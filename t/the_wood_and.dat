5|$|Advancing up {{the ridge}} {{they had just}} abandoned, Browne's {{battalion}} came under intense fire from Ruffin's emplaced infantry and artillery. Within a few salvoes, half the battalion was gone and, unable to continue, Browne's men scattered amongst the cover provided by the slope and returned fire. Despite his success, Ruffin could not descend the hill to brush away the remnants of Browne's battalion, as Dilkes's brigade had by now emerged from <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> was forming up {{at the base of}} the slope.|$|E
5|$|During the night, the 113th and 114th Infantry Brigades {{were ordered}} out of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> the 115th Brigade {{assembled}} in their place. The next day, the 115th Brigade prepared an assault {{to clear out}} the Germans. The 115th Brigade's commanding officer, Brigadier-General H. J. Evans, wanted to launch a surprise attack but was overruled. The subsequent bombardment to support the attack fell short in places, hitting British troops and provoking German artillery fire. As well as the friendly fire, the barrage also caught German troops in the open as they fled from the wood. The remaining Germans offered determined resistance and the 16th Welsh were held up by machine gun fire {{and the use of}} a flamethrower. Despite this, the brigade was able to clear Mametz Wood {{by the end of the}} day. The German second line position was on higher ground which dominated the edge of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and,</b> coupled with artillery fire, resulted in the brigade pulling back to its start line to avoid further casualties.|$|E
5|$|The Polikarpov I-6 was a Soviet biplane fighter {{prototype}} of the late 1920s. It was designed with traditional wooden construction in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> steel tube construction Polikarpov I-5. Its development took longer than planned and the lead designer, Nikolai Polikarpov, was arrested for industrial sabotage, which only further delayed the project. Only two prototypes were built, as the I-5 was selected for production.|$|E

5|$|A crew of over 200 craftspeople and {{technicians}} constructed the three principal sets: {{the surface of}} the alien planetoid, and the interiors of the Nostromo and the derelict spacecraft. Art Director Les Dilley created -scale miniatures of the planetoid's surface and derelict spacecraft based on Giger's designs, then made moulds and casts and scaled them up as diagrams for <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> fiberglass forms of the sets. Tons of sand, plaster, fiberglass, rock, and gravel were shipped into the studio to sculpt a desert landscape for the planetoid's surface, which the actors would walk across wearing space suit costumes. The suits themselves were thick, bulky, and lined with nylon, had no cooling systems and, initially, no venting for their exhaled carbon dioxide to escape. Combined with a heat wave, these conditions nearly caused the actors to pass out: nurses had to be kept on-hand with oxygen tanks.|$|E
5|$|According to chapter 9 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{the three}} {{brothers}} Vili, Vé, and Odin, are {{the creators of}} the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there. They took <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names. Ask and Embla go {{on to become the}} progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of Midgard.|$|E
5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E

5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels with her long, pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E
5|$|The Covent Garden {{area has}} over 60 pubs and bars; {{several of them}} are listed buildings, with some also on CAMRA's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors; some, such as The Harp in Chandos Place, have {{received}} consumer awards. The Harp's awards include London Pub of the Year in 2008 by the Society for the Preservation of Beers from <b>the</b> <b>Wood,</b> <b>and</b> National Pub of the Year by CAMRA in 2011. It was at one time owned by the Charrington Brewery, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated to just The Harp, before Charrington sold it to Punch Taverns in 1997. It has been owned by the landlady since 2010.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{attack by}} Bauduin's brigade emptied <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> park, but was driven back by heavy British {{artillery}} fire, and cost Bauduin his life. As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade {{and what had}} been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard. The Coldstream Guards and the Scots Guards arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.|$|E

5|$|What is most {{important}} for us, out of the heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> <b>and</b> was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> had them built for himself.|$|E

5|$|In February 1931, {{the woods}} were {{included}} in a sale by King's College to the urban district council. Park Wood was sold for £28,100, with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included {{as a gift to}} the people of Ruislip. King's had also wished to present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost, as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational day-trippers from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council. An area of the wood to the south {{was not included in the}} lease agreement and three residential roads were later constructed on it.|$|E

5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as the most {{formidable}} challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in <b>the</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>and</b> his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of the his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after, Gaudí {{received}} an important new commission from Güell: {{the construction of}} his family house, in the Carrer Nou de la Rambla in Barcelona. The Palau Güell (1886–1888) continues the tradition of large Catalan urban mansions {{such as those in}} Carrer Montcada. Gaudí designed a monumental entrance with a magnificent parabolic arch above iron gates, decorated with the Catalan coat of arms and a helmet with a winged dragon, the work of Joan Oñós. A notable feature is the triple-height entrance hall; it is the core of the building, surrounded by the main rooms of the palace, and it is remarkable for its double dome, parabolic within and conical on the outside, a solution typical of Byzantine art. For the gallery on the street facade Gaudí used an original system of catenary arches and columns with hyperbolic capitals, a style he used only here. He designed the interior of the palace with a sumptuous Mudejar-style decoration, where <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> iron coffered ceilings stand out. The chimneys on the roof are a remarkable feature, faced in vividly coloured ceramic tiles, as is the tall spire {{in the form of a}} lantern tower, which is the external termination of the dome within, and is also faced with ceramic tiles and topped with an iron weather vane.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of Manor Farm {{and the local}} woods from redevelopment was eventually confirmed in January 1930, after a visit {{by a member of}} the Royal Society of Arts to choose buildings that should be conserved. The Great Barn and Little Barn were selected, along with the old Post Office, the Old Bell public house and the Priest's House of the local church. The woods, part of the centre of the manor of Ruislip along with Ruislip village square, were included when King's College sold the land to the district in February 1931. Park Wood was sold for £28,100 with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included as a gift to the people of Ruislip. King's had wished to also present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land.

5|$|After Dernancourt, the 48th Battalion {{marched to}} the rear and began {{establishing}} a reserve line at Beaucourt. On 18 April, Gellibrand was evacuated sick and Leane was appointed to act as brigade commander in his place. The following day he was temporarily promoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. During Gellibrand's absence, on 27–28 April the 12th Brigade was deployed to the line at Villers-Bretonneux, which had just been recaptured from the Germans. In order to push the frontline further east of the town, it was necessary to capture strongly-held German positions in Monument Wood, so-named as it was adjacent to a memorial to the Franco-Prussian War. This task was given to the 12th Brigade, and Leane, knowing that the fighting would be difficult, applied his usual practice of giving the most challenging missions to his own, the 48th Battalion. After the intense fighting at Dernancourt, the 48th had been reinforced with a significant number of unseasoned new recruits. The attack was planned for 02:00 on 3 May, and in order to achieve surprise, there was to be only intermittent shelling of the wood during the day, and just a two minute barrage with all available guns {{at the time of the}} attack. In the event, Leane's first battle as brigade commander went badly, with the artillery barrage being very weak and failing to cut the wire in front of <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> <b>and</b> the supporting tanks failing to have any impact. One party managed to get through the wire and capture 21 Germans in the farm buildings in the centre of the wood, but a German counterattack forced the Australians back to their start line, with a loss of 12 officers and 143 other ranks, against German casualties of 10 officers and 136 men.|$|E
