5|$|The mod {{received}} widespread media acclaim. Edge called DayZ the mod of the year. Wired UKs Quitin Smith said {{it could}} be the most terrifying game of 2012, and Rock Paper Shotgun's Jim Rossignol called it the best game he had played so far in 2012. PC Gamer stated the game {{was one of the most}} important things to happen to PC gaming in 2012 and included it in their 2012 list of the top five scariest PC games of all time. Metro called it one of the best games to ever to come out of PC modding and one of the single most impressive experiences available on the system. Eurogamer called it the best zombie game ever made and the break out phenomenon of PC gaming in 2012. Kotaku called it possibly the greatest zombie game of all time and the most interesting PC game of 2012. PC PowerPlay said DayZ was the most important <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to PC gaming in 2012.|$|E

500|$|The {{story with}} the Jack Donaghy {{character}} accidentally hitting his mother with {{his car was}} based on an experience by one of the 30 Rock writers. According to executive producer Robert Carlock: [...] "This actually happened. The niece of one of our writers hit her grandmother—the writer's mother—with her car. We kind of spent a day saying, 'Can we do this? Is everything going to be okay?' And she was fine, so we figured that would be a fun, fraught <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> between Jack and his mom, especially right before Christmas." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} {{shot of the}} season, Benioff felt that the shot of Daenerys making her way to Westeros was a monumental part in the series's history, saying [...] "That shot of Dany's fleet making {{its way out of}} the Slaver's Bay towards the Narrow Sea and home is {{probably}} the biggest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> on the show thus far, that's the thing we've been waiting for since the pilot episode of the first season." [...] He continued, [...] "It hasn't been a smooth road. That's the shot we're going to leave everyone with; it was a real thrill to see her, with Tyrion by her side, heading west." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1986 {{the band}} finally got {{permission}} to {{tour in the}} US.

[...] Concerts included Reading Festival and a gig with David Bowie in front of the Reichstag in Berlin, and the band for the first time expanded their touring line-up to include a second guitarist in the shape of Ricky Warwick, as well as harmonica player Mark Feltham from Nine Below Zero.|$|E

500|$|During {{the winter}} {{following}} the 1933 season, {{the manager of}} the world champion Giants, Bill Terry was interviewed by the press about the other teams in the National League. When asked about the Dodgers, Terry responded, [...] "Brooklyn? Gee, I haven't heard a peep out of there. Is Brooklyn still in the league?" [...] This angered Brooklyn's management, and they expected Carey to make a full-throated response. When he remained silent, he was fired. One sportswriter regarded the hiring of Stengel as too logical a <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in Brooklyn, but on February 24, 1934, Stengel faced the press {{for the first time as}} the manager of a major league team.

Nick Levine of Digital Spy said that [...] "the track itself is nearly as sexy as the promo clip", commenting [...] "Ciara purrs, and Timberlake, if you'll pardon the pun, more than rises to the occasion.

500|$|Just as the Save Our Children {{campaign}} was a motivational force for conservative Christians, {{it was also}} one for gay and lesbian politics. Fejes writes, [...] "While the Stonewall riots of 1969 may have {{marked the beginning of}} the modern lesbian and gay movement, the campaigns of 1977 and 1978 marked the emergence of a national politically self-conscious lesbian and gay community". The birth of a political life for gays and lesbians gave opportunities for national networking as Anita Bryant and those who followed her acted as a virtual lightning rod, attracting a collective anger. Thirty years after the campaign, the Stonewall Library & Archives sponsored an exhibition of the events surrounding the Save Our Children campaign and displayed it at the Broward County Public Library. According to the curator of the exhibit, Bryant is considered [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to the gay rights movement.

Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled to be asked to play on his record … It was the most exciting <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to me. I had to keep pinching myself to remember it was real." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{departure}} of several cast members throughout the seasons, many new characters {{were added to the}} drama's ensemble.

In addition, Matt Roush of TV Guide commented: [...] "Hunt/McKidd is the most encouraging <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to Grey's Anatomy in quite a while." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide noted that Robbins [...] "quickly established herself as a fan favorite", describing her as: [...] "a breath of fresh air in the often angsty halls of Seattle Grace. On April Kepner and Jackson Avery Courtney Morrison of TVFanatic wrote [...] "April has grown since her character was introduced. She’s no longer much less annoying than she used to be, and she’s honest. A girl with principles is a girl you want to do well."

500|$|Steph {{appeared}} to [...] "finally [...] happiness" [...] when {{she fell in}} love with Max Cunningham (Matt Littler). Although attracted to her, Max initially resisted Steph as he believed her to be a [...] "ditzy, air-headed blonde", only interested in [...] "bad boys." [...] When his younger brother Tom (Ellis Hollins) developed a crush on her, the [...] "kind, sensitive way" [...] Steph handled it altered his impression. Littler explained, [...] "Max begins to realise there's more to her than her looks. He begins to think she's actually really nice and they become friends." [...] Littler quit the series in 2008, and producers planned his exit around Max's wedding to Steph. He was killed off on their wedding day, as he pulled Tom out of the path of a car. Before she filmed the aftermath of Max's death, Stenson listened to depressing music to reach her character's bereaved mindset. Stenson believed it was a mistake to kill Max off, and [...] "such an awful <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to Steph", until she received [...] "amazing feedback" [...] about the storyline. In the aftermath, Tom asked Steph to be his mother, in a scene that then-executive producer Bryan Kirkwood deemed his favourite of the year. The interaction between the two was intended to represent [...] "what Hollyoaks is all about - lots of heart, relationships, friendships, love and loss." [...] Kirkwood praised Stenson's performance throughout the storyline, particularly during in that scene.|$|E
500|$|In 1985 Randall H. Langer, a young {{real estate}} {{developer}} active in apartment rehabilitation in the neighborhood, aided {{the creation of a}} local historic district, the Sheridan Park Historic District, which critics charged was of dubious historical value and created to facilitate gentrification. Nineteen tax delinquent properties in Uptown were offered for sale by auction by Cook County in Fall, 1987. Since 1983 Cook County had a program to afford local governments the opportunity to acquire tax delinquent properties for almost nothing, prior to the county's scavenger sale to the public, if the local government had a specific development plan. On October 28, 1987, Shiller urged the Tax Delinquency Subcommittee of the Cook County Board to accept a no-cash bid from the City for the 19 tax-delinquent parcels in Uptown. A decision was deferred when Commissioner Rosemarie Love requested a delay on grounds that the Washington administration had not provided a development plan. Subcommittee chairman Commissioner Richard Siebel said the County's no-cash sales program was [...] "designed to place property back on the tax rolls as quickly as possible – not for land-banking. It's not appropriate for us to pass this until the city tells us, parcel by parcel, what they intend to do and how they plan to pay for it." [...] Another commissioner noted that the City already owned 7,000 tax-delinquent properties, and another added, [...] "Properties we gave to the city 12 years ago are still war zones. I don't want the same <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> here." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} highly positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called [...] "Broke" [...] a [...] "great, great" [...] episode, {{although he}} said he wished the Michael Scott Paper Company arc could have lasted longer. Sepinwall praised touches such as the Korean women who were constantly getting into the sales van, and Michael's moment of nervousness on the elevator, and said the ending when Michael came through was particularly satisfying. Will Leitch of New York magazine described [...] "Broke" [...] as [...] "a rousing, exuberant episode that continues one of The Offices best runs in history". Leitch said the negotiations during {{the latter half of}} the episode had genuine tension, and that all the storylines of the Michael Scott Paper Company arc were wrapped up perfectly. Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode was strong enough that it could have served as the season finale. He said the episode had lots of good throw-away moments, like Charles brown-nosing to David and realizing Dwight is eccentric, as well as several clever twists, like Jim's actions in tricking Dwight and helping the Michael Scott Paper Company get bought out. Eric Rezsnyak of the City Newspaper said the episode was a strong finale to the Michael Scott Paper Company arc, which was [...] "probably the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to the show in the last two seasons". Rezsnyak praised Michael's impressive actions in the episode and said he was curious to see how Michael's relationship with several of the supporting characters would be recast as a result of this episode.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of Subterranean Jungle, Marky was fired from the band due to his alcoholism. He was {{replaced}} by Richard Reinhardt, who adopted the name Richie Ramone. Joey Ramone remarked that [...] " [...] saved the band as far as I'm concerned. He's the greatest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to the Ramones. He put the spirit back in the band." [...] Richie is the only Ramones drummer to sing lead vocals on Ramones songs, including [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice" [...] {{as well as the}} unreleased [...] "Elevator Operator". Joey Ramone commented, [...] "Richie's very talented and he's very diverse... He really strengthened the band a hundred percent because he sings backing tracks, he sings lead, and he sings with Dee Dee's stuff. In the past, it was always just me singing for the most part." [...] Richie was also the only drummer to be the sole composer of Ramones songs including their hit [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink" [...] as well as [...] "Smash You", [...] "Humankind", [...] "I'm Not Jesus", [...] "I Know Better Now" [...] and [...] "(You) Can't Say Anything Nice". Joey Ramone supported Richie's songwriting contributions: [...] "I encouraged Richie to write songs. I figured it would make him feel more a part of the group, because we never let anybody else write our songs." [...] Richie's composition, [...] "Somebody Put Something in My Drink", remained a staple in the Ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album Loud, Fast Ramones: Their Toughest Hits. The eightsong bonus disc, The Ramones Smash You: Live'85, is also named after Richie's composition [...] "Smash You".|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to me in my life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it would work out great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If someone asked me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, I would tell them Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had. And that's what we wanted to do with this album." ...|$|E
500|$|Efforts at {{improvement}} {{before the}} bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre– the exterior of which was widely unloved– {{from the rest of}} the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb was the best thing that ever happened to Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I take exception to his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s: ...|$|E
