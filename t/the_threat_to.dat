5|$|In {{addition}} to the air and naval forces assigned to protect shipping in Australian waters, fixed defences were constructed to protect the major Australian ports. The Australian Army was responsible for developing and manning coastal defences to protect ports from attacks by enemy surface raiders. These defences commonly consisted {{of a number of}} fixed guns defended by anti-aircraft guns and infantry. The Army's coastal defences were considerably expanded as <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Australia increased between 1940 and 1942, and reached their peak strength in 1944. The Royal Australian Navy was responsible for developing and manning harbour defences in Australia's main ports. These defences consisted of fixed anti-submarine booms and mines supported by small patrol craft, and were also greatly expanded as <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Australia increased. The RAN also laid defensive minefields in Australian waters from August 1941.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} highly exaggerated {{reports about}} the role of the Christians and their help to the British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu decided to minimise <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> his kingdom from the British and banish the Christians of Canara.

5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Don Juan Manuel de Rosas, the {{dictator}} of Argentina, had assisted the separatist rebels in the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul during the 1830s, {{and continued to}} attempt its annexation. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Brazil's territorial integrity, Rosas had ambitions to conquer Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia. Brazil's Conservative Cabinet decided to form military alliances with the countries threatened by {{the dictator}}. On 4 September 1851, Brazil's army, commanded by Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (then Count of Caxias), crossed the border into Uruguay.|$|E

The other supporters of the uprising were imprisoned and released in 1025, after {{the death of}} Basil II and the succession of his younger brother, Constantine VIII. In 1026, however, Constantine VIII accused the last surviving member of the once great family, Bardas Phokas (possibly a son or nephew of Nikephoros Barytrachelos), of plotting against the throne, and had him blinded.|$|E

5|$|Gay activists, newly {{alarmed at}} <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their rights, confronted vice {{president}} Walter Mondale at a political rally in San Francisco {{two weeks after}} the announcement of Proposition 6. Mondale ran with Jimmy Carter in 1976 on a platform highlighting human rights as their first priority, and he was there to address the subject pertaining to Latin America. When gay activists interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the gay activists.|$|E
5|$|German and Italian spies kept a {{constant}} watch on Gibraltar {{and sought to}} carry out sabotage operations, sometimes successfully. The Italians repeatedly carried out raids on Gibraltar's harbour using human torpedoes and divers operating from the Spanish shore, damaging a number of merchant ships and sinking one. Three Spaniards being run as spies and saboteurs by the German Abwehr were caught in Gibraltar in 1942–43 and hanged. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> Gibraltar was greatly reduced {{after the collapse of}} Italy in September 1943.|$|E

As a result, work was begun to reopen Chain of Craters Road, initially as a one-lane gravelled surface, and to make Railroad Avenue and Government Beach Road usable as emergency routes. However the flow stopped just short of entering Pahoa, and by March 2015, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the town was much reduced.|$|E

The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage.

Two submarines were dispatched to operate off Australia in July 1943, but were diverted to the Solomon Islands shortly before reaching the east coast. Following this, the Japanese submarines were fully occupied responding to Allied offensives and transporting supplies to isolated garrisons. As <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> shipping declined, the RAN ceased running convoys in waters south of Newcastle on 7December 1943 and Sydney–Brisbane convoys ended on 10February 1944.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was <b>to</b> explore <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> {{internal}} and external validity that international research on structured employment interviews may have been prone to. On the basis of this exploration, suggestions were rendered on how <b>the</b> perceived <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> internal validity could have been managed. In addition, commentary was offered on whether or not <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> external validity appear to have been actualised in the international studies that were compared. These constituted the secondary aims of the study. In order to accomplish the primary aim of the study a qualitative approach was employed. Using the literature on the thr~~ts to internal and external validity as a fundamental point of departure, studies on the two main variants of structured employment interviews (viz. behaviour description interviews and situational interviews) were analysed. This analysis yielded an insight into <b>the</b> potential <b>threats</b> that are likely to have impacted on the validity findings that were obtained in these studies. On the basis of these insights, suggestions, pertaining <b>to</b> how <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> internal validity could have been managed, were proposed. In addition, a meta-analytic technique, for comparing the findings across multiple studies, was employed to comment on whether or not <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> external validity appear to have manifested in the studies in question.
