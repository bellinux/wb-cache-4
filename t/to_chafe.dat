25|$|Unrest in {{the colony}} began <b>to</b> <b>chafe</b> against the aristocratic Family Compact who governed while benefiting {{economically}} from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies power. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions; Louis-Joseph Papineau led the Lower Canada Rebellion and William Lyon Mackenzie led the Upper Canada Rebellion.|$|E
25|$|The {{fit of the}} {{underwear}} {{should allow}} the same range of movement as the suit itself, and together should allow the diver to bend, squat, kneel, climb a ladder, fin and reach all critical parts of the diving equipment. Underwear which is flexible and stretches, particularly at the joints, will allow the diver more freedom of movement, and is less likely <b>to</b> <b>chafe,</b> and materials which resist compaction under light pressure will maintain a more even thickness in use, which will provide better insulation for the same overall volume.|$|E

25|$|He {{spent nine}} {{months on the}} islands, much longer than he had intended. As a Chief Qadi, his skills were highly {{desirable}} in the formerly Buddhist nation that had recently converted to Islam. Half-kidnapped into staying, he became chief judge and married into the royal family of Omar I. He became embroiled in local politics and left when his strict judgments in the laissez-faire island kingdom began <b>to</b> <b>chafe</b> with its rulers. In the Rihla he mentions his dismay at the local women going about with no clothing above the waist, and the locals taking no notice when he complained. From the Maldives, he carried on to Sri Lanka and visited Sri Pada and Tenavaram temple.|$|E
500|$|In late 1910, {{she came}} {{together}} with poets such as Osip Mandelstam and Sergey Gorodetsky {{to form the}} Guild of Poets. It promoted the idea of craft {{as the key to}} poetry rather than inspiration or mystery, taking themes of the concrete rather than the more ephemeral world of the Symbolists. Over time, they developed the influential Acmeist anti-symbolist school, concurrent with the growth of Imagism in Europe and America. From the first year of their marriage, Gumilev began <b>to</b> <b>chafe</b> against its constraints. She wrote that he had [...] "lost his passion" [...] for her {{and by the end of}} that year he left on a six-month trip to Africa.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} of Final Fantasy XIII have received mixed and positive opinions from reviewers. Ben Dutka of PSX Extreme {{said that the}} voice acting for the characters are [...] "interesting" [...] and that the cast was [...] "a competent one, even if some characters can begin <b>to</b> <b>chafe</b> after a while." [...] He {{also said that the}} player [...] "might grow tired of Lightning’s gruffness and Vanille’s bounciness in the early goings but they begin to show new emotions as [...] progress." [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish applauded the characters as [...] "the best-defined group of protagonists the series has ever seen" [...] and also praised them for their development in the story. Parish also commented that the characters [...] "worked through their differences and demons and feel like comrades" [...] during the story's development. IGN editor Ryan Clements drew a favorable comparison to the {{characters of}} Final Fantasy VI and enjoyed the characters' multi-story approach and the flashbacks in the storyline. [...] Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer said the characters were [...] "fantastic" [...] and also praised the voice acting. However, den Ouden said that in the introduction to the game, the characters [...] "lacked any kind of development for the first few hours , and the result is a confusing plotline with uninteresting characters that leaves a terrible first impression".|$|E

50|$|Because {{of their}} thinness, light weight, and {{relative}} ease of collecting, rings {{are often used}} for juggling high numbers of props. Jugglers often wear gloves or other protection when juggling more than four rings, as {{the height of the}} pattern, thin cross-section and hard plastic of rings can act like blades and lead <b>to</b> <b>chafing.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In St Andrews, Scotland in 1866, 15-year-old Tommy Morris (Jack Lowden) {{is an avid}} golfer {{like his}} legendary and {{pioneering}} father, Tom Morris (Peter Mullan). [...] "Old Tom" [...] is greens-keeper for The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, {{as well as the}} town’s club- and ball-maker. He is the two-time winner of the first major golf tournament, The Open Championship, which he founded in 1860. He also established golf's standard of 18 holes per round. But young Tommy is beginning <b>to</b> <b>chafe</b> at his father's dictates, especially in the rapidly changing world they live in.|$|E
2500|$|Bristol Motor Speedway is {{the fourth}} largest sports venue in America and the eighth largest in the world, housing up to 162,000 people. The track is so short that speeds here are far lower than is typical on most NASCAR oval tracks, {{but they are very}} fast {{compared}} to other short tracks due to the high banking. These features make for a considerable amount of [...] "paint swapping" [...] at the NASCAR races where the initial starting grid of 40 vehicles each in the Monster Energy Cup Series & the Xfinity Series, and 32 in the Truck Series, extends almost halfway around the track, meaning that slower qualifiers begin the race almost half a lap down. The congestion inherent in this facility {{and the power of the}} cars and trucks has been likened to [...] "flying fighter jets in a gymnasium" [...] (or a [...] "washing machine" [...] or a [...] "toilet"). The track is one that tends to be either loved or hated by the fans and the drivers. Purists who grew up driving or attending races at older short tracks located at fairgrounds and similar places tend to love Bristol, while those raised on superspeedway racing tend <b>to</b> <b>chafe</b> at the lower speeds.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Observers Rex Reed {{declared}} that [...] "one {{of the most}} important stories of the last century {{is one of the greatest}} movies of 2014". Kaleem Aftab of The Independent gave the film a five-star review, hailing it the [...] "Best British Film of the Year". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post described it as a [...] "thoroughly engrossing Oscar-caliber movie", while critic James Rocchi added that the film is [...] "strong, stirring, triumphant and tragic". Empire described it as a [...] "superb thriller" [...] and Glamour declared it [...] "an instant classic". Peter Debruge of Variety added that the film is [...] "beautifully written, elegantly mounted and poignantly performed". Critic Scott Foundas stated that the [...] "movie is undeniably strong in its sense of a bright light burned out too soon, and the often undignified fate of those who dare <b>to</b> <b>chafe</b> at society's established norms". Critic Leonard Maltin asserted that the film has [...] "an ideal ensemble cast with every role filled to perfection". Praise went to Knightley's supporting performance as Clarke, Goldenberg's editing, Desplat's score, Faura's cinematography and Djurkovic's production design. The film was enthusiastically received at the Telluride Film Festival and won the [...] "People's Choice Award for Best Film" [...] at TIFF, the highest prize of the festival.|$|E

40|$|A model-based {{approach}} for {{the definition of}} requirements for detecting progressive failures in wire insulation integrity is presented. The model-based approach combines theoretical models, numerical simulation and experimental data to demonstrate advanced data interpretation from common diagnostic hardware.

This approach is used to demonstrate the detection of changing impedance and erosion of shielding due <b>to</b> common <b>chafing</b> causes in twisted-pair wire geometry prior to any possible shorting or open condition in the conductors. Results are encouraging for finding flaws in shielding prior to any disruptive damage to the inner conductors...|$|R
