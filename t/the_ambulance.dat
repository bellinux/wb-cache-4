5|$|After Guy and Joanna have sex, Martin arrives to {{tell them}} that Joanna is Guy's mother. She met Guy's father whilst she was an {{exchange}} student in Switzerland. Guy then stabs a syringe full of Botox into Martin's legs as an act of revenge. Martin is taken into an ambulance, and Caroline helps Joanna, but Guy punches Mac in a drunken rage and steals <b>the</b> <b>ambulance.</b> Mac tries to stop him and gets on <b>the</b> <b>ambulance,</b> which drives away. Guy drives <b>the</b> <b>ambulance</b> to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field and almost goes over a cliff. The first series ends with Guy, Mac and Martin teetering on the edge – a literal cliffhanger – while ending up in a discussion about which of The Three Musketeers they are most like.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when <b>the</b> <b>ambulance</b> is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from <b>the</b> <b>ambulance)).</b> Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E

5|$|Another passive marking form is {{the word}} {{ambulance}} (or local language variant) spelled out in reverse {{on the front of}} the vehicle.

5|$|Methods of {{summoning}} (e.g. telephone) and dispatching ambulances usually rely {{on electronic}} equipment, which itself often relies on an intact power grid.

5|$|The {{design of}} {{intermediate}} technology ambulances {{must take into}} account not only the operation and maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>ambulance,</b> but its construction as well.

5|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>ambulance</b> begins in ancient times, {{with the use}} of carts to {{transport}} incurable patients by force. Ambulances were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by the Spanish, and civilian variants were put into operation during the 1830s. Advances in technology throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to the modern self-powered ambulances.|$|E
5|$|The {{speakers}} {{for modern}} sirens can be {{integral to the}} lightbar, {{or they may be}} hidden in or flush to the grill to reduce noise inside <b>the</b> <b>ambulance</b> that may interfere with patient care and radio communications.

5|$|After the war the Manchester Fire Brigade {{was again}} municipalised, and reorganised.

The control room was modernised in 1952, becoming the first in the country with equipment to record emergency calls.|$|E
5|$|Although Hall's author's note disclaims any {{real-world}} {{basis for}} <b>the</b> <b>ambulance</b> unit that Stephen joins, she drew {{heavily on the}} wartime experiences of her friend Toupie Lowther, co-commander of the only women's unit {{to serve on the}} front in France. Lowther, like Stephen, came from an aristocratic family, adopted a masculine style of dress, and was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and jujitsu enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the {{shooting death of}} <b>the</b> <b>ambulance</b> driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad.

5|$|In 2003, {{the band}} {{released}} its Island Records debut, The Artist in <b>the</b> <b>Ambulance.</b> The album's title is {{in reference to}} Burn Collector by Al Burian and is meant to reflect the band's desire {{to do more than}} make music and contribute to society through their charitable donations.

First pressings of the album were packaged in a digipak-style case with postcards containing lyrics and notes from the band.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen.
