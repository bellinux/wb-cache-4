5|$|After 1555, {{the initial}} {{reconciling}} tone of <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> began to harden. The medieval heresy laws were restored. The Marian Persecutions of Protestants ensued and 283 Protestants were burnt {{at the stake}} for heresy. This resulted in the Queen becoming known as Bloody Mary, due {{to the influence of}} John Foxe, one of the Protestants who fled Marian England. Foxe's Book of Martyrs recorded the executions in such detail that it became Mary's epitaph; Convocation subsequently ordered that Foxe's book should be placed in every cathedral in the land. In fact, while those who were executed after the revolts of 1536, and the St David's Down rebellion of 1549, and the unknown number of monks who died for refusing to submit, may not have been tried for heresy, they certainly exceeded that number by some amount. Even so, the heroism of some of the martyrs was an example to those who witnessed them, so that in some places it was the burnings that set people against <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b>|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{response}} of Venice province population {{to the rise of}} Fascism and to <b>the</b> <b>regime’s</b> attempts to fascistise Italian society. This thesis is developed around analysis of popular opinion {{and the way in which}} limited local consensus for <b>the</b> Fascist <b>regime</b> contributed to Fascism’s downfall. The thesis begins with a discussion of the Party, and to provides a clear picture of how ‘national’ and ‘local’ interacted alongside the establishment of the structures. The focus then shifts to the working class and the way it came to terms with <b>the</b> Fascist <b>regime.</b> <b>The</b> third chapter deals with two groups that provided a particular challenge to <b>the</b> <b>regime’s</b> totalitarian aspirations: Venetian Youth and the Catholic Church with its attempts to resist and to jeopardize <b>the</b> <b>regime’s</b> intention to monopolise every aspect of social life. The fourth chapter is a case-study of the Venetian Jewish community, of how the Race Laws affected the life of Venetian Jews. Lastly, the fifth chapter, by way of a conclusion, studies the ‘Fascist War’ (1940 - 1943) as a microcosm that explains for the local Venetian context how the lack of popular consent enhanced <b>the</b> <b>regime’s</b> inability to survive war-induced challenges. ...|$|R
30|$|A {{key factor}} {{to address the}} {{applicability}} of different models is the dynamic behavior of pattern formation.

The crossover into <b>the</b> nonlinear <b>regime</b> begins if <b>the</b> wavelength grows with irradiation time. Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>regimes</b> can be separated by the temporal evolution of the surface roughness which grows exponentially in <b>the</b> linear <b>regime</b> and has a power-law behavior in <b>the</b> nonlinear <b>regime.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> total ion fluence is a critical parameter that controls the structure size and regularity of the ripple pattern.|$|R

Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the Kirchenkampf (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.|$|E

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{under what}} economic conditions democratization would be adopted in oligarchic {{societies in the}} absence of social conflict and political competition. In each essay, I construct a general equilibrium model of a delegation game and characterize the conditions in terms of economic primitives. I show that democratization occurs when there is a net positive spillover to the elite 2 ̆ 7 s payoff. The benchmark delegation game considers <b>the</b> oligarchic <b>regime</b> and <b>the</b> democratic <b>regime.</b> At <b>the</b> status quo, the elite are entrusted with the political power over a tax policy. They decide either to sustain the power under <b>the</b> oligarchic <b>regime</b> or to delegate the power to people so that democratization occurs and the society goes under <b>the</b> democratic <b>regime.</b> <b>The</b> first essay considers an environment with education. Under <b>the</b> oligarchic <b>regime,</b> <b>the</b> elite appropriate people 2 ̆ 7 s labor income. The tax decreases people 2 ̆ 7 s incentive to receive education and to work. The economy grows poor, and the tax revenue may be limited. Under <b>the</b> democratic <b>regime,</b> people remove <b>the</b> tax distortion. They pursue education and work hard, which increase the elite 2 ̆ 7 s capital return. Democratization would be adopted if the elite receive sufficient capital return under <b>the</b> democratic <b>regime,</b> or collect small labor income tax revenue under <b>the</b> oligarchic <b>regime.</b> <b>The</b> second essay considers the presence of home production and non-exclusive public goods. Under <b>the</b> oligarchic <b>regime,</b> home production weakens the elite 2 ̆ 7 s appropriation on people 2 ̆ 7 s labor income received from market production. Under <b>the</b> democratic <b>regime,</b> people impose a capital gain tax on the elite to finance for non-exclusive public goods. Democratization would be adopted if the elite impose a small labor income tax under <b>the</b> oligarchic <b>regime,</b> or people provide abundant labor supply and impose a reasonable capital gain tax on the elite under <b>the</b> democratic <b>regime.</b> <b>The</b> third essay considers a two-period economy {{in the absence of}} commitment. Under <b>the</b> oligarchic <b>regime,</b> <b>the</b> elite impose a savings tax on people after observing their savings behavior. When people save, the elite expropriate their saving. Under <b>the</b> democratic <b>regime,</b> <b>the</b> tax distortion is removed and the efficiency of the economy is improved.
