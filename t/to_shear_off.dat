5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two nuclear bombs suffered a structural failure in flight {{that caused the}} tail section <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> <b>off.</b> Four crewmen ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland. Two crewmen subsequently perished on the ground because of hypothermia, while another, who was unable to eject, died in the aircraft; both weapons were recovered. This {{was one of several}} incidents caused by failure of the vertical stabilizer.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 1983, an Israeli Air Force F-15D {{collided}} mid-air with an A-4 Skyhawk {{during a}} training flight, causing the F-15's right wing <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> almost completely. Despite the damage, {{the pilot was}} able to reach a nearby airbase and land safely – albeit at twice the normal landing speed. The aircraft was subsequently repaired and saw further combat action.|$|E
25|$|The Chief's rock faces, {{especially}} the Grand Wall, exhibit the unique textural patterns which {{result from the}} process of granitic exfoliation. This is the natural means by which large, high-quality granite formations weather, erode, and age. Rather than crumbling and slowly wearing away, large flakes of granite tend <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> and drop from the face in layers. On impact with the ground below, the shattered flakes become boulders and talus.|$|E
40|$|It appears most {{probable}} that the Watts linkage {{of the aircraft}} has experienced a tensile overload superimposed with bending stresses during {{which one of the}} bolts of the fork connector between the pogo stick and the frame got <b>sheared</b> <b>off.</b> Evidences also suggest that both the bolts of the fork connector were present at the time of failure and there were no abnormalities in the assembly. Tell tale marks on the inner surface of the fork of the link assembly suggest that the bolt connecting the lever and the link assembly of the control linkage port PFCU was present prior to the accident. Evidences also suggest that this joint has experienced compressive force due to impact leading <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> of the bolt and subsequent dislodgement of all the attaching parts. Certain damages were seen on the bolts and/or nuts of control linkage starboard PFCU and engine throttle control linkage in question, which probably have been caused by split pins. This means that split pins were present in these bolts at some given time during their service life. It was not possible to ascertain whether or not these bolts were fitted with split pins prior to the accident. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an interpretation on the abnormal roof shock in longwall coal mining under gullies using physical modeling, numerical modeling, and mechanical analysis. The modeling {{results show that}} the roof movement causes the shock load onto the stope in longwall coal mining under surface gully. The triggering mechanism of shock load depends on the direction of the face retreat with respect {{to the bottom of the}} surface gully. The slope tends to slide along the interface plane with a long periodical weighting intervals when mining towards the bottom of the gully (downslope direction), while the overburden strata may be split into blocks and tend to topple towards the free face of gully when mining away from the bottom of the gully (upslope direction). The mechanical models showed that, during the period of mining in downslope direction, planar sliding and key fragmental blocks cause a sudden roof <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> which could result in shock load and, during the period of mining in upslope direction, the overburden blocks may become unstable due <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> which could resulted in large shock pressure onto the stope...|$|R
50|$|Cyanoacrylate glue {{has a low}} {{shearing}} strength, {{which has}} led to its use as a temporary adhesive in cases where the piece needs <b>to</b> be <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> later. Common examples include mounting a workpiece to a sacrificial glue block on a lathe, and tightening pins and bolts. It is also used in conjunction with another, slower, but more resilient adhesive as way of rapidly forming a joint, which then holds the pieces in the appropriate configuration until the second adhesive has set.|$|R
25|$|Avia Traffic Company Flight 768 was a {{scheduled}} passenger flight from Bishkek Airport, to Osh Airport {{operated by the}} airline's fleet of four Boeing 737-3YO aircraft. On 22 November 2015 EX-37005, operating the flight, was on final approach to Osh Airport when it touched down hard enough <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> {{the left and right}} main landing gear. The aircraft skidded off the runway with the left engine being torn from its mount.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, on 3 March, Severn {{destroyed}} the American privateer Ino. American accounts report that Ino grounded outside of Charleston on 7 March. As hr crew {{was attempting to}} free Ino, Severn {{came on the scene}} and launched her boats to board Ino. Inos crew, unaware that the war had ended on 15 February 1815, fired grapeshot and small arms at the British boats, causing them <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> <b>off.</b> Ino crew then set fire to her and took to their boats and some improvised rafts. A schooner that came out from Charleston rescued almost all. The Inos crew believed that Captain Nourse of Severn had known for some days that the war had ended. The delay of payment of the head money may have been due to the need to adjudicate the case.|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge {{suffered}} severe damage, as a [...] {{section of}} the upper deck on the eastern cantilever side fell onto the deck below. The quake caused the Oakland {{side of the bridge}} to shift [...] to the east, and caused the bolts of one section <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> <b>off,</b> sending the [...] section of roadbed crashing down like a trapdoor. Traffic on both decks came to a halt, blocked by the section of roadbed. Police began unsnarling the traffic jam, telling drivers to turn their cars around and drive back the way they had come. Eastbound drivers stuck on the lower deck between the collapse and Yerba Buena Island were routed up to the upper deck and westward back to San Francisco. A miscommunication made by emergency workers at Yerba Buena Island routed some drivers the wrong way; they were directed to the upper deck where they drove eastward toward the collapse site. One of these drivers did not see the open gap in time; the car plunged over the edge and smashed onto the collapsed roadbed. The driver, Anamafi Moala, died, and the passenger was seriously injured. Caltrans removed and replaced the collapsed section, and re-opened the bridge on November 18.|$|E
50|$|From {{the outset}} the largest problem was {{torsional}} vibration of the crankshaft, {{at one time}} necessitating a ban on using below 4000rpm on the bench. The vibration often caused one or other of the cranks <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> itself <b>off</b> the central spur gear, resulting in the engine becoming two aphasic flat-8s, or the parallel quill shaft (driven at 0.8 times the crank speed, located below crank, and in turn driving the flywheel and ancillaries) overheated and disintegrated.|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of a notch in the anterior {{margin of the}} glenoid cavity of 236 scapulae (118 female, 118 male) was investigated. The notch was found in 129 scapulae (55 %) and {{gave rise to a}} pear-shaped cavity. In 107 scapulae (45 %) the notch was absent, the shape of the cavity being oval. No sex difference was found in the {{prevalence of}} the notch. If a distinct notch exists, the glenoid labrum is not attached to bone at the notch and is therefore liable <b>to</b> be <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> (Bankart lesion) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow field}} of a {{propeller}} blade experiencing sheet and tip vortex cavitation is simulated using a multiscale two-phase flow Eulerian/Lagrangian approach {{which includes a}} micro-scale model tracking microbubbles, a macro-scale model capturing large cavities and a transition scheme bridges the micro and macro scales. A transition scheme bridges the micro and macro scales. The cavitation patterns on the propeller are compared for three different advance coefficients at the same cavitation number. For the higher advance coefficient the sheet cavity is seen to occur near the blade tip and downstream of the blade mid-chord. As the advance coefficient is reduced, the sheet cavitation extends toward the leading edge. Finally, at the smallest advance coefficient, the tip vortex fills with cavitation bubbles into a well-developed elongated cavity. For all three cases studied the sheet cavity is observed to extend beyond the trailing edge. Under the test conditions simulated no significant sheet cavity oscillations, detachment, and collapse is observed. Instead, small sheet volume oscillations are observed due <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> of the cavity near the trailing edge by the wake flow...|$|R

60|$|This Summer {{then being}} our Third Campaign, the King {{came to the}} Army, and with Him my Lord Marlborough, and several other Persons of Quality: Among the rest was Count Solmes, a nigh Relation to his Majesty, and Colonel of the great Regiment of Dutch Blue Guards; {{and then it was}} after two or three Marches that my Lord was observ'd to be {{somewhat}} neglected, and his Interest in the Army to decay and cool; and upon a certain Morning, as we were in full March, a Man might judge by what then happened that it was so: For it seems the Count had ordered his Baggage and Sumpters to take Place of my Lord's, and to cut them out of the Line; of which Affront my Lord being inform'd by his Servants, soon found him out, and having caus'd his Baggage to enter the Post which was his due, with his Cane lifted up, and some hard Words in French, 'twas thought by a great many that it would end in a single Combat; but the Count thought fit <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> <b>off,</b> and we heard no more of it.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{contents}} {{are under pressure}} and are sometimes hazardous materials, handling bottled gases are regulated. Regulations may include chaining bottles to prevent falling and damaging the valve, proper ventilation to prevent injury or death in case of leaks and signage to indicate the potential hazards If a compressed gas cylinder tips over, causing the valve block <b>to</b> be <b>sheared</b> <b>off,</b> the rapid release of high-pressure gas may cause the cylinder to be violently accelerated, potentially causing property damage, injury, or death. To prevent this, cylinders are normally secured to a fixed object or transport cart with a strap or chain.|$|R
60|$|Bernardo Rucellai {{was a man}} to hold a {{distinguished}} place in that Academy even before he became its host and patron. He {{was still in the}} prime of life, not more than four and forty, with a somewhat haughty, cautiously dignified presence; conscious of an amazingly pure Latinity, but, says Erasmus, not to be caught speaking Latin--no word of Latin <b>to</b> be <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> him by the sharpest of Teutons. He welcomed Tito with more marked favour than usual and gave him a place between Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giannozzo Pucci, both of them accomplished young members of the Medicean party.|$|R

25|$|The {{criminal}} charges {{focused on the}} car's steering column, which was found <b>to</b> have <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> {{at a point where}} a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed causing the accident and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his FW16's steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and Adrian Newey satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as {{there was no time to}} manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race.|$|R

Many experiments including testing the [...] "indirect mode" [...] of compression using hohlraums continued at Shiva until its dismantling in 1981. Shiva's target chamber would be reused on the Novette laser. Maximum fusion yield on Shiva was around 1010 to 1011 neutrons per shot.|$|R
40|$|Components from crashed {{aeroengine}} {{were sent}} to the laboratory for metallurgical investigation. Investigation revealed that the Rotary Slide Valve (RSV) got seized due to presence of foreign abrasive particles rich in silicon, aluminum and oxygen. These particles were found to be in the size range 5 - 15 m. The seizure of the RSV has led <b>to</b> the <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> of cardon shaft due to torsional overload. Fractographic study indicated that the failure of the cardon shaft took place under the superimposition of bending stresses, probably due to misalignment. The damages seen on the other components such as LPTR blades, HPTR blades and Nozzle Guide Vanes (1 st and 2 nd stages) are secondary in nature and subsequent to the primary failure. It appears most probable that the failure of RSV has resulted in overspeeding of the engine leading to subsequent failures...|$|R
50|$|All {{of these}} methods remove {{existing}} contamination, but provide no practical protection in icing conditions. If icing conditions exist, or are expected before takeoff, then anti-icing fluids are used. These are thicker than deicing fluids and resist the effects of snow and rain for some time.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} protein incorporation on the resistance of biomimetic calcium-phosphate coatings <b>to</b> the <b>shear</b> forces that are generated during implant insertion. Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight standard (5 × 13 mm) Osseotite® implants were coated biomimetically {{with a layer of}} calcium phosphate, which either lacked or bore a co-precipitated (incorporated) depot of the model protein bovine serum albumin (BSA). The coated implants were inserted into either artificial bone (n= 18) or the explanted mandibles of adult pigs (n= 12). The former set-up was established for the measurement of torque and of coating losses during the insertion process. The latter set-up was established for the histological and histomorphometric analysis of the fate of the coatings after implantation. Results: BSA-bearing coatings had higher mean torque values than did those that bore no protein depot. During the insertion process, less material was lost from the former than from the latter type of coating. The histological and histomorphometric analysis revealed fragments of material <b>to</b> be <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> from both types of coating at vulnerable points, namely, at the tips of the threads. The sheared-off fragments were retained within the peri-implant space. Conclusion: The incorporation of a protein into a biomimetically prepared calcium-phosphate coating increases its resistance <b>to</b> the <b>shear</b> forces that are generated during implant insertion. In a clinical setting, the incorporated protein would be an osteogenic agent, whose osteoinductive potential would not be compromised by the <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> of coating material, and the osteoconductivity of an exposed implant surface would not be less than that of a coated one...|$|R

40|$|Shock-produced melt {{veins in}} the Martian {{shergottite}} Dar al Gani 670 crosscut large olivine crystals. The {{upper part of}} one of these crystals appears <b>to</b> be <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> and displaced along the shock vein. From the olivine–vein interface small lamellae of ringwoodite grow into the host crystal. The ≤ 1 – 3 mm wide and up to 20 mm long lamellae consist of small bands and blocks and are orientated along specific crystallographic orientations. Texture and composition, i. e., more Fe-rich than the host olivine, indicate that lamellae formed via incoherent diffusion-controlled growth. It is suggested that a combination of high particle velocities and shock-induced defects lead to enhanced diffusion rates. In addition, shearing caused grain size reduction allowing rapid Fe–Mg interchange and induced lattice defects serving as nucleation sites for ringwoodite. Crystallographic orientation of ringwoodite lamellae indicates that during shock deformation the [001]hk 0 slip system was activated in olivine. Natural high-pressure phases in Martian meteorite allow to constrain phase transitions taking place in the inaccessible Earth's mantle. High pressure shear instabilities of olivine at subduction zones in 400 – 700 km depth are considered being responsible for deep earthquakes. At such p–T-conditions, breakdown of olivine results in formation of ringwoodite filled micro-anti cracks which interact with eachother finally leading <b>to</b> catastrophic <b>shear</b> failure. Our results strongly suggest that <b>shearing</b> itself contributes <b>to</b> a runaway process of enhanced ringwoodite formation and, thus, reinforces catastrophic material failure that may result in deep earthquakes...|$|R
50|$|Not {{long after}} {{becoming}} a hurricane, Adrian suddenly succumbed <b>to</b> persistent wind <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> {{the coast of}} El Salvador. Operationally, this weakening was not noticed by the NHC, leading to their assessment of the storm making landfall in El Salvador around 11:00 pm PDT (0600 UTC on May 20) as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In post-storm analysis, {{it was determined that}} the center of Adrian never actually crossed the coastline of El Salvador. Rather, convection associated with the system was sheared northward away from the center of circulation. Meteorologists at the NHC stated that Adrian's near-parallel track along the coast of El Salvador contributed to its rapid weakening as well as keeping the low offshore. Later on May 20, the system weakened to a tropical depression and made landfall in Honduras, along the Gulf of Fonseca, around 1:00 pm PDT (2100 UTC) with winds of 25 mph (35 km/h). Several hours later, Adrian dissipated over the mountains of Central America.|$|R
