40|$|When mobiTopp was {{initially}} designed, more than 10 years ago, {{it has been}} the first travel demand simulation model intended for an analysis period of one week. However, the first version supported only an analysis period of one day. This paper describes the lessons learned while extending the simulation period from one day to one week. One important issue is ensuring realistic start times of activities. Due to differences between the realized <b>trip</b> <b>durations</b> during the simulation and the <b>trip</b> <b>durations</b> assumed when creating the activity schedule, the realized activity schedule and the planned activity schedule may deviate from each other {{at some point in time}} during simulation. A suitable rescheduling strategy is needed to prevent this. Another issue is the different behavior at weekends, when more joint activities take place than on weekdays, resulting in an increased share of trips made using the mode car as passenger. If a mode choice model that takes availability of ride-sharing opportunities into account is used, it can be difficult to reproduce the correct modal split without modeling explicitly these joint activities. When modeling travel demand for a week, it is also important to account for infrequent long-distance trips. While the share of these trips is low, the total number is not negligible. It seems that these long-distance trips are not well covered by the destination choice model used for the day-to-day trips, indicating the need for a long-distance trip model of infrequent events...|$|R

40|$|Penguins rely on {{vision to}} travel and hunt at sea. Vision in marine predators, {{particularly}} those hunting phototactic prey under {{a broad range of}} light intensities, must be better understood to realize how these species respond to changes in their environment. We studied the effects of daily cycles in light intensity on visual predators by examining the duration and timing of chinstrap penguins 2 ̆ 7 Pygoscelis Antarctica foraging trips and the size, composition, and timing of their meals. We used radio telemetry and stomach-contents sampling to study adult penguins that were provisioning chicks during the summers of 1993 and 1994 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The penguins rarely initiated or terminated foraging trips at night, but otherwise varied the timing and <b>duration</b> of <b>trips</b> to sea. Cluster analyses using departure and arrival times revealed 5 distinct modes of foraging: 3 were strictly diurnal (early, mid-, and late) and 2 were partly nocturnal (overnight and extended). <b>Durations</b> of diurnal <b>trips</b> (4 to 11 h) were shorter than overnight (13 to 14 h) and extended trips (18 to 22 h). Early and mid-diurnal trips and extended trips were significantly shorter in 1993 than in 1994; late diurnal and overnight <b>trip</b> <b>durations</b> did not differ between years. Diurnal foraging was most common in 1993, whereas overnight foraging predominated in 1994. Shortened diurnal foraging in 1993 appears to have increased the frequency of diurnal foraging by allowing more parent birds to alternate diurnal trips within a single day and by reducing the incidence of birds extending diurnal foraging through the night.

50|$|A canoeist can {{transport}} significantly heavier (up to 400 {{pounds or}} more) and bulkier loads than a backpacker or kayaker, and can therefore travel farther and more easily under similar conditions. Portaging by foot is sometimes necessary to pass between water bodies or around hazardous obstacles such as rapids or waterfalls, {{but most of}} the time canoe campers travel on water.

This is especially the case with food which, unlike gear where the weight is essentially fixed regardless of the <b>trip</b> <b>duration,</b> increases in weight for each additional day of provision. On rivers, high water levels after storms can make river travel hazardous, while on lakes, winds and thunderstorms can produce strong winds which create large waves and headwinds which work against that paddlers to slow the canoe.

40|$|This study {{examined}} three competing hypotheses {{to explain how}} lactating Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) respond {{to changes in the}} level of resource availability. Antarctic fur seals have episodic bouts of suckling (1 - 3 days), alternating with foraging trips (3 - 10 days). Foraging time budgets varied significantly (p <. 001) among 8 consecutive years at Bird Island, South Georgia. Foraging <b>trip</b> <b>duration</b> increased during periods of relative food shortage. Time spent ashore was more consistent among years than foraging <b>trip</b> <b>duration</b> but declined during a year of particularly low food availability. In 4 of the 8 years, there was a significant positive correlation between time spent ashore and foraging <b>trip</b> <b>duration.</b> In the other years, the relationship was close to statistical significance. Energy delivery to pups during suckling bouts followed an asymptotic power function. Energy gain during foraging trips was estimated from diving behavior, which suggested that the energy gain function was linear. Distance traveled during foraging trips was correlated with foraging <b>trip</b> <b>duration,</b> and long foraging trips were associated with reduced foraging intensity. There was support for the hypothesis that lactating Antarctic fur seals compensate for reduced resources by increasing the foraging <b>trip</b> <b>duration</b> rather than working harder and increasing their energy expenditure. However, there was most support for the hypothesis that lactating Antarctic fur seals adjust time spent ashore as well as foraging <b>trip</b> <b>duration,</b> possibly to maximize the delivery of food to their offspring.
