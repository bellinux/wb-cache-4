40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of AISI {{304 stainless steel}} irradiated {{for over a decade}} in the Experimental Breeder Reactor (EBR-II) were measured using miniature mechanical testing methods. The shear punch method was used to evaluate the shear strengths of the neutron-irradiated steel and a correlation factor was empirically determined to predict its tensile strength. The strength of the stainless steel slightly decreased with increasing irradiation temperature, and significantly increased with increasing dose until it saturated above approximately 5 dpa. An effective <b>tensile</b> <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> was also obtained from the data which shows a relative decrease in ductility of steel with increased irradiation damage.

For the present study, line heating test for marine grade steel plate {{has been carried out}} with varying plate thickness and heating speed, and then microscopic examination and tensile test have been carried out. From the microscopic, it is found that the grain refined zones like ferrite and pearlite are formed all around the heat affected zone. From the tensile test results, it is seen that yield strength, <b>tensile</b> strength, fracture <b>strain,</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> and strength coefficient vary with plate thickness and heat input quantity.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility to measure the mechanical properties, such as yield strength, <b>tensile</b> strength, elongation, <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> and plastic <b>strain</b> ratio parameters, of low carbon steel sheets on the production line using laser ultrasound. The ultrasound generated by the developed apparatus travels mostly {{back and forth in}} the thickness of the steel sheet. By measuring the time delay between two echoes, and the relative amplitude of these two echoes, one can measure ultrasound velocity and attenuation. These are governed by the microstructure: grain size, crystallographic texture, dislocations, etc. Thus, by recording the time behavior of the ultrasonic signal, one can extract microstructural information. These microstructural information together with the modified Hall-Petch equation allow measurement of the mechanical properties. Through laboratory investigations with a laboratory laser ultrasound system, followed by the installation of a prototype system at LTV Steel Company's No. 1 Inspection Line in Cleveland, all target mechanical properties of ultra low carbon (ULC), low carbon (LC) and high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel sample lots were measured meeting or nearly meeting all the target accuracies.

Design/methodology/approach: The heat treatment of the C-Mn steel {{in order to obtain}} a dual-phase ferritic – martensitic structure of desirable phase fractions was realized. To investigate the influence of heat treatment parameters on the structure light and transmission electron microscopy methods were used. Mechanical properties were determined by means of <b>tensile</b> test. A <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> as a function of true strain was evaluated, too. Findings: It was found that an initial structure influences essentially the morphology of martensite in an obtained dual-phase structure. It can occur as a network, fine fibres or islands in a ferritic matrix of high dislocation density in the vicinity of diffusionless transformation products of austenite. The best combination of strength and ductile properties has a steel with the martensite in a form of fine fibres. Research limitations/implications: Investigations concerning using the thermomechanical treatment to obtain a ferritic – martensitic structure of steel are required.

40|$|Large rocket {{cryogenic}} tank domes have typically been fabricated using Al-Cu based alloys like Al-Cu alloy 2219. The use of aluminum-lithium based alloys for rocket fuel tank domes can reduce weight because aluminum-lithium alloys have lower density and higher strength than Al-Cu alloy 2219. However, Al-Li alloys have rarely {{been used to}} fabricate rocket fuel tank domes because of the inherent low formability characteristic that make them susceptible to cracking during the forming operations. The ability to form metal by stretch forming or spin forming without excessive thinning or necking depends on the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> "n". The stain <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> {{is a measure of}} how rapidly a metal becomes stronger and harder. A high <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> is beneficial to a material's ability to uniformly distribute the imposed strain. Marshall Space Flight Center has developed a novel annealing process that can achieve a work <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> on the order of 0. 27 to 0. 29, which is approximately 50 % higher than what is typically obtained for Al-Li alloys using the conventional method. The <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> of the Al-Li alloy plates or blanks heat treated using the conventional method is typically on the order of 0. 17 to 0. 19.

40|$|A {{numerical}} description relating microstructure to elastic {{and plastic}} deformation behavior {{would make it}} possible to simulate the mechanical behavior of complex cast components with tailored material properties. Limited work and data have however been published regarding the connection between microstructure and plastic behavior of austempered ductile irons (ADI). In the current work the effects of austempering temperature and austempering time on the strength coefficient and the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> of the Hollomon equation have been investigated for two ADI alloys. The results show that the plastic behavior is highly dependent on the combination of austempering temperature and austempering time.

The effect of the austempering time on the plastic behavior depends on the austempering temperature. At low austempering temperatures the strength coefficient and the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> decrease with increased austempering time, whereas at higher austempering temperatures they show little time dependence.

In contrast, very few studies have investigated quantitative aspects of frictional sliding contact in the elasto-plastic regime. In this thesis, a new framework was developed to establish relationships between the frictional sliding response, material properties and contact parameters. Dimensional analysis enabled to define scaling variables and dimensionless functions. Finite element methods were used to simulate the process of steady-state frictional sliding and evaluate the dimensionless functions. In frictional sliding, the representative plastic strain {{was found to be}} more than four times as large as in normal indentation. Further comparison with indentation indicated a three fold increase in the maximum pile-up height and an increased influence of the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> on hardness. Experimental studies were conducted with and without a liquid lubricant in selected material systems. Quantitative agreements with numerical predictions were observed in all cases. The strong influence of the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> on the pile-up height was illustrated from frictional sliding results obtained in copper and copper-zinc specimens of different grain sizes. (cont.) Also, the influence of hardening characteristics was illustrated by preparing two microstructures of an aluminum alloy to have the same indentation hardness. These materials with same indentation hardness showed significantly different hardness and pile-up in frictional sliding. Experiments were also carried out on nanocrystalline nickel and alloys of different grain sizes. The addition of tungsten did not change significantly the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> behavior of nanocrystalline nickel but it did stabilize significantly the microstructure in repeated pass experiments. A reverse algorithm was developed to extract plastic flow properties from the frictional sliding response. This algorithm uses the scratch hardness and pile-up measurements to estimate yield strength and <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent.</b> Based on sensitivity analysis, the accuracy on these estimates is significantly improved as compared to reverse algorithms for instrumented indentation, especially for the <b>strain</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent.</b> Frictional sliding is an alternative or complement to instrumented indentation.
