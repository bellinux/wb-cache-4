5|$|Gould's {{career as}} justice {{minister}} {{was marked by}} consolidation of the law, <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> licensing laws and reforms relating to police courts. A supporter of Federation, he nevertheless opposed the 1898 bill, which he believed deprived New South Wales of adequate recognition. He was defeated in the election of that year, but in 1899 {{he was one of}} Premier Reid's twelve appointments to the Legislative Council that enabled the passage of the legislation for a referendum on Federation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> {{laws and}} {{increased}} enforcement by police {{on behalf of}} the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and other industry groups—often for peripheral issues such as tax evasion—gradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD bootlegs further underground. Physical bootlegging largely shifted to countries with laxer copyright laws with the results distributed through existing underground channels, open market sites such as eBay, and other specialised websites, though {{by the end of the}} decade, eBay had clamped down on bootlegs.|$|E

5|$|When the {{consideration}} {{was made that}} the ambulance drivers' weapons incident just prior to Centaur's voyage may have been partially responsible for the attack, {{it led to the}} <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> rules regarding who was allowed to travel on a hospital ship. Quasi-medical staff, like repatriation teams, were no longer permitted on hospital ships. Ambulance drivers had to transfer from the regular Army to the Australian Army Medical Corps before they were allowed aboard, although they were still permitted to carry their unloaded weapons and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|After much delay (two of its ten members {{died and}} several fell ill), the {{commission}} reported its findings in March 1912. Its 139-page report recommended {{an increase in}} the number of full-time inspectors from two to four; restrictions on the use of curare, a poison used to immobilize animals during experiments; the euthanasia of animals in severe pain, even if it meant frustrating the experiment; and the <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> the definition and practice of pithing. It also recommended the maintenance of more detailed records and the establishment of a committee to advise the Secretary of State on matters related to the Cruelty to Animals Act. The latter became the Animal Procedures Committee under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot {{begins in}} June 1819, {{following}} Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, after the House of Bourbon had been {{restored to the}} throne of France. Tension was mounting between the aristocracy, which had returned with King Louis XVIII, and the bourgeoisie produced by the Industrial Revolution. During this era, France saw a <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> social structures, with a lower class steeped in overwhelming poverty. By one estimate, almost three-quarters of Parisians {{did not make the}} 500–600 francs a year required for a minimal standard of living. At the same time, this upheaval made possible a social mobility unthinkable during the Ancien Régime of previous centuries. Individuals willing to adapt themselves to the rules of this new society could sometimes ascend into its upper echelons from modest backgrounds, much to the distaste of the established wealthy class.|$|E

5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> small {{blood vessels}} in the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|The British South Africa Company had {{reservations}} about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia's {{resources to the}} war effort, {{in part because of}} its desire to keep the colonial economy operating. There was indeed <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> belts in the Rhodesias during the war, but not on the same scale as in Britain. The retail sector suffered, prices for many basic day-to-day items rose sharply, and exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war, but mining, the industry on which Rhodesia's economic viability hinged, continued to operate successfully, despite occasional difficulties in obtaining manpower. The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916, and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal ferrochrome. A flurry of new prospecting ventures led to the discovery of another strategic metal, tungsten, near Essexvale in southern Matabeleland in May 1917.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{believed there}} was a need for it to act to prevent Sinn Féin from using the media to defend the actions of the IRA, and the measures were part of a wider government response to the increase in violence, which also included changes to the right to silence and the <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> rules allowing paramilitary prisoners early release. Further controversy also erupted in September 1988 over an intended edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark which was to have featured the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, as a guest. The show was dropped after the conservative academic Paul Wilkinson – a Professor at Aberdeen University who specialised in the study of terrorism and political violence – voiced strong objections to its transmission (more details here).|$|E

5|$|The {{legal status}} of {{psilocybin}} mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including P.semilanceata, is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) {{there has been a}} <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> laws and enforcements. In The Netherlands, where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops and smart shops, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms—the final European country to do so.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{accident}} {{did not result}} in a large number of deaths, it exposed major stewardship shortcomings of the privatised national railway infrastructure company Railtrack. Reports found {{there was a lack of}} communication and some staff were not aware of maintenance procedures. Railtrack subsequently went into administration and was replaced by Network Rail. The aftermath of {{the accident}} saw widespread speed limit reductions throughout the rail network and a <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> health and safety procedures, the repercussions of which were still felt up to 15 years later. In 2005, both Network Rail and the contractor Balfour Beatty were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt {{led to the}} <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> Umayyad control over Iraq. Al-Hajjaj founded a {{permanent}} garrison for the Syrian troops at Wasit, situated between Basra and Kufa, and the Iraqis, regardless of social status, were deprived of any real power in the governance of the region. This was coupled with a reform of the salary (ʿaṭāʾ) system by al-Hajjaj: whereas hitherto the salary had been calculated based {{on the role of}} one's ancestors in the early Muslim conquests, it now became limited to those actively participating in campaigns. As most of the army was now composed of Syrians, this measure gravely injured the interests of the Iraqis, who regarded this as another impious attack on hallowed institutions. In addition, extensive land reclamation and irrigation works were undertaken in lower Iraq (the Sawad), but this was limited mostly to around Wasit, and the proceeds went to the Umayyads and their clients, not the Iraqi nobility. As a result, the political power of the once mighty Kufan élites was soon broken.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a gradual}} {{reduction}} in the number of locations allowed to mint coins in England; under HenryII, only 30 boroughs were still able to use their own moneyers, and the <b>tightening</b> <b>of</b> controls continued throughout the 13th century. By the reign of EdwardI there were only nine mints outside London and the king created a new official called the Master of the Mint to oversee these and the thirty furnaces operating in London to meet the demand for new coins. The amount of money in circulation hugely increased in this period; before the Norman invasion there had been around £50,000 in circulation as coin, but by 1311 this had risen to more than £1million. At any particular point in time, though, much of this currency might be being stored prior to being used to support military campaigns or to be sent overseas to meet payments, resulting in bursts of temporary deflation as coins ceased to circulate within the English economy. One physical consequence of the growth in the coinage was that coins had to be manufactured in large numbers, being moved in barrels and sacks to be stored in local treasuries for royal use as the king travelled.|$|E
