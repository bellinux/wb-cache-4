5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that would lead to a value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E

40|$|Soil pressureswere {{measured}} {{on both sides}} of the cutterwheel of an EPB-shield during tunnelling in saturated sand, using foam for soil conditioning. <b>The</b> measured <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> compared with <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> at <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> bulkhead. <b>The</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> not purely hydrostatic but the results are also influenced by the yield strength of the foam mixture and the effective stresses. At the lowest positions, the sensors sometimes measured effective stresses. This led to peaks in <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> measured. It <b>is</b> shown that for the soil conditions present, <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> measured at <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> bulkhead <b>are</b> comparable to <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> measured at <b>the</b> rotor, but <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> gradients can differ significantly (around 30 % difference in gradients is possible).

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. The table below classifies the effects by affected organ and bubble location.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E

5|$|The Snake River Plain is a {{volcanic}} province {{that was created}} {{by a series of}} cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 15 million years ago. A migrating hotspot thought to now exist under Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated. This hot spot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11million years ago but 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward. Pressure from the hot spot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot spot passes <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> released and the land subsides.|$|E
5|$|The Westerlies or the Prevailing Westerlies are the {{prevailing}} winds {{in the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with {{the temperature in the}} range 100–160K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10–20 bar and temperatures are 270–330K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.|$|E

40|$|Plastic {{deformation}} of either a sample or a gasket between diamond anvils leads to large pressure concentrations, i. e., <b>the</b> maximum <b>pressure</b> can <b>be</b> many times <b>the</b> average <b>pressure.</b> This behavior <b>is</b> discussed using elementary plasticity theory {{for the case}} where <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently low that the yield stress can be assumed not to vary with <b>pressure.</b> It <b>is</b> then shown that <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> concentration factor can be even much larger when the yield stress of the sample at <b>the</b> highest <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> {{much greater than the}} yield stress at <b>the</b> lowest <b>pressure.</b> This <b>is</b> illustrated with solid xenon where it is shown that the assumption that Nelson and Ruoff made about <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution in their xenon samples <b>is</b> incorrect. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution <b>is</b> shown to be much steeper than assumed. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> they observed electrical conduction in xenon was above 1 Mbar...|$|R

5|$|There are two {{widespread}} {{standards for}} pressure measurement of diving gas. In the USA {{and perhaps a}} few other places <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> measured in {{pounds per square inch}} (psi), {{and the rest of the}} world uses bar. Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units, such as kilopascal (kPa) or megapascal (MPa), or in atmospheres (atm, or ATA), particularly gauges not actually used underwater.|$|E
5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. <b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E

25|$|The pacinian {{corpuscle}} is {{one such}} structure. It has concentric layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires. If <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> steady, {{there is no more}} stimulus; thus, typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of a number of other neurons.|$|E

25|$|Fluid {{particles}} are subject only to pressure {{and their own}} weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases {{it can only be}} because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>is</b> highest.|$|E
