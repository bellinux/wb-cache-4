5|$|She and Tony meet up {{with her}} Israeli friend, Adam Eshel (Damon Dayoub), who gives them {{information}} on Bodnar's whereabouts and intentions. Bodnar contacts Ziva on the computer, urging her to walk away. They are able to track his location but are unable to apprehend him as he disappears into a crowd. Later, they learn that he is planning {{to pick up the}} diamonds from an ally (Willem Van Der Vegt) at a night club. While waiting to intercept him, Tony dances with Ziva both to help her get a better view of the area and to calm her agitated state of mind. Bodnar seems to appear, but when Ziva approaches him, she is stunned <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is Ilan's brother, Yaniv (Iddo Goldberg).|$|E
25|$|This event {{occurred}} {{shortly before}} Rosh Hashanah. On that holiday, {{as he lay}} dying, Rabbi Amnon asked to be carried into the synagogue, where he recited the original composition of Unetanneh Tokef with his last breath (the story contains an ambiguous phrase that some commentators interpreted as saying {{that he did not}} merely die but that his body miraculously vanished). Three days later, he appeared in a dream to Rabbi Kalonymus ben Meshullam (died 1096), one of the great scholars and liturgists of Mainz, and begged him to transcribe the prayer and <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was included in the text of the High Holiday services. Thus, the legend concludes, Unetanneh Tokef became a part of the standard liturgy.|$|E
25|$|Gershwin's all-black opera {{was also}} unpopular with some celebrated black artists. Harry Belafonte {{declined}} to play Porgy {{in the late}} 1950s film version, so the role went to Sidney Poitier. Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935. My {{way of dealing with}} it was <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was really a piece of Americana, of American history, whether we liked it or not.

His magazine also accused Caragiale of having copied Victorien Sardou's Rabagas for his O scrisoare pierdută, as well as Henri Chivot and Alfred Duru's Le Carnaval d'un Merle Blanc in D-ale carnavalului. In one memorable incident of 14 February 1902, while he was hosting a literary festivity at the Bucharest Athenaeum, Macedonski was heckled and responded by blowing a whistle. Forţa Morală was shut down soon after this episode. In parallel, the National Theater offered Caragiale a degree of satisfaction, when it decided to showcase Rabagas, leaving the public <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was only remotely similar to his play.|$|E
25|$|The Yamato {{arrives at}} Iskandar, but is {{met by a}} large Gamilas fleet that sends a {{spacecraft}} to obstruct the muzzle of the Wave Motion Cannon. With their main weapon disabled, Kodai makes the dangerous choice to conduct a random warp and ends up at {{the opposite side of}} Iskandar. They are surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is lifeless, and in fact strongly resembles Earth in its presently irradiated state. It is then discovered that Gamilas and Iskandar are the same planet. The crew thinks it is a trap, but Kodai urges them to go ahead. He leads an attack party to the planet's surface against heavy Gamilas opposition. Much of the assault force is killed, and the remaining pilots stay behind to cover for Kodai, Sanada, Saito and Mori as they head for the coordinates.|$|E

The three barricade themselves inside a room, but Dean quickly realizes that Lilith has taken over Ruby's host. Claiming to have sent Ruby [...] "far, far away", Lilith telekinetically pins the brothers down and lets in the hellhound. As Dean is mauled to death, Lilith blasts Sam with white energy from her hand. Horrified <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has no effect, she flees her host before Sam can retaliate.

500|$|The 19th-century clergyman and {{antiquarian}} Harry Longueville Jones {{disputed the}} need to replace the old church and condemned its [...] "melancholy fate", describing the reasons for its demise as [...] "pretexts".

[...] Furthermore, the cost of the new church was more than double the cost of repairs to the medieval church, which could have [...] "endure for ages to come". He added that it might have been thought to be safe, as it was so close to Lord Boston's house and thus [...] "under the shadow of the lord of the domain", and he condemned the [...] "evil hour" [...] in which [...] "the ruthless hand of the destroyer was allowed to be lifted against it by those whose first duty it was <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> took no harm". He stated that [...] "when buildings, dedicated to God's service by the piety of former ages, are allowed to be treated in this manner by the constituted authorities of the land... the institutions to which they are attached cannot be expected to find greater favour at the hands of the fickle and ignorant multitude." [...] He also noted that the new church was only a little larger than its predecessor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{importance}} of the seal {{as a means of}} authentication necessitated that when authority passed into new hands the old seal should be destroyed and a new one made.

A similar practice prevailed in the Middle Ages and it is often alluded to by historians, as it {{seems to have been a}} matter of some ceremony. For example, on the death of Robert of Holy Island, Bishop of Durham, in 1283, the chronicler Robert Greystones reports: [...] "After his burial, his seal was publicly broken up in the presence of all by Master Robert Avenel."

2500|$|Despite {{their success}} fielding five {{specialist}} bowlers at Adelaide, England brought in Mark Ramprakash from the England A tour of India to replace spinner Tufnell.

Australia's selection was less straightforward, with some analysts predicting that Warne had either been overbowled or had an injury that was affecting his performance and would be {{left out of the}} side. Skipper Mark Taylor rubbished these reports though, claiming that his leg spinner simply [...] "had a niggle", and [...] "wasn't bowling well", but that it had [...] "nothing to do with injuries" [...] and that it was [...] "all to do with his action", which was now remedied.|$|E
