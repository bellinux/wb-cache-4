2500|$|... "It is {{customary}} {{to talk of}} Kelly as quintessentially an Irish rider. For my part, though, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> {{to place}} Kelly better as a cyclist {{to see him as}} the last of the Flemish riders. This is usually a title associated with the post-war rider, Briek Schotte who has become appropriately enough the man in day-to-day charge of the de Gribaldy teams. As exemplified by Schotte it stood for a certain type of mentality, willing to suffer, narrowly focussed, and hard, hard, hard. Kelly had all this in him from his Irish small-farm background: the outside loo; the dogs that have to be chained before you can step from your car; the one career possible, as a bricklayer on a construction site, stretching away and away into the grey mists. On the positive side, along with the self-reliance, came a physical strength that even by peasant standards is impressive. In a profession of iron wills, there is no one harder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sharapova {{has made}} varying remarks {{on how long}} she intends to {{maintain}} her tennis career. Following the retirement of 25-year-old Justine Henin in 2008, Sharapova said, [...] "If I [...] 25, and I'd won so many Grand Slams, I'd quit too." [...] In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open, she balked {{at the idea of}} playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a [...] "nice husband and a few kids" [...] by then. However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis {{for as long as she}} enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated, [...] "I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up, and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement." ...|$|E

6000|$|Rheims is {{the most}} unspeakable and immeasurable horror and infamy--and what is appalling and heart-breaking is that it's [...] "for ever and ever." [...] But no words fill the abyss of it--nor touch it, nor relieve one's heart nor light by a spark the blackness; the ache of one's howl and the anguish of one's execration aren't mitigated by a shade, even as one brands it as the most hideous crime ever perpetrated against the mind of man. There it was--and now all the tears of rage of all the bereft {{millions}} and all the crowding curses of all the wondering ages will never bring a stone of it back! Yet one tries--even now--tries to get something from saying that the measure is so full as to overflow at last {{in a sort of}} vindictive deluge (though for all the stones that that will replace!) and that the arm of final retributive justice becomes by it an engine really in some degree proportionate to the act. I positively do <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>helps</b> me a little, to think of how they can be made to wear the shame, in the pitiless glare of history, forever and ever--and not even {{to get rid of it}} when they are maddened, literally, by the weight.
