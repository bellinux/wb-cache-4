40|$|The MUC 7 12 -mer (RKSYKCLHKRCR) is a {{cationic}} antimicrobial peptide {{derived from}} the human salivary mucin MUC 7. To study its effect/mechanism of action on fungi, we performed a fitness screen of a tagged, diploid, homozygous gene deletion mutant pool of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown {{in the presence of}} the MUC 7 peptide. Forty-five strains exhibiting reduced fitness and 13 strains exhibiting increased fitness (sensitivity or resistance, respectively) were identified by hybridization intensities to tag arrays. The strongest fitness defects were observed with deletions in genes encoding elements of the RIM 101 signaling pathway (regulating response to alkaline and neutral pH and other environmental conditions) and of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT; functioning mainly in protein sorting for degradation, but also required for activation of the RIM 101 pathway). Other deletions identified as conferring fitness defect or gain are in genes associated with a variety of functions, including transcription regulation, protein trafficking, transport, metabolism, and others. The results of the pool fitness screen were validated by a set of mutant strains tested individually {{in the presence of the}} MUC 7 12 -mer. All <b>tested</b> <b>RIM</b> 101 -related deletion strains showing fitness defects confirmed their sensitivities. Taken together, the results led us to conclude that deletions of genes associated with the RIM 101 pathway confer sensitivity to the peptide by preventing activa-tion of this pathway and that this stress response plays a major role in the protection of S. cerevisiae agains...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{different}} {{tests for}} antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV) were evaluated for attributes {{that are important}} in situations in veterinary practice. We compared four indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests (IFAT), one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (FCoV Immunocomb; Biogal) and three rapid immunochromatographic (<b>RIM)</b> <b>tests</b> against a panel of samples designated by consensus as positive or negative. Specificity was 100 % for all but the two IFATs based on transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), at 83. 3 % and 97. 5 %. The IFAT and ELISA tests were best for obtaining an antibody titre and for working in the presence of virus. The <b>RIM</b> <b>tests</b> were the best for obtaining a result quickly (10 - 15 mins); of these, the Speed F-Corona was the most sensitive, at 92. 4 %, followed by FASTest feline infectious peritonitis (FIP; 84. 6 %) and Anigen Rapid FCoV antibody test (64. 1 %). Sensitivity was 100 % for the ELISA, one FCoV IFAT and one TGEV IFAT; and 98. 2 % for a second TGEV IFA and 96. 1 % for a second FCoV IFAT. All tests worked with effusions, even when only blood products were stipulated in the instruction manual. The ELISA and Anigen <b>RIM</b> <b>tests</b> were best for small quantities of sample. The most appropriate FCoV antibody test to use depends on the reason for testing: in excluding a diagnosis of FIP, sensitivity, specificity, small sample quantity, rapidity and ability to work in the presence of virus all matter. For FCoV screening, speed and sensitivity are important, and for FCoV elimination antibody titre is essential...|$|R

40|$|Spacecraft on-orbit {{servicing}} {{consists of}} exchanging components such as payloads, orbital replacement units (ORUs), and consumables. To accomplish {{the exchange of}} consumables, the receiving vehicle must mate to the supplier vehicle. Mating {{can be accomplished by}} a variety of docking procedures. However, these docking schemes are mission dependent and can vary from shuttle bay berthing to autonomous rendezvous and docking. Satisfying the many docking conditions will require use of an innovative docking device. The device must provide fluid, electrical, pneumatic and data transfer between vehicles. Also, the proper stiffness must be obtained and sustained between the vehicles. A device to accomplish this, the resupply interface mechanism (RIM), was developed. The RIM is a unique device because it grasps the mating vehicle, draws the two vehicles together, simultaneously mates all connectors, and rigidizes the mating devices. The NASA-Johnson Manipulator Development Facility was used to study how compatible the RIM is to on orbit docking and berthing. The facility contains a shuttle cargo bay mockup with a remote manipulator system (RMS). This RMS is used to prepare crew members for shuttle missions involving spacecraft berthing operations. The MDF proved to be an excellant system for testing the RIM/RMS compatibility. The elements examined during the <b>RIM</b> JSC <b>test</b> were: <b>RIM</b> gross and fine alignment; berthing method sequence; visual cuing aids; utility connections; and RIM overall performance.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionSeveral {{treatment}} options {{are available for}} primary hyperhidrosis. Selection for individual patients is influenced by symptom severity, success rates and the relative risk of compensatory hyperhidrosis. Case reportA 24 -year-old female presented with a 10 -year history of palmar, pedal and axillary hyperhidrosis. Following recurrent relapse after botulinum toxin (BOTOX®) injections for axillary hyperhidrosis bilateral axillary sweat gland curettage was performed with immediate procedural success. At 6 month follow-up recurrent hyperhidrosis was reported affecting both axillae. A starch-iodine <b>test</b> showed a <b>rim</b> of persisting sweating at the periphery of both axillae. DiscussionCurettage is generally performed without specific identification of sweat gland distribution, perhaps explaining the recurrence in this patient. In contrast, a starch–iodine test is used to guide administration of BOTOX® for hyperhidrosis. We propose pre-operative use of this technique before axillary curettage...|$|R
40|$|Background: Wheelchair {{research}} {{includes both}} {{qualitative and quantitative}} approaches, primarily focuses on functionality and skill performance and is often limited to short testing periods. This is the first study to use {{the combination of a}} performance test (i. e. wheelchair propulsion test) and a multiple-day mobility assessment to evaluate wheelchair designs in rural areas of a developing country. Objectives: Test the feasibility of using wheel-mounted accelerometers to document bouts of wheeled mobility data in rural settings and use these data to compare how patients respond to different wheelchair designs. Methods: A quasi-experimental, pre- and post-test design was used to test the differences between locally manufactured wheelchairs (push rim and tricycle) and an imported intervention product (dual-lever propulsion wheelchair). A one-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to interpret propulsion and wheeled mobility data. Results: There were no statistical differences in bouts of mobility between the locally manufactured and intervention product, which was explained by high amounts of variability within the data. With regard to the propulsion <b>test,</b> push <b>rim</b> users were significantly more efficient when using the intervention product compared with tricycle users. Conclusion: Use of wheel-mounted accelerometers as a means to test user mobility proved to be a feasible methodology in rural settings. Variability in wheeled mobility data could be decreased with longer acclimatisation periods. The data suggest that push rim users experience an easier transition to a dual-lever propulsion system...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Resilience is a {{positive}} health outcome identified by the Committee on Future Direction for Behavioral and Social Sciences as a research priority for the National Institutes of Health. The Resilience in Illness Model (RIM) was developed {{from a series of}} qualitative and quantitative studies, to increase understanding of how positive health protective factors (ie, social integration, family environment, courageous coping, and derived meaning) may influence resilience outcomes. The RIM also includes 2 risk factors: illness-related distress and defensive coping. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this 2 -part article was to report on evaluation of the RIM for adolescents/young adults (AYAs) with cancer. Here, in part 1, our purpose was to describe the exploratory RIM evaluation, and in part 2 we describe the confirmatory RIM evaluation. METHODS: An exploratory evaluation of RIM was done using exploratory latent variable structural equation modeling with a combined sample from 2 studies of preadolescents and AYAs with cancer aged 10 to 26 years (n = 202). RESULTS: Results, including goodness-of-fit indices, support the RIM as a theory {{with a high level of}} explained variance for outcomes of resilience (67 %) and self-transcendence (63 %). Variance explained for proximal outcomes ranged from 18 % to 76 %.

40|$|Biosorption {{can be a}} {{promising}} technology in rare earth metal separation and recovery due to the low costs of waste biomasses (used as biosorbents) and the high selectivity exploiting specific interaction between metals and biological active sites. In this work, Saccharomyces cerevisiae biomass was used to recover lanthanum. Biosorption properties of two S. cerevisiae strains, wild type and rim 20. mutant, have been tested. Potentiometric titrations were carried out for rim 20. mutant strain and compared with wild type. Nature of the main active sites and their concentration were determined by implementing mechanistic models. Carboxylic, amino and phosphoric sites are the main groups present. Higher concentration of negatively charged sites was found in rim 20. (0. 0024 mol/g) than in wild type (0. 0022 mol/g). The rate of lanthanum biosorption process is very fast requiring only 10 - 20 minutes to reach equilibrium condition for both strains. Then biosorption equilibrium tests were done for both biomasses by testing two equilibrium pH (4. 0 and 6. 0). Maximum uptake capacities (qmax) were: 70 mg/g and 40 mg/g at pH 4. 0 for rim 20. and wild type, respectively, and 67 mg/g and 80 mg/g at pH 6. 0 for wild type and rim 20., respectively. These data evidenced that: rim 20. mutant had a higher maximum biosorption capacity with respect to wild type counterpart, and that pH had a relevant effect on lanthanum removal. S. cerevisiae yeast denoted good lanthanum biosorption properties and, between <b>tested</b> strains, <b>rim</b> 20. {{was found to be}} the most promising for such aim...|$|R

40|$|In this research, {{experimental}} and numerical methods {{were used to}} analyse the performance of multi-piece wheel structures and two proposed innovative designs to enhance safety were validated by computer simulations. Fatality report analyses revealed that the majority (90 %) of the multi-piece wheel failures were caused by use of lock rings. Experimental tire and <b>rim</b> base <b>tests</b> were conducted to understand the deflection characteristics of off-the-road tires and to validate the finite element model of a five-piece wheel/tire (sized 29. 5 - 29) assembly. A linear relationship {{was found between the}} vertical displacement of the wheel and the maximum lateral deflection of the tire for both static and quasi static loading tests. A robust tire model was validated with an average accumulative error of 9. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 96 for tire deflections, compared to the experimental <b>tests.</b> The <b>rim</b> base model was validated with an average error of 7. 6 % and an average validation metric of 0. 93 for wheel deformations, and an average accumulative error of 12. 7 % and an average validation metric of 0. 88 for strains, compared to experimental tests. Based on validated FE model of the five-piece wheel/tire assembly, geometry degradation (material wear out at critical regions) and material degradation (fatigue and corrosion) were studied to estimate their effects on fatigue lives. Two design innovations were proposed to enhance safety and fatigue life of the five-piece wheel. The threaded-connection design reduced the possibility of failure due to the mismatched wheel components. The BS band pull-out simulation revealed that the threaded-connection design was twice as strong as the conventional five-piece design in holding wheel components and the tire together, and the wheel may fail in a safer mode. The fatigue lives of the rim base were two orders of magnitude higher than those of the conventional five-piece wheel. The two-piece wheel design completely removed the possibility of wheel failure due to mismatched wheel components; the fatigue lives were increased by over two orders of magnitude, compared to the conventional five-piece wheel...|$|R
40|$|Results {{of using}} vibration-based methods to detect gear tooth fatigue cracks are presented. An {{experimental}} test rig {{was used to}} fail a number of spur gear specimens through bending fatigue. The gear tooth fatigue crack in each test was initiated through a small notch in the fillet area of a tooth on the gear. The primary purpose of these tests was to verify analytical predictions of fatigue crack propagation direction and rate {{as a function of}} gear rim thickness. The vibration signal from a total of three tests was monitored and recorded for gear fault detection research. The damage consisted of complete rim fracture on the two thin rim gears and single tooth fracture on the standard full <b>rim</b> <b>test</b> gear. Vibration-based fault detection methods were applied to the vibration signal both on-line and after the tests were completed.

Design and data sources: This was a systematic review, prognostic accuracy analysis, and cost-effectiveness analysis. Databases searched were: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and BioSis Previews. Grey literature was also explored. Materials and methods: A systematic review was conducted to locate published and unpublished studies. All studies examining corneal button contamination and its association with endophthalmitis and keratitis posttransplantation were included. Extracted data were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Cost data from the London Laboratory Services Group in London, ON were used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of culturing donor rim cultures. Results: Of 7, 870 grafts, 954 had a positive rim culture (12. 1 %), with 12 patients going on to develop keratitis or endophthalmitis (1. 3 %). The prevalence of keratitis and endophthalmitis in this study was 0. 15 %, and the positive predictive value 1. 5 %. Of the 12 infections, nine were fungal and three bacterial. The estimated cost of a positive and negative test result was CAD$ 45. 99 and $ 14. 15, respectively. The cost to run all 7, 870 tests was estimated to be $ 141, 735. 86, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $ 40, 215. 70. Conclusion: There was a significant divergence between bacterial and fungal rim-culture results. Bacterial cultures predicted clinical infection poorly, did not change management, and were expensive. Fungal cultures predicted clinical infection in over 10 % of patients, had the potential to change management, and were 40 % less expensive than full rim culturing (bacterial and fungal <b>tests).</b> Fungal <b>rim</b> cultures may be considered in areas where fungal infection rates are high.

40|$|Wear {{and fatigue}} of {{polyethylene}} acetabular cups {{have been reported}} {{to play a role in}} the failure of total hip replacements. Edge loading of hip replacements can occur where there is sub-optimal component positioning and/or joint laxity. Wear resistance can be improved by crosslinking but the manufacturing process of these materials involves post-irradiation thermal treatments to recombine free radicals and to stabilise the materials. Stabilisation can also be achieved by adding antioxidants. Material degradation due to oxidation and manufacturing process can result in rim cracking and/or fracture due to a reduction in mechanical properties and this has been observed in vivo. A requirement for pre-clinical hip simulator testing under edge loading conditions for all of these materials has therefore been identified. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a hip simulator edge loading protocol using accelerated aged conventional UHMWPE acetabular liners as positive controls and commercially available crosslinked UHMWPE acetabular liners as negative controls. The edge loading protocol was then used to evaluate antioxidant stabilised liners in hip simulator tests. Explanted UHMWPE acetabular liners were evaluated for wear and damage mechanisms and compared with the damage observed on the hip simulator tested liners and new methodologies were developed to measure and analyse these explanted liners. The edge loading protocol produced cracking and subsurface damage in the aged UHMWPE liners but not in the non-aged crosslinked liners. Rim deformation was observed on all liners and the volume change produced was reduced under edge loading conditions for both types of UHMWPE liner. The antioxidant liners performed as well as the commercially available crosslinked liner in hip simulator <b>tests</b> and the <b>rim</b> deformation that was observed on explanted liners was replicated under edge loading conditions in the hip simulator tests. The edge loading protocol can be used in the future to test a range of UHMWPE materials, including aged materials, and explant analysis using the methodologies developed in this study can be used to inform the design of future simulator tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{inclusion}} of roughness elements {{on the target}} surface of a turbine aerofoil impingement cooling system is an attractive means of heat transfer enhancement. In such a system, {{it is important to}} minimise additional pressure loss caused by the roughness elements and thus their shape, size and position need to be optimised. The research showed how heat transfer enhancement is normally achieved at the expense of extra pressure loss. A hexagonal roughness element designed by the authors showed up to 10 % heat transfer enhancement with minimal extra pressure loss. The present work includes shear pattern visualisation on the target surface, pressure loss measurements and heat transfer coefficient measurements for an impingement cooling system with simply shaped roughness elements-specifically cylindrical and diamond pimples. Flow visualisation results and pressure loss measurements for the above configurations provided criteria for selecting the shape, size and position of the roughness elements. The detailed heat transfer measurements on the target surface and over the roughness elements were used to explain the heat transfer enhancement mechanisms. It was found that the largest contribution to heat transfer is the impingement stagnation point and the developing wall jet regions. However, the research showed that the low heat transfer coefficient region could be made to contribute more by using strategically located roughness elements. A hexagonal rim was designed to cover the complete low heat transfer coefficient region midway between neighbouring jets. The effect of the height, cross sectional shape and wall angle of the hexagonal rim were studied using a series of heat transfer and pressure loss experiments. The transient heat transfer tests were conducted using a triple thermochromic liquid crystal techninique and the thermal transient was produced by a fine wire me heater. The heat transfer coefficient over the pimples was measured using a hybrid transient method that analysed the thermal transient of the copper pimple. The detailed heat transfer coefficient distributions over the complete area of the target surface provided comprehensive understanding of the performance of the hexagonal <b>rim.</b> <b>Tests</b> were conducted at three different mass flow rates for each configuration.

40|$|Gas {{turbine engines}} for future subsonic {{aircraft}} will require nickel-base disk alloys {{that can be}} used at temperatures in excess of 1300 F. Smaller turbine engines, with higher rotational speeds, also require disk alloys with high strength. To address these challenges, NASA funded a series of disk programs in the 1990 's. Under these initiatives, Honeywell and Allison focused their attention on Alloy 10, a high-strength, nickel-base disk alloy developed by Honeywell for application in the small turbine engines used in regional jet aircraft. Since tensile, creep, and fatigue properties are strongly influenced by alloy grain size, the effect of heat treatment on grain size and the attendant properties were studied in detail. It was observed that a fine grain microstructure offered the best tensile and fatigue properties, whereas a coarse grain microstructure offered the best creep resistance at high temperatures. Therefore, a disk with a dual microstructure, consisting of a fine-grained bore and a coarse-grained rim, should have a high potential for optimal performance. Under NASA's Ultra-Safe Propulsion Project and Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Program, a disk program was initiated at the NASA Glenn Research Center to assess the feasibility of using Alloy 10 to produce a dual-microstructure disk. The objectives of this program were twofold. First, existing dual-microstructure heat treatment (DMHT) technology would be applied and refined as necessary for Alloy 10 to yield the desired grain structure in full-scale forgings appropriate for use in regional gas turbine engines. Second, key mechanical properties from the bore and rim of a DMHT Alloy 10 disk would be measured and compared with conventional heat treatments to assess the benefits of DMHT technology. At Wyman Gordon and Honeywell, an active-cooling DMHT process was used to convert four full-scale Alloy 10 disks to a dual-grain microstructure. The resulting microstructures are illustrated in the photomicrographs. The fine grain size in the bore can be contrasted with the coarse grain size in the <b>rim.</b> <b>Testing</b> (at NASA Glenn) of coupons machined from these disks showed that the DMHT approach did indeed produce a high-strength, fatigue resistant bore and a creep-resistant rim. This combination of properties was previously unobtainable using conventional heat treatments, which produced disks with a uniform grain size. Future plans are in place to spin test a DMHT disk under the Ultra Safe Propulsion Project to assess the viability of this technology at the component level. This testing will include measurements of disk growth at a high temperature as well as the determination of burst speed at an intermediate temperature...|$|R
