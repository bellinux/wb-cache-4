50|$|The {{most popular}} {{application}} program for <b>the</b> <b>Symbolics</b> Lisp Machine was the ICAD computer-aided engineering system. One {{of the first}} networked multi-player video games, a version of Spacewar, was developed for <b>the</b> <b>Symbolics</b> Lisp Machine in 1983. Electronic CAD software on <b>the</b> <b>Symbolics</b> Lisp Machine was used to develop the first implementation of the Hewlett-Packard Precision Architecture.|$|R

50|$|Some later Lisp {{machines}} (like the TI MicroExplorer, <b>the</b> <b>Symbolics</b> MacIvory or <b>the</b> <b>Symbolics</b> UX400/1200) were {{no longer}} complete workstations, but boards designed to be embedded in host computers: Apple Macintosh II and SUN 3 or 4.|$|R

50|$|Symbolics Document Examiner is a {{powerful}} and early hypertext system developed at Symbolics (a manufacturer of high-end workstations) by Janet Walker in 1985. <b>The</b> <b>Symbolics</b> Document Examiner was first used for a hypertext implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Symbolics</b> manual in <b>the</b> sixth release of the Genera operating system, and was well liked, winning an award from the Society for Technical Documentation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Symbolics</b> manual was an 8,000 page {{document}} that was represented in a 10,000 node [...] "hyperdocument" [...] containing 23,000 links in all. The entire manual required 10 MB of storage space - {{a significant amount}} in 1985, even on <b>the</b> Lisp machines <b>Symbolics</b> sold. <b>The</b> <b>Symbolics</b> Document Examiner used a hierarchical structure, which differed from other experimental hypertext systems; it apparently was partially inspired by an even earlier hypertext system, the precursor to Texinfo which originated with Emacs ...|$|R
5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this {{symbolic}} explosion, and in tandem, was the development of syntactic language that evolved through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse. Syntax would have {{played a key role in}} this process and its full adoption could have been a crucial element of <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> behavioral package in the MSA.|$|E
5|$|Sir David Lindsay {{would have}} been well aware of <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> allusions of the carvings. In {{correspondence}} with his brother, Lord Menmuir, he discusses {{the relationship of the}} planets to the metals, which he had employed Hans Ziegler to search for on his land. Sir David's nephew, David Lindsay, 1st Lord Balcarres, was noted for his interest in alchemy and the Rosicrucians.|$|E
5|$|The East End lies {{east of the}} Roman {{and medieval}} walls of the City of London, and north of the River Thames. Aldgate Pump {{on the edge of}} the City is <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> start of the East End and, on the river, Tower Bridge is also {{sometimes}} also described in these terms.|$|E

50|$|These {{machines}} had hardware {{support for}} various primitive Lisp operations (data type testing, CDR coding) and also hardware support for incremental garbage collection. They ran large Lisp programs very efficiently. <b>The</b> <b>Symbolics</b> machine was competitive against many commercial super minicomputers, but was never adapted for conventional purposes. <b>The</b> <b>Symbolics</b> Lisp Machines were also sold to some non-AI markets like computer graphics, modeling, and animation.|$|R

5|$|After the Morea {{military}} expedition, the Greeks {{only had}} to face the Turkish troops in Central Greece. Livadeia, gateway to Boeotia, was conquered at the beginning of November 1828. A counterattack by Mahmud Pasha from Euboea was repulsed in January 1829. In April, Naupaktos was restored to the Greeks; in May, Augustinos Kapodistrias recaptured <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> town of Messolonghi. However, it took the military victory of Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 and the Treaty of Adrianople before the independence of Greece was recognised.|$|E

He {{denied the}} Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation and following Cornelius Henrici Hoen, he agreed that the bread and wine of the institution signify and do not literally become the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Zwingli's differences of opinion on this with Martin Luther resulted in {{the failure of the}} Marburg Colloquy to bring unity between the two Protestant leaders.|$|E

5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique {{character}} traits. Set is aggressive and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> meaning of the myths {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire, {{the young}} Matilda's court {{included}} knights, chaplains and ladies-in-waiting, although, unlike some queens of the period, {{she did not}} have her own personal chancellor to run her household, instead using the imperial chancellor. When acting as regent in Italy, she found the local rulers were prepared to accept a female ruler. Her Italian administration included the Italian chancellor, backed by experienced administrators. She was not called upon to make any major decisions, instead dealing with smaller matters and acting as <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> representative of her absent husband, meeting with and helping to negotiate with magnates and clergy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break down some of <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning {{of the dangers of}} adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E
50|$|Some Lisp machines, like <b>the</b> <b>Symbolics</b> XL1200, had {{extensive}} graphics abilities using special graphics boards. These machines {{were used in}} domains like medical image processing, 3D animation, and CAD.|$|R

5|$|On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown {{was elected}} to the Senate in a special {{election}} to replace Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters. His victory had become significant because of its effects on the legislative process. The first was psychological: <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of passing a bill.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps each source has {{preserved}} {{a part of}} {{the same}} truth and Sessrúmnir was conceived of as both a ship and an afterlife location in Fólkvangr. 'A ship in a field' is a somewhat unexpected idea, but it is strongly reminiscent of the stone ships in Scandinavian burial sites. 'A ship in the field' in the mythical realm may have been conceived as a reflection of actual burial customs and vice versa. It is possible that <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> ship was thought of as providing some sort of beneficial property to the land, such as good seasons and peace brought on by Freyr’s mound burial in Ynglinga saga.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of anthropology, sociology, and {{feminism}} {{have pointed}} out <b>the</b> <b>symbolic</b> nature of phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority. Towers and other vertical structures may unintentionally or perhaps subconsciously have those connotations. There are many examples of modern architecture that {{can be interpreted as}} phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.|$|E
50|$|Sunstone was a RISC-like {{processor}} {{that was}} to be released shortly after the Ivory. It was designed by Ron Lebel's group at <b>the</b> <b>Symbolics</b> Westwood office. However, the project was canceled the day it was supposed to tape out.|$|R
