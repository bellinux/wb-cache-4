5|$|A 5,000-year-old rock carving at Knowth, Ireland, may {{represent}} the Moon, {{which would be the}} earliest depiction discovered. <b>The</b> <b>contrast</b> between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the Man in the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon, and astrological views of the Moon continue to be propagated today.|$|E
5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates {{more than a third}} of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} {{division of}} the poem occurs, Tolkien writes, at line 1887, after which all the earlier story is summarized, so a complete account of Beowulf's tragedy is given between 1888 and the end, but without {{the account of the}} gloomy court of Heorot, or of <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> between the young Beowulf and the old Hrothgar.|$|E

5|$|Duncan and Fogarty (1984) {{argued that}} the key {{difference}} lies in <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> between the stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia’s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is {{recommended}} to be temporarily discontinued before any radiographic study involving iodinated contrast agents, (such as a contrast-enhanced CT scan or angiogram), as <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> dye may temporarily impair kidney function, indirectly leading to lactic acidosis by causing retention of metformin in the body. Metformin can be resumed after two days, assuming kidney function is normal.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog which occurs most often {{in the spring and}} early summer because of <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> between sea and air temperatures.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>contrast</b> {{between the}} Terran {{relationship}} to the planet and the Athshean one is the major example of a larger dialectical structure within the novel, a comparison of opposites. Throughout, the Athsheans are shown as living in balance with their world, while the Terrans despoil it. The Athsheans are shown as a gentle people, in contrast the violence and aggression of the Terrans.|$|E

5|$|The most noted of Bauer's {{pictures}} are his watercolors, the technique he used when illustrating for books and magazines; he alternated between aquarelle and gouache. When he created illustrations the two mediums were sometimes mixed, since he needed both {{the speed of}} the aquarelle and <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> and impasto that the gouache provided. These water-soluble, and fast drying, media allowed Bauer to work on his pictures until the last minute before deadline, something he was prone to do.|$|E

5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of +0.08, Capella is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest star {{visible to the naked eye}} from the latitude 40° N. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white color, although the yellow color is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> against the blue sky.|$|E

40|$|Models for {{the origin}} of <b>the</b> <b>contrasts</b> in <b>the</b> {{ultraviolet}} images of Venus are examined {{in an attempt to}} determine the physical differences between light and dark regions fundamental to a clear understanding of the apparent cloud motions. To evaluate the meaning of the wavelength dependence of <b>the</b> <b>contrasts,</b> an improved determination of the spherical albedo curve for Venus in the 0. 225 - 1. 06 micron range is made by fitting appropriate theoretical models to the observations of monochromatic magnitudes as a function of phase angle. It is shown that, because of differences between the spectral dependences of spherical albedo and contrasts, at least one major absorber other than the one causing <b>the</b> <b>contrasts</b> is almost certainly required. Several classes of models are compatible with present observational evidence. <b>The</b> <b>contrasts</b> and <b>the</b> absorption associated with them may in fact be occurring below, within or above the main visible cloud layer, and thus an unambiguous interpretation of the apparent cloud motions is not possible...|$|R

5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retirement}} from the Yorkshire team, Leyland returned {{to play for}} Harrogate until 1950, when he became chief coach, along with Arthur Mitchell, at Yorkshire. Mitchell was a dour, serious man but <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> with the cheerier Leyland made an effective partnership. Leyland {{also served as a}} representative of the paper manufacturers Thomas Owen. In 1949, he was among the first group of former professional cricketers to be awarded honorary membership of the MCC. He continued as a respected coach of Yorkshire until illness forced {{his retirement}} in 1963. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, he maintained some connections with Yorkshire cricket and always tried to attend matches played at Harrogate. In recognition of his achievements, the Harrogate grounds erected new gates which were named in his honour. Leyland died in a hospital at Knaresborough on 1 January 1967.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2001, Denise Sigogneau-Russell {{and colleagues}} in their {{description}} of the earliest Laurasian tribosphenic mammal, Tribactonodon, agreed with the relationship between Ausktribosphenos and monotremes, but argued that Ambondro was closer to Laurasian tribosphenidans than to Ausktribosphenos and monotremes. As evidence against the integrity of Australosphenida, they cited the presence of lingual cingula in various non-australosphenidan mammals; the presence of two cusps in the anterior cingulum in Ambondro {{as well as some}} boreosphenidans; the different appearance of the premolar in Ambondro (flat) and Ausktribosphenos (squared); and <b>the</b> <b>contrast</b> between the talonids of Ambondro (with a well-developed hypoconid on the labial side) and Ausktribosphenos (squared).|$|E
