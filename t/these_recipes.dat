5|$|The menu at the White House Passover Seder {{featured}} traditional American Jewish Passover cuisine such as gefilte fish, charoset, {{chicken soup}} with matzah balls, brisket, potato kugel, and macaroons. Salads and vegetable side dishes completed the menu. Lesser brought handmade shmurah matzah from the Chabad-Lubavitch center in Springfield, Massachusetts. Family recipes were emphasized: in 2015, <b>these</b> <b>recipes</b> included matzo ball soup from Ziskend's grandmother, carrot soufflé from Lesser's mother, and Raspberry Ganache Marjolaine from Chaudhary's mother. Recipes covered foods {{from both the}} Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. The food was not strictly kosher, but kosher style. In 2014, the White House Passover Seder began inviting a guest chef to coordinate the menu with the White House executive chef.|$|E
25|$|Technology – The dawn of Western alchemy is {{sometimes}} {{associated with that}} of metallurgy, extending back to 3500. Many writings were lost when the emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (292). Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus X. Dating from 300–500, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver. These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of Bolus of Mendes (or Pseudo-Democritus), which aligned <b>these</b> <b>recipes</b> with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements. Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition {{has been}} seen in cats fed home-made or vegetarian/vegan diets {{produced}} by owners with good intentions, and most published recipes have been only crudely balanced (by computer) using nutrient averages. Because the palatability, digestibility, and safety of <b>these</b> <b>recipes</b> have not been adequately or scientifically tested, {{it is difficult to}} characterize all of these homemade diets. Generally, most formulations contain excessive protein and phosphorus and are deficient in calcium, vitamin E, and microminerals such as copper, zinc, and potassium. Also, the energy density of these diets may be unbalanced relative to the other nutrients. Commonly used meat and carbohydrate ingredients contain more phosphorus than calcium. Homemade feline diets that are not actually deficient in fat or energy usually contain a vegetable oil that cats do not find palatable; therefore, less food is eaten causing a calorie deficiency. Rarely are homemade diets balanced for microminerals or vitamins. Owner neglect is also a frequent contributing factor in malnutrition.|$|E

500|$|Studies on the non-vascular flora {{recorded}} {{the presence of}} about 150 moss species {{in the area of}} the national park, including one newly described taxon. Many herbs of the Vikos Gorge and other areas within the park were regarded to have medicinal properties and were once harvested by local healers, colloquially referred to as [...] "Vikos doctors" [...] ( [...] , [...] "Vikoiatri"). These herbal healers used special recipes that were often copies of ancient Greek recipes of Hippocrates or Dioscorides and became famous beyond the borders of Greece. The plants used in <b>these</b> <b>recipes</b> include the lemon balm Melissa officinalis, Tilia tomentosa, the spearmint Mentha spicata, the gas-plant Dictamnus albus, St John’s Wort Hypericum perforatum, [...] absinth Artemisia absinthium, the very popular Sideritis raeseri, known colloquially in Greece as “mountain tea”, and the elder bush Sambucus nigra. A chemical screening of these native plant species has shown that a high number of them are characterized by biologically active ingredients. A collection of 2,500 dried species of local plants and herbs is exhibited in the local natural history museum in the village of Koukouli.|$|E

2500|$|Whipped cream, often {{sweetened}} and aromatised, {{was popular}} in the 16th century, with recipes {{in the writings of}} Cristoforo di Messisbugo (Ferrara, 1549), Bartolomeo Scappi (Rome, 1570), and Lancelot de Casteau (Liège, 1604). It was called milk snow (neve di latte, neige de lait). [...] A 1545 English recipe, [...] "A Dyschefull of Snow", includes whipped egg whites as well, and is flavored with rosewater and sugar. [...] (cf. snow cream) In <b>these</b> <b>recipes,</b> and {{until the end of the}} 19th century, naturally separated cream is whipped, typically with willow or rush branches, and the resulting foam on the surface would from time to time be skimmed off and drained, a process taking an hour or more. By the end of the 19th century, centrifuge-separated, high-fat cream made it much faster and easier to make whipped cream.|$|E

30|$|The 13 Klosterneuburg texts do not {{correlate}} with the critical edition of Mappæ [29], because the latter concerns the Latin {{translation of the}} old alchemical nucleus only. Moreover, unlike Ganzenmüller, we found concordances with the 13 text units absent in the Lucca 490 manuscript with the Sélestat and four other fundamental manuscripts that were unknown as possible witnesses at Ganzenmüller’s time. 8 Finally, specific lexical terms used by <b>these</b> 13 <b>recipes</b> refer to the same lexicon of other sections of the Lucca 490 manuscript and of the Compositiones Lucenses tradition, as is exemplified by the terms pandius, cianus, lulacin, ficarin, cinnabarin, iarin, etc. These, on the contrary, are completely absent in the Mappæ Clavicula critical edition. Consequentially, one should consider <b>these</b> 13 <b>recipes</b> likely candidates for the Compositiones Lucenses tradition.|$|R
2500|$|By a Promethean recipe of {{the third}} kind, Georgescu understands a solar {{collector}} returning a net energy output sufficiently large to supply all the energy input needed to manufacture an additional solar collector of the same kind, thereby constituting a full serial reproduction with regard to solar energy only. The fact that solar collectors of various kinds had been in operation on a substantial scale {{for more than a}} century without providing a breakthrough in energy efficiency brought Georgescu to the conclusion that no Promethean recipe was yet around in the world in his day. Only feasible recipes for solar collectors were available, functioning like what he labelled 'parasites' with regard to the terrestrial inputs of energy for their manufacture and operation — and like any other parasite, <b>these</b> <b>recipes</b> cannot survive their host (the 'host' being the sources of the terrestrial inputs). Georgescu believed that for a worldwide solar-powered economy to be truly energy self-supporting, a Promethean kind of solar collector had yet to be invented. [...] Later, some scholars have argued that the efficiency of solar collectors has increased considerably since Georgescu made these assessments.|$|E

40|$|Anthocyanins are {{colorants}} {{which provide}} {{most of the}} blue, red and violet colours in numerous plants and fruits. Because of their great sensitivity to the slightest changes in pH and their instability in ordinary daylight, it is generally thought that these colorants were used only to dye everyday clothes in a domestic context. However, medieval artists’ recipe books not only describe these elusive substances, but also indicate their use in illumination. This is notably {{the case for the}} texts of the so-called ‘Strasbourg Tradition’, written in the south of Germany and the north of France between 1400 and 1560, and partly composed from an older Alsatian treatise on illumination. Departing from these sources, this paper details the methods employed to prepare these colorants and (re) evaluates their diverse uses in painting and illuminating techniques. This technical data subsequently served as a basis upon which to make reconstructions.
