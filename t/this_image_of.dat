5|$|The Saguna meditation, that is {{qualified}} and with attributes, {{is for those}} who need a concrete symbol such as a Murti, or a visualization aid. They should think of the identity of their lotus heart having eight petals with the highest self visualized as Vasudeva, Narayana or Purushottama. The meditation should concentrate on one's own identity with <b>this</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> imperishable highest self. This is {{the path to the}} state of Vaishvanara, or qualified Dhyana.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the force}} became {{the topic of}} many radio {{broadcasts}} and films. Radio series such as the Renfrew of the Mounted and Challenge of the Yukon continued the portrayal of the mounted police as iconic heroes, Challenge later translating onto television in the 1950s as Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. Over 250 films were made about the force in the 20th century, including the highly successful 1936 musical Rose Marie. The popularity of these films finally waned in the 1970s, although <b>this</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the force continued to influence late-20th century television portrayals of the modern Royal Canadian Mounted Police, such as the series Due South which centred on a mounted police constable from the Yukon.|$|E

5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have <b>this</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or transsexual. He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. <b>This</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Shenzong died in 1085, {{an abrupt}} death {{since he was}} in his mid 30s. His {{successor}} Emperor Zhezong of Song was only ten years old when he ascended to the throne, so his powerful grandmother served as regent over him. She disliked Wang's reforms from the beginning, and sought to appoint more Conservative officials at court who would agree to oppose the Reformists. Her greatest political ally was Sima Guang (1019–1086), who was made the next Chancellor. Undoing what Wang had implemented, Sima dismissed the New Policies, and forced the same treatment upon Reformers that Wang had earlier meted out to his opponents: dismissal to lower or frontier posts of governance, or even exile. However, there was still mounted opposition to Sima Guang, as many had favored some of the New Policies, including the substitution of tax instead of forced labor service to the state. Sure enough, when Emperor Zhezong's grandmother died in 1093, Zhezong was quick to sponsor the Reformists like his predecessor Shenzong had done. The Conservatives once more were ousted from political dominance at court. When Zhezong suddenly died in his twenties, his younger brother Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100–1125) succeeded him, and also supported the Reformers at court. Huizong banned the writing of Sima Guang and his lackeys while elevating Wang Anshi to near revered status, having a statue of Wang erected in a Confucian temple alongside a statue of Mencius. To further <b>this</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Wang as a great and honorable statesman, printed and painted pictures of him were circulated throughout the country. Yet this cycle of revenge and partisanship continued after Zhezong and Huizong, as Reformers and Conservatives continued their infighting. Huizong's successor, Emperor Gaozong of Song, abolished once more the New Policies, and favored ministers of the Conservative faction at court.|$|E

25|$|These {{dates are}} {{allegedly}} the king's birthday and coronation day, respectively. There is no direct {{evidence to support}} this. It is logical to assume, however, that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the pharaoh's rule. In fact, according to calculations {{made on the basis}} of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22. <b>This</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramesses the Great could take his place next to Amun Ra and Ra-Horakhty.|$|E
25|$|Though it did {{represent}} {{a complex and}} gradual change in the shopping and self-presentation habits of both men and women, the idea of metrosexuality was often distilled in the media down to a few men and a short checklist of vanities, like skin care products, scented candles and costly, colorful dress shirts and pricey designer jeans. It was <b>this</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the metrosexual—that of a straight young man who got pedicures and facials, practiced aromatherapy and spent freely on clothes—that contributed to a backlash against the term from men who merely wanted to feel free to take more care with their appearance than had been the norm in the 1990s, when companies abandoned dress codes, Dockers khakis became a popular brand, and XL, or extra-large, became the one size that fit all.|$|E

25|$|Yashovijaya {{left behind}} a vast body of {{literature}} that exerted a vast influence on the Jain philosophy. After Acarya Haribhadra and Acarya Hemacandra, Upadhyaya Yashovijaya is the most high-profile Jain monk. Dundas notes that Yashovijaya enjoys a near talismanic figure for the contemporary Svetambara monastic community and is identified with madhyastha or principle of neutrality. Dundas further notes that Yashovijaya paints a superior picture of Jainism with his inclusivism and it is <b>this</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Jainism {{that has become a}} dominant one today. He had an influence on Srimad Rajcandra’s book Atmasiddhi wherein, he has provided six fundamental truths on soul and liberation following Yashovijaya's Adhyatmasara. A college called Jain Yashovijaya Pathashala has been established in Varanasi in his memory, under auspices of which the sacred Jain texts are being published in a series called Jain Yashovijaya Granthamala. The Jain community of Ahmedabad has honoured him by naming one block as Yashovijaya Chowk at the Relief Road end of Ratanpol where Yashovijaya lived for many years.|$|E
25|$|According {{to ancient}} {{tradition}} among Greek historians, the Phrygians anciently migrated to Anatolia from the Balkans. Herodotus {{says that the}} Phrygians were called Bryges when they lived in Europe. He and other Greek writers also recorded legends about King Midas that associated him with or put his origin in Macedonia; Herodotus, for example, says a wild rose garden in Macedonia was named after Midas. Some classical writers also connected the Phrygians with the Mygdones, the name of two groups of people, one of which lived in northern Macedonia and another in Mysia. Likewise, the Phrygians have been identified with the Bebryces, a people said to have warred with Mysia before the Trojan War and who had a king named Mygdon {{at roughly the same}} time as the Phrygians were said to have had a king named Mygdon. The classical historian Strabo groups Phrygians, Mygdones, Mysians, Bebryces and Bithynians together as peoples that migrated to Anatolia from the Balkans. <b>This</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> Phrygians as part of a related group of northwest Anatolian cultures seems the most likely explanation for the confusion over whether Phrygians, Bebryces and Anatolian Mygdones were or were not the same people.|$|E

500|$|Dunn {{then moved}} {{onto the scene}} during the funeral, when the child trembled from seeing her mother's lips sewn shut.

The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair, that she remembered that her mother's lips looked funny in the funeral.

500|$|On {{viewing the}} {{original}} studio rushes for the 20th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again, John Lloyd recalls that originally {{the final scene}} was [...] "all very embarrassing", as the actors only had [...] to run before they reached the barbed wire {{in front of the}} camera, where they had to pretend to die, an effect described by Atkinson as [...] "somewhat unconvincing". It was only in post-production that the final effect was achieved by running the video and audio in slow motion and fading another video of the empty set over the top to make it appear as if the characters had disappeared. <b>This</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> a barren landscape was then faded into a still image of a poppy field found in the BBC Picture Library.|$|E
