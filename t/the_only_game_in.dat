5|$|Though {{the game}} {{involved}} two Canadian teams, the NHL {{hoped that the}} event would prove a successful draw in the U.S. To that end, the league scheduled the Heritage Classic as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> prime time, while NBC debuted its Hockey Day in America {{with a pair of}} regional doubleheaders that led into the telecast; throughout NBC's telecast, commercials advised viewers to change to Versus for the Heritage Classic once the American games finished. University of Alberta sports economist Brad Humphreys questioned the league's ambitions, arguing that a game without an American team would not appeal. He stated that the game was being held to placate the Canadian audience, but noted that it was important for the NHL to keep the league's Canadian audience happy.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime was a {{collaboration}} between Retro Studios and Nintendo EAD and R. The overall design was a collaborative effort, while the art and engineering was done entirely at Retro, and the music was handled in Japan. Retro Studios was created in 1998 by an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg. The studio would create games for the forthcoming GameCube targeted at a mature demographic. After establishing its offices in Austin, Texas in 1999, Retro worked on four GameCube projects. When Miyamoto visited Retro in 2000, he suggested a new Metroid game after seeing the prototype of a first-person shooter engine they had created. In 2000 and early 2001, three games in development at Retro were canceled, and in July 2001, an RPG, Raven Blade, was terminated, leaving Prime <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> development. During the last nine months of development, Retro's staff worked 80- to 100-hour weeks to reach the deadline imposed by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|The National Championship Game against Stanford was a {{completely}} different story. UConn started the game with its worst first half in school history by scoring only 12 points; only eleven teams in tournament history have been held to 12 points or less in the first half: {{three of them were}} against UConn teams, and two of them (Southern and Temple) just days earlier in the 2010 Tournament. Stanford itself only managed to score 20 points in the first half. Maya Moore gave UConn the lead (23–22) in the second half with a three-pointer and led the team on a scoring run of 30–6 that eventually secured the national championship with a final score of 53–47. It was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> the Huskies' 78-game winning streak that was won by fewer than 10 points. Moore was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player, to go along with her second straight Wade Trophy award and Academic All-America of the Year award. Charles, who won the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year awards, was chosen first overall in the WNBA draft days later.|$|E

5|$|The 15th {{edition of}} the Belk Bowl was played in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday, December 29, 2016. This was the 24th {{consecutive}} bowl game for Virginia Tech and Justin Fuente's first bowl game as {{head coach of the}} Hokies football team. This was the first time ever these two teams played each other. The first and second halves were totally different in terms of how each team did. Virginia Tech was losing 24-0 at halftime but turned the game around in the second half aided by 3 interceptions and six sacks, and won 24-35. This resulted in a season record of 10-4 and was the first time a Hokie football coach won 10 games in his first season and the first Hokie 10-win season since 2011. This {{was the first time the}} Hokies won 3 straight bowl games. Only one of the 5 Hokie touchdowns was not the result of an Arkansas turnover. This was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> the college football 2016 in which a team trailing by 24 or more points ended up winning the game. There was a very confusing ruling in the second quarter that took the officials about 12 minutes to sort out. Arkansas punted and the Hokies muffed it. Arkansas touched the ball and the Hokies recovered. But there was also an inadvertent whistle blown. Officials disagree on what the ruling should have been. The game officials gave the ball back to Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|As in {{the case}} of all Soul {{character}}s, Taki's character creation started with her weapon. During the early development of Soul Edge, Taki was conceived as a Yoshimitsu-like ninja character, armed with a long sword and wearing a loose outfit and large helmet covering her upper face. She underwent several major design changes before the game's release, evolving into an athletic, iron-masked, buxom woman with a chest size of 90cm/E (Soulcalibur IV measurements; her breasts have noticeably grew through the series), clad in a partially armored catsuit. Taki used variations of this outfit throughout the series; by default her primary costumes were colored crimson or navy blue. A cloth mask returns with Taki's primary costume in Soulcalibur, which is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>game</b> <b>in</b> which her breasts are partially exposed. Taki has a demon-themed menpo iron mask with her blue-colored main costume in Soulcalibur III and a similar red costume is featured in Legends. Other demonic motifs have appeared on her armor since Soulcalibur.|$|E
