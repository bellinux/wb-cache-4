6000|$|With {{respect to}} learning, [...] "the Curriculum," [...] as Mr. Veal loved to call it, was of prodigious extent, {{and the young}} gentlemen in Hart Street might learn a {{something}} of every known science. The Rev. Mr. Veal had an orrery, an electrifying machine, a <b>turning</b> <b>lathe,</b> a theatre (in the wash-house), a chemical apparatus, and {{what he called a}} select library of all the works of the best authors of ancient and modern times and languages. He took the boys to the British Museum and descanted upon the antiquities and the specimens of natural history there, so that audiences would gather round him as he spoke, and all Bloomsbury highly admired him as a prodigiously well-informed man. And whenever he spoke (which he did almost always), he took care to produce the very finest and longest words of which the vocabulary gave him the use, rightly judging that it was as cheap to employ a handsome, large, and sonorous epithet, as to use a little stingy one.|$|E
60|$|Drawing nearer, I discern {{that these}} are not mangles, but {{intricate}} machines, set with knives and saws and planes, which cut smooth and straight here, and slantwise there, and now cut such a depth, and now miss cutting altogether, according to the predestined requirements of the pieces of wood that are pushed on below them: each of which pieces is to be an oar, and is roughly adapted to that purpose before it takes its final leave of far-off forests, and sails for England. Likewise I discern that the butterflies are not true butterflies, but wooden shavings, which, being spirted up from the wood by the violence of the machinery, and kept in rapid and not equal movement by the impulse of its rotation on the air, flutter and play, and rise and fall, and conduct themselves as like butterflies as heart could wish. Suddenly the noise and motion cease, and the butterflies drop dead. An oar has been made since I came in, wanting the shaped handle. As quickly as I can follow it with my eye and thought, the same oar is carried to a <b>turning</b> <b>lathe.</b> A whirl and a Nick! Handle made. Oar finished.|$|E
60|$|The room bore no sort of {{resemblance}} to a boudoir. A faded old turkey carpet was {{spread on the}} floor. The common mahogany table had no covering; the chintz on the chairs was of a truly venerable age. Some of the furniture made the place look like a room occupied by a man. Dumb-bells and clubs of the sort used in athletic exercises hung over the bare mantelpiece; a large ugly oaken structure with closed doors, something between a cabinet and a wardrobe, rose on {{one side to the}} ceiling; a <b>turning</b> <b>lathe</b> stood against the opposite wall. Above the lathe were hung in a row four prints, in dingy old frames of black wood, which especially attracted the attention of Amelius. Mostly foreign prints, they were all discoloured by time, and they all strangely represented different aspects of the same subject--infants parted from their parents by desertion or robbery. The young Moses was there, in his ark of bulrushes, on the river bank. Good St. Francis appeared next, roaming the streets, and rescuing forsaken children in the wintry night. A third print showed the foundling hospital of old Paris, with the turning cage in the wall, and the bell to ring when the infant was placed in it. The next and last subject was the stealing of a child from the lap of its slumbering nurse by a gipsy woman. These sadly suggestive subjects were the only ornaments on the walls. No traces of books or music were visible; no needlework of any sort was to be seen; no elegant trifles; no china or flowers or delicate lacework or sparkling jewelry--nothing, absolutely nothing, suggestive of a woman's presence appeared in any part of Mrs. Farnaby's room.|$|E

6000|$|The youth {{went too}} on his way, {{and began to}} murmur to himself: [...] "Oh! if I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!" [...] A carrier who was walking behind him heard these words, and asked him: [...] "Who are you" [...] "I don't know," [...] said the youth. [...] "Where do you hail from?" [...] "I don't know." [...] "Who's your father?" [...] "I mayn't say." [...] "What are you {{constantly}} muttering to yourself?" [...] "Oh!" [...] said the youth, [...] "I would give worlds to shudder, {{but no one can}} teach me." [...] "Stuff and nonsense!" [...] spoke the carrier; [...] "come along with me, and I'll soon put that right." [...] The youth went with the carrier, and in the evening they reached an inn, where they were to spend the night. Then, just as he was entering the room, he said again, quite aloud: [...] "Oh! if I could only shudder! if I could only shudder!" [...] The landlord, who heard this, laughed and said: [...] "If that's what you're sighing for, you shall be given every opportunity here." [...] "Oh! hold your tongue!" [...] said the landlord's wife; [...] "so many people have paid for their curiosity with their lives, it were a thousand pities if those beautiful eyes were never again to behold daylight." [...] But the youth said: [...] "No matter how difficult, I insist on learning it; why, that's what I've set out to do." [...] He left the landlord no peace till he told him that in the neighborhood stood a haunted castle, where one could easily learn to shudder if one only kept watch in it for three nights. The King had promised the man who dared to do this thing his daughter as wife, and she was the most beautiful maiden under the sun. There was also much treasure hid in the castle, guarded by evil spirits, which would then be free, and was sufficient to make a poor man more than rich. Many had already gone in, but so far none had ever come out again. So the youth went to the King and spoke: [...] "If I were allowed, I should much like to watch for three nights in the castle." [...] The King looked at him, and because he pleased him, he said: [...] "You can ask for three things, none of them living, and those you may take with you into the castle." [...] Then he answered: [...] "Well, I shall beg for a fire, a <b>turning</b> <b>lathe,</b> and a carving bench with the knife attached." ...|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} day the King had everything put into the castle; and when night drew on the youth took up his position there, lit a bright fire {{in one of the}} rooms, placed the carving bench with the knife close to it, and sat himself down on the <b>turning</b> <b>lathe.</b> [...] "Oh! if I could only shudder!" [...] he said: [...] "but I sha'n't learn it here either." [...] Toward midnight he wanted to make up the fire, and as he was blowing up a blaze he heard a shriek from a corner. [...] "Ou, miou! how cold we are!" [...] "You fools!" [...] he cried; [...] "why do you scream? If you are cold, come and sit at the fire and warm yourselves." [...] And as he spoke two huge black cats sprang fiercely forward and sat down, one on each side of him, and gazed wildly at him with their fiery eyes. After a time, when they had warmed themselves, they said: [...] "Friend, shall we play a little game of cards?" [...] "Why not?" [...] he replied; [...] "but first let me see your paws." [...] Then they stretched out their claws. [...] "Ha!" [...] said he; [...] "what long nails you've got! Wait a minute: I must first cut them off." [...] Thereupon he seized them by the scruff of their necks, lifted them on to the carving bench, and screwed down their paws firmly. [...] "After watching you narrowly," [...] said he, [...] "I no longer feel any desire to play cards with you"; and with these words he struck them dead and threw them out into the water. But when he had thus sent the two of them to their final rest, and was again about to sit down at the fire, out of every nook and corner came forth black cats and black dogs with fiery chains in such swarms that he couldn't possibly get away from them. They yelled in the most ghastly manner, jumped upon his fire, scattered it all, and tried to put it out. He looked on quietly for a time, but when it got beyond a joke he seized his carving-knife and called out: [...] "Be off, you rabble rout!" [...] and let fly at them. Some of them fled away, and the others he struck dead and threw them out into the pond below. When he returned he blew up the sparks of the fire once more, and warmed himself. And as he sat thus his eyes refused to keep open any longer, and a desire to sleep stole over him. Then he looked around him and beheld in the corner a large bed. [...] "The very thing," [...] he said, and laid himself down in it. But when he wished to close his eyes the bed began to move by itself, and ran all round the castle. [...] "Capital," [...] he said, [...] "only a little quicker." [...] Then the bed sped on as if drawn by six horses, over thresholds and stairs, up this way and down that. All of a sudden--crash, crash! with a bound it turned over, upside down, and lay like a mountain on the top of him. But he tossed the blankets and pillows in the air, emerged from underneath, and said: [...] "Now anyone who has the fancy for it may go a drive," [...] lay down at his fire, and slept till daylight. In the morning the King came, and when he beheld him lying on the ground he imagined the ghosts had been too much for him, and that he was dead. Then he said: [...] "What a pity! and such a fine fellow he was." [...] The youth heard this, got up, and said: [...] "It's not come to that yet." [...] Then the King was astonished, but very glad, and asked how it had fared with him. [...] "First-rate," [...] he answered; [...] "and now I've survived the one night, I shall get through the other two also." [...] The landlord, when he went to him, opened his eyes wide, and said: [...] "Well, I never thought to see you alive again. Have you learned now what shuddering is?" [...] "No," [...] he replied, [...] "it's quite hopeless; if someone could only tell me how to!" ...|$|E
