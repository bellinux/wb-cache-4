Alice Wyllie of The Scotsman and David Balls of Digital Spy called the song radio-friendly, while the latter described it as [...] "more comfortably more Sugababes-sounding" [...] than the group's previous two singles, [...] "Get Sexy" [...] and [...] "About a Girl". Balls praised the hook as one that [...] "lodges in your brain like shrapnel". A writer from Daily Record shared a similar opinion, writing: [...] "The big chanted hook won't go away once it's in your head". Andy Gill of The Independent regarded [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] {{as one of the}} album's better tracks and noted that it practices [...] "a craven form of extreme self-objectification". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian noted that while the album was significantly Americanised, [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] had [...] "escaped with some quirky Britishness intact". Khaleej Times wrote that the song proves the Sugababes are [...] "feisty and seductive as ever" [...] and elaborated, [...] "the cut-glass industrialism of the backing track belies the dedication of the trio to the permanent <b>touchpoints</b> of pop music".|$|E
5000|$|When a {{consumer}} enters a store {{they intend to}} convert their pre-existing intentions into purchases. These pre-existing intentions are formed through pre-purchase experience <b>touchpoints.</b> These <b>touchpoints</b> include advertising, promotions, social media, word of mouth among others which allow consumers {{to interact with the}} brand before entering the store. However, the store itself also contains in-store communications which have the ability to introduce new brands to the consumer and influence spontaneous purchases.

50|$|With often over {{a hundred}} <b>touchpoints</b> {{identifiable}} within larger companies, the key question is: Which of these are relevant for the company’s success? Analysis and assessment is undertaken on the nature and impact (for example, on brand management) of specific <b>touchpoints.</b> The <b>touchpoints</b> which are relevant for a company’s success will vary by multiple factors including industry, product, service, target segment, etc.|$|E
50|$|Post-purchase {{experience}} <b>touchpoints</b> {{are used}} after {{the sale of}} the brand, the product, and or service, and to enhance customer experience with the brand. Post-purchase <b>touchpoints</b> can include loyalty programs, customer satisfaction surveys, warranty and rebate activities, regular maintenance, and reminders about the brand’s innovations on its products or services. Even though these <b>touchpoints</b> offer brand-development opportunities, and the chance for businesses to enhance sustainable and profitable growth, they are ignored at most times. Post-purchase experience <b>touchpoints</b> aim to deliver the brand promise, to satisfy or exceed customer performance and usage expectations, and to build brand loyalty and advocacy towards the brand.|$|E
50|$|Much {{like the}} {{unexpected}} <b>touchpoints,</b> customer-initiated <b>touchpoints</b> are a communication between customer and brand directly, without purchase. Unlike other <b>touchpoints,</b> these customer-initiated <b>touchpoints</b> are created solely by customers relaying the experiences {{they received from}} the brand/company directly back to the brand/company. Again, these are particularly difficult to control directly yet can be managed effectively and can portray a positive message to customers through actions such as a help desk or suggestions line. These touch points, created by customers and transferred directly to companies/brands are effective ways of keeping in communication with customers even after they have finished their purchasing, evolving a brand and growing a customer base.|$|E

50|$|In its {{commercial}} context, experience design {{is driven by}} consideration of the moments of engagement, or <b>touchpoints,</b> between people and brands, and the ideas, emotions, and memories that these moments create.

Moreover, it collects recommendations received and given (word-of-mouth). The result: all <b>touchpoints</b> are in one [...] "currency".|$|E

50|$|Sales: Within {{business}} to consumer companies sales are the transaction <b>touchpoint</b> where {{a business and}} consumer both agree on a terms of trade. Consumers can be retained if this <b>touchpoint</b> is managed well {{and the experience of}} the customers’ transaction was pleasant (Bhattacherjee, 2001). For example, if a customer is satisfied with a service from a Coke-a-cola outlet they may return rather than switch to a Pepsi outlet. This brand rivalry can be beneficial for consumers as it encourages brands to provide the best service or product available.|$|R

50|$|<b>Touchpoints</b> {{are always}} {{evolving}} as the tastes and preferences of consumers are constantly changing and {{adapting to the}} technology and resources that are available. The traditional <b>touchpoints</b> {{that would have been}} relevant and effective even just 10 years ago could be greatly ineffective for marketing now - present day in 2016. The same as vital <b>touchpoints</b> marketers use now may have not existed a decade ago like all of the social media websites and apps. Traditional <b>touchpoints</b> began with radio, newspaper and television but now some of the most common <b>touchpoints</b> used in celebrity branding largely are through social media e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr and various other social media webpages. Now with the forever changing technology, people are ditching old <b>touchpoints</b> for newer and faster ones leading sources like newspapers to get printed less and less every year and TV marketing to be less effective as people now can skip past advertisements missing the endorsement and the message it was trying to convey. These new <b>touchpoints</b> are quicker, highly accessible and easy to use for the modern day person with their portable smartphone or computer - this has created celebrity endorsements to be incredibly popular on these sites through the celebrity posting a picture or status advertising the business and their products on their personal accounts. These social media sites give celebrity branding a significant boost and immense opportunities with millions of millions of accounts, creating an audience which is virtually endless.

50|$|Moreover, {{emphasizing}} {{the fact that}} <b>touchpoints</b> are any point in which the brand communicates with the consumer, the post-purchase stage of the decision making process is where the retention of consumers becomes vital. In saying this, examples of post-purchase <b>touchpoints</b> are, customer satisfaction surveys, product warranties, post-purchase customer service and support, loyalty programs and even billing processes. All such <b>touchpoints</b> enable brands or companies to retain customers and nurture the relationship between consumer and brand. These <b>touchpoints</b> also provide brands {{with a sense of}} being able to control the post-purchase element of a consumer’s decision making process in a more effective manner. This is done in the hope that customers can relate to the brand on a positive level. To further highlight the importance of the post-purchase <b>touchpoints,</b> {{there is a need for}} brands to be readily available to and accessible by customers in order for them to remain trusting of the brand, rather than being perceived by the customer as a quick opportunity to make a sale with no post-purchase care.|$|E
50|$|The {{customers}} derive <b>touchpoint</b> {{value from}} the capabilities offered, {{such as a}} great website {{making it easier to}} find product information, making their life easier or helping to facilitate decision-making. For business owners, value comes from information about customer preferences and the ability to use this knowledge to lock in customers. Today, early adopting consumers will immediately try anything if it looks as though it will improve their lives. The incorporation of Apps with GPS locations that can now display popular restaurants nearby and connect details of products and pricing, also offering consumer opinions and comments, enable consumers to select their destination and products based on brand and customer experience. The development of new <b>touchpoint</b> opportunities is hugely accelerated by new technology such as, augmented reality (AR), near field communications, IPTV and sixth sense technology. The challenge for businesses is to keep up to date, engaged, understand, make choices and respond to the <b>touchpoint</b> opportunities evolving. (Westernberg, E. 2010).|$|R

They use social media to listen, to engage, to offer services and to interact through platforms that enhance the brand and customer experience, to keep them coming back.
