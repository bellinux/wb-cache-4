50|$|The {{municipal}} amalgamation was {{controversial and}} unpopular, {{especially in the}} suburban municipalities. Virtually all of the municipal councils had only nominal authority over their own affairs throughout the year, as much of their power {{was transferred to the}} appointed transition board — consisting of Jim Ashcroft, Ron MacDonald, George Lund, Jim Griffin, Maurice Lamoureux, Gaetan Doucet and Terry Lee — which was overseeing the amalgamation. For example, Valley East's city council attempted in June to reduce its property taxes due to a budget surplus, but was overruled by the board as the council had lost its authority to adjust taxes during the transition period. The transition board also had sole authority over issues such as staffing decisions, user fees for municipal services, the possible closure of some public library branches, the structure and status of Greater Sudbury Utilities, and the new city's organizational structure, budget and <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>rates</b> for 2001. Its operations throughout the year were frequently criticized as secretive and undemocratic, with some critics, including the Canadian Union of Public Employees, alleging that the board was preparing a sweeping privatization plan. Lamoureux, a former mayor of the preamalgamation city of Sudbury, also faced some controversy when he resigned from the transition board to register as a candidate for city council.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to test certain {{assumptions}} concerning the relationship between the achieved educational level of adults and certain educational and financial factors in the 206 communities of Illinois. Information sources for this study include: 16 th Census of the United States, Property <b>Tax</b> <b>Assessments,</b> Levies, <b>Rates,</b> and Extensions: 1940, Superintendent of Public Instruction, State of Illinois. From the 1940 Census the total number of adults (both male and female), aged 25 years and over, of the 206 communities of Illinois. From the data the median age was determined. The total population and the median educational level of each community was obtained from the 1940 Census. The assessed valuation of each community was obtained from the Illinois State Tax Commission Report. The per capita wealth of each community was obtained by dividing the assessed valuation by the total population of the community. The per capita expenditure for schools was obtained by dividing the communities’ current school expenses by the total population of the community. The relationships between the various factors were determined by the tetachoric method of correlation. Several conclusions were made from this study among them it was determined that enough of a relationship exists between per capita expenditure for education and adult educational level in Illinois to warrant further study.

40|$|The {{subject-matter}} of the considerations is {{the construction}} of a value added tax. The author comments on the issues of the <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> basis, <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> and the methods of calculating the said tax. Special attention was focused on the concept and range of the <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> basis since it makes it possible to show the consequences of that tax. The author presents economic, fiscal and social effects of a value added tax. The considerations are illustrated by examples taken from the tax legislation of the EEC countries among which only Greece does not provide for a value added tax. The author refers to postulates of introducing the said tax in Poland. He claims that at present the economic and financial situation in Poland is not mature enough to introduce a value added tax. Therefore he declares first for eliminating the dualism in taxing the turnover and for introducing one tax instead of two taxes applied at present. The turnover tax which is actually under preparation should be a multiple tax with the traits of a value added tax. It would facilitate a gradual transformation of a turnover tax into a value added tax. The author declares for the tax protection of consumption of the poor.

50|$|Property tax {{is based}} on fair {{market value of the}} subject property. The amount of tax is {{determined}} annually based on the market value of each property on a particular date, and most jurisdictions require redeterminations of value periodically. The tax is computed as the determined market value times an assessment ratio times the <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> <b>Assessment</b> ratios and <b>tax</b> <b>rates</b> vary widely among jurisdictions, and may vary by type of property within a jurisdiction. Where a property has recently been sold between unrelated sellers, such sale establishes fair market value. In other (i.e., most) cases, the value must be estimated. Common estimation techniques include comparable sales, depreciated cost, and an income approach. Property owners may also declare a value, which is subject to change by the tax assessor.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{positive}} but mixed progress {{over two}} decades, most lower income African countries need {{to enhance their}} low tax-to-GDP ratios by mobilizing domestic resources to complement debt relief, donor aid and to achieve the MDG and poverty reduction objectives. With these goals in mind, most African countries have undertaken revenue administration reforms and from the early 1990 s, 16 of 19 Anglophone Africa countries established some form of revenue authority (RA) for greater governance, financing, and workforce autonomy. Changes in governance and HR practices are evident, but has revenue administration improved overall? Capacity limitations and integrity issues persist. The introduction of VAT heralded self-assessment, but in most instances without being integrated with income tax administration. Rather, VAT administration was assigned to a separate department. Special units for large taxpayers are now common following initial challenges, but programs for other taxpayer segments are still emerging.

40|$|Time Limit for <b>Tax</b> <b>Assessment</b> The thesis {{deals with}} the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> as it is {{regulated}} especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment</b> represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This time limit thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of time limits. It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of time limits. Part Two explains general aspects of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of time limits. Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Part Two looks at the extension of the time limit for <b>tax</b> <b>assessment.</b> Part Three deals with the interruption of time [...] ...|$|R
