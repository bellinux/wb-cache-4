5000|$|Sanchez's first book, The Teachings of Don Carlos: Practical Applications of the Works of Carlos Castaneda (1995), {{provides}} in-depth {{techniques and}} commentary {{on a path}} of [...] "self-growth" [...] based on {{the wisdom of the}} Toltec descendants. His approach in this book is bringing the proposals of Castaneda down to the earth focusing on those parts of Castaneda's book that can be applied in everyday life and used for personal development, while discouraging the use of psychotropic plants, which was prominent in mostly in the first book of Castaneda [...] "The Teachings of Don Juan" [...] Sanchez has published four further books: Toltecs of the New Millennium (1996), providing an overview of and background on the author's experiences with the Wirrarika; The Toltec Path <b>of</b> Recapitulation: Healing <b>Your</b> Past to Free Your Soul (2001); and The Toltec Oracle (2004); and [...] "Los Colores de Tu Alma" [...] (<b>The</b> <b>Colors</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Soul - not yet translated into English) (2014). Sanchez's recapitulation technique bears some resemblance to Sandra Ingerman's soul retrieval technique, but is probably the most comprehensive approach to the subject that has been published so far. Other shamanic teachers using similar techniques include Michael Harner, PhD founder of core shamanism, and Ken Page, founder of Heart and Soul Healing. Some have associated Sanchez's work with Toltec author Don Miguel Ángel Ruiz, author of the Four Agreements. Sánchez usually respond to such association, that while he likes the general message of Ruiz´ book, they are not particular of the Toltec but could be found in many religions or world philosophies.|$|R

The captain we only knew by report as the [...] "man" [...] who lifted leg-balls over the pavilion and was said to have made a joke to the head-master's wife. By-and-by we understood the distinction that was to be conferred on us. Peterkin instructed his mother to send the captain a formal invitation addressed [...] "J. Rawlins, Esq." [...] This was done, but {{in such a way that}} Peterkin feared we might lose our distinguished visitor. [...] "You shouldn't have asked him for all the holidays," [...] Peterkin wrote, [...] "as he has promised a heap of fellows." [...] Then came a condescending note from the captain, saying that if he could manage it he would give us a few days. In this letter he referred to Peterkin as his young friend. Peterkin wrote shortly afterwards asking his sister Grizel to send him her photograph. [...] "If you haven't one," [...] he added, [...] "what is <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> eyes?" [...] Grizel is eighteen, which is also, I believe, the age of J. Rawlins. We concluded that the captain had been sounding Peterkin about the attractions that our home could offer him; but Grizel neither sent her brother a photograph nor any account of her personal appearance. [...] "It doesn't matter," [...] Peterkin wrote back; [...] "I told him you were dark." [...] Grizel is rather fair, but Peterkin had not noticed that.|$|E

60|$|The {{operation}} {{was done at}} home. A capable, fair-complexioned nurse took possession of us; and my study, because it has the best light, was transfigured into an admirable operating-room. All its furnishings were sent away, every cloth and curtain, and the walls and floor were covered with white sterilized sheets. The high little mechanical table they erected before the window seemed to me like an altar on which I had to offer up my son. There were basins of disinfectants and towels conveniently about, the operator came, took out his array of scalpels and forceps and little sponges from the black bag he carried, put them ready for his hand, and then covered them from your sight with a white cloth, and I brought you down in my arms, wrapped in a blanket, from your bedroom to the anæsthetist. You were beautifully trustful and submissive and unafraid. I stood by you until the chloroform had done its work, and then left you there, lest my presence should in the slightest degree embarrass the surgeon. The anæsthetic had taken all <b>the</b> <b>color</b> out <b>of</b> <b>your</b> face, and you looked pinched and shrunken and greenish and very small and pitiful. I went into the drawing-room and stood there with your mother and made conversation. I cannot recall what we said, I think {{it was about the}} moorland to which we were going for your convalescence. Indeed, we were but the ghosts of ourselves; all our substance seemed listening, listening to the little sounds that came to us from the study.|$|R

This {{was the first time}} Poland has held a competition to choose its entry since its return in 2014. The Eurovision pre-selection show took place on 5 March 2016 at the TVP Headquarters in Warsaw and was hosted by Artur Orzech. The Polish public chose Michał Szpak and his entry song titled [...] "Color <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Life", with Szpak winning overwhelmingly with 35.5% of the vote. “I would like to take part in Eurovision, to face the European artists and present the entry which I believe will leave big emotional mark on everyone”, stated Michal. To promote his Eurovision Song Contest entry Szpak took part in the Eurovision Concert Tour in London (17 April 2016), Tel Aviv (12 April 2016), Amsterdam (9 April 2016) and later Portugal. On 12 May, Szpak performed {{in the first half of}} the second Eurovision semi-final.

Despite being in second to last place with the juries, he leapt from seven points to 229 when public votes were added, and finished eighth overall.|$|R
