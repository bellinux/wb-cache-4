5|$|After 1700 British {{continental}} {{policy was}} to contain expansion by competing powers such as France and Spain. Although Spain was the dominant global power {{during the previous}} two centuries and the chief threat to England's early transatlantic ambitions, its influence was now waning.

5|$|All {{three of}} the Radetzky-class battleships were {{commissioned}} {{only a few years}} prior the beginning of World War I. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> all three battleships were assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, along with the Tegetthoff-class battleships in the 1st Division. All three battleships conducted training exercises in the Mediterranean Sea from 1910 to 1911. In 1913, they participated in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea that protested the Balkan Wars. During World War I, the ships had very limited service careers, hardly ever leaving port. However, in October 1914, the three ships bombarded French positions on Mount Lovƒçen during the Austro-Hungarian invasion of Montenegro. After Italy declared war on Austro-Hungary in 1915, the Radetzky-class battleships participated in the bombardment of the Italian city of Ancona. Following these operations, the three battleships' contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> effort became minimal. They remained in port {{until the end of the}} war. Following Austria-Hungary's defeat in World War I, all three battleships were handed over to Italy and later broken up for scrap between 1920 and 1926.|$|E

There was a group that prepared and sent out a weekly special bulletin to the parishioners in the Armed Forces. These parishioners were happy to receive news from home on the progress of their new church and many of them sent home money to go towards the building fund. During the war, hundreds of dollars came in from these parishioners fighting in the war. Of the 808 parishioners who went off to war, seven died and their names were engraved on a piece of granite outside of the church: James DiMuzio, Arthur Capo, Nick Costelli, Justine DeFelices, Neal Chipoletti, and Anthony Zaffuto.|$|E
