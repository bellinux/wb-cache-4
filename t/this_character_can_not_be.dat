The article chooses Na, LiPb and LBE {{three kinds}} of metal coolant, and makes a {{comparative}} analysis of the thermophysical properties of Na, LiPb and LBE when they are at liquid state. The results show that Na has the lowest density and the largest thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. There is a small difference between LBE and LiPb in terms of density, thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity. LiPb has the largest kinematic viscosity. The thermal conductivity of Na decreases as temperature rises, which is opposite of LBE and LiPb. The kinematic viscosity of LiPb increases as temperature rises. Considering thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, LBE and LiPb are not the best coolant. However, their high densities can economize equipments and materials at the same time. When it flows, LiPb’s heat transfer capacity gets larger as temperature rises, <b>this</b> <b>character</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> ignored in fusion reactor...|$|E
5000|$|When {{drinking}} alcohol, {{the health}} was restored {{and as an}} added benefit the character became somewhat less affected by enemy fire. This only worked to a minor degree, and the more the character drank, the less coordinated they became. This was measured on a [...] "drunk meter" [...] in the user display. Toward {{the high end of}} the meter, after consuming a large amount of alcohol, the character movements would become erratic and the user would have difficulty controlling the character as he moved in directions that did not correspond to the input on the keyboard. The in-game video would also become grainy and less viewable. At the maximum drunk level, the character would simply fall down, followed by the sounds of vomiting and the loss of all motor regardless of user input. All of these effects would pass after a few minutes as the character sobered up. During <b>this</b> time, the <b>character</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> use weapons and is essentially defenseless. The side effects of both power-up types forces the user to use them sparingly and gives another reason to avoid damage during gameplay. However, one other power-up, moonshine, gives the player increased speed for a brief amount of time, at the end of which both the [...] "drunk meter" [...] and the [...] "gut meter" [...] were reset to zero.|$|R

50|$|This novel {{presents}} a clear {{use of the}} restricted action resolution of the Grandfather paradox. The actions of the <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> have changed the past because the past is what their actions brought about. For example, one could not {{go back in time}} and kill one's grandfather because then the time traveler would not be born.|$|R

40|$|This project {{represents}} the research, analysis, rehearsal, {{and performance of}} a major female role from a masterpiece of modern American theatre – Martha from Edward Albee’s Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? I have chosen <b>this</b> significant <b>character</b> to pursue my ongoing research into major female theatrical roles, not merely on the theoretical, but on the practical/performance level. That is, my interest lies in a comprehensive exploration of <b>this</b> <b>character,</b> {{particularly with respect to}} the “vision of mid twentieth century woman” created by <b>this</b> <b>character,</b> that <b>can</b> be achieved only through the creation of the role. Martha is often compared in scope to the role of Hamlet, and the significance of <b>this</b> <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be measured by viewing her as a modern-day Hedda Gabler. Additionally, performing at the high professional level demanded by this project would greatly enhance my skills as the main performance teacher in my program...|$|R
50|$|The percontation point (⸮), a {{reversed}} {{question mark}} later {{referred to as}} a rhetorical question mark, was proposed by Henry Denham in the 1580s and was used {{at the end of a}} question that does not require an answer—a rhetorical question. Its use died out in the 17th century. <b>This</b> <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be represented using the reversed question mark (⸮) found in Unicode as U+2E2E; another character approximating it is the Arabic question mark (؟), U+061F.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{issue is}} that an XML {{document}} can be transcoded from one encoding to another during transport.

The passage runs in German: [...] "Until it has been refuted, I stand by the statement that <b>characters</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be inherited that were acquired during the lifetime of the individual". The passage comes from his W. 1874. Unsere Körperform und das physiologische Problem ihrer Enstehung. Vogel, Leipzig. The historical significance {{is that it was}} not until 1883 that August Weismann made a similar declaration.|$|R

25|$|The rhetorical {{question}} mark or percontation point {{was invented by}} Henry Denham in the 1580s and was used {{at the end of}} a {{rhetorical question}}; however, its use died out in the 17th century. It was later revived in modern-day society by Matt DiRoberto. It was the reverse of an ordinary question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it. <b>This</b> <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be represented using the reversed question mark (⸮) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the Irony mark, but these are very rarely seen.|$|R

40|$|Honey {{bee colony}} {{strength}} (number of adult bees in a colony) {{is a crucial}} character used for both breeding and research. In breeding programs a rough estimate is usually sufficient to select strong colonies. On the other hand, the accuracy of <b>this</b> <b>character</b> <b>can</b> deeply {{affect the quality of}} several studies in both fundamental and applied research. For example these studies are related to the assessment of low demographic variations following a stress, or the estimate of a host-parasite ratio (e. g. involving the mite Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman). The “Liebefeld estimation method” is extensively used in these studies while its accuracy remains weakly documented. Our goal is to provide more information on the accuracy of this method...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of {{myth and}} power, Barthes asserts that myth is a depoliticized speech. Myth removes our {{understanding}} of concepts and beliefs as created by humans. Instead, myth presents them as something natural and innocent. Drawing upon Karl Marx, Barthes states {{that even the most}} natural objects include some aspect of politics. Depending on how strong the political side of myth is, Barthes defines the strong and the weak myths (des mythes forts et des mythes faibles). [...] Depoliticization of the strong myths happens abruptly, as the strong myths are explicitly political. The weak myths are the myths which have already lost their political <b>character.</b> However, <b>this</b> <b>character</b> <b>can</b> be brought back by “the slightest thing”.|$|R

The rude hearer is affected by the principles which operate in these arts even in their rudest condition; and he is not skilful enough to perceive the defects.
