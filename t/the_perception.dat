5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of a predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E

Data were collected from 718 parents and 111 teachers by means of a written survey— School Effectiveness Questionnaire published by The Psychological Corporation (Baldwin, et al., 1998). Three research questions were answered by testing 21 hypotheses. Mean scores, paired-sample t-test, Multiple Analysis of Variances (MANOVA) and descriptive comparative statistics were used. Based on the statistical treatment, the following conclusions appear warranted: (1) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to clear and focused mission. (2) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to assessment and monitoring of students achievement. (3) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to parent/community participation. (4) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to safe and orderly environment. (5) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to teachers taking part in decision-making and teachers having control over portions of the school 2 ̆ 7 s instructional budget. (6) Significant differences existed in <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in high-performing schools and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents in low-performing schools with respect to increased opportunities for student.

(8) Teachers in low-performing schools rated 9 of the 11 attributes of school effectiveness as needing attention except for Clear and Focused Mission (x¯ = 4. 21) and Professional Development (x¯ = 4. 06). (9) Parents in high-performing schools rated their schools higher compared to parents in low-performing schools.
