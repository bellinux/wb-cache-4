5|$|Knox's final {{encounter}} with Mary {{was prompted by}} an incident at Holyrood. While Mary was absent from Edinburgh on her summer progress in 1563, a crowd forced its way into her private chapel as Mass was being celebrated. During the altercation, the priest's life was threatened. As a result, two of the ringleaders, burgesses of Edinburgh, were scheduled for trial on 24 October 1563. In order to defend these men, Knox sent out letters calling the nobles to convene. Mary obtained one of these letters and asked her advisors if {{this was not a}} treasonable act. Stewart and Maitland, wanting to keep good relations with both the Kirk and the Queen, asked Knox <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> was wrong and to settle the matter quietly. Knox refused and he defended himself in front of Mary and the Privy Council. He argued that he had called a legal, not an illegal, assembly as part of his duties as a minister of the Kirk. After he left, the councillors voted not to charge him with treason.|$|E
5|$|Brian {{turns down}} {{a chance to}} see Disney on Ice with Jillian, so she decides to give his ticket to Peter. After Peter and Jillian spend the entire day {{together}} and greatly enjoy each other's company, Peter convinces Jillian to either force Brian to let her move in with him or leave him. An angry Brian agrees to get an apartment with Jillian. Much to his surprise, Brian has a good time living with Jillian, but he comes to the realization {{that there is no way}} he can pay the rent by himself and he decides to allow Stewie to move in with them, who now makes money with his own paper route. When Brian does not tell Jillian that Stewie is helping with the rent, Stewie quickly gets in the way of Brian and Jillian's happiness living together. After arguing with Brian one night while he is having sex with Jillian, Stewie reveals that he is paying half the rent, prompting Brian <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> never wanted to move in with Jillian at all. Heartbroken, Jillian leaves Brian, who blames Stewie for ruining the relationship until Stewie tells him it's himself that ruined the relationship. After many failed attempts to lift a saddened Brian's spirits, Stewie convinces Brian to try to get Jillian back. Brian goes to her apartment, only to find that she has now moved in with Mayor West. As the two go their separate ways, Brian moves back in with the Griffins, where he manages to move on with his life.|$|E
25|$|That {{same year}} BBC TV started its Pot Black series. A single-frame format {{could hardly have}} been more removed from the epic finals of the 1940s, and Davis was quick <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> was a slow starter in matches. Nevertheless, he would be runner-up in the 1971 series (to John Spencer) and {{achieved}} the highest break in the 1970, 1971 and 1975 series.|$|E

25|$|A {{feature film}} version of the serial was shot in eleven days in December 1973 in colour on 16mm film and then blown up to 35mm. The film {{features}} nearly all the show's regular cast {{as well as more}} revealing nudity than was allowed on TV at the time. A gay kiss between Don and Simon was mysteriously cut from the movie after its Sydney season. Critics were not kind but even Mike Harris from The Australian had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> had never been in a cinema before where every character's first appearance got a roar of approval from the crowd.|$|E
25|$|He returns {{briefly in}} April 1997 for Ricky's wedding to Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) {{and again in}} December to console Ricky {{following}} {{the loss of his}} child. On another visit in May 1998, he becomes attracted to landlady Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) and they soon begin a relationship. Peggy asks Frank to move in with her at the Vic and they soon announce their engagement. Roy remains jealous of Frank, believing Pat has feelings for her ex-husband. When Pat turns to Frank following an argument with Roy and is seen leaving his flat, Roy and Peggy believe Frank and Pat are having an affair. Peggy calls off her engagement and Roy speeds off in his car on a suicide bid but Frank manages to convince him that his relationship with Pat is now platonic. He and Roy bond, leading Frank <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> got a young woman called Gemma pregnant in Manchester, and had a young son, Danny, of whom no one else is aware.|$|E
25|$|He was {{insulated}} by his wife, who selected {{matters for}} his attention and delegated others to his cabinet. Wilson temporarily resumed a perfunctory attendance at cabinet meetings. By February 1920, the President's true condition was publicly known. At issue was Wilson's fitness {{for the presidency}} {{at a time when}} the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. No one close to him, including his wife, his physician, or personal assistant, was willing <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> was unable to perform the duties of the presidency. Because of this complex case, and the subsequent realization of the difficulties that might have been experienced in the nuclear age if, instead of being assassinated in 1963, John F. Kennedy had been left in a permanent vegetative state on account of his brain injuries, the 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967 to allow the voluntary or forcible replacement of an unable or unwilling incumbent.|$|E

500|$|The Porto manager, Jos√© Mourinho, led {{his team}} to the Champions League title the {{following}} year before moving to Chelsea. Reflecting on the final, Mourinho was happy <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> played part of a historic moment in football. He said, [...] "As a football game, Celtic-Porto in Seville was the most exciting football game I have ever been involved in. An unbelievable game. Every time I see Martin O'Neill I remember I was the lucky one that day. An incredible match. I've never seen such emotional people. It was unbelievable." ...|$|E
500|$|Olds {{developed}} ambivalent {{feelings about}} West Point, admiring its dedication to [...] "Duty, Honor, Country", but {{disturbed by the}} tendency of many tactical officers to distort the purpose of its Honor Code. In March 1943, Olds was braced by an officer upon returning from leave in New York City, and compelled on penalty of an honor violation <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> had consumed alcohol. The infraction reduced him in rank from cadet captain to cadet private, characterized by Olds in his memoirs as [...] "only the second cadet {{in the history of}} West Point to earn that dubious honor." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his cross-examination, {{prosecutor}} Hausner {{attempted to}} get Eichmann <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> was personally guilty, but no such confession was forthcoming. Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries, but {{stated that he}} never thought their annihilation was justified. When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets. During later examination by the judges, he admitted he meant the Jews, and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time.|$|E

500|$|Rick Porter of Zap2It {{said that}} even though the episode [...] "was long on uncomfortable and even {{disturbing}} behavior" [...] and [...] "only out-and-out funny in a few spots" [...] he found himself [...] "respecting it a fair amount at the end". BuddyTV Senior Writer Oscar Dahl said that [...] "the insubordination of Stanley was a necessary plot point to cover" [...] because [...] "without it, too much Stanley being Stanley becomes unbelievable". Furthermore, he wrote that there [...] "was a lot of really funny stuff tonight" [...] and highlighted [...] "the scene between Darryl and Michael" [...] due to Robinson's acting. Aubry D'Arminio from Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "Mike's embarrassment, and his unwillingness at first <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> is disliked, was very very well played on Carell's part." [...] Furthermore, D'Arminio praised several of the episode's lines of dialogue and wrote [...] "I cannot even come near to picking a favorite quote [...] for this episode" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{questioning}} {{several of}} Mahoney's former associates, drug supplier Wilkie Collins (Robert F. Chew) is pressured into telling Lewis and Falsone the shooter was Mahoney's nephew, Junior Bunk (Mekhi Phifer). They arrest Junior Bunk {{and find the}} matching gun, a Desert Eagle pistol prompting Bunk <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> shot at the police to [...] "send a message" [...] from his mother, Georgia Rae Mahoney (Hazelle Goodman), {{over the death of}} her brother, Luther. Georgia is arrested trying to flee in a jet to the Cayman Islands, where she used to handle Luther's drug money. Meanwhile, following Brierre's autopsy, Cox (Michelle Forbes) finds somebody had consensual sex with the victim before her death. Pembleton and Bayliss learn from Felix Wilson's daughter Thea (Ellen Bethea) that Brierre had a vicious and abusive ex-boyfriend named Kaja. Pembleton and Gee declare Kaja the primary suspect, despite protests from Ballard that the lead is thin and that they have not properly questioned Felix Wilson. The episode ends with an imprisoned Georgia Rae Mahoney stating Kellerman will hear from her soon.|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza {{believed}} in a [...] "Philosophy {{of tolerance and}} benevolence" [...] and actually lived the life which he preached. He was criticized and ridiculed during his life and afterwards for his alleged atheism. However, even those who were against him [...] "had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> lived a saintly life". Besides the religious controversies, nobody really had much bad to say about Spinoza other than, [...] "he sometimes enjoyed watching spiders chase flies".|$|E

2500|$|Seigenthaler's {{friendship}} with Kennedy {{became one of}} the focal points of Jimmy Hoffa's bid to shift his jury tampering trial from Nashville. Citing [...] "one-sided, defamatory" [...] coverage from the newspaper, Hoffa's lawyers were able to get Seigenthaler <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> personally wanted Hoffa convicted. However, the journalist noted that he hadn't conveyed those sentiments to his reporters. Hoffa's lawyers gained a minor victory when the trial was moved to Chattanooga in a change of venue, but Hoffa was nonetheless convicted in 1964 after a 45-day trial.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually a close {{friendship}} {{and a strong}} professional association developed between the elder Freud and Jung, which left a sizeable correspondence. For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (known in English as Psychology of the Unconscious), which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured‚Äîeach stating that the other was unable <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> could possibly be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Henri Ellenberger called Jung's intense experience a [...] "creative illness" [...] and compared it favorably to Freud's own period of what he called neurasthenia and hysteria.|$|E
2500|$|In the afternoon, {{questioning}} {{turned to}} Reavis' {{discovery of the}} baptismal and burial records in San Bernardino. [...] The subject then turned to Alfred Sherwood's 1887 affidavit regarding Sophia's noble birth. [...] During this line of questioning an apparent contradiction appeared where Reavis had known of Miguel Noe and others with knowledge of Sophia's early life as early as 1885 yet {{he did not look}} for any of these people till 1892. [...] On the morning of June 13, Reavis was forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> had doubted some of the documents in his 1883 filing were genuine, but he had still filed them on advice of counsel while believing his wife was the true heir. [...] At the same time he admitted that he had at that time not told his lawyers of his marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Alfred the Alien (the only {{politician}} <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> {{came from}} outer space) ran in 1988 in Coast Capilano {{on a platform}} of [...] "Safe sex, prescription drugs, and easy listening" [...] ‚Äì an update to the original party tag line of [...] "sex, drugs, and rock'n roll". He also coined the slogan: [...] "The primary obligation of a political party is to have one". While campaigning, he always wore a tuxedo, but with baggy grey sweat pants and a cummerbund festooned with 'rhinostones', as well as a grey headdress with an outsized horn adorned with a condom. He supported global warming as part of the savannafication process to create better Rhino habitat on the prairies. He also supported free trade ‚Äì to trade Baffin Island for Maui, or Brian Mulroney for some peace and quiet. Another plan was to advocate for Canadian citizenship for Jose Cuervo ‚Äì Rhinos drank so much tequila that it seemed reasonable to recognize Jose as truly Canadian.|$|E
2500|$|This story {{tells of}} the [...] "Second Expedition" [...] to Mars. The {{expedition}} {{is a group of}} four men. The astronauts arrive to find the Martians to be strangely unresponsive to their presence. The one exception to this is a group of Martians in a building who greet them with a parade. Several of the Martians in the building claim to be from Earth or from other planets of the solar system, and the captain slowly realizes that the Martian gift for telepathy allows others to view the hallucinations of the insane, and that they have been placed in an insane asylum. The Martians they have encountered all believed that their unusual appearance was a projected hallucination. Because the [...] "hallucinations" [...] are so detailed and the captain refuses <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>he</b> is not from Earth, Mr. Xxx, a psychiatrist, declares him incurable and kills him. When the [...] "imaginary" [...] crew does not disappear as well, Mr. Xxx shoots and kills them too. Finally, as the [...] "imaginary" [...] rocket remains in existence, Mr. Xxx concludes that he too must be crazy and shoots himself. The ship of the Second Expedition is sold as scrap at a junkyard.|$|E
