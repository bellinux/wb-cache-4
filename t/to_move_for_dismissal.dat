50|$|By March 2010, the NHL had not {{finished}} the sale to Ice Edge. It {{was reported that}} Ice Edge had run into trouble securing sufficient financing although the group denied the claims. The NHL launched a lawsuit for $61 million against former Coyotes owner Jerry Moyes to recover $10 million in bankruptcy court costs, $20 million in losses for 2009-10 and $11.6 million owed to creditors. On May 10, 2010, the lawsuit was transferred from New York to Arizona. Moyes is planning <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal</b> of the case. It was reported in December 2010, that the court is considering Moyes motion to dismiss the case.|$|E
5000|$|The statute says {{little about}} the {{substantive}} standards for judging a notice of contest. [...] Under the FCEA, the candidate contesting the election must file a notice of contest within thirty days of state certification of the election results. [...] The only substantive requirements for the notice are that the contestant must “state grounds sufficient to change {{the result of the}} election” and must “claim the right to the contestee’s seat” in Congress. [...] The contestee then has thirty days either to file an answer or <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal.</b> The burden of proof rests with the contestant, who “must overcome the presumption of the regularity of an election, and its results, evidenced by the certificate of election presented by the contestee.” [...] The FCEA also sets forth procedures for an adversarial system of taking depositions and other discovery. Traditionally, the Committee on House Administration appoints a bipartisan three-member task force to investigate and report on an FCEA proceeding. [...] Generally, the task force investigates the contest and makes a recommendation to the Committee on House Administration, which then issues a report and sends a resolution to the full House regarding the disposition of the contest. “The committee may recommend, and the House may approve by a simple majority vote, a decision affirming the right of the contestee to the seat, may seat the contestant, or find that neither party is entitled to be finally seated and declare a vacancy.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Brooklyn {{district}} attorney Charles Hynes indicted DeVecchio {{on charges that}} he'd helped Scarpa kill four people in the 1980s and early 1990s by supplying confidential FBI information about them. [...] The case was based almost entirely on the testimony of Scarpa's longtime girlfriend, Linda Schiro. However, the case imploded {{in the fall of}} 2007 when Tom Robbins of The Village Voice came forward with an interview he and mob expert Jerry Capeci had conducted with Schiro in 1997 in which Schiro denied that DeVecchio had been involved in most of the murders. link This all but forced prosecutors <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>for</b> a <b>dismissal</b> of charges against DeVecchio, which was granted on November 1, 2007.|$|R

Unless the court in its order <b>for</b> <b>dismissal</b> otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any <b>dismissal</b> not provided <b>for</b> in the rules, other than a <b>dismissal</b> <b>for</b> lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication on the merits.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013, a {{proposed}} class action lawsuit, Jennifer L Saavedra v.

Eli Lilly <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal</b> per the [...] "learned intermediary doctrine" [...] as the doctors prescribing the drug were warned of the potential problems and are an intermediary medical judgment between Lilly and patients; in December 2013 Lilly's motion to dismiss was denied.|$|R
5000|$|The Supreme Court {{reversed}} the Court of Claims, holding that the Indian General Allotment Act {{did not create}} a trust relationship and that any grounds for recovery {{must be based on}} other grounds. [...] The case then returned to the Court of Claims to consider the plaintiff's other claims, and the United States again <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal.</b> The Court of Claims rejected the motion to dismiss, holding that three other federal laws gave the plaintiffs a cause of action. These three laws dealt with timber sales, regulations and sustained yield, and rights-of-way.|$|R
5000|$|On March 31, 2017, Hale {{ruled against}} the {{dismissal}} of a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump of inciting violence against protesters in Louisville, Kentucky. During a campaign rally on March 1, 2016, Trump repeatedly said [...] "get 'em out of here" [...] while pointing at anti-Trump protesters. According to the protesters, as they were escorted out they were repeatedly shoved and punched by his supporters. Trump's attorneys <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal</b> of the case, arguing he was protected by free speech laws, and wasn't {{trying to get his}} supporters to resort to violence.|$|R
500|$|Glik then filed a {{complaint}} with the Internal Affairs section of the Boston Police Department. [...] After the department refused to investigate that legitimate complaint, Glik, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, along with attorneys David Milton and Howard Friedman, filed a civil rights lawsuit against the officers and the city, alleging violations of his First and Fourth Amendment rights. [...] The officers <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal,</b> based in part on qualified immunity. [...] The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts denied the motion, noting that [...] "this First Amendment right publicly to record the activities of police officers on public business is established." ...|$|R
50|$|On January 25, Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissals</b> of both {{articles}} of impeachment for lack of merit. On the following day, Rep. Bryant <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> call witnesses to the trial, a question that the Senate had scrupulously avoided to that point. In both cases, the Senate voted to deliberate on the question in private session, rather than public, televised procedure. On January 27, the Senate voted on both motions in public session; the motion to dismiss failed on a nearly party line vote of 56-44, while the motion to depose witnesses passed by the same margin. (In both cases, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin was the sole Democratic vote in the minority.) A day later, the Senate voted down motions <b>to</b> <b>move</b> directly <b>to</b> {{a vote on the}} {{articles of}} impeachment and to suppress videotaped depositions of the witnesses from public release, Feingold again voting with the Republicans.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Government Accountability Project (GAP) and OMB Watch {{filed suit}} against the Department of Justice {{challenging}} {{the constitutionality of the}} [...] "seal provisions" [...] of the FCA that require the whistleblower and the court to keep lawsuits confidential for at least 60 days. The plaintiffs argued that the requirements infringe the First Amendment rights of the public and the whistleblower, and that they violate the division of powers, since courts are not free to release the documents until the executive branch acts. [...] The government <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal,</b> and the district court granted that motion in 2009. [...] The plaintiffs appealed, and in 2011 their appeal was denied.|$|R

5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI. The tribe argued that the United States had {{exclusive}} control over the buildings and allowed them to fall into disrepair, {{a violation of the}} trust relationship established by the 1960 statute. Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal</b> on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addition, the United States claimed that the statute of limitations had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims. The trial court dismissed the suit on the failure to state a claim.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt} In most {{types of}} organizations, formal {{authority}} {{is located at}} the top as part of an exchange against fairly explicit expectations. In networked, pluralistic organizations that must rapidly formulate adaptive solutions in an increasingly complex world, its power is eroding as its functions become less clear. In the 21 st century, the requirements of organizational speed demand investments in informal authority. Formal authority—the power to influence or command thought, opinion, or behavior—is the defining characteristic of societal and organizational hierarchy. Ideally, after Ronald Heifetz, it is expected to serve five functions that most will agree are indispensable to social life. They are to (i) provide direction, (ii) offer protection, (iii) orientate roles, (iv) control conflict, and (v) maintain norms. Then again, in practice, there is a darker side to what formal authority can do on any given day: for instance, a boss can restrict a subordinate’s actions, invalidate his or her decisions, or <b>move</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Merrill Lynch again <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal,</b> {{which was}} granted by Senior Judge Milton Pollack, {{on the grounds}} that the claims were [...] "squarely within SLUSA's ambit." [...] However, this {{decision}} was reversed on appeal by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the ruling judges being Sonia Sotomayor. [...] The court ruled that the holder claims did not satisfy the SLUSA requirement that the fraud claims be brought [...] "in connection with the purchase or sale" [...] of securities. Though recognizing the typically broad interpretation that language has been given, the Second Circuit believed Congress meant to incorporate the Supreme Court's limitation from Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723 (1975), which ruled that only those suffering direct loss from the purchase or sale of stock had standing to sue under federal securities law. [...] To the extent that Dabit's amended complaint [...] alleged that Merrill Lynch had fraudulently induced the stockholders to retain their stock and not to purchase or sell it, the Second Circuit determined that his class action fell outside SLUSA's preemptive scope. [...] The case was nonetheless remanded <b>for</b> <b>dismissal</b> with leave to amend again, because the amended complaint still did not necessarily exclude purchaser claims.|$|R

On 30 June 1992 the Hartwigs added another count of emotional distress to the lawsuit, after the Navy {{sent a letter}} to Hartwig's parents inviting the dead sailor to join the US Navy Reserve. The Hartwigs sued for emotional distress {{in order to avoid the}} limitations imposed by the Feres Doctrine. The DoD asked <b>for</b> a <b>dismissal</b> of the Hartwigs' suit on grounds of sovereign immunity, but in May 1993, US District Judge Paul R.

After discovery, the government again <b>moved</b> <b>for</b> <b>dismissal.</b> On 26 January 1999 Magistrate Judge David Perelman issued a recommendation to grant dismissal because several years of discovery had revealed that defamation was essential to the Hartwigs' claims, and that pure defamation claims were barred by sovereign immunity. The Hartwig family filed objections, but on 10 November 1999 District Judge Solomon Oliver, Jr. adopted the recommendation to dismiss, ruling that [...] "however hurtful the government's action may have been, they cannot form the basis of a claim against the United States." ...|$|R
