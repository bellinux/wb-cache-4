5|$|A {{drawing method}} found by Kazimierz Zarankiewicz has been conjectured {{to give the}} correct answer for every {{complete}} bipartite graph, and the statement <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> true {{has come to be}} known as the Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture. The conjecture remains open, with only some special cases solved.|$|E
5|$|A legend {{developed}} that England would not fall {{to a foreign}} invader {{as long as there}} were ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> actually a romantic Victorian invention.|$|E

5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's digestive tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E
5|$|As Olivia {{enters the}} park, she is {{passed by a}} man riding a penny-farthing bicycle. As these have not been shown elsewhere, {{it does not seem}} likely that they are a common means of {{transportation}} in the alternate universe, but rather <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a reference to The Prisoner, in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held prisoner.|$|E

5000|$|The {{organizers}} of the event were criticized for holding this event, dubbed [...] "Just-us Sunday" [...] by some critics.

[...] Still others felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> an attempt to undermine {{the independence of the}} Federal Judiciary. Among those opposed to the event were a number of religious leaders from a wide spectrum of faiths [...] - [...] including Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and Eastern Orthodox leaders.|$|R

5|$|Einstein argued <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> true for {{fundamental}} reasons, {{because the}} gravitational field {{could be made}} to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived. The historian Barbara Yorke has maintained <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to the destruction of the kingdom's monasteries and the disappearance of both of the East Anglian sees, which were caused by Viking raids and later settlement.|$|E
