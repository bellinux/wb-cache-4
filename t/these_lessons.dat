5|$|Operations Southeast Croatia and Ozren were early {{opportunities}} for the Germans to learn lessons about the challenges their poorly equipped and often substandard occupation troops faced fighting in the difficult terrain and weather conditions of Bosnia. However, <b>these</b> <b>lessons</b> were to be repeated many more times in the following years as German commanders persisted with their encirclement tactics and unreasonable expectations {{of what could be}} achieved in a given time and space.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the group often proselytized on street corners for hours, and Clarence13X's assistants led classes about the group's teachings, {{strictly}} enforcing study habits. He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters. Once they did so, they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths. <b>These</b> <b>lessons</b> were taught in a form that resembled catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} different lesson plans dealing withauthentic and controversial socio-scientific issues in the framework ofclimate change. <b>These</b> <b>lesson</b> plans orient themselves along the sociocritical,problem-oriented approach to science teaching. They deal with theuse of bioethanol as an alternative fuel and with the phenomenon of climatechange itself. The development of <b>these</b> <b>lesson</b> plans for chemistry classesusing Participatory Action Research will also be discussed. Parallelapproaches to Physics, Biology and Politics education taken in the project"Climate Change Before the Court" will also be outlined briefly.

40|$|<b>These</b> <b>lesson</b> plans {{began with}} a desire to explore notions of {{authority}} in the library classroom at our mid-sized urban university, including how authority is used by teachers to the benefit or detriment of learners and how learners can begin to reclaim their own authority.

5|$|Fletcher, {{along with}} Yorktowns {{commanding}} officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired first-hand experience in organizing and launching a full strike against an enemy {{force in the}} Coral Sea, {{but there was no}} time to pass <b>these</b> <b>lessons</b> on to Enterprise and Hornet which were tasked with launching the first strike. Spruance ordered the striking aircraft to proceed to target immediately, rather than waste time waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing enemy carriers was the key to the survival of his own task force.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think. From another early operation (K-Shell, the spreading of rumours about a new Allied super-shell which eventually petered out after the media picked up the story), he learned the value of conducting deception only when there was a clear objective, rather than because it was possible. From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception on a short timescale. From <b>these</b> <b>lessons</b> Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
5|$|The Portland {{class were}} also {{designed}} with more advanced armament in mind. Their main guns {{were the first}} to be specially designed to fire long-point projectiles with a streamlined shape, which increased the guns' range when compared with older cruiser guns. Such projectiles were in use by ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which until that point out-ranged U.S. cruisers with their firepower. The New Orleans class was designed with <b>these</b> <b>lessons</b> in mind, intended to create a better balance between protection, armament and speed.|$|E

5|$|Djajakusuma's next production, Terimalah Laguku (Take My Song; 1952), was {{a musical}} about an old, impoverished {{musician}} who sells his saxophone {{to help his}} former student's career. Though the film's technical quality was poor, {{when he returned to}} Indonesia in 1953 Ismail was pleased with the work, stating that the editing had been done well. Over the next year Ismail conveyed information he learned at UCLA to the Perfini staff; Djajakusuma followed <b>these</b> <b>lessons</b> closely. This was followed by Harimau Tjampa (Tiger from Tjampa) in 1953, a film about a man who attempts to avenge his father's death. Set amidst Minang culture, the film featured some of the first nudity in a domestic production and was a considerable critical success.|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While <b>these</b> <b>lessons</b> could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
5|$|The IJN began reevaluating the Nagato {{design in}} light of {{lessons learned from the}} Battle of Jutland in May 1916, {{experiments}} evaluating armor protection, and newly acquired information on the protective schemes of British and American capital ships. <b>These</b> <b>lessons</b> highlighted the need for better protection of the main gun turrets and magazines, as well as thicker deck armor to protect against plunging fire. Existing methods of defense against mines and torpedoes had also proved to be inadequate and needed improvement. Eleven new designs were rejected between October and early 1917 before Captain Yuzuru Hiraga, superintendent of shipbuilding and the naval architect in charge of the fundamental design of the ships of the Eight-Eight Fleet, presented a heavily modified version of the Nagato design, A-125, to be built in lieu of the second ship of the class, Mutsu, on 12 June 1917, well before she was actually laid down.|$|E

40|$|Teachers {{often have}} {{difficulty}} engaging students in {{arts and humanities}} classes. To aid in this struggle, a series of lesson plans applicable for kindergarten through twelfth grade students in music and arts and humanities classes will be presented. <b>These</b> <b>lesson</b> plans will teach students about world cultures, such as West African, Appalachian, and Latin America, through arts integration. In order to reach this goal, {{there will be a}} component on student development in order to match the units with students’ developmental levels.

The students will understand these topics through a variety of products and performances that they will create. With the development of <b>these</b> <b>lesson</b> plans, students should become more culturally aware. They will have an understanding of people that are not like them, but realize that they are just as alike as they are different because of the cultures’ contribution to the arts...|$|R
