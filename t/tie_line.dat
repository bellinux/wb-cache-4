As the oscillation center may be an isolated dot or exists in {{a section of the}} splitting, this paper has proposed the thought of “false oscillation center ” and introduced the relative degree coefficient of oscillation k which reflects the degree of effect on the <b>tie</b> <b>lines.</b> The <b>tie</b> <b>lines</b> being cut off should be sorted based on the value of k. If the system recovers stable, the <b>tie</b> <b>lines</b> remained should not be cut off. It is vital to the control of the splitting and reducing the losses of accidents.

The ternary diagram shows that all the <b>tie</b> <b>lines</b> have a positive slope at all concentration of naphthenic acid, thus indicating that the ionic liquid is enough for the de-acidification of dodecane.

5000|$|On June 7, 2013, Vermont's Public Service Board issued Entergy a Certificate of Public Good {{to install}} an outdoor diesel {{generator}} {{to replace a}} <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> from the nearby hydroelectric station as its station blackout power source. The outdoor generator would only operate if the plant's main emergency diesel generators located inside the turbine building were to fail. The outdoor generator is a self-contained unit that does not require cooling water from the plant's cooling water systems. The new generator would power instrumentation {{in the control room}} and would be capable of providing emergency AC power to one train of each of the plant's emergency cooling systems. [...] On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced in a press release that it would close Vermont Yankee by the end of 2014. Among the reasons cited for the closure were ongoing low energy prices resulting from increased shale gas production, and the high operating costs of the plant.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Vermont Electric Power Company {{constructed}} a new substation, {{designated as the}} Vernon Substation, on the Vermont Yankee site {{to serve as the}} site's new main transmission facility and to connect a new 345 kV transmission line to Central Vermont as part of its Southern Loop project. The aging Entergy-owned Vermont Yankee substation could not handle the additional line or any additional transformers and VELCO desired to have a utility owned and controlled substation for what is probably the state's most important interconnection point. Additionally, the local 115 kV system was relying exclusively on Entergy's single 345 kV to 115 kV transformer. The construction of the Vernon substation included a second 345 kV to 115 kV transformer to supplement the existing Entergy owned transformer. The additional transformer also provided redundancy for Vermont Yankee's source of offsite power. The four transmission lines that formerly connected directly to the Vermont Yankee substation now connect to the Vernon substation, and three tie-lines, one at 115 kV and two at 345 kV, connect the Vermont Yankee substation to the Vernon substation. Each 345 kV <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> is capable of carrying the full power output of the plant.|$|E
50|$|On December 24, 1998, a {{heavy metal}} cleat {{fastened}} to the hull of the Sailing Ship Columbia tore loose, striking one employee and two park guests. One of the guests, a 33-year-old man, died of a head injury. The normal <b>tie</b> <b>line,</b> an inelastic hemp rope designed to break easily, was improperly replaced for financial reasons by an elastic nylon rope which stretched and tore the cleat from the ship's wooden hull. Disney received much criticism for this incident due to its alleged policy of restricting outside medical personnel in the park to avoid frightening visitors, {{as well as for}} the fact that the employee in charge of the ship at the time had not been trained in its operation. After this incident, Disney reinstated lead foremen on most rides and the Anaheim police department placed officers in the park to speed response. This accident resulted in the first guest death in Disneyland's history that was not attributable to any negligence on the part of the guest. California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health investigated the incident and found fault with the training of the park employee who placed the docking line on the cleat. The cleat was not designed to help brake the ship and the employee should have been trained to recognize when the ship was approaching too fast. Ride procedures called for the ship's captain to reverse the ship if it overshot the dock and re-approach the dock at the correct speed. Disney was fined US$12,500 by Cal/OSHA and settled a lawsuit brought by the victim's survivors for an estimated US$25,000,000.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a strategy to determine lengths and orientations of <b>tie</b> <b>lines</b> in the coexistence region of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases of cholesterol containing ternary lipid mixtures. The method combines confocal-fluorescence-microscopy image stacks of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), a dedicated 3 D-image analysis, and a quantitative analysis based in equilibrium thermodynamic considerations. This approach was tested in GUVs composed of 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine/ 1, 2 -palmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine/cholesterol. In general, our results show a reasonable agreement with previously reported data obtained by other methods. For example, our computed <b>tie</b> <b>lines</b> {{were found to be}} nonhorizontal, indicating a difference in cholesterol content in the coexisting phases.

40|$|Forty-one phase {{diagrams}} {{and fifteen}} sand column experiments {{were conducted to}} evaluate the efficiency of three types of washing solutions to recover trichloroethylene (TCE) at residual saturation and to identify the recovery mechanisms involved. This study demonstrates that: (1) an alcohol and a surfactant combination is more efficient than an alcohol used alone in water; (2) the prediction of the dominant recovery mechanism from the <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> slopes in phase diagram is accurate and can be reproduced in sand column experiments; and (3) TCE recovery efficiency in sand column experiments is generally well represented by {{the position of the}} miscibility curve in phase diagrams in the low concentration range. However, the miscibility curve alone is not sufficient to exactly predict the TCE recovery mechanisms involved. <b>Tie</b> <b>line</b> slopes and the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> have to be taken into consideration to select the active matter as well as its concentration and to predict the dominant recovery mechanism in sand column experiments. The sand column experiments quantified the recovery efficiency of each solution and identified the proportion of the recovery mechanisms (mobilisation vs. solubilisation). Washing solutions with an active matter concentration above the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> caused dominating mobilisation. Mobilisation was also dominant when the active matter of the washing solution partitioned into the organic phase and the active matter concentration was below the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> Solubilisation and emulsification were dominant for washing solutions containing active matter, which principally partitioned into the aqueous phase and an active matter concentration below the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> Copyright 2003 Elsevier B.

Results reveal that the flash points are constant in each <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> Handling the non-ideality of the liquid phase through the use of activity coefficient models, the general flash-point model of Liaw et al. extended to partially miscible mixtures predicts the experimental data well when using literature LLE and the VLE activity coefficient model binary parameters to estimate sequentially the span and flash point in each <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> and the flash point in the mutual solubility region, respectively. The constant flash-point behavior in a <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> is also observed and predicted, in agreement with the VLLE <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> property that a single vapor is in equilibrium with all liquid composition on a <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> For the aqueousorganic mixtures here studied, a deviation between prediction and measurements is observed, arising from the failure of the constant lower flammable limit assumption in the mutual solubility inert-rich region.
