5|$|Fischer heavily disparaged chess {{as it was}} {{currently}} being played (at the highest levels). As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was {{to ensure that a}} game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.|$|E
5|$|The French {{would use}} the lessons learned at Muong Khoua {{and those of the}} 1952 Battle of Na San in their defence plans at Điện Biên Phủ, while the Viet Minh in turn would employ similar tactics of encirclement and {{strangulation}} there. The importance of an air bridge to maintain supply lines, strong artillery support to stave off human-wave Viet Minh attacks, and the need for isolated emplacements to mutually support each other, were also important tactics taken on board by the French from both conflicts. The disappearance of local civiliain populations previously friendly towards the French, which served as a precursor to Viet Minh attack, was also remembered by the Điện Biên Phủ troops. For the Viet Minh, <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> isolated and smother individual strongpoints while maintaining hidden artillery and support weapon emplacements {{out of the reach of}} French airstrikes and artillery were honed at both battles, as were their practicies of using human-wave attacks.|$|E
5|$|Most paleontologists regard birds as {{the only}} {{surviving}} dinosaurs (see Origin of birds). It is thought that all non-avian theropods became extinct, including then-flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and hesperornithiforms. Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K–Pg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and ratite bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs. Large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K–Pg boundary. The absence of these birds in the Paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there. A {{small fraction of the}} Cretaceous bird species survived the impact, giving rise to today's birds. The only bird group known for certain to have survived the K–Pg boundary is the Aves. Avians may have been able to survive the extinction as a result of <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> dive, swim, or seek shelter in water and marshlands. Many species of avians can build burrows, or nest in tree holes or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–Pg boundary. Long-term survival past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a research about communication skill of secondary biology student in Arthropode classification using phenetic method. Data {{were obtained from}} written report and oral presentation. There were five indicators used to analyze communication skill in oral presentation, which included <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> express opinion themselves and hearing the opinion from other, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> master the concept <b>to</b> be presented, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> communicate of results systematically and clearly, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> question, and <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> answer. Five indicators used in written report were <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> choose informative character <b>to</b> build fenogram, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> undergo step by step, resulted phenogram, <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> interpret the results, and <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> make a report. Results showed that communication skill in oral were good enough (63. 75 %), but low (56. 25 %) in written. Based on interview, however, students felt comfortable when teacher used the phenetic method to understand classification of Arthropode. This method has markedly stimulated the students to study actively in the classroom. Keywords: arthropode, communication skill, classification, phenetic method...|$|R

25|$|The {{extent of}} arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} colonization and species affects the bacterial {{population in the}} rhizosphere. Bacterial species differ in <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> compete for carbon compound root exudates. A change in the amount or composition of root exudates and fungal exudates due to the existing AM mycorrhizal colonization determines the diversity and abundance of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 17th century, {{the rodeo}} begins to get {{regulated}} and is practiced in a rectangular track 75 meters long. The riders would bring out the cattle from the corrals and on the main track, display <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> separate a single calf and guide it without the help of other riders. All this activity was regulated and the most talented riders would receive honors and awards.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} finding a new drug against a chosen target for a {{particular}} disease usually involves high-throughput screening (HTS), wherein large libraries of chemicals are tested for <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> modify the target. For example, if the target is a novel GPCR, compounds will be screened for <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> inhibit or stimulate that receptor (see antagonist and agonist): if the target is a protein kinase, the chemicals will be tested for <b>their</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> inhibit that kinase.|$|R

These were considered a rarity amongst locomotive crews, and due to the customised inside valve gear, the regulators worked in a different fashion to the norm, therefore causing problems amongst those unfamiliar with the design.

25|$|The game {{is based}} on the Russian {{stacking}} matryoshka dolls, an idea coined by Double Fine's art director, Lee Petty, who saw the dolls as a means to replace the standard player interface used in graphical adventure games. The player controls the smallest doll, Charlie Blackmore, who has the ability to stack and unstack into larger dolls and use <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> solve puzzles to allow Charlie to free his older siblings {{and put an end to}} child labor enforced by the antagonist, the Baron. Puzzles within the game have multiple solutions, and include additional puzzles and challenges that allow the player to explore the game's world outside of the main story.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to scaffold material and physical cues, biological cues {{can also be}} incorporated into a bioartificial nerve conduit {{in the form of}} cells. In the nervous system there are many different cell types that help support the growth and maintenance of neurons. These cells are collectively termed glial cells. Glial cells have been investigated in an attempt to understand the mechanisms behind <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> promote axon regeneration. Three types of glial cells are discussed: Schwann cells, astrocytes, and olfactory ensheathing cells. In {{addition to}} glial cells, stem cells also have potential benefit for repair and regeneration because many are able to differentiate into neurons or glial cells. This article briefly discusses the use of adult, transdifferentiated mesenchymal, ectomesenchymal, neural and neural progenitor stem cells.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem is}} further {{exacerbated}} by inadequate resources and trained personnel. Many rural areas – {{where most of}} China's HIV-positive population resides – {{do not have the}} capacity to monitor patients' CD4+ cell counts and viral load. In some cases, the physical infrastructure exists, but staff do not have the skills or reagents to use it. Human resource capacity is a major constraint on China's ability to deliver HIV prevention and care. Many health workers and educators have poor knowledge of HIV and hold their own biases and stigmas towards those at risk or infected with HIV. A substantial proportion of the funds allocated to HIV prevention and control is being spent on establishing training centers and in building the capacity of health workers so that they can deliver better services. But many of those willing to work in rural areas do not have formal medical qualifications to begin with, which limits <b>their</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> understand the complexities of treating HIV patients. Furthermore, health services rely heavily on user fees, which often encourages health workers to do additional, chargeable services that many people living with HIV/AIDS cannot afford.|$|E
