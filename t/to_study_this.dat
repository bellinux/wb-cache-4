5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>this</b> behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E

25|$|A {{course of}} {{instruction}} lasts {{three years and}} comprises obligatory subjects common to all students, subjects {{that are part of}} the student's study programme, and elective subjects.

25|$|Most {{species of}} {{micro-organism}} on Earth {{are not yet}} well understood or DNA sequenced. This particularly applies to the uncultivable archaea, {{and the majority of}} micro-organisms are uncultivable, and so are hard <b>to</b> <b>study.</b> <b>This</b> can be either because they depend on the presence of other micro-organisms, or are slow growing, or depend on other conditions not yet well understood. In typical habitats, 99% of micro-organisms are uncultivable.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} pest that {{attacked}} orange {{trees in the}} United States was the cottony cushion scale (Icerya purchasi), imported from Australia to California in 1868. Within 20 years, it wiped out the citrus orchards around Los Angeles, and limited orange growth throughout California. In 1888, the USDA sent Alfred Koebele to Australia <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>this</b> scale insect in its native habitat. He brought back with him specimens of Novius cardinalis, an Australian ladybird beetle, and within a decade the pest was controlled.|$|E
30|$|There {{were several}} {{limitations}} <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> <b>This</b> was a retrospective, single-facility study, {{and the information}} was obtained only from medical records. No {{statistical analysis was performed}} as the number of cancellation cases was small.|$|R
30|$|A {{limitation}} <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{the retrospective}} design, {{which allows for}} the possibility that complications may have occurred and were not recorded. Furthermore, since there is a low rate of intra-articular shoulder pathology in the skeletally immature population, there is a corresponding low rate of surgery to treat children [16]. Therefore, the size of our cohort may be considered small by adult incidence standards [6], but it is still a fairly large, multicenter cohort considering <b>this</b> innate limitation <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> <b>this</b> particular population.|$|R

25|$|Professor Nathaniel Kleitman and {{his student}} Eugene Aserinsky defined rapid eye {{movement}} and linked it to dreams in 1953 and further described by researchers including William Dement and Michel Jouvet. Many experiments have involved awakening test subjects whenever they begin to enter the REM phase, thereby producing a state known as REM deprivation. Subjects allowed to sleep normally again usually experience a modest REM rebound. Techniques of neurosurgery, chemical injection, electroencephalography, positron emission tomography, and reports of dreamers upon waking, have all been used <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>this</b> phase of sleep.|$|E
25|$|Levantine Art {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Teruel in 1903. The Spanish prehistorian Juan Cabre {{was the first}} <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>this</b> art, defining it as a regional Palaeolithic art. Assessment as Palaeolithic was challenged for various reasons {{including the fact that}} no glacial fauna was depicted. Antonio Beltrán Martínez and others place the beginning of this art in the Epipaleolithic or Mesolithic, placing its heyday in the Neolithic period. Accepting a post-Paleolithic age for the art, Ripio devised a new chronological scheme in the 1960s, dividing the art into four stages:naturalistic, stylized static, stylized dynamic, and final phase of transition to the schematic.|$|E
25|$|The {{cocktail}} party effect is the phenomenon {{that a person}} hears his or her name even when not attending to the conversation. <b>To</b> <b>study</b> <b>this,</b> a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability {{to keep track of}} words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more likely to hear their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.|$|E

25|$|It {{is known}} that the {{founding}} queen of a nest produces her first brood to be workers. In a study about early emerging males in this initial brood of workers, many observations were taken. First, the possibility of sibling mating was quite high in nests where there were early emerging males. There were no early emerging males found to be diploid in chromosome number. So, the early emerging males were haploid, with the number chromosomes in a haploid set being 30. This was in contrast with previously known data where the number of haploid chromosomes had been set at 13. These chromosomes were observed to be meta or submetacentrics. Nests where there were early emerging males had a strong possibility of mating between these males and the workers of the same brood. Further investigation needs to be conducted <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>this</b> behavior.|$|E
25|$|Cornell hosts a large {{fraternity}} and sorority system, with 70 chapters involving 33% of {{male and}} 24% of female undergraduates. Alpha Phi Alpha, the first intercollegiate Greek-letter organization established for African Americans, was founded at Cornell in 1906. Alpha Zeta Fraternity, the first Greek-lettered organization established for Latin Americans in the United States, was also founded at Cornell on January 1, 1890. Alpha Zeta served the wealthy international Latin American students that came to the United States <b>to</b> <b>study.</b> <b>This</b> organization led a movement of fraternities that catered to international Latin American students that was active from 1890 to 1975. On February 19, 1982, La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda fraternity was established; it would eventually become the only Latino based fraternity in the nation with chapters at every Ivy League institution. Latinas Promoviendo Comunidad/Lambda Pi Chi sorority was established on April 16, 1988, making the organization the first Latina-Based, and not Latina exclusive, sorority founded at an ivy-league institution.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, {{immigrants}} to the United States from traditional cricket strongholds such as South Asia and the West Indies helped to stimulate the growth of the game. The first match televised in the United States was one between the Corinthians and Hollywood in 1958. Cricket received a boost in the United States in 1959 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower attended a cricket match at Karachi's National Cricket Ground. In 1961, an expatriate Englishman, John Marder, helped to establish the United States of America Cricket Association. He also helped to re-establish the series between the United States and Canada that began in 1844. Cricket also gained ground in American collegiate settings during this period. Again, most of the play was done by foreign students visiting the United States <b>to</b> <b>study.</b> <b>This</b> slow but steady resurgence in the game has not spread in great numbers to the mainstream American population.|$|E

500|$|As AI {{began to}} prove itself through early 1940 the RAF {{realised}} that the radar supply would soon outstrip {{the number of}} suitable aircraft available. With large numbers of single-engine single-seat aircraft already in the night fighter units, some way to fit these with radar was desired. The Air Ministry formed the AI Mk. VI Design Committee <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>this</b> {{in the summer of}} 1940. The resulting AI Mk. VI design was essentially a Mk. IVA with an additional system that automatically set the strobe range. With no target visible, the system moved the strobe from its minimum setting to a maximum range of about [...] and then started over at the minimum again. This process took about four seconds. If a target was seen, the strobe would stick to it, allowing the pilot to approach the target using his C-scope. The pilot would fly under ground control until the target suddenly appeared on his pilot indicator, and then intercept it.|$|E
