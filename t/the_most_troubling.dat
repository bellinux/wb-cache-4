5|$|The {{treatment}} of Tourette's focuses on identifying {{and helping the}} individual manage <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> or impairing symptoms. Most cases of Tourette's are mild, and do not require pharmacological treatment; instead, psychobehavioral therapy, education, and reassurance may be sufficient. Treatments, where warranted, {{can be divided into}} those that target tics and comorbid conditions, which, when present, are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves. Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions, but when those conditions are present, they often take treatment priority.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> {{aspect of}} colonizing the patroonships was enlisting the {{required}} number of colonists, {{so that the}} failure {{of many of the}} other proposed patroonships may in part be attributed to this fact. The patroons still dealt with the issues of a cautious people not caring to venture to an undeveloped world. As an owner of extensive lands in the sandy Gooi and of family estates in the not much more fruitful Veluwe, where several relatives were landowners and struggled to subsist on meager means, Van Rensselaer had an advantage — his agents needed to employ little persuasion to induce some Gooiers and Veluwers to migrate to more fruitful regions where the farming would be less difficult. In addition, he could depend on the indirect support of his nephew Wouter van Twiller, who had been appointed Director of New Netherland in 1632, and with whom he engaged in friendly correspondence at a time when Dutch directors opposed the patroons in every way. In 1634 he collaborated with Michael Reyniersz Pauw, the patroon of Pavonia on shipping cattle.|$|E
25|$|MBO55 and -56 {{also had}} {{issues with the}} {{controllers}} and the lubrication of the gear boxes, and the issues were soon corrected. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> issue was a swaying motion when running on the suburban Vignoles rails. The riders complained to no avail until several derailments made the management aware of the severity. A Gullfisk was test-run and {{found to have a}} much smoother ride. A horizontal suspension was added, which helped somewhat to reduce the swaying. This could only be installed on the newer MBO55 and -56 series, as MBO50 had a different bogie design. The issue was never corrected in a satisfactory way.|$|E

25|$|On November 3, 1787, Don Manuel Gayoso de Lemos assumed {{military}} and civil {{command of the}} fort and the newly organized District of Natchez (West Florida), having been appointed district governor by Governor-general Esteban Rodríguez Miró, governor of Louisiana and West Florida. On his arrival, Gayoso de Lemos established an informal cabildo (council) of landed planters which was formalized in 1792. Most of the council were of non-Spanish origin having {{come down from the}} Ohio River Valley settlements (especially Kentucky). Gayoso de Lemos continued to encourage American settlement on Spanish soil, especially by Catholics, notably the Irish and the Scots, and by those who brought significant property. He moved the administrative part of the town of Natchez from the waterfront up onto the bluff. One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> aspects during his civil administration was confusion in the land titles, with a number of inconsistent land grants. Unfortunately, Rodríguez Miró's successor, Governor-general Carondelet was not amenable to rectifying the problem.|$|E

Described by her as one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> shots in {{mainstream}} music videos, the scene was inspired by Madonna's memory of her mother lying in her wake. The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair, that she remembered that her mother's lips looked funny in the funeral. When she got closer, she saw that Madonna Sr's lips had been sewn together. This image of her mother had haunted Madonna for many years, and led her to comment that she never could resolve her Electra complex. The singer further explained: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Thompson {{provided}} the narration for Jason Reitman's film Men, Women & Children, before seeing {{the release of}} a project she had been working on for many years. The period drama Effie Gray, based on the true-life story of art critic John Ruskin's disastrous marriage, was written by Thompson but became the subject of a copyright suit before being cleared for cinemas. [...] The American playwright Gregory Murphy claimed that Thompson's screenplay was an infringement on his play and screenplay The Countess, which deals with the same story. Murphy was initially offered a screenwriting fee and co-screenwriting credit with Thompson by Potboiler Productions, the original producers of Effie Gray, in settlement of his claim, but this settlement offer was impugned by the film's subsequent producers, Ms. Thompson and Donald Rosenfeld, who instigated the suit. In March 2013, the judge in the case, after allowing Thompson to submit a second revised screenplay into evidence from which Murphy claimed [...] "some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> material" [...] had been removed, ruled that while there were similarities, the screenplays were [...] "quite dissimilar in their two approaches to fictionalising the same historical events". Effie Gray was released in October 2014, to a modest reception. [...] Thompson also appeared in the film, alongside her husband Greg Wise and actress Dakota Fanning, but declined to promote it as did Mr. Wise.|$|E

[...] One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>troubling</b> rules going into effect in 1907 limited eligibility to three years.
