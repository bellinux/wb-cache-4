5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, <b>tulip</b> <b>poplar,</b> yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
5|$|Most {{land around}} the oxbow is steep. It {{is covered by}} hemlock and {{hardwood}} forests, as well as skunk cabbage seeps. The forests around the lake also contain black birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, <b>tulip</b> <b>poplar,</b> and Norway maple, while the understory contains slippery elm, European privet, Japanese barberry, American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain laurel, ironwood, and the rare American yew. The American yew population was in significant decline by 2004 due to heavy grazing by deer.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant life}} around the Griffin Reservoir on Leggetts Creek {{includes}} various native trees and understory plants. From the reservoir downstream to an intake pond near Interstate 81, the creek's riparian buffer contains old growth forest, including <b>tulip</b> <b>poplar</b> trees. In addition to tulip popular, hemlock and pine also {{occur in the}} Griffin Mills reach of the creek. Near Leggetts Gap, the creek has some riparian buffering. Even in its lower reaches, the it has a stable vegetative cover in some areas. However, other areas are full of invasive plants. Major invasive plant species include Japanese knotweed, Norway Maple, and Ailanthus. Overall, the riparian buffer of the creek mainly consists of grassland and forested land.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} trees {{grow in the}} forested areas along Donaldson Run, {{including}} <b>tulip</b> <b>poplars,</b> oaks, and beech. However foreign greenery such as English ivy, Japanese honeysuckle, bamboo, garlic mustard have taken {{over much of the}} native undergrowth.|$|R
50|$|The herons roost in {{the eastern}} end with its tall sycamores. As you move towards the west, the woods become denser with beech, <b>tulip</b> <b>poplars</b> and maples. Here, {{there are a variety}} of smaller birds, {{including}} kinglets, wood thrushes, woodpeckers, and warblers.|$|R
50|$|Albright Grove, a {{grove of}} old-growth hemlocks and <b>tulip</b> <b>poplars</b> located in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, was named in Albright's honor. The Albright Training Center at Grand Canyon National Park and the Albright Visitor Center at Yellowstone National Park also bear his name.|$|R
5|$|Forests cover 65% of the state, {{primarily}} with deciduous, broad leaf {{trees in the}} western part of the state and evergreens and conifers dominant the central and eastern part of Virginia. Lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance, with hickory and oak in the Blue Ridge. However, since the early 1990s, Gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests. In the lowland tidewater and piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees and plants include red bay, wax myrtle, dwarf palmetto, <b>tulip</b> <b>poplar,</b> mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The largest areas of wilderness are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found. The Atlantic coast regions are host to flora commonly associated with the South Atlantic pine forests and lower Southeast Coastal Plain maritime flora, the latter found primarily in eastern and central Virginia.|$|E
25|$|It {{also has}} a {{reputation}} for being resistant to termites, and in the Upland South (and perhaps elsewhere) house and barn sills were often made of <b>tulip</b> <b>poplar</b> beams.|$|E
25|$|Another form of {{art that}} the tulip tree is {{a major part of}} is wood carving. The <b>tulip</b> <b>poplar</b> can be very useful and {{has been one of the}} {{favorite}} types of trees for wood carving by sculptors such as Wilhelm Schimmel and Shields Landon Jones.|$|E
50|$|It {{is known}} that foliaceous {{stipules}} are used like leaves to make energy for the plants. Sometimes stipules protect the next leaf or bud as it grows in, then falls off after the leaf unfolds, as with <b>Tulip</b> <b>Poplars.</b> Stipules {{can be used as}} climbing tendrils by climbing plants. Spiny stipules can be used to help protect the plant from animals.|$|R
50|$|The area {{contains}} steep forested hills, deep hollows {{and narrow}} ridge fields. In total, the conservation area consists of 746 acres. The forested track contains hardwood forest, including oaks, <b>tulip</b> <b>poplars</b> and other species, including {{a number of}} majestic old growth. The forest tract has several sinkholes and springs and offers scenic vistas overlooking the Mississippi River Valley. Steep rock bluffs run along the area for approximately two miles.|$|R
5000|$|Samuel Galloway bought Poplar Knowle in 1755, {{renaming}} it [...] "Tulip Hill" [...] after a {{grove of}} <b>tulip</b> <b>poplars.</b> The central portion {{of the house was}} built in 1755-56, supervised by John Devour. The house resembles [...] "Stenton" [...] in Germantown, Pennsylvania, built by Galloway's friend James Logan. Samuel's son John enlarged the house in 1787-90 by adding the end wings, hyphens and portico. The house remained in the Galloway family until 1866.|$|R
25|$|It {{is common}} to find American Windsors made in the 18th century that contain three {{different}} species of wood. Pine, bass or <b>tulip</b> <b>poplar</b> are common for the seat. Non ring porous hardwoods such as Maple are stiff and make crisp turnings, and {{were used for the}} undercarriage. Ring porous species such as Oak, ash, and hickory all rive (split) and steam bend nicely. These woods are also straight grained and flexible and thus work well for slender parts such as the spindles.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} the park, and in turn also its flora and fauna, is largely typical for mountainous regions of the eastern Mid-Atlantic woodland, and indeed {{a large portion of}} common species are typical of {{ecosystems}} at lower altitudes as well. On southwestern faces of some of the southernmost hillsides pine predominates and there is also the occasional prickly pear cactus, which grows naturally. In contrast, some of the northeastern aspects are most likely to have small but dense stands of moisture loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance. Other commonly found plants include oak, hickory, chestnut, maple, <b>tulip</b> <b>poplar,</b> mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The once predominant American chestnut tree was effectively brought to extinction by a fungus known as the chestnut blight during the 1930s – though the tree continues to grow in the park, it does not reach maturity and dies back before it can reproduce. Various species of oaks superseded the chestnuts and became the dominant tree species. Gypsy moth infestations beginning in the early 1990s began to erode the dominance of the oak forests as the moths would primarily consume the leaves of oak trees. Though the Gypsy moths seem to have abated some, they continue to affect the forest and have destroyed almost 10 percent of the oak groves.|$|E
500|$|The Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania {{is known}} for its fall foliage, and Leonard Harrison State Park is a popular place to observe the colors, with the first three weeks of October as the best time to see the leaves in their full color.

40|$|To help {{understand}} {{the effect of}} short term climatic changes on ring width variations of trees on Long Island, time series were performed on 6 Liriondendrin tuliperfera (<b>tulip</b> <b>poplars)</b> and 1 white oak from Caumsett State Park, and 6 Pinus rigidas (pitch pines) from Sears Bellows and Hubbard County Parks. Prolonged drought periods on Long Island occur during years 1927 - 1932, 1960 - 1970 and 1980 - 1988. All trees document drought periods by marked decrease in growth ring width regardless of specie or location. In addition base cations were analyzed in two tulip trees and two pitch pines. Based on {{the limited number of}} trees in this study there is a suggestion that Ca concentration in tree rings may be increasing with time. According to studies done in other areas (Aberg 1995, Bondietti et al 1989, Likens et al 1996), the increase of available base cations such as Ca is a precursor to the impending decrease in its availability due to removal of base cations from the system by acid rain. The implications of an increase in Ca followed by a decrease in Ca available to trees may be detrimental to Long Island’s trees and the Pine Barrens ecosystem...|$|R

2500|$|The {{seat of a}} Windsor {{chair is}} an {{essential}} part since it provides the stability to both the upper and lower portions. The thickness of the seat allows the legs to be anchored securely into their respective tapered sockets, providing the undercarriage with strength and stability. A timber that will provide the strength and stability whilst also allowing it to be shaped, in order to achieve the desired look and feel, requires a strong durable timber, with interlocking grain, to provide the right characteristics. [...] English Windsors typically have elm seats because its interlocking grain gives good cross-grain strength that resists splitting where holes are placed close {{to the edge of a}} seat. There are no real satisfactory alternatives to elm although other woods have been tried, for example, oak and ash in Britain and various types of pine in the USA. [...] Because of elm's strength compared to pine, <b>tulip</b> <b>poplar</b> or bass, English Windsor chair seats are usually not as thick as American Windsors. [...] The English Windsor chair seats are not saddled (or dished) as deeply as their American counterparts- partly because of elm's relative strength, and partly because elm is comparatively more difficult to sculpt than the softer woods chosen by American chair makers. Woodwrights use tools such as the adze, scorp or inshave to form the hollowed out, form fitting, ergonomic top of the seat.|$|E
40|$|Compaction of {{replaced}} soil during reclamation of surface-mined land {{can limit}} trees. Growth, survival, and water relations of bare-root seedlings of six tree species were followed on deep-tilled and untilled minesoil for 2 years after planting. Trees were planted in rows deep-tilled to 0. 7 m and in untilled soil; mowing and herbicides controlled competing vegetation. Leaf area, shoot elongation, and diameter increment were measured in both years, and predawn and midday water potential, and midday stomatal conductance, were {{measured in the}} second year. Survival was 16 – 98 % after the first season, varying more among species than between tillage treatments. Rainfall was 50 % less in the second season, resulting in a progressive decline in predawn water potential in all treatments {{and a decrease in}} survival for several species on untilled soil. Similarly, trees on deep-tilled soil grew slightly more than those on untilled soil in the second season. Tillage effects on survival and growth were not consistently detectable between years, however, and 3 years after planting there were no further changes in survival. Differences in survival and growth among species were large. Survival of black locust was approximately double that of any other species, and its growth was several orders of magnitude greater than that of other species, whereas all of the <b>tulip</b> <b>poplars</b> died {{by the end of the}} second season. Over 2 years it appeared that most species had not grown enough either to exploit fully the deep-tilled soil or to be impeded on the untilled soil such that differences in establishment could be detected.
