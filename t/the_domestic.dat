5|$|From {{the point}} of view of <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a {{transfer}} from the government to the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>domestic</b> cat {{was first}} {{classified}} as Felis catus by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae published in 1758. Because of modern phylogenetics, domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat, F. silvestris. This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> cat can be called by its subspecies name, Felis silvestris catus. Wildcats have also {{been referred to as}} various subspecies of F. catus, but in 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris. The most common name in use for <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> cat remains F. catus. Sometimes, <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> cat has been called Felis domesticus as proposed by German naturalist J.C.P. Erxleben in 1777, but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature. A population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as Felis daemon (Satunin 1904) but now this population {{is considered to be a}} part of domestic cat.|$|E
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the government subsidy, ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy to <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm {{is shown in}} Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E

Introduced predators include the small Indian civet (Viverricula indica), <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> cat and <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> dog.|$|E
5|$|To {{supplement}} their income, {{the inhabitants of}} Milnrow entered <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> system, producing flannel and woollen cloth in purpose-built weavers' cottages, some of which from the Early Modern period have survived as listed buildings. Coalmining and metalworking also flourished in this period, but the Industrial Revolution supplanted <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> industries and converted Milnrow into an urban mill town that mass-produced textile goods in cotton mills, such as Ellenroad Ring Mill (now a museum). The Milnrow Urban District was established in 1894 and was governed thereafter by its own district council until its abolition in 1974.|$|E
5|$|With no {{government}} subsidy (s=0) the resulting equilibrium {{will be the}} standard Cournot outcome, {{as shown in the}} graph by the intersection of the best response functions. A subsidy however has the effect of shifting <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm's best response function to the right. Because its output is subsidized, <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> firm increases production. This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, the market price falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.|$|E

Ray was selected for all six of Victoria’s matches and played in all of these matches alongside Neil, as <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> season was shortened and there were no scheduling clashes between the Tests and <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> matches.
