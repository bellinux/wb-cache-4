40|$|The {{architectural}} {{traits of}} the University {{building and the}} intention of constructing a complex denoted by synergic solutions between architecture and structures have resulted in complex elaboration of the structures {{and the development of}} multiple structural solutions aligned with the requirements of the environments and spaces in order to construct an avant-garde site in terms of live ability, comfort and aesthetic appearance. Structural design was not based on acquisition of the architectural ideas and development of these as the costs, times and materials were already known; the structural elements have become architectural features, elements of aesthetic characterisation and interdisciplinary involvement, reflected for example in art. This particular aspect is clearly evident in the large circular columns, the stairways, skylights, reinforced concrete partition walls and the roof which, combined with bidirectional slabs on large spans, have made it possible to obtain large spaces and broad flexibility in <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> <b>desig...</b>|$|E

40|$|This volume {{contains}} {{the papers in}} the design area from the Third International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Engineering. Design is that most fundamental but least understood of engineering activities. Most current computer-aided design systems are primarily concerned with graphical representations of objects as they are being designed. The introduction of artificial intelligence into engineering has fostered the burgeoning interest in formal methods of engineering design. These methods treat design as being modelable using reasoning processes. The papers related to design can be grouped into two categories: those primarily concerned with design knowledge in its various forms and those primarily concerned with applications in specific domains. The papers in this volume are presented under the following headings: Design Knowledge and Representation, Integrated Circuit Design, Mechanical Engineering Design, Structural Engineering Design, Simultaneous Engineering Design, <b>Architectural</b> <b>Desig...</b>|$|R
40|$|In Finland, {{approximately}} 80 % of the facades of buildingsare manufactured as precast units. Currently one of theobstacles {{to making}} the overall design and construction ofprecast building facades more efficient is the inefficientexchange of data about facades between architects, structuralengineers and precast element manufacturers. The product modelapproach seems to offer a new methodology for data exchange andsharing which would solve many of the current problems. Thisthesis {{presents the results of}} research in which this approachwas tested. The prevailing way of designing facades was chosen as areference process model. Based on an analysis of data needs inthe different stages of the process a product data model of afacade was developed. The product data model was restricted tofacades only and does not include other information about thebuilding. Central data structures in the conceptual schemadefine how a precast concrete facade consists of precastconcrete units, i. e., elements. Structural wall layers that mayhave openings form the elements. The conceptual schema was implemented as a prototype whichwas based on existing software, modified and further developed. The prototype was tested by an architectural design company, astructural design company and a manufacturer. The mainconclusion of testing was that the data produced in thearchitectural design is directly usable in further design. Thestructural or element design may use <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> data assuch. Also, it is possible to create applications that takeinto account the architect's preferred design approach.

40|$|Researchers have {{demonstrated}} the value of replication of research and explicit testing of concepts in artificial intelligence (Ritchie and Hanna 1989). In this study, a rule-based system was implemented as an exercise {{in the application of}} the theory and practice of knowledge-based systems development to <b>architectural</b> design analysis. <b>The</b> test domain was the selection of wall and window assemblies to provide adequate noise reduction given a set of traffic and building site conditions. This domain was chosen for two reasons: (1) considerable detailed heuristic information was available, and (2) it avoided large solutions spaces,'errorful'and time-dependent data, and unreliable knowledge. Development of the system in conjunction with an extensive literature review revealed that publications on construction and performance of rule-based systems provided insufficient detail on key aspects of system architecture. Topics suffering from neglect or insufficiently rigorous treatment included algorithms used in automated inference, methods for selection of inference procedures, the integration of numerical and symbolic processing, the formulation of explanation mechanisms to deal with integrated numerical and symbolic processing, testing methods, and software standardization. Improving the quality and scope of knowledge in these areas is essential if expert systems are to be applied effectively in <b>architectural</b> <b>desig...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract:　 As {{software}} systems {{become more}} complex, the overall system structure or software architecture becomes a central design problem. Recently, software architecture has placed significant importance on components and interactions between them. The component-oriented software architecture (SA) {{is composed of}} components and connectors which play {{a very important role}} in SA. One of architecture research focus is architecture style, and now there are many architecture styles such as client- server system, layered system, blackboard organization and so on which have been used widely. Nonetheless, the existing connector models can only allow the specific SA styles, and lack a general connector model to support them. This paper abstracts the essential of different taxonomies of software connectors, and makes the connectors composed by fine-grained elements, each of which represents a single, well- defined function. And then a general connector model is presented to describe different connector types, which can also extends itself to admit different SA styles’composition. We can also put some non-functional properties such as distribution element, security element and fault- tolerance element into the general connector model. Another research focus is architectural design languages. They help the architectures’design and facilitate the designers’communication.

30|$|A {{most natural}} move is perhaps {{identifying}} {{it with the}} content of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design. But this move will reveal hasty. For the content of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design often contains too little information in respect to the abstract entity the work should consist in, if at all. Architectural works are often constituted also by properties over which <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design normally remains silent, such as, environmental, geographical or social properties. In fact, if we imagine to {{have the capability to}} relocate buildings to a far way location after meticulous stone-by-stone transfer, still we must admit that some of <b>the</b> corresponding <b>architectural</b> works would not survive the change. For example, Palazzo Sansedoni, or the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral, would not survive a relocation to Tokyo—while an anonymous block of flats probably would (Bacchini 2017). I take the reason to be that some architectural works, but not all, are to be broadly identified. By contrast, taking <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> work to reside in the content of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design normally is identifying it narrowly. This is the first reason why we should abstain from always equating the abstract entity <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> work may consist in with the content of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{concentrates}} on the experiences acquired in <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design studios which are a prominent part of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> education, and evaluates also the effects the space where the project is being put to life has on an architectural product. In this sense, this study includes mainstream design approaches, {{based on the idea}} that an inter-dependence is mandatory between space, context and <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> outcome; and also contarian ones which criticizes this interaction. This paper aims to weigh the potential that these two different approaches discover whilst interacting with space against the conceptualization and spatialisation methods through the design process. In order to do so, the study advances in two separate stages: The first stage develops a discussion of the mainstream design approaches, which are based on the a priori and urgent interaction of <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> product with <b>the</b> space and context, and evaluates also <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> discourses opposing these ideas. The second section has chosen to dissect two different architectural design studio experiences of Bomonti [B] and Seyrantepe [S], (Districts located both in Istanbul) based on the context set forth in the first section. Thus in this manner, six student studies with architectural products relating to different districts of Istanbul have been chosen from these design studios and they have been evaluated on the basis of interaction they have implemented with space. The conclusion of the study is that <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design process incorporates multiple potentials to <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> understanding, and that the education given in <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> design studios carries an important responsibility in the development of the design approaches. In this sense, as an independent platform, <b>the</b> <b>architectural</b> education is seen as a valuable laboratory, which has the ability to expose the embedded potentials of space and its design...|$|R
