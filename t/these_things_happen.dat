The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from point to point and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen,</b> but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E
25|$|The player, {{who sits}} in an office, is {{given access to}} a network of {{security}} cameras throughout the facility to track {{the movement of the}} animatronics. Each character roams the restaurant and has distinct movement patterns, and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are dimly lit and distorted, one of the rooms only contains an audio feed, and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics. Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out. Once <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>happen,</b> the Toreador March will play, the screen will go pitch black, and the player will be jumpscared by Freddy, provided they do not reach {{the end of the night}} in the meantime. If the player is jumpscared by any of the animatronics, the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning of the night.|$|E

[...] During my lifetime, I made no contributions to the people, and I should not harm them in my death. [...] I hope that you will not build a tomb to cause the people to labor and the empire to waste resources. [...] Make a hill my tomb, and only use brick or wooden implements in the tomb. [...] I hope that Your Imperial Majesty will continue to be close to honest men and stay away from those lacking virtues; that you will accept faithful words and reject wicked flattery; that you will decrease labor and stop hunting.
