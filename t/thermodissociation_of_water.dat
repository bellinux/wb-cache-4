40|$|AbstractSinglet oxygen {{generated}} {{in a dark}} reaction by <b>thermodissociation</b> <b>of</b> an endoperoxide (NDPO 2) elicits an increase in mRNA of interstitial collagenase (MMP- 1) in cultured human fibroblasts. The effect is enhanced in deuterium oxide-based medium and is abolished {{in the presence of}} non-toxic doses of sodium azide. In contrast, the mRNA level of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP- 1) remains unaltered under these experimental conditions. These observations support the suggestion that an unbalanced synthesis of collagenase and TIMP reported to occur following UV-A irradiation or during inflammatory conditions may be mediated by singlet oxygen...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a simple and}} rapid method to dissociate antigen-antibody complexes to allow antigen detection by radioimmunoassay. Immunoglobulins and immune complexes were precipitated from serum in 50 %-saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in distilled water and heated at 90 degrees C for 15 min to free the antigen and denature the antibody irreversibly. With this treatment, the sensitivity for detecting staphylococcal antigen added to human serum improved {{greater than or equal}} to 16 -fold and was similar to the sensitivity in buffer. After intravenous injection of antigen into a rabbit with high levels of staphylococcal antibodies, antigen was detected only after thermodissociation. Also, in 4 of 26 patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, circulating antigen was detected after <b>thermodissociation.</b> <b>Thermodissociation</b> <b>of</b> immune complexes is a simple, rapid method and should be useful for detecting other heat-stable antigens...|$|R
40|$|Singlet oxygen {{has been}} {{postulated}} to be generated by Ultraviolet (UV) A irradiation of mammalian cells. We studied {{the role of}} singlet oxygen in the down-stream signaling of the complex UV response leading to the induction of matrix-metalloproteinase- 1 (interstitial collagenase/MMP- 1). Exposure of cultured human fibroblasts to singlet oxygen, generated in a dark reaction by <b>thermodissociation</b> <b>of</b> the endoperoxide of the disodium salt of 3, 3 '-(1, 4 -naphthylidene) dipropionate (NDPO 2) induced collagenase mRNA steady state levels in a dose dependent manner. The increase in collagenase expression after singlet-oxygen exposure generated with 3 mM NDPO 2 was equivalent to that observed with UVA at a dose rate of 200 - 300 kJ/m 2 and developed in a similar time course, In contrast, mRNA levels of TIMP- 1, the specific tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, remained unchanged. Indirect evidence {{for the role of}} singlet oxygen in the UVA induction of collagenase comes from studies using singlet oxygen enhancer or quencher. Accordingly, incubation in deuterium oxide, an enhancer of singlet-oxygen lifetime, led to an additional increase in steady-state levels of collagenase mRNA after exposure to NDPO 2 or to UVA irradiation, In contrast, sodium azide, a potent quencher of singlet oxygen, almost totally abrogated the induction of collagenase after exposure of fibroblasts to NDPO 2 or to UVA irradiation. Similar results were obtained in studies of the proteins by radioimmunoprecipitation of MMP- 1 and TIMP- 1 using specific antibodies, Collectively, our data provide circumstantial evidence that singlet oxygen mediates the UVA induction of collagenase in vitro, whereas It does not exert any effect on TIMP- 1 synthesis. The unbalanced synthesis of Interstitial collagenase may contribute to the connective tissue damage in viva related to photoaging and other photocutaneous disorders...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to clarify the optimum number <b>of</b> <b>watering</b> plants per porous pipe {{from the point of}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> supply under the sub-irrigation method of using {{negative}} pressure difference.
