40|$|Particulate matter {{settling}} {{out of the}} <b>trophogenic</b> <b>layer</b> {{was collected}} in sediment traps at five stations during 5 yr in a coastal area of the Baltic Sea. Al, Fe, and Ti in the intercepted matter were inferred to bc due mainly {{to the presence of}} fine-grained bedrock detritus and were used as markers to calculate the proportion of primary settling matter and resuspended sediment in the collected matter. Considerable variations within and between years, seasons, and nearby stations were found for gross sedimentation rate and for the ratio between primary settling matter and resuspended sediment. This pattern also applied to organic C. A predominance of primary settling matter was recorded mainly in spring. Resuspended matter was a large component in the annual budget for all years and stations. In fact, the resuspended portion commonly exceeded 50 %, and periods without resuspension seem to occur rarely or never in the investigated area. The settling rate of particulate matter is a key variable in studies on pelagic biological production and benthic food supply, in efforts to model flows of energy and matter in eco-systems, in geochemical and biogeochemical mass balance calculations, and in studies on dispersion and dynamics of particle-borne el-ements and contaminants. Commonly, esti-mates of settling flux are obtained by means of sediment traps (Reynolds et al. 1980...|$|E
40|$|Abstract As long as {{lakes and}} {{reservoirs}} are an impor-tant {{component of the}} global carbon cycle, monitoring of their metabolism is required, especially in the tropics. In particular, the response of deep reservoirs to water-level fluctuations (WLF) is an understudied field. Here, we study community metabolism through oxygen dy-namics in a deepmonomictic reservoir where highWLF (~ 10 m) have recently occurred. Simultaneous monitor-ing of environmental variables and zooplankton dynam-ics {{was used to assess}} the effects of WLF on the metab-olism of the eutrophic Valle de Bravo (VB) reservoir, where cyanobacteria blooms are frequent. Mean gross primary production (Pg) was high (2. 2 g C m − 2 day− 1), but temporal variation of Pg was low except for a drastic reduction during circulation attributed to zooplankton grazing. The <b>trophogenic</b> <b>layer</b> showed net autotrophy on an annual basis, but turned to net heterotrophy during mixing, and furthermore when the whole water-column oxygen balance was calculated, considering the aphotic respiration (Raphotic). The high total respiration resulting (3. 1 g C m− 2 day− 1) is considered to be partly due to mixing enhanced by WLF. Net ecosystem production was equivalent to a net export of 3. 4 mg CO 2 m − 2 day− 1 to the atmosphere. Low water levels are posed to inten-sify boundary-mixing events driven by the wind during the stratification in VB. Long-term monitoring showed changes in the planktonic community and a strong sili-con decrease that matched with low water-level periods. The effects of low water-level onmetabolism and plank-tonic community in VB suggest that water-level manip-ulation could be a useful management tool to promote phytoplankton groups other than cyanobacteria...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a synoptic {{account of the}} most important results emerging from studies on the phytoplankton communities in the deep southern subalpine lakes Garda, Iseo, Como, Lugano and Maggiore (DSL) {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s. At present, the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>layers</b> of these lakes are trophically different, ranging from the oligo-mesotrophy of lakes Maggiore and Garda to the meso-eutrophy of lakes Iseo and Lugano. The research confirmed the existence of a common pool of species developing in the DSL, as already suggested by early studies conducted on a seasonal basis from the end of the 1970 s to the first half of the 1980 s. However, multivariate analyses (Correspondence Analysis, CA, and a subsequent application of Non Metric Multidimensional Scaling) demon-strated that the species in this common pool were developing differently or exclusively along a geographic and a trophic gradient. The major differences in the geographic distribution were found between the easternmost lakes (Garda and Iseo) and those farthest to the West (Lugano and, partly, Maggiore), with intermediate characteristics in Lake Como. These differences were due mainly to changes in the dominance relationships and only secondarily to compositional changes. The detection of the ultimate causes of these differences should take into account other factors not considered in the paper (i. e. the specific analysis of the food webs, local climatic conditions, hydrology and seasonal input of nutrients). Despite the observed differences, common patterns in the sequence o...|$|R
40|$|La {{composition}} et la distribution spatio-temporelle des ciliés du Lac Municipal de Yaoundé (Cameroun) ont été analysées d’avril à décembre 1997, en relation avec des paramètres physico-chimiques du milieu. Trois stations pélagiques et l’herbier littoral ont été échantillonnés. 58  espèces de protistes ciliés ont pu être identifiées, parmi lesquelles environ 60  % d’espèces littorales et périphytiques et 37  % d’espèces pélagiques. Les espèces les plus courantes sont les espèces pélagiques Uronema nigricans et Coleps hirtus. L’abondance saisonnière des ciliés a atteint une valeur maximale de 21   800  ind•L- 1, les valeurs les plus élevées étant enregistrées dans la couche trophogène du lac, particulièrement au cours de la grande saison des pluies. Les variations de la biomasse totale des ciliés sont plus faibles, avec des maxima correspondant également aux fortes pluies. Les espèces dominantes en matière de biomasse sont Prorodon africanum, Coleps hirtus et Uronema nigricans. Enfin, les fluctuations saisonnières de l’abondance et de la biomasse des ciliés sont discutées en relation avec les paramètres environnementaux, parmi lesquels le régime pluvial tient apparemment un rôle central. The Municipal Lake of Yaoundé (3 °  51 ’  37 ’’ N and 11 °  30 ’  40 ’’ E) is {{a shallow}} water body (Zm =  4. 3 m), situated in downtown Yaoundé, the political capital of Cameroon (Central Africa). The composition and the spatio-temporal distribution of ciliates {{in combination with}} physical and chemical water variables were measured in this lake from April to December 1997. Sampling was carried out weekly, at 5  depths (surface, 0. 5 m, 1 m, 1. 5 m and 2. 5 m) and at 3  pelagic stations, A, B and C, representing the upper, middle and the lower parts of the lake, using a Van Dorn sampling bottle. In the littoral station, the periphytic fauna is collected by agitation of the vegetation in a bucket and filtration of water. The water temperature was measured with a thermometer and the pH was measured in the field with a portable pH-meter. The oxygen concentration was determined according to the Winkler method and the transparency of the water column was determined with a Secchi disk. Light availability was measured with a luxmeter. Water colour, suspended solids and ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4 -N) were analyzed spectrophotometrically using APHA methods. Ciliate species were identified using appropriate and specific keys and were counted under a stereomicroscope at magnifications of 250 X and 500 X. Results showed that the lake was hypereutrophic. Throughout the study, the temperature and pH values of the water remained around 25 °C and 7, respectively. The dissolved oxygen concentration decreased with depth to almost zero at the lake bottom, while the Secchi disk transparency did not exceed 1  m. Spatio-temporal variations of these variables indicated that the middle zone (0. 5 to 1. 5  m) was the stratum with {{a critical role in}} the functioning of the lake. Indeed, it represented the transitional zone between the <b>trophogenic</b> upper <b>layer</b> where photosynthetic activity occurred and the bottom water layer, formed by the microaerophilic to anaerobic tropholitic layers where reducing processes were important. Fifty-eight ciliate species, belonging to 10 orders and 28  families, were identified among which five (Holophrya sp., Lagynophrya rostrata, Lagynophrya simplex, Pseudoprorodon sp. and Histriculus sp.) were new records for Cameroon fauna. This population contained 62 % of littoral species and 37 % of pelagic species respectively. Within these taxa, dominant species were Uronema nigricans (present at all pelagic stations) and Coleps hirtus (present at more than 97 % of the pelagic stations). Their abundance was greater than 2, 000 ind•L- 1 during the study period showing variation with many peaks. Prorodon africanum occurred sporadically between October and November when rainfall decreased and their densities reached 5, 700 ind•L- 1 in November at 0. 5 m depth at station A. After November, this species was replaced by Prorodon sp. Most of the species collected were cosmopolite or characteristic of shallow tropical water bodies. The total abundance of the ciliate community was high reaching 21, 800 ind•L- 1 at station A, at 0. 5  m depth. According to several authors, the abundance of ciliates in such tropical water bodies varies from 3. 6 to 9. 75 x 104 ind•L- 1. The highest abundances were observed at depths of 0. 5  m to 1. 5  m at all 3  stations, especially during the rainy season. This corroborated the importance and the role of this stratum in the functioning of Lake Yaoundé. The lowest abundance of ciliates was observed at station A, at the bottom (2. 5  m depth). The total abundance of ciliates showed one or several peaks during the period from July to November. With respect to the total biomass, the variation was more regular with generally one peak during the rainy season. At certain depths at stations B and C, several peaks were observed during the period of April to June and from September to November. The total biomass values obtained were higher than those reported by other authors. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that reported values in these latter studies were expressed as dry weight while values reported in this study were expressed as wet weight. With respect to biomass, the dominant species was Prorodon africanum (5, 300  µg•L- 1), followed by Coleps hirtus (3, 800  µg•L- 1) and Uronema nigricans (3, 100  µg•L- 1). The highest biomass was 130 x 105  µg•L- 1, and was observed at station A, at 0. 5  m depth. Generally large size ciliates were more abundant during the dry season whereas small size species were abundant during rainy season. Chilodonella uncinata and Prorodon africanum grew in surface layers (between the surface and 1  m depth) while Paradileptus conicus and Uronema nigricans preferred deep water (1 to 2. 5  m depth). There was a great development of ciliates during the transitional period between the rainy and dry seasons. Moreover there was a close relationship between environmental parameters and the ciliate community. In fact, 2 to 3 physico-chemical predictors (dissolved oxygen, temperature and conductivity or pH) explained spatio-temporal distributions of different species. The variation of the total biomass in station A was explained by the dissolved oxygen concentration (r 2  =  0. 366; p< 0. 001) and by the pH (r 2  =  0. 274; p< 0. 001); at stations B and C, the variation was explained by ammonium-nitrogen (r 2  =  0. 178 and r 2  =  0. 294 for p< 0. 01). The most important abiotic factor that influenced the density and biomass variation of ciliate communities of Lake Yaoundé was the precipitation rate. Throughout the study, station B was the most characteristic of the structure of the ciliate community of this lake...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{adequately}} assess the ecological status of thermally stratified lakes based on chlorophyll, the sampling must cover all productive {{layers of the}} water column. Missing the deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) that often occur in the meta- or hypolimnion of transparent lakes supported by sufficient illumination and good nutrient availability, may cause serious underestimation of the productivity and lead to misclassification of the lake ecological status. There is no commonly accepted sampling design for stratified lakes and various monitoring guides suggest controversial designs. Our aim was to find some robust criteria to assess the probability of occurrence of a DCM and estimate the differences in measured mean chlorophyll concentrations caused by various sampling designs. Our theoretical model showed that the probability of occurrence of a DCM increases with increasing water transparency and decreasing lake size. Empirical data from Italian and Estonian stratified lakes confirmed the results. Testing of different sampling designs on lakes with full measured chlorophyll profiles available showed that taking only surface layer samples will lead with a high probability to an underestimation of the chlorophyll concentration in the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>layer.</b> In order not to miss the Chl peak in stratified lakes, in most cases {{it would be more}} precautious not to limit the sampling with the well-mixed epilimnion but to extend it to the euphotic layer. Sampling epilimnion instead of euphotic zone could cause up to 70 % underestimation of Chl concentration, an error that would cause a misclassification of the lake by one or even two status classes in a 5 -class assessment system. In most cases, the 2. 5 *Secchi depths proved a suitable criterion of the sampling depth and only in case of surface scums, sampling of a 3 *Secchi depth layer would be recommended in order to not miss the deep chlorophyll maximum.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the evolution of}} 13 C and 15 N of sedimenting particulate organic matter (SPOM) in response to changes in primar y productivity, nutrient loading, and plankton dynamics in Lake Lugano between 1985 and 1998. A decreasing 13 C reects the decline of phosphorus loading in Lake Lugano, suggesting that the 13 C of SPOM is a good indicator of P availability in the lake, with phosphate being the major control on the CO 2 draw-down in the photic zone. However, annual primar y production and 13 C do not correlate. The expansion of the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>layer</b> in response to lowered plankton biomass concentrations balanced the effect of reduced phosphate concentration on total primar y production (per unit area) and, thus, biased the correlation of 13 C and primar y productivity. Whereas a substantial decrease of total phytoplankton biomass in the late 1980 s clearly affected the 13 C of SPOM, {{it did not seem}} to affect 15 N. Marked changes in the plankton population composition did not have a major effect on 15 N. If at all, the effects of primar y productivity, nitrate utilization, and changes in the intensity of denitrication are superimposed on a signal dominantly derived from changes in the amount and isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from external sources. A marked positive shift (3 ‰) in the 15 N obser ved in 1994 / 1995 corresponded to the introduction of a denitrication stage in wastewater treatment. This study demonstrates that the 13 C of exported organic matter is a useful indicator of the trophic state of lacustrine environments. The 15 N of sedimentar y organic matter is unlikely to reect nitrate utilization or denitrication if the input of external N sources dominates the N-isotope dynamics within the lake. However, in those systems, organic matter 15 N can provide information on the development of N pollution and subsequent effects of lake restoration measures...|$|E
40|$|Aquatic mineral {{measurements}} and sediment {{characterization of the}} Cedar River basin lakes and streams reveals two largely distinct physical and chemical environments. Near {{the headwaters of the}} Cedar River Watershed the composition of lakes and streams reflect adjacent rocks but the effects of forest and agricultural practices and of processes occurring downstream very quickly alter the composition to a type largely responsive to the urbanization in the lower reaches of the watershed. The relative ionic composition in the watershed is: Ca > Mg ≥ Na > K and HCO₃ > Cl ≥ S 0 ₄. A 2 - to 10 -fold increase in concentration is measured with most chemical parameters when comparing upper watershed to lower watershed. The lowest increase is observed with total phosphorus reflecting perhaps identical phosphorus solubility control mechanisms. Annual nutrient budgets for Lake Sammamish suggest a reduction in sedimented phosphorus since diversion, but little change in the quantity of phosphorus released from anaerobic sediment. Although the sediment phosphorus supply during the summer and fall months is nearly three times higher than the external phosphorus supply its relative contribution to the <b>trophogenic</b> <b>layer</b> phosphorus is a function of lake mixing. An iron precipitation mechanism appears to control the mean winter phosphorus contents of Lake Sammamish. The prevailing anoxic conditions in the lake during late summer and fall bring about large increases in hypolimnetic iron concentrations which upon destratification precipitate phosphorus as an iron (111) hydroxy complex. Lake sediment characterization indicate differences between lakes with respect to carbon/nitrogen, nitrogen/phosphorus and particle size distribution reflecting drastic variations in the depositional environments and trophic status of the upper and lower watersheds. Higher carbon/nitrogen and nitrogen/phosphorus ratios and coarser sediments are measured in oligotrophic Findley Lake. With the exception of Findley Lake, all sediments appear to have the same composition with respect to Fe, Mn, Ca, Mg, Na, and K contents. Simulation of sediment phosphorus release at the sediment-water interface In enclosed in situ Lake Sammamish sediment-water columns appears to parallel the phosphorus release measured in the lake hypolimnion {{at the peak of the}} lake stagnation period. Preliminary studies indicate that it will be possible to relate the nutrient release results from the in situ columns to those of laboratory studies, arriving thus at a faster more economically obtained elucidation of the nutrient exchange mechanisms and potentials at lake sediment-water interface...|$|E
