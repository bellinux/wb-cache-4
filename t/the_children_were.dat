5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> {{forced to}} go to church to pray, and were {{required}} to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat the children with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E

Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E

5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} {{that they were}} fed a variety of foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, beets and similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, but very little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> systematically punished for various infractions, and were treated harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} the nuns. Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love and attention to the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E

In 1917, Franklin often included Mercer in his summer yachting parties, which Eleanor usually declined to attend.|$|E

The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on Carpathia by 09:00.
