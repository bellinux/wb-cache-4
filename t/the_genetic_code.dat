5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code.</b> <b>The</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code.</b> In general, <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E
5|$|In 2015 N. Budisa, D. Söll and {{co-workers}} reported the full substitution of all 20,899 tryptophan residues (UGG codons) with unnatural thienopyrrole-alanine in <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> of the bacterium Escherichia coli.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>codes</b> have degeneracy; that is, most {{amino acids}} (18 out of 20 in <b>the</b> {{universal}} <b>genetic</b> <b>code)</b> are encoded {{by more than}} one codon. Codons encoding the same amino acid are called synonymous codons. Both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes, the synonymous codons are not used with equal frequencies...|$|R
50|$|GNC {{hypothesis}} or GNC-SNS primeval <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> hypothesis {{refers to}} a hypothesis {{about the origin of}} genes. While almost all of the organisms on present Earth shares <b>the</b> universal <b>genetic</b> <b>code,</b> in GNC hypothesis it is argued that two primeval <b>genetic</b> <b>codes</b> preceded <b>the</b> present <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> as follows.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{encoding}} {{provides a}} generic construction scheme for biomolecular functions. This paper addresses the key problem of coevolution and {{exploitation of the}} multiple components necessary to implement a replicable genetic encoding scheme. Extending earlier results on multicomponent replication, the necessity of spatial structure for the evolutionary stabilization of <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>coding</b> system is established. An individual-based stochastic model of interacting molecules in three-dimensional space is presented that allows <b>the</b> evolution of <b>genetic</b> <b>coding</b> to be analyzed explicitly. A massively parallel configurable computer (NGEN) is used to implement the model, on the time scale of millions of generations, directly in electronic hardware. The spatial correlations between components of <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>coding</b> system are analyzed and found to be essential for evolutionary stability...|$|R
5|$|Optimality: <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> {{continued}} to evolve after its initial creation, {{so that the}} current code maximizes some fitness function, usually some kind of error minimization.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> is the set {{of rules}} by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation is accomplished by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. <b>The</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} the optimality of a doublet precursor to <b>the</b> canonical <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> {{with respect to}} mitigating the effects of point mutations and compare our results to corresponding ones for <b>the</b> canonical <b>genetic</b> <b>code.</b> We find that the proposed precursor has much less optimality {{than that of the}} canonical code. Our results render unlikely the notion that the doublet precursor was an intermediate state in the evolution of <b>the</b> canonical <b>genetic</b> <b>code.</b> These findings support the notion that code optimality reflects evolutionary dynamics, and that if such a doublet code originally had a biochemical significance, it arose before the emergence of translation...|$|R

5|$|Stereochemical {{affinity}}: <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> is {{a result}} of a high affinity between each amino acid and its codon or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA molecules matched their corresponding amino acids by this affinity. Later during evolution, this matching was gradually replaced with matching by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has led to}} codon assignments of <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> that {{minimize the}} effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{differences}} {{should be regarded as}} pseudo-changes in <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> due to the phenomenon of RNA editing, which is common in mitochondria. In higher plants, it was thought that CGG encoded for tryptophan and not arginine; however, the codon in the processed RNA was discovered to be the UGG codon, consistent with the standard genetic code for tryptophan. Of note, the arthropod mitochondrial genetic code has undergone parallel evolution within a phylum, with some organisms uniquely translating AGG to lysine.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent work by Har Gobind Khorana {{identified}} {{the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code.</b> Shortly thereafter, Robert W. Holley determined the structure of transfer RNA (tRNA), the adapter molecule that facilitates the process of translating RNA into protein. This work was based upon Ochoa's earlier studies, yielding the latter the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for work on the enzymology of RNA synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine. This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context and it is referred to as functional translational readthrough.|$|E
5|$|The code defines how {{sequences}} of nucleotide triplets, called codons, specify which amino acid {{will be added}} next during protein synthesis. With some exceptions, a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme {{is often referred to}} as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code,</b> though variant codes (such as in human mitochondria) exist.|$|E

50|$|However, the Deviants were {{masters of}} science, having perfected cloning and other genetic {{manipulation}} tools whilst mainstream humanity were {{still living in}} caves; this was demonstrated by the beast Spore, an unstoppable creature capable of assimilating <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>codes</b> of any creature assimilated into its mass.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> is a {{key part}} of the story of life. The main {{hypothesis}} for life's origin is the RNA world hypothesis. Any model for the emergence of genetic code is intimately related to a model of the transfer from ribozymes (RNA enzymes) to proteins as the principal enzymes in cells. In line with the RNA world hypothesis, transfer RNA molecules appear to have evolved before modern aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, so the latter cannot be part of the explanation of its patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of a gene's DNA specifies the {{amino acid sequence}} of a protein through <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code.</b> Sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each correspond to a specific amino acid. The principle that three sequential bases of DNA code for each amino acid was demonstrated in 1961 using frameshift mutations in the rIIB gene of bacteriophage T4 (see Crick, Brenner et al. experiment).|$|E
5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code,</b> these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E
50|$|The GADV-protein world {{hypothesis}} was first proposed by Kenji Ikehara at Nara Women's University. It {{is supported by}} GNC-SNS primitive gene code hypothesis (GNC hypothesis) also formulated by him. In the GNC hypothesis, the origin of <b>the</b> present standard <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> {{is considered to be}} <b>the</b> GNC <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> that includes <b>the</b> codons GGC, GCC, GAC, GUC, respectively coding glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, and valine; it also follows <b>the</b> SNS primitive <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> that codes 10 amino acids where N denotes arbitrary four RNA bases and S denotes guanine (G) and cytosine (C).|$|R
50|$|Two parents {{carrying}} a mutated gene and passing {{it on to}} their offspring cause the disease. Even with both parents carrying the disease in their genome, {{there is only a}} 25% chance that they will have a child containing <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>coding</b> for <b>the</b> disease (see figure right).|$|R
25|$|By mutating aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, chemists have {{expanded}} <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>codes</b> of various organisms to include lab-synthesized amino acids {{with all kinds}} of useful properties: photoreactive, metal-chelating, xenon-chelating, crosslinking, spin-resonant, fluorescent, biotinylated, and redox-active amino acids. Another use is introducing amino acids bearing reactive functional groups for chemically modifying the target protein.|$|R
5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} where {{information}} in DNA, called <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code,</b> is used to produce RNA copies called messenger RNA (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to ribosomes where {{it is used to}} make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.|$|E
5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E
5|$|Amino acids are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet Union and The Russian Parliament {{bestowed}} on Brekhman the Order of Lenin, The Lenin Medal for valiant work, {{as well as}} the Certificate of Honour. These awards came to him for studying <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>codes</b> of plants, uncovering the molecular structures of their phytochemicals, and his lifetime work with adaptogens.|$|R
500|$|Variations on the {{standard}} code were predicted in the 1970s. The first was discovered in 1979, by researchers studying human mitochondrial genes. Many slight variants were discovered thereafter, including various alternative mitochondrial codes. Small variants such as translation of the codon UGA as tryptophan in Mycoplasma species, and translation of CUG as a serine rather than leucine in yeasts of the [...] "CTG clade" [...] (such as Candida albicans). Because viruses must use <b>the</b> same <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> as their hosts, modifications to <b>the</b> standard <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> could interfere with viral protein synthesis or functioning. However, viruses such as totiviruses adapted to <b>the</b> host's <b>genetic</b> <b>code</b> modification. In bacteria and archaea, GUG and UUG are common start codons. In rare cases, certain proteins may use alternative start codons.|$|R
40|$|First, {{mathematical}} formulae faithfully {{describing the}} distributions of amino acids and codons and reproducing the degeneracies in <b>the</b> various known <b>genetic</b> <b>codes,</b> including <b>the</b> standard <b>genetic</b> <b>code,</b> are constructed, by hand. Second, we summarize another mathematical approach {{relying on the}} use of q-deformations to describe these same <b>genetic</b> <b>codes,</b> and add a new application not considered before. Third, by considering these same <b>genetic</b> <b>codes,</b> we find, qualitatively, that an inverse symmetry-information relationship exists...|$|R
