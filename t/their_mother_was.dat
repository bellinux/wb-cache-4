5|$|Albert and his elder brother, Ernest, {{spent their}} youth {{in a close}} {{companionship}} marred by their parents' turbulent marriage and eventual separation and divorce. After <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> exiled from court in 1824, she married her lover, Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Polzig and Beiersdorf. She presumably never saw her children again, and died of cancer {{at the age of}} 30 in 1831. The following year, their father married his own niece, his sons' cousin Princess Antoinette Marie of Württemberg; their marriage was not close, however, and Antoinette Marie had little—if any—impact on her stepchildren's lives.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley wrote Midas in 1820. Miranda Seymour, a Mary Shelley biographer, {{speculates that}} she wrote Midas and Proserpine for two young girls she met and befriended, Laurette and Nerina Tighe. They were {{the daughters of}} friends of the Shelleys in Italy and <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> a former pupil of Mary Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft. The same year, she wrote the children's story Maurice for Laurette.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} {{were born to}} a plebeian branch {{of the old and}} noble Sempronia family. Their father was the elderly Tiberius Gracchus the Elder (or Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus) who was tribune of the plebs, praetor, consul, and censor. <b>Their</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> a patrician; Cornelia Africana daughter of Scipio Africanus himself considered a hero by the Roman populace for his part in the war against Carthage. Their parents had 12 children, but only one daughter - who later married Scipio Aemilianus (Scipio Africanus the Younger) - and two sons, Tiberius and Gaius, survived childhood.|$|E

40|$|Background: Zinc {{and copper}} {{belong to the}} {{essential}} trace metals needed for optimal growth and development. Measurement of serum zinc and copper in maternal blood and cord blood of neonates was carried out to study and compare the level of trace metals in term and preterm neonates and <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Methods: 152 healthy neonates, both term and preterm and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> selected. Measurement of serum zinc and copper {{was carried out by}} atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Findings: The mean serum zinc level in the term neonates and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>was</b> 0. 83 µg/ml and 0. 62 µg/ml respectively. The mean serum zinc level in the preterm neonates and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>was</b> 0. 78 µg/ml and 0. 47 µg/ml respectively. The mean serum copper level in the term neonates and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>was</b> 0. 55 µg/ml and 2. 29 µg/ml respectively. The mean serum copper level in the preterm neonates and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>was</b> 0. 63 µg/ml and 2. 17 µg/ml respectively. Cord blood zinc level was significantly higher and cord blood copper level was significantly lower than the corresponding maternal blood levels (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: There {{was no significant difference between}} cord blood zinc and copper levels in term and preterm neonates. The serum levels of zinc in both maternal and cord blood seem to be lower in our sample population compared to the levels found by other authors...|$|R
5|$|After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's {{personal}} {{photographs and}} belongings removed {{and some of}} them destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended the house to be a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new King had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to them by <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.|$|E
5|$|Alcmene {{belongs to}} the Pelopid line—her mother Lysidice was a {{daughter}} of Pelops and Hippodameia—, and the passages preceding her Ehoie also concern Pelopids. Three of Pelops' daughters married sons of Perseus: Lysidice married Electryon, Nicippe wed Sthenelus, and Astydameia wed Alcaeus. Nicippe and Sthenelus' daughter Astymedusa married Oedipus, and at the funeral games in his honor his son Polynices {{caught the eye of}} his future wife Argeia, the daughter of Adrastus. Pelops' son Atreus was the father of Pleisthenes who, contrary to the better known genealogy, was the father of Agamemnon and Menelaus. <b>Their</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> Aerope, the daughter of Catreus, and their births were reported in the verses directly preceding the Ehoie of Alcmene.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year of his life, George was the only heir to the German territories of his father and three childless uncles. George's brother, Frederick Augustus, was born in 1661, and the two boys (known as Görgen and Gustchen by the family) were brought up together. <b>Their</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> absent for almost a year (1664–65) during a long convalescent holiday in Italy, but corresponded {{regularly}} with her sons' governess and took a great interest in their upbringing, even more so upon her return. Sophia bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter. In her letters, Sophia describes George as a responsible, conscientious child who set an example to his younger brothers and sisters.|$|E

50|$|As the war ended, the {{children}} and <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>were</b> made outcasts by many among the general populace in formerly occupied countries, as societies grieved and resented the losses of the war, and actively rejected everything associated with Germany.

5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr and {{his brother}} Harald that the Nazis {{considered}} their family to be Jewish, since <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> Jewish, {{and that they were}} therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1956, Bánáthy was {{naturalized}} as a United States citizen.

Teague; Ernest Nagy, Vice Consul in the U.S. Legation in Budapest; Hulda Neiburh of the McCormick Theological Seminary; and Howard Pyle, deputy assistant to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

5|$|Stephen's second (or third) wife, Maria of Mangup, was of {{the family}} of the princes of Theodoro. She was {{probably}} also cousins with the Muscovite Grand Princess Sophia Palaiologina, and was related to Trebizond's royal couple, Emperor David and Empress Maria. The Stephen–Maria marriage took place in September 1472, but she died in December 1477. During her brief stay in Moldavia, Maria supported the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople, contributing to the friendly contacts between Stephen and Catholic powers. Stephen's third (or fourth) wife, Maria Voichița, was the daughter of Radu the Fair, Voivode of Wallachia. She was the mother of Stephen's immediate successor, Bogdan, and a daughter named Maria Cneajna. The latter married into the House of Sanguszko. Stephen is known to have fathered two other sons who died in childhood, {{at a time when he}} was married to Maria Voichița: Bogdan died in 1479, and Peter (Petrașco) in 1480. Scholars are divided as to whether <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> Evdochia or Maria. Archivist Aurelian Sacerdoțeanu believes that Bogdan also had a twin, Iliaș.|$|E
