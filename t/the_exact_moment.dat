25|$|The Cathedral has a {{prominent}} role in determining the beginning of the Pisan New Year. Between the tenth century and 1749, when the Tuscan calendar was reformed, Pisa used its own calendar, in which {{the first day of the}} year was March 25, the feast day of the Annunciation of Mary. Years were counted such that the Pisan New Year begins 9 months before the ordinary one. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>moment</b> is determined by a ray of sun that, through a window on the left side, falls on an egg-shaped marble, just above the pulpit by Giovanni Pisano; this occurs at noon.|$|E

In this way Petre was referring in a modest way to the original Gothic revival period as conceived by such architects as James Wyatt, rather than the later Gothic, after it had fallen under the ecclesiastical Anglo-Catholic influences of such architects as Augustus Pugin in England, and Benjamin Mountfort in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Bruckner's symphonies are scored for {{a fairly}} {{standard}} orchestra of woodwinds in pairs, four horns, {{two or three}} trumpets, three trombones, tuba (from the second version of the Fourth), timpani and strings.

Only the Eighth has harp, and percussion besides timpani (though legend has it the Seventh is supposed to have a cymbal crash at <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>moment</b> Wagner died). Bruckner's style of orchestral writing was criticized by his Viennese contemporaries, but {{by the middle of the}} twentieth century, musicologists recognized that his orchestration was modeled after the sound of his primary instrument, the pipe organ, i.e., alternating between two groups of instruments, as when changing from one manual of the organ to another.|$|E

50|$|In a {{separate}} rifting event about 610 {{million years ago}} (halfway in the Ediacaran period), the Iapetus Ocean formed.

500|$|Unfortunately, it was {{impossible}} to time <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>moment</b> of the start and end of the transit because of the phenomenon known as the [...] "black drop effect". This effect was long thought to be due to Venus's thick atmosphere, and initially it was held to be the first real evidence that Venus had an atmosphere. However, recent studies demonstrate that it is an optical effect caused by the smearing of the image of Venus by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere or imperfections in the viewing apparatus.|$|E
500|$|While admitting the {{complexity}} and sophistication of the Jain doctrine, Padmanabh Jaini compares it with that of Hindu doctrine of rebirth and {{points out that the}} Jain seers are silent on <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>moment</b> and mode of rebirth, that is, the re-entry of soul in womb after the death. [...] The concept of nitya-nigoda, which states that there are certain categories of souls who have always been nigodas, is also criticized. According to Jainism, nigodas are lowest form of extremely microscopic beings having momentary life spans, living in colonies and pervading the entire universe. According to Jaini, the entire concept of nitya-nigoda undermines the concept of karma, as these beings clearly would not have had prior opportunity to perform any karmically meaningful actions.|$|E

Professor William J. Beal called him [...] "the most important agent" [...] of the school, while President Abbot said, [...] "To no one man is the College so much indebted as John Clough Holmes." [...] One hundred years after the founding, Madison Kuhn's high regard for Holmes was clear, using as the frontispiece of his book a painting clearly meant to signify <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>moment</b> of the Agricultural College's genesis with an almost mythological glow.

Kruszelnicki also criticized the small sample size, and questioned how MacDougall was able to determine <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>moment</b> when a person had died considering the technology available in 1907. In 2008 physicist Robert L.

500|$|... "For Your Eyes Only" [...] {{begins with}} the murder of the Havelocks, a British couple in Jamaica who have refused to sell their estate to Herr von Hammerstein, a former Gestapo officer who is the chief of counterintelligence for the Cuban secret service. They are killed by two Cuban hitmen at the {{direction}} of their leader, Major Gonzales; all three work for von Hammerstein. The Havelocks turn out to be close friends of M, who served as the groom's best man during their wedding in 1925. M subsequently gives Bond a voluntary assignment, unconnected to sanctioned Secret Service duties, to travel to Vermont via Canada, find von Hammerstein at his rented estate at Echo Lake and assassinate him as a warning to future criminals who might think to target British citizens. When Bond arrives on the scene, he finds the Havelocks' daughter, Judy, who intends to carry out her own mission of revenge with a bow and arrow. Judy kills von Hammerstein by shooting him in the back with an arrow from [...] away at <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>moment</b> that he dives into a lake. A shoot-out then occurs between Bond and Gonzales and the two Cuban gunmen. Bond kills all of them and returns to Canada with Judy, who has been wounded during the gunfight.|$|E
500|$|Despite the victory, the {{remaining}} royalist forces {{could not be}} pursued as the column led by Justo Bermúdez had moved further than calculated for. This delayed the meeting with San Martín's column whose horse was killed by enemy fire, leaving with his leg trapped under the corpse of the animal. These factors led to the columns not meeting up and allowed many royalists to escape. A royalist, probably Zabala himself, attempted to kill San Martín while he was trapped under his dead horse where he suffered a saber injury to his face, and a bullet wound to his arm. Juan Bautista Cabral and Juan Bautista Baigorria intervened and saved San Martín's life. Cabral was mortally wounded during the rescue and San Martín reported that after Cabral was hit he said [...] "I die happy, we have defeated the enemy". <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>moment</b> this was said is unclear as the word [...] "after" [...] could have meant immediately after; during the ongoing battle; or some hours later during Cabral's agonising decline.
