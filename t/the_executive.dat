50|$|Reasons for loss: From the beginning, Lenny {{failed to}} take {{initiative}} with the project and let his teammates talk with <b>the</b> <b>executives,</b> dismissing <b>the</b> meeting from his agenda. Their theme of music and dance was also too narrow, and because Gold Rush spent only 10 minutes with <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> for a Q&A session, as opposed to Synergy's 45 minutes, Gold Rush failed to capitalize on what <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> wanted. Lenny also left his teammates (Charmaine, Leslie, & Tarek) {{to do all the}} constructional work, while himself and Lee went to pick up the equipment and supplies, and Lenny poorly presented the team's room to <b>executives.</b> One of <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> remarked that if all the children played the instruments at the same time, the noise would be chaotic. While the children were visibly delighted with the room Gold Rush had made, <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> still stressed that not everyone would love their theme.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for win: <b>The</b> <b>executives</b> of <b>the</b> company {{believed}} that their commercials were superior to Tenacity's in terms of clarity and originality, despite having made reference to a plumber's crack {{in one of the}} ads, which <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> found distasteful.|$|R

5|$|By 1934, <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> branch {{consisted}} of sixty-nine boards, commissions, and agencies {{in addition to}} the constitutional officers, although the members of these commissions were often the constitutional officers themselves.

The General Assembly passed this legislation, giving <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> branch some semblance of structure for the first time.|$|E

5000|$|Reasons for win: The {{feedback}} for the team's jingle was overwhelmingly positive, with <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> {{finding it}} catchy, memorable and well-suited to the product.

50|$|Reasons for loss: <b>The</b> <b>executives,</b> {{along with}} Trump and Kim, all felt that Fortitude's display was cheap, cheesy, tacky and juvenile.

50|$|Reasons for loss: The {{theme and}} text for Empresario's {{campaign}} was not consistent enough for <b>the</b> <b>executives</b> and they didn't take the necessary risks by adding more provocative images of Trace Adkins.

5|$|The delegates {{also agreed}} with Madison that <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> {{function}} {{had to be}} independent of the legislature.
