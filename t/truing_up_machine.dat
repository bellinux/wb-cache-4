25|$|In {{a forward}} though, the spread in {{exchange}} rates is not <b>trued</b> <b>up</b> regularly but, rather, it builds up as unrealized gain (loss) {{depending on which}} side of the trade being discussed. This means that entire unrealized gain (loss) becomes realized at the time of delivery (or as what typically occurs, the time the contract is closed prior to expiration) - assuming the parties must transact at the underlying currency's spot price to facilitate receipt/delivery.|$|R
50|$|In {{accordance}} with the Frank-Starling law of the heart, the myocardium contracts more powerfully as the end-diastolic volume increases. Stretching of the myofibrils in cardiac muscle causes them to contract more powerfully due to {{a greater number of}} cross-bridges being formed between the myofibrils within cardiac myocytes. This is <b>true</b> <b>up</b> to a point, however beyond this there is a loss of contractile ability due to loss of connection between myofibrils; see figure.|$|R

The fact that forwards are not margined daily means that, due to movements in the price of the underlying asset, a large differential can build up between the forward's delivery price and the settlement price, and in any event, an unrealized gain (loss) can build up.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} an inequality connecting the lattice point enumerator of a 0 -symmetric convex body with its successive minima.
