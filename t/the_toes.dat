5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>toes,</b> there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and <b>the</b> <b>toes,</b> giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E
5|$|Flexing <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> {{and feet}} and {{extending}} on tiptoes, {{can all be}} very useful in detecting perforator vein incompetence. These movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins. If a perforator valve is incompetent then a reflux from the deep to the superficial through the perforator vein will be registered.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse have small, pigeon like {{heads and}} necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and {{sometimes}} tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes {{at dawn and}} dusk. Their legs are feathered down to <b>the</b> <b>toes.</b>|$|E
40|$|The energy-recycling {{artificial}} {{foot was}} comprised of six component groups: the attachment interface, <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> assembly, <b>the</b> heel assembly, the primary compression spring, the heel clutch, and <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> latch (cf. Figure 2). The interface component attached to the prosthesis simulator boot through a standard prosthetic pyramid adaptor (Figure S 1). The one-way heel clutch acted between the heel assembly and the interface component, allowing the heel to rotate freely in plantar-flexion (compressing the spring) but locking when forced {{in the opposite direction}} (unless released by motor actuation). <b>The</b> <b>toe</b> latch acted between <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> assembly and <b>the</b> interface component, and prevented <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> assembly from rotating in plantar-flexion unless unlatched. During preload (about 25 - 40 % stride), the torque acting on <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> assembly increased as the center of pressure advanced forward and ground reaction forces increased, eventually overcoming the torque of the primary compression spring and pushing <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> assembly against a limit stop. This relieved <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> latch of load, so that a motor could move it to effectively release <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> assembly. During push-off, the primary compression spring was then allowed to force <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> assembly through plantar-flexion, returning stored energy. Simultaneously, <b>the</b> carbon fiber <b>toe</b> spring returned energy that was stored during preload. At the onset of swing, the foot then reset into the ready position by unlocking the heel clutch (cf. Figure 2) ...|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> big <b>toe</b> and <b>the</b> second <b>toe</b> are <b>the</b> {{same length}} (as {{measured}} from the MPT joint to the tip, including only the phalanges), then <b>the</b> second <b>toe</b> will protrude farther than <b>the</b> big <b>toe,</b> {{as shown in}} the photo. If <b>the</b> second <b>toe</b> is shorter than <b>the</b> big <b>toe,</b> <b>the</b> big <b>toe</b> may still protrude the farthest, or there may be little difference, {{as shown in the}} X-ray.|$|R
50|$|The cable binding {{attaches}} firmly at <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> only, {{normally in}} a trapezoidal metal cup {{roughly the same}} as <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> of a boot. A strap is fastened over <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> to stop it from {{rising out of the}} cup vertically. Another cable holds the boot forward into the cup, and under the tow strap. If the heel is lifted, causing the boot to rotate in <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> clip, a spring keeps tension on the cable to keep the boot pressed forward.|$|R
5|$|The {{scales of}} Solomon Islands skinks are {{a dark green}} but are often {{speckled}} with light brown or black. The scales on the underside vary from light yellow to different shades of green. <b>The</b> <b>toes</b> on all four legs have thick, curved nails used for climbing and gripping tree limbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} birds are {{composed}} of the same keratin as beaks, claws, and spurs. They are found mainly on <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> and metatarsus, but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds. Most bird scales do not overlap significantly, except {{in the cases of}} kingfishers and woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: tarsometatarsus. The {{third and}} most {{conspicuous}} {{portion of the}} bird's leg, from which <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> spring; the foot. In birds, the true tarsus has disappeared, with the proximal tarsals having fused with the tibia, the centralia having disappeared, and the distal bones having fused with the metatarsals to form a single tarsometatarsus bone, effectively giving the leg a third segment.|$|E

50|$|A sprain or {{strain to}} the small {{interphalangeal}} joints of <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> is commonly called a stubbed toe. A {{sprain or strain}} where <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> joins to <b>the</b> foot is called turf toe.|$|R
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting at the base of <b>the</b> <b>toes,</b> and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|The {{little brown}} bat can be {{distinguished}} from the Indiana bat {{by the absence of}} a keel on the caclar and long hairs on the hind feet that stretch longer than <b>the</b> <b>toes.</b> Compared to the long-legged bat, the brown bat has a shorter tibia and lesser amounts of ventral wing hair in addition to the lack of a keel on the caclar.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.|$|E
50|$|The 8.5 m tall {{statue of}} Gregory of Nin by Ivan Meštrović in Split is a heavily trafficked tourist {{site in the}} town, which <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> of <b>the</b> statue shows. Rubbing <b>the</b> statue's <b>toe</b> is said to bring good luck. <b>The</b> <b>toe</b> has been worn smooth and shiny as a result.|$|R
5000|$|The Nevada patents ran out in 1976, {{a similar}} models with long-travel toes quickly {{appeared}} from other binding manufacturers, starting with Salomon. These replaced earlier designs, which generally used a single cup-shaped piece that fitted over <b>the</b> entire <b>toe</b> flange (as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>toe,</b> as in <b>the</b> original Nevada). These had {{the disadvantage of}} requiring careful adjustment to fit the height of <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> flange, and could be impacted if snow {{on the bottom of}} the heel lifted <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> upward. Today <b>the</b> Nevada-style [...] "two finger toe" [...] is universal among modern bindings.|$|R
5000|$|Racing {{shoes were}} once limited to 6 spikes (or [...] "pins") in <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> section, with an {{additional}} 4 allowed in the heel for jumping shoes. The IAAF changed its rules in the early 1990s to allow a maximum of 11 spikes/pins for all shoes: most high jumpers place 7 in <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> and 4 in the heel. Photographs taken during competitions reveal Ukhov uses 10 in <b>the</b> <b>toe,</b> none in <b>the</b> heel.|$|R
5|$|The skin of {{the cane}} toad is dry and warty. It has {{distinct}} ridges above the eyes, which run down the snout. Individual cane toads can be grey, yellowish, red-brown, or olive-brown, with varying patterns. A large parotoid gland lies behind each eye. The ventral surface is cream-coloured and may have blotches in shades of black or brown. The pupils are horizontal and the irises golden. <b>The</b> <b>toes</b> have a fleshy webbing at their base, and the fingers are free of webbing.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept {{for the arrival of}} the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. <b>The</b> <b>toes</b> on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5000|$|... 1876: <b>The</b> <b>toe</b> {{stop was}} first patented. This {{provided}} skaters {{with the ability}} to stop promptly upon tipping the skate onto <b>the</b> <b>toe.</b> Toe stops are still used today on most quad skates and on some types of inline skates.|$|R
50|$|When performed, <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> {{should be}} <b>the</b> {{last part of}} the foot to leave the ground and the first part to hit it again. Although the step is a dynamic movement, care should be taken to step {{smoothly}} so as not to interrupt the air flow of wind instrumentalists. As the glide step rolls the foot from the heel to <b>the</b> <b>toe,</b> marchers executing <b>the</b> ankle knee step roll the foot from <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> to <b>the</b> heel.|$|R

5|$|Frogs {{that live}} in or visit water have adaptations that improve their {{swimming}} abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> of the hind feet increases {{the area of the}} foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family Pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, lateral line systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet. Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side.|$|E
5|$|In frogs the {{pelvic girdle}} is robust and the hind legs are much longer and {{stronger}} than the forelimbs. The feet have four or five digits and <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or {{in contact with the}} ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Species of Oryzomys are {{medium-sized}} rats with long, coarse fur. The upperparts are gray to reddish and the underparts {{white to}} buff. The animals have broad feet with reduced or absent ungual tufts of hair around the claws and, {{in at least}} some species, with webbing between <b>the</b> <b>toes.</b> The rostrum (front part of the skull) is broad and the braincase is high. Both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have 56chromosomes, lack a gall bladder, and have a complex penis (as is characteristic of the Sigmodontinae) with some traits that are rare among oryzomyines; these characteristics are unknown in the other species of this genus.|$|E
50|$|The Downtown Hotel at Second Avenue and Queen Street has {{garnered}} {{media attention}} for its unusual Sourtoe Cocktail, {{which features a}} real mummified human <b>toe.</b> <b>The</b> hotel and <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> received increased attention in June 2017 after <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> was stolen; it was soon returned to the hotel by mail along with a written apology.|$|R
50|$|A toe punt (also {{known as}} a toe poke or a toe-ender) is a method of kicking the ball in {{association}} football. Unlike other methods of kicking, <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> punt uses <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> end of <b>the</b> boot rather than the instep or laces.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the actual}} {{transfer}} of the MTP-joint of <b>the</b> second <b>toe</b> soft-tissue distraction of the wrist is required to create enough space to place the MTP joint. When after several weeks enough space has been created through distraction, the actual transfer of the MTP joint can be initiated. During this surgical intervention the wrist and <b>the</b> second <b>toe</b> are prepared for transfer at the same time. <b>The</b> ipsilateral second <b>toe</b> MTP joint, together with its metatarsal arteries, its extensor and flexor tendons and its dorsal nerves to the skin, is harvested for transfer. The distal and middle phalanx of <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> are removed. <b>The</b> transferred <b>toe,</b> consisting of <b>the</b> metatarsal and proximal phalanx, is fixed between the physis of the ulna and the second metacarpal, or the scaphoid. The tendons of <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> are attached {{to those of the}} radial flexor and extensors muscles of the wrist to create more stability to the MTP joint. K-wires are placed to fixate the bones in the desired position. Once the bones are secured anastomosis are made between the vessels of <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> and <b>the</b> vessels of the forearm. After revascularization of <b>the</b> <b>toe,</b> <b>the</b> skin paddle is placed and the skin is closed.|$|R
5|$|The {{feathers}} are outgrowths of the epidermis and {{are found}} in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin. Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds. The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near {{the base of the}} tail. This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens. There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of <b>the</b> <b>toes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed, while the talons of all <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking, and are of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in birds of prey and Old World vultures. The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The irises of the male are brown, while those of the female are deep red. The eyelids lack eyelashes. Contrary to the usual rule for sexual dimorphism among birds of prey, the female is smaller than the male.|$|E
5|$|The {{river otter}} is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E

40|$|To be detected, {{movements}} of the interphalangeal joint of <b>the</b> big <b>toe</b> must be greater than at other joints. This poor acuity may arise because the anatomy of the foot and ankle results in poor coupling between <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> and <b>the</b> muscles that operate it. To vary this coupling, the effect of ankle position on proprioceptive acuity at <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> was measured. We measured proprioceptive acuity at <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> with <b>the</b> ankle in different positions and found that ankle plantarflexion did improve acuity. This implies that, with the ankle at mid-range or dorsiflexed, toe movement is inadequately transferred to muscle fascicles. To determine actual changes in fascicle length of <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> extensor, {{movements of}} extensor hallucis longus near <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> and at <b>the</b> muscle-tendon junction were measured during surgical exposure in one subject. Ankle position greatly affected movement transfer from toe to muscle-tendon junction: no tendon movement was transferred with the ankle dorsiflexed, but all movement was transferred with the ankle plantarflexed. When the relationship between joint rotation and muscle fascicle length measured in vivo was used to express the smallest detectable movements of <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> as proportional changes in muscle fascicle length, these detectable changes {{were similar to those}} at all other limb joints. This suggests that change in muscle fascicle length is of major interest to the nervous system...|$|R
