5|$|The Hot Rock is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American rock band Sleater-Kinney, {{released}} on February 23, 1999,by Kill Rock Stars. It was produced by Roger Moutenot and recorded at Avast studio in Seattle, Washington in July 1998. The Hot Rock marks a considerable change in the band's sound, veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> punk rock style of its predecessors. The lyrical themes of the album explore issues of failed relationships and personal uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|With few teams, but a long history, it is {{inevitable}} that intense rivalries have developed in Canadian football. Far and away the greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton, while <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and well. The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game's greatest rivalries are showcased.|$|E

(The timekeeper's clock is displayed on the television broadcast.) The umpire controlling play, Matthew Nicholls, signalled another ball-up to restart play; he was oblivious to {{the noise of the}} siren, which was barely audible over <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> crowd. A number of Fremantle players, particularly Scott Thornton, appeared to have either heard the siren or reacted to other players hearing the siren.|$|E
25|$|Football {{first began}} to be {{associated}} with Dartmouth Night during the 1920s. Memorial Field was dedicated on Dartmouth Night in 1923. For decades <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> pre-football rallies remained separate from the dignified official activities. In 1936, the College first began the tradition of football games during this weekend; ten years later the formal College events and the rally were combined in a single grand event, {{and for the first time}} Dartmouth Night was intentionally scheduled on what is called Dartmouth Night Weekend.|$|E
25|$|The plot had young Humpty and his playmates {{turn into}} harlequinade {{characters}} and romp through a candy store, an enchanted garden and Manhattan's costly new City Hall. Fox's mute passivity set {{him apart from}} <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> clamor surrounding him, and audiences took the little man to their hearts. Humpty Dumpty was revived several times. Fox eventually gave 1,128 performances in the title role, becoming the most highly paid actor of his time. He initiated the tradition of Wednesday matinee's {{to take advantage of}} the show's appeal to children.|$|E

25|$|The series shifted back to Oakland and <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> Oracle Arena crowd, which {{lifted the}} Warriors to a resounding blowout in Game 3, a game which saw the Warriors hit a playoff record 11 threes {{in the first}} half. However, the Jazz shrugged off the crowd and handed the Warriors their only playoff home loss {{of the year in}} Game 4. The Warriors' playoff run ended as the Jazz {{finished}} them off in Game 5.

25|$|After the {{assertive}} trumpets of {{the first}} movement and <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> horns of the second, this movement uses no brass at all. The strings are divided throughout the entire movement (3 groups of violins, violas in 2, cellos in 2; basses in 2). Shostakovich fills this movement with beautiful, long melodies—one of them again based on the first theme {{of the first}} movement—punctuating them with intermezzi of solo woodwinds. Harp and celesta play prominent roles here as well. The music is emotive and even elegiac in tone; it returns to the sober mood which the scherzo has interrupted.|$|E
25|$|While {{these early}} efforts in orchestrated merengue {{generally}} succeeded only in scandalizing their audiences, the political changes {{that occurred in}} the Dominican Republic {{over the next few years}} made a resurgence of the merengue possible. The resented North American invasion of 1916 seems to have made the general public more disposed to support autochthonous rhythms over imported ones, though <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> rural accordion sound was still unacceptable to high-society tastes. Nevertheless, when Rafael Leonidas Trujillo took power in 1930, he imposed the merengue upon all levels of society, some say as a form of punishment for the elites that had previously refused to accept him. The soon-to-be dictator must also have realized the symbolic power of the rural folk music and its potential for creating support among the masses, since he took accordionists with him around the Republic during his campaign tours from the very beginning.|$|E

25|$|After the {{nomination}} of the new High Commissioner Sir John Chancellor to succeed Lord Plumer in December 1928, the question was re-examined, and in February 1929 legal opinion established that the mandatory authority was within its powers to intervene to ensure Jewish rights of access and prayer. Al-Husseini pressed him for a specific clarification of the legal status quo regarding the Wall. Chancellor mulled weakening the SMC and undermining al-Husseini's authority by making the office of mufti elective. The Nabi Musa festival of April that year passed without incident, despite al-Husseini's warnings of possible incidents. Chancellor thought his power was waning, and after conferring with London, admitted to al-Husseini on 6 May that he was impotent to act decisively in the matter. Al-Husseini replied that, unless the Mandatory authorities acted, then, very much like Christian monks protecting their sacred sites in Jerusalem, the sheikhs {{would have to take}} infringements of the status quo into their own hands, and personally remove any objects introduced by Jews to the area. Chancellor asked him to be patient, and al-Husseini offered to stop works on the Mount on condition that this gesture not be taken as a recognition of Jewish rights. A change of government in Britain in June led to a new proposal: only Muslim works in the sector near where Jews prayed should be subject to mandatory authorisation: Jews could employ ritual objects, but the introduction of seats and screens would be subject to Muslim authorisation. Chancellor authorised the Muslims to recommence their reconstructive work, while, responding to further Zionist complaints, prevailed on the SMC to stop <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> Zikr ceremonies {{in the vicinity of the}} wall. He also asked the Zionist representatives to refrain from filling their newspapers with attacks on the government and Muslim authorities. Chancellor then departed for Europe where the Mandatory Commission was deliberating.|$|E

500|$|The Hot Rock marks a {{considerable}} {{change in the}} band's sound, veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> punk rock style of its predecessors. As Rolling Stone noted, Sleater-Kinney [...] "delved into more oblique sounds [...] Brownstein's abandoned power chords to slither in abstract patterns, backed by Weiss' increasingly subtle and complex drumming [...] Tucker expanded her vocal range steering from bellow to fragile ululations". Likewise, The Village Voice writer Sara Sherr considered The Hot Rock to be Sleater-Kinney's darkest album. Brownstein remarked that the album's sound and lyrics were heavily influenced by the music of The Go-Betweens.|$|E

500|$|Walton's first {{successful}} large-scale concert work, the Viola Concerto (1929) is {{in marked contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> Portsmouth Point; despite the common influence of jazz and of the music of Hindemith and Ravel, in its structure and romantic longing it owes much to the Elgar Cello Concerto. In this work, wrote Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor in The Record Guide, [...] "the lyric poet in Walton, who had so far been hidden under a mask of irony, fully emerged." [...] Walton followed this pattern in his two subsequent concertos, for Violin (1937) and for Cello (1956). Each opens reflectively, is in three movements, and contrasts agitated and jagged passages with warmer romantic sections. The Cello Concerto is more introspective than the two earlier concertos, with a ticking rhythm throughout the work suggesting the inexorable passage of time.|$|E
500|$|All Hands on the Bad One is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed fourth album The Hot Rock, released in 1999. The Hot Rock marked a considerable {{change in the}} band's sound, veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> punk rock style of its predecessors. It {{was also the first}} Sleater-Kinney album that entered the US Billboard Top 200 chart, peaking at number 181. Some fans, however, dismissed the album, claiming that the band had sold out and that it was a commercial album. This criticism was something that singer and guitarist Corin Tucker strongly disagreed with, claiming that The Hot Rock was their least commercial album due to its longer and intricate pieces. According to Tucker, [...] "we wanted to be doing difficult work. We wanted to be expanding as musicians and people didn't want that from us. They wanted us to jump around and yell." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{other music}} critics have {{compared}} [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] to Beyoncé's 2003 single, [...] "Crazy in Love", the lead single of her debut album.

Jason King of the Vibe magazine deemed the song as [...] "cloned from the DNA of <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> 'Crazy in Love'" [...] while Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine {{referred to it as}} [...] "'Crazy in Love' lite". Some reviewers, however, were negative to the parallels drawn between the two songs. Andy Kellman of AllMusic, an online music database, wrote that [...] " [...] "had the audacity to not be as monstrous as 'Crazy in Love'", referring to the commercial success the latter experienced in 2003. The internet-based publication Pitchfork's writer Ryan Dombal claimed that [...] "this time [...] out-bolds the beat".|$|E

The [...] actor often uses the [...] in solo performance, especially when performing , light-hearted verses spoken for comedic effect. The clown is also connected to the small gong and cymbals, percussion instruments that symbolize the lower classes and <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> atmosphere inspired by the role.

500|$|In the 1978 {{edition of}} their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler said that Harrison had [...] "desperately" [...] {{employed}} [...] "last-minute devices" [...] to save Extra Texture, by featuring [...] "'zany' ex-Bonzo Dog Band drummer 'Legs' Larry Smith on a track, and by instructing his graphic designers to 'get a little humour into the packaging'. They do; and 'Legs' duly sings; {{but it is}} all too little, too late." [...] Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden identified the song and the album art, {{as well as the}} single [...] "You", as evidence that Harrison was attempting to re-engage with his listeners. Woffinden welcomed this approach but, noting the lack of a lyric sheet with the album, he added: [...] " [...] is not a success, since most of the vocals are lost in <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> mix; Larry might have had pearls of wisdom to impart, but who could tell?" [...] More recently, Richard Ginell of AllMusic has described the song as a [...] "baffling salute" [...] to Smith, while former Mojo editor Mat Snow dismisses it as [...] "a throwaway among throwaways".|$|E

He marveled at {{newspaper}} reports in the Washington Post that mentioned [...] "coaches of opposing teams and how they were planning to stop Kermit Washington." [...] He led the nation in rebounding again in his senior season. He was a second team All-American, and helped American into the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). In the last game of his college career, Washington needed to score 39 points to average 20 points and 20 rebounds a game for his career in college. He became extremely nervous before the game and could neither eat nor sleep. The game set American University attendance records, and Washington felt light on his feet when he was introduced before <b>the</b> <b>raucous</b> crowd. He managed to score 40 points and in so doing, became just the seventh player to reach the 20/20 mark. He was thrown a party, and there was a campus wide celebration after the game. He graduated with a 3.37 GPA and a degree in sociology. Washington was a two-time Academic All-American, who taught courses in social sciences his senior year.|$|E
