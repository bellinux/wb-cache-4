On all levels, a team on the offensive (in possession of the ball) is prohibited <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> the lane for more than three seconds; after three seconds the player will be called with a three-second violation which will result in a turnover.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside.</b> Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E

5000|$|The phrase [...] "Rose Garden strategy" [...] (such as a {{re-election}} strategy) refers <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>inside</b> or on {{the grounds}} of the White House as opposed to traveling throughout the country. For example, Jimmy Carter's initial efforts to end the Iran hostage crisis (1979-1981) were a Rose Garden strategy because he mostly held discussions with his close advisers in the White House. On July 25, 1994 a declaration of peace between Israel and Jordan was signed in the Rose Garden.|$|R
5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> the Union.|$|E
5|$|Fearing for {{the safety}} of his wife's {{relatives}} in San Antonio, Bowie invited her cousins Getrudis Navarro and Juana Navarro Alsbury, as well as Alsbury's 18-month-old son, Alijo Perez Jr., <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> the walls of the Alamo. Bowie also brought several black servants, some of whom worked at the Veramendi Palace, into the security of the Alamo fortress. Bowie had been ill, and twodoctors, including the fort surgeon, were unable to diagnose his illness. Travis became the sole commander of the forces when Bowie was confined to bed. Santa Anna and his army began a siege of the Alamo on February 24. The Mexican army raised a red flag to warn the defenders that no quarter would be given.|$|E
5|$|Nariman House, a Chabad Lubavitch Jewish centre in Colaba {{known as}} the Mumbai Chabad House, {{was taken over by}} two attackers and several {{residents}} were held hostage. Police evacuated adjacent buildings and exchanged fire with the attackers, wounding one. Local residents were told <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside.</b> The attackers threw a grenade into a nearby lane, causing no casualties. NSG commandos arrived from Delhi, and a naval helicopter took an aerial survey. During the first day, 9 hostages were rescued from the first floor. The following day, the house was stormed by NSG commandos fast-roping from helicopters onto the roof, covered by snipers positioned in nearby buildings. After a long battle, one NSG commando Havaldar Gajender Singh Bisht and both perpetrators were killed. Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka Holtzberg, who was six months pregnant, were murdered with four other hostages inside the house by the attackers.|$|E

The person must make the appropriate intention, either on the person's own behalf or on behalf of someone else unable to do so, <b>to</b> commit <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>inside</b> the masjid for the entire period chosen for i'tikāf, except for very important or unavoidable reasons (such as buying food or attending a funeral).

5|$|An iron hook is affixed {{into the}} wall of the Castellania close to the pillory. According to tradition, the hook might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. The hook was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through the hook in a dare, and the hook became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through the hook. Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through the hook. Brockman further claims that the hook was used to lift a cage at the pillory, with a person condemned <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. The hook by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{it was not}} as {{successful}} as her previous records in Japan. It debuted at number five on the Oricon Albums Chart and sold 39,295 units, making it Hamasaki's lowest first week sales in her career at the time and was her first album to miss the top three position. Its low first week sales were attributed to the lack of promotion of the album and stiff competition by other artists at the time, as described by Japanese publications. It dropped to number 16 the following week, her first album not <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> the top ten for at least two weeks, with sales of 6,122 units. The following week, it slipped to number 31 with 2,922 units sold, and fell outside the top 50 the following week. It sold 53,406 units by the end of 2014, and was ranked number 98 on Oricon's Annual Chart. Despite its much lower success, it became her 47th record to chart within the top ten on the Oricon Albums Chart; Hamasaki became the second artist in Japanese music history to achieve this after Yumi Matsutoya. Elsewhere, the album reached number 75 and 16 on the South Korean Gaon Albums Chart and Gaon International Chart.|$|E

5000|$|Another severe {{hardship}} of the crisisthe [...] "cloth famine"left {{nearly the}} entire population of the immiserated poor in Bengal naked or clothed in scraps through the winter. The British military consumed nearly all the textiles produced in India by purchasing Indian-made boots, parachutes, uniforms, blankets, and other goods at steep discount rates. The relatively small proportion of materials left over for civilian use were purchased by speculators for sale to civilians, subject to similarly steep inflation. With the supply of cloth crowded out by commitments to Great Britain and price levels held captive by profiteering, anyone who was not among the [...] "priority classes" [...] faced increasingly dire scarcity: [...] Many women [...] "took <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>inside</b> a room all day long, emerging only when it was their turn to wear the single fragment of cloth shared with female relatives." ...|$|R

25|$|After {{meeting with}} other militant groups, Hamas agreed {{to enforce a}} ceasefire if Israel stopped firing, but both sides {{continued}} to fire. The Israeli Air Force bombed two smuggling tunnels in the northern Gaza Strip, injuring four people. Rocket and mortar fire from Gaza began a few hours later, and at least 45 additional Palestinian projectiles were fired into Israel over a three-hour period. No one was killed, but residents were instructed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> their homes, children were ordered <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside</b> schools, and police sealed roads {{in the area for}} fear of additional attacks. One mortar shell damaged a home in the Eshkol Regional Council, but caused no injuries. A Grad rocket fired at Ashkelon was intercepted by an Iron Dome battery, marking the first successful interception of a short-range rocket in history. Immediately afterward, an Israeli aircraft fired at the militant squad that had launched the rocket, and confirmed a hit.|$|E
25|$|When rain {{falls on}} the sukkah, one is not {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside.</b> The Mishna in Sukkah 28b compares rain falling on a sukkah to a master who receives a drink from his servant and then throws {{it back in the}} servant's face.

25|$|The {{soldiers}} {{warned the}} townspeople <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside,</b> and began {{shooting at the}} MPs, who returned fire. The darkness meant that both sides were confused and few shots were fired. However, one black soldier, Private William Crossland, was killed, and four people were wounded (two soldiers and two MPs). Shooting continued until around 4 AM the next morning. Eventually, the soldiers returned to the base, and by the afternoon all but four rifles had been recovered.|$|E

25|$|Gray started {{shooting}} indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals {{who had seen}} the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy {{several times in the}} back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned to the three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children's father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, it was getting dark and the dispatcher advised her <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>inside.</b> Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.|$|E
