5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E

This concept {{takes place in}} everyday interactions, and often goes unnoticed by both the person enacting the mirroring behaviors as well as <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> is being mirrored. The activation of mirror neurons takes place within <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> begins to mirror another's movements, and allows them a greater connection and understanding with <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> they are mirroring, as well as allowing <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> is being mirrored to feel a stronger connection with <b>the</b> other <b>individual.</b> Mirroring is distinct from conscious imitation under the premise that while {{the latter is a}} conscious, typically overt effort to copy another person, mirroring is subconsciously done during the act and often goes unnoticed.|$|R

5|$|The {{difference}} of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements.

The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.|$|E

Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E

5|$|The second epoch saw the reigns of {{the last}} three legendary kings. The second epoch was more {{consequential}} than was the first, which was in part due to the significant degree of territorial expansion which occurred during this period. Regardless of how true these legends were, it is likely that, as the legends suggest, a series of conquests did occur during the late monarchy. As a result of these conquests, it became necessary to determine what was to be done with the conquered people. Often, individuals whose towns had been conquered remained in those towns, while other such individuals came to Rome. To acquire legal and economic standing, these newcomers adopted a condition of dependency toward either a Patrician family, or toward the king. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> were dependents of the king were released from their state of dependency, and became the first Plebeians. As Rome grew, it needed more soldiers to continue its conquests. When the Plebeians were released from their dependency, they were released from their Curia. When this occurred, while they were no longer required to serve in the army, they also lost their political and economic standing. To bring these new Plebeians back into the army, the Patricians were forced to make concessions. While it is not known exactly what concessions were made, {{the fact that they were}} not granted any political power set the stage for what history knows as the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. Because {{most people}} {{think that they are}} better than others, self-superiority beliefs must perspire in how they {{describe}} themselves to others. We examined how people respond to self-superiority claims as compared to other positive self-descriptions. Design and methods. Participants read a quote in which an individual claimed being a better friend than others (self-superiority claim), an equally good friend as others (self-equality claim) or a good friend (non-comparative positive self-description). They judged <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> <b>the</b> self-view of <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and his or her look upon others. Half of the participants read that the quote was made during a group discussion (i. e., in public) whereas the other half read that it was made on a confidential questionnaire (i. e., in private). Results. Irrespective of the self-description being made in public or in private, participants judged <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> made <b>the</b> self-superiority claim unfavorably. They judged <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> gave a non-comparative positive self-description favorably and <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> made a self-equality claim neutrally. In all three cases, they thought that <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> looked positively upon themselves. However, they thought that only <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> made a self-superiority claim looked negatively upon others. Conclusion. People hold self-superiority claims against <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> <b>who</b> makes them, even if these claims were never meant to be made public. This unfavorable response is probably related to the unfavorable look upon others that such claims communicate. It suggests that self-superiority beliefs may have detrimental effects on social relationships if they lead to self-superiority claims. status: publishe...|$|R
