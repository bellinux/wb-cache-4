5|$|After a night-time advance, the 20th Battalion was {{positioned}} {{on the ridge}} in reserve behind the 18th and 19th Battalions. On daybreak, {{it was discovered that}} the advance had bypassed numerous strong points, leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact. The supporting British armour was nowhere <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> the supporting artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger had difficulty with his radio communications and made a dash through enemy lines to make contact with the British armour. On reaching one of the British brigades, its commanding officer resisted Kippenberger's entreaties to advance and it was not until a passing British general authorised the move that the British mounted up. By the time the armoured support arrived, the flanking battalion of the 5th Brigade had been overrun, leaving the battalions of the 4th Brigade even more exposed and receiving fire from the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, the {{supporting}} British armour was nowhere <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> the artillery and anti-tank units {{were unable to}} break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger inspected the brigade's position and found his battalions under fire from German tanks. Unable to contact nearby units by radio and realising {{the degree to which}} his men were exposed, he raced off under fire in a Bren carrier to locate the British armour. Coming across an armoured brigade four miles away, he implored its commander to bring his unit forward but was refused meaningful support until the intervention of Major General Herbert Lumsden, commander of the British 1st Armoured Division. By the time the tanks had arrived, the men of the 22nd Battalion had been largely killed or captured. The headquarters element of the 23rd Battalion were also prisoners of war. By nightfall, the 4th Brigade had been overrun. Kippenberger asked for and received permission to withdraw his brigade from the ridge. Although awarded a Bar to his DSO for his dash for help from the British, Kippenberger was bitter about the poor planning of the operation and admitted his own errors of judgement.|$|E
25|$|By reading Bradstreet's {{works and}} {{recognizing}} her intended audience, {{one can get}} an idea of how life was for Puritan women. According to U.S. History.org Puritan women were required to attend worship services, yet they could not to speak or offer prayer. Women were also not allowed to attend town meetings or be involved in the decisions that were discussed. If Puritan women were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> not heard in public, then one can say that most of their works are not meant for public consumption.|$|E

25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, {{and used to}} say of him {{that when he was}} in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>And,</b> more over, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had anything to say to him.|$|E
25|$|At {{a time in}} the past, {{monocline}} {{formed to}} the west of Sydney. The monocline is a sloping bend that raises the sandstone well above where it is expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>and</b> this is why the whole of the visible top of the Blue Mountains is made of sandstone. From the beginnings of the colony in 1788, settlers and convicts had to work with the stone, using it for building and trying to grow crops on the soil over it. The sandstone had a negative effect on farming because it underlay most of the available flat land at a very shallow depth.|$|E
25|$|However, work did {{not start}} in 2003. In November 2005, {{there was still no}} {{progress}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>and</b> the extensive planning was not fully completed. In a press release on November 30, 2005, Transportation Minister Meir Sheetrit announced that he was considering connecting Nazareth and Migdal HaEmek to the planned valley railway, and that the railway would be completed in 2008–09 (starting construction in 2006). The original plans to build a full dual-track railway in the initial phase were scrapped in favor of single-track for most of the route (between Nesher and Beit She'an). On February 22, 2006, Israel Railways and the Nature and Parks Authority transferred 1,500 endangered geophytes from the route of the railway.|$|E

25|$|The use of spheres {{is often}} for convenience, being limited both by {{graphics}} libraries and the additional effort required to compute complete electronic density or other space-filling quantities. It is now relatively common to see images of surfaces {{that have been}} colored to show quantities such as electrostatic potential. Common surfaces in molecular visualization include solvent-accessible ("Lee-Richards") surfaces, solvent-excluded ("Connolly") surfaces, and isosurfaces. The isosurface in Fig. 5 appears to show the electrostatic potential, with blue colors being negative and red/yellow (near the metal) positive (there is no absolute convention of coloring, and red/positive, blue/negative are often reversed). Opaque isosurfaces do not allow the atoms <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> identified {{and it is not}} easy to deduce them. Because of this, isosurfaces are often drawn with a degree of transparency.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Voldemort is {{initially}} only heard, possessing the scratchy, weak voice {{heard in the}} first film. By the film's climax, however, he appears in his physical form for the first time, played by Ralph Fiennes. As in the book, Voldemort is shown clad in dark black robes, being tall and emaciated, with no hair and yellowish teeth; his wand has a white tone and the handle appears {{to be made of}} bone; his finger nails are long and pale blue while his toe nails appear to be infected. Unlike in the book, his pupils are not cat-like and his eyes are blue, because producer David Heyman felt that his evil would not be able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> would not fill the audience with fear (his eyes do briefly take on a snake-like appearance when he opens them after turning human, but quickly turn normal). As in the book, the film version of Voldemort has snake-like slit nostrils with the flesh of his nose significantly pressed back. Ralph Fiennes' nose was not covered in makeup on the set, but was digitally removed in post-production. In this first appearance, Voldemort also has a forked tongue, but this element was removed for the subsequent films.|$|E

500|$|According to Kubrick's {{brother-in-law}} Jan Harlan, {{the director}} was adamant the trims were never <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>and</b> that he burned the negatives, {{which he had}} kept in his garage, shortly before his death. This was confirmed by former Kubrick assistant Leon Vitali: [...] "I'll tell you right now, okay, on Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Barry Lyndon, some little parts of 2001, we had thousands of cans of negative outtakes and print, which we had stored in an area at his house where we worked out of, which he personally supervised the loading of it to a truck and then I went down to a big industrial waste lot and burned it. That's what he wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{procession}} {{lasted from}} morning to night. The streets {{were lined with}} tableaux vivants displaying scenes from the Crusades, Deësis and the Gates of Paradise. More than a thousand burghers stood along the route; those on one side were dressed in green facing, those on the opposite in red. The procession began at the Porte de St. Denis and passed under a canopy of sky-blue cloth beneath which children dressed as angels sang, winding into the Rue Saint-Denis before arriving at the Notre Dame for the coronation ceremony. As Tuchman describes the event, [...] "So many wonders were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>and</b> admired that it was evening before the procession crossed the bridge leading to Notre Dame and the climactic display." ...|$|E
500|$|Also, faecal sac. A mucous membrane, {{generally}} {{white or}} clear {{with a dark}} end, that surrounds the feces of some species of [...] birds. It allows parent birds to more easily remove fecal material from the nest. The nestling usually produces a fecal sac within seconds of being fed; if not, a waiting adult may prod around the youngster's cloaca to stimulate excretion. Young birds of some species adopt specific postures or engage in specific behaviours to signal that they are producing fecal sacs. For example, nestling curve-billed thrashers raise their posteriors in the air, while young cactus wrens shake their bodies. Other species deposit the sacs {{on the rim of}} the nest, where they are likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> (<b>and</b> removed) by parent birds. Not all species generate fecal sacs. They are most prevalent in [...] and their near relatives, which have young that remain in the nest for longer periods.|$|E
