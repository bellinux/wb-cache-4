5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, and is expected <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> {{in games}} McGraw managed. During a brawl that erupted {{during a game}} against the Detroit Tigers on August 21, 1901, McGinnity spat on umpire Tom Connolly. McGinnity was arrested for the incident and permanently suspended by AL president Ban Johnson, who wanted there to be no fighting in AL games. Johnson later cut the suspension down to 12 days after McGinnity apologized. McGinnity compiled a 26–20 record for the 1901 Orioles, and his 48 games, 39 complete games, and 382 innings pitched led the AL.|$|E

40|$|Structural changes occur {{throughout}} life in enamel, dentine, and cementum with continuous cementum apposition. Erupted teeth are {{directly affected by}} environmental and ageing process as opposed to impacted teeth. Cementum deposition on a healthy tooth is a continuous process and relationship may exist between age and cementum thickness. Cementum deposition may occur with coronal displacement due <b>to</b> <b>erupted</b> forces on impacted teeth. Aim: The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the extent of coronal displacement of cementum in impacted teeth as compared <b>to</b> <b>erupted</b> teeth, and <b>to</b> draw a probable correlation between age and coronal displacement of cementum in erupted and impacted teeth. Materials and methods: A morphometric analysis was performed using Leica DML B 2 O-Win Lite image analysis system. Results: Our results suggested that there was a significant linear and positive correlation between age and coronal displacement of cementum in impacted mandibular third molars. Conclusion: This method can be applied in the arena of forensic odontology...|$|R

5|$|Geysers are fragile {{phenomena}} and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many {{have been destroyed}} simply by people throwing debris into them while others have ceased <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> due to dewatering by geothermal power plants. However, the Great Geysir of Iceland has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced—often on special occasions—by the addition of surfactants to the water.|$|E
5|$|Glacier Peak {{is one of}} {{the most}} active of Washington's volcanoes. The volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch, about one million years ago, and since the most recent ice age, it has {{produced}} some of largest and most explosive eruptions in the state. When continental ice sheets retreated from the region, Glacier Peak began <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> regularly, erupting explosively five times in the past 3,000 years. It has erupted repeatedly during at least six periods; two of these eruptions have been among the largest in Washington.|$|E
5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards pose {{a significant}} threat {{to human life}} near Gareloi. If Gareloi were <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of volcanic ash, also known as tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E

5|$|The plugs-out test {{began on}} the morning of January 27, 1967, and {{immediately}} was plagued with problems. First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.|$|E

5|$|Two {{stages of}} {{volcanic}} activity constructed the Itcha Range. The first stage, {{referred to as}} the felsic shield-building stage, occurred between 3.8and 3.0million years ago. Three phases comprise this stage; a pre-explosive phase, an explosive phase and a post-explosive phase. Analysis of the first trachyte magmas <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> during the pre-explosive phase suggest they were relatively fluid as shown by their areal extent. Eruptions became more viscous during the explosive phase, followed by more viscosity during the post-explosive phase. As a result, the volume of erupted material became smaller over time. The increasing viscousness of felsic lava during the shield-building stage suggests a maturing plumbing system underneath the Itcha Range, which may have consisted of multiple, isolated, cupola-type magma chambers.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Butler {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} computer tomography scans {{of the juvenile}} skull SAM-PK-K10487. To the surprise of these researchers, replacement teeth yet <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> were present even in this early ontogenetic stage. Despite these findings, the authors argued that tooth replacement must have occurred since the juvenile displayed the same tooth morphology as adult individuals – this morphology would have changed if the tooth simply grew continuously. In conclusion, Butler and colleagues suggested that tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus must have been more sporadic than in related dinosaurs. Unerupted replacement teeth in Heterodontosaurus were not discovered until 2011, when Norman and colleagues described the upper jaw of specimen SAM-PK-K1334. Another juvenile skull (AMNH 24000) described by Sereno in 2012 also yielded unerupted replacement teeth. As shown by these discoveries, tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus was episodical and not continuous as in other heterodontosaurids. The unerupted teeth are triangular in lateral view, which is the typical tooth morphology in basal ornithischians. The characteristic chisel-like shape of the fully erupted teeth therefore resulted from tooth-to-tooth contact between the dentition of {{the upper and lower}} jaws.|$|E
5|$|Like other volcanoes in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, the Itcha Range is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is.

5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor {{seamount}} chain {{is a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts extending across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and subsidence of the seafloor cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further subsidence causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a guyot. This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements and likely tidal heating {{may have led}} to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago. The freezing of the water likely led to the expansion of the interior, which may have been responsible for the formation of the canyons and obliteration of the ancient surface. The liquids from the ocean may have been able <b>to</b> <b>erupt</b> to the surface, flooding floors of canyons in the process known as cryovolcanism.|$|E
