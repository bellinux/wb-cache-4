2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Gold, in 2002 Adams was blocked by his label from {{releasing}} his choice for a follow-up. This would be {{the second time this}} happened, the first being with Gold; Adams had recorded [...] "the Suicide Handbook" [...] which was rejected {{on the grounds that it}} was [...] "too sad". The label opted this time around to cherry pick from the four recorded albums already dismissed as releasable full albums ("48 Hours", [...] "The Suicide Handbook", [...] "The Pinkhearts" [...] and [...] "The Swedish Sessions") for a mix tape type record assembled without his involvement. [...] Demolition, a compilation of tracks from these recording sessions, was released in 2002. Although the album garnered more critical attention, it failed to sell as well as Gold. That same year, Adams produced Jesse Malin's first album, <b>The</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Art</b> <b>of</b> Self Destruction, and later worked with Malin to form the punk-rock group The Finger (under the pseudonyms, [...] "Warren Peace" [...] and [...] "Irving Plaza" [...] respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form We Are Fuck You, released on One Little Indian Records in 2003.

His apologies for having failed to return at the right time were little masterpieces of grace and gaiety.

In these earlier and better days, she would have reminded him affectionately of her claim to be received into his confidence--she would have tried all that tact and gentleness and patience could do to win his confession of the ascendency exercised over him by his vile friend--and she would have used the utmost influence of her love and her resolution to disunite the fatal fellowship which was leading him to his ruin.|$|E
6000|$|... 88. The words I {{have just}} used, [...] "pictorial scholarship," [...] and [...] "pictorial theology," [...] remind me how strange it must appear {{to you that}} in this sketch of the {{intellectual}} state of Italy {{in the thirteenth century}} I have taken no note of literature itself, nor of <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> Music with which it was associated in minstrelsy. The corruption of {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "clerk," [...] from [...] "a chosen person" [...] to [...] "a learned one," [...] partly indicates the position of literature in the war between the golden crest and scarlet cap; but in the higher ranks, literature and music became the grace of the noble's life, or the occupation of the monk's, without forming any separate class, or exercising any materially visible political power. Masons or butchers might establish a government,--but never troubadours: and though a good knight held his education to be imperfect unless he could write a sonnet and sing it, he did not esteem his castle to be at the mercy of the [...] "editor" [...] of a manuscript. He might indeed owe his life to the fidelity of a minstrel, or be guided in his policy by the wit of a clown; but he was not the slave of sensual music, or vulgar literature, and never allowed his Saturday reviewer to appear at table without the cock's comb.|$|E
6000|$|The morning, {{after the}} sun got up, was {{exceedingly}} delightful. And this camp was such a contrast to the others, so pleasant and attractive, that {{even if we had}} not arranged to meet Lee Haught and his sons here I would have stayed a while anyway. Haught was a famed bear hunter who lived in a log-cabin somewhere up under the rim of the mesa. While Lee and Nielsen rode off up the trail to find Haught I gave Romer his first try at rainbow trout. The water of the creek was low and clear, so that we could see plenty of good-sized trout. But they were shy. They would not rise readily to any of our flies, though I got several strikes. We searched under the stones for worms and secured a few. Whereupon Romer threw a baited hook to a trout we plainly saw. The trout gobbled it. Romer had been instructed in <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> angling, but whenever he got a bite he always forgot science. He yanked this ten-inch rainbow right out. Then in another pool he hooked a big fellow that had ideas of his own as well as weight and strength. Romer applied the same strenuous tactics. But this trout nearly pulled Romer off the rock before the line broke. I took occasion then to deliver to the lad a lecture. In reply he said tearfully: [...] "I didn't know he was so--so big." ...|$|E

6000|$|Eugenio {{knew nothing}} {{practically}} {{and very little}} theoretically of painting; but it appeared to him that what Hazlitt said was of equal force with respect to <b>the</b> <b>fine</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> literature; and that in his own American field the English race failed, {{as far as it}} had failed, for the same reason as that given by Hazlitt for its failure in painting. In his mind he went further than Hazlitt, or came short of him, in refusing the consolation of our race's superiority in poetry because it was will and passion. As far as they had excelled in that, it was because they had tried hard and not neglected the means for the end. Where they had excelled most, it was quite imaginable that the poem would still have been better if the poet had taken more pains. In the case of prose, he thought we failed of the end because we were impatient of the means, and as elderly men will, he accused the present of being more hasty and indifferent to form than the past. He recalled the time when he was apprentice in the art in which he could not yet call himself a master workman, and thought how he tried to make what he did beautiful, and fashioned his work with tireless pains after some high model. Perhaps the young writers of this time were striving as earnestly; but he could not see it, or thought he could not. He fancied their eyes dazzled by the images of easy success, instead of taken with the glory of a thing beautifully done. He remembered, with fond emotion, how once his soul had glowed over some [...] "cunning'st pattern of excelling nature," [...] and had been filled with longing to learn from it the art of surprising some other mood or aspect of nature and making that loveliness or grandeur his own. He had talked with other youths who were trying {{at the same time to}} do good work, and he remembered that they too were trying in the same way; and now, long after, he fancied that their difference from the youth of the present day was in their willingness to strive for perfection in the means and to let the end take care of itself. The end could no more justify bad means in æsthetics than in ethics; in fact, without the carefully studied means there could be no artistic result. If it was true that the young writers of the present expected a high result from hurried or neglected processes, they could have only the results that Eugenio saw around him. If they admired these, and were coming to him for the secret of achieving them, they were coming to the wrong shop.|$|E
