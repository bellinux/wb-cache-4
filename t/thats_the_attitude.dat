40|$|Abstract — A {{deterministic}} attitude estimation {{problem for}} a rigid body in an attitude dependent potential field with bounded measurement errors is studied. An attitude estimation scheme that does not use generalized coordinate representations of <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> is presented here. Assuming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>attitude,</b> angular velocity and measurement noise lie within given ellipsoidal bounds, an uncertainty ellipsoid <b>that</b> bounds <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> and <b>the</b> angular velocity of the rigid body is obtained. The center of the uncertainty ellipsoid provides point estimates, and its size gives {{the accuracy of the}} estimates. The point estimates and the uncertainty ellipsoids are propagated using a Lie group variational integrator and its linearization, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>attitude</b> estimation is optimal in <b>the</b> sense <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> estimation error {{and the size of the}} uncertainty ellipsoid is minimized, and it is global since <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> is represented by a rotation matrix.

40|$|Public opinion has {{increasingly}} {{become a political}} force in the European integration process. At present, it appears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people’s <b>attitude</b> towards <b>the</b> European integration is relatively skeptical. How can we expect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> towards European integration will evolve in the future? This paper tests {{the extent to which}} diffusion theory can serve as a model to explain <b>the</b> development of <b>attitudes</b> to European integration policy in Sweden from 1999 until 2009. The policy specific approach is grounded in a commitment to the importance of keeping the concept of European integration relatively constant and comparable over time. The study tests the diffusion theory’s prediction of an increasingly positive <b>attitude</b> towards <b>the</b> European integration. This paper is also testing the diffusion theory’s explanation for changes in attitudes to European integration, the diffusion process and the weakening of differences between groups and orientations. The paper’s quantitative analysis of data from the Swedish European parliament election surveys reveals <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> towards European policy integration, in line with the diffusion theory, has been improved over time. There is, however, no clear evidence that a diffusion process is the cause of this development...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} {{nonlinear}} controllability theory to <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> dynamics of a magnetically actuated spacecraft in a Keplerian orbit in the geomagnetic field. The {{variation of the}} geomagnetic field along the orbit makes the dynamical equations time varying in nature. Hence we first present sufficient conditions for accessibility, strong accessibility and controllability of a general time-varying system. We apply these sufficient conditions to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> dynamics of a spacecraft actuated by three magnetic actuators and subjected to a general time-varying magnetic field are strongly accessible if the magnetic field and its first two time derivatives are linearly independent at every instant. In addition, if the magnetic field is periodic in time, then <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> dynamics of <b>the</b> spacecraft are controllable. These results are used to show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> dynamics of a spacecraft actuated by three magnetic actuators in a closed Keplerian orbit in a of the geomagnetic field are strongly accessible and controllable if the orbital plane contains neither the geomagnetic equator nor the geomagnetic poles. © IEE...|$|R
