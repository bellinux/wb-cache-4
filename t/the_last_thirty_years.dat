5|$|Having {{been officially}} {{suspended}} {{at the end}} of the Cromwellian regime, parliament returned after the Restoration of Charles II in 1661.

James' parliament supported him against rivals and attempted rebellions, but after his escape to exile in 1689, William's first parliament was dominated by his supporters and, in contrast to the situation in England, effectively deposed James under the Claim of Right, which offered the crown to William and Mary, placing important limitations on royal power, including the abolition of the Lords of the Articles.

Rosalind Mitchison argues that the parliament became a focus of national political life, but it never reached the position of a true centre of national identity attained by its English counterpart. The new Williamite parliament would subsequently bring about its own demise by the Act of Union in 1707. The English and Scottish parliaments were replaced by a combined Parliament of Great Britain, but it sat in Westminster and largely continued English traditions without interruption. Forty-five Scots were added to the 513 members of the House of Commons and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the House of Lords.|$|E

40|$|One {{family of}} {{classifiers}} which lias has considerable experimental success over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>year</b> {{is that of}} the ?i-tuple classifier and its descendents. However, the theoretical basis for such classifiers is uncertain despite attempts {{from time to time to}} place it in a statistical framework. In particular the most commonly used training algorithms do not even try to minimise recognition error on the training set. In this paper the tools of statistical learning theory are applied to the classifier in an attempt to describe the classifier's effectiveness. In particular the effective VC dimension of the classifier for various input distributions is calculated experimentally, and these results used as the basis for a discussion of the behaviour of the n-tuple classifier. As a side-issue an error-minimising algorithm for the u-tuple classifier is also proposed and briefly examined. SCOPUS: cp. kinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The drawbacks of using 'Si-centred' chiral organosilanes has led to 'C- centred' organosilicon compounds being the substrate of choice. This research has been directed at the synthesis and application of C(_ 2) symmetric 'C-centred' cyclic organosilicon species and their potential applications in asymmetric synthesis. A variety of synthetic methods have been considered, the most successful {{of which has been}} the double asymmetric hydroboration of substituted divinylsilanes. This has allowed the use of unusual boron redistribution chemistry to give access to both acyclic and cyclic rmw-substituted organosilicon compounds with high stereoselectivity. A new method for the synthesis of dichlorosilanes from their diphenyl analogue has been developed and has been shown to occur almost instantaneously and in good yield. Finally, the application of dichlorosilacycles in tethered Diels-Alder reactions has been investigated and has been shown to give enhanced rates of reaction when compared to acyclic silicon tethers...|$|R

25|$|Rameau's musical works may {{be divided}} into four {{distinct}} groups, which differ greatly in importance: a few cantatas; a few motets for large chorus; some pieces for solo harpsichord or harpsichord accompanied by other instruments; and, finally, his works for the stage, to which he dedicated <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thirty</b> <b>years</b> of his career almost exclusively. Like most of his contemporaries, Rameau often reused melodies that had been particularly successful, but never without meticulously adapting them; they are not simple transcriptions. Besides, no borrowings have been found from other composers, although his earliest works show the influence of other music. Rameau's reworkings of his own material are numerous; e.g., in Les Fêtes d'Hébé, we find L'Entretien des Muses, the Musette, and the Tambourin, taken from the 1724 book of harpsichord pieces, {{as well as an}} aria from the cantata Le Berger Fidèle.|$|E
