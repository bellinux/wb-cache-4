50|$|The branch {{names are}} not usual month names; the main {{use of the}} {{branches}} for months is astrological.

For example, since the Han Dynasty, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> has been jiànyínyuè, but earlier <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> was jiànzǐyuè (during the Zhou Dynasty) or jiànchǒuyuè (traditionally during the Shang Dynasty) as well.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In this {{exploratory}} study, {{the contribution}} of delivery type to the weight gain pattern for full-term infants with exclusive breastfeeding in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> of infancy was determined. In addition, breastfeeding success among cesarean section (C-section) delivery mothers based on their neonate's weight gain {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> of infancy was evaluated. Methods A cohort of 92 neonates born in Shiraz, from July 10 to August 10, 2007 was followed longitudinally. The data were collected during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> postpartum at three occasions: 3 to 7 days postpartum, 10 - 21 days postpartum and 24 - 31 days postpartum. Results Among 92 mothers in this study, 35 (38 %) were delivered by C-section. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) showed that delivery type (p Conclusions Type of delivery contributes strongly to the weight gain pattern in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> of infancy. In spite of greater weight loss among C-section birth neonates in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> days of life, at the end of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>month</b> neonates showed a similar weight gain.

In the summer of 1583, Gebhard and Agnes took refuge, first at Vest in Vest Recklinghausen, a fief of the Electorate, and then in the Duchy of Westphalia, at Arensberg castle. In both territories, Gebhard set in motion as much of the Reformation as he could, although his soldiers indulged in a bout of iconoclasm and plundering.|$|E

Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.|$|E
