5|$|A single High Angle Control System {{director}} was fitted on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> {{and another on}} an elevated mount on the former flying-off deck. Two pom-pom directors were also mounted on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> for the weapons mounted fore and aft of <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Eighteen species of land birds breed on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> {{and there are many}} more migratory species that occur on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> and its adjacent islets, many tame enough that it is possible for humans to get quite close. <b>The</b> <b>island</b> has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E

5|$|A typhoon watch {{was issued}} for Rota, Tinian, and Saipan on December 14, which was {{upgraded}} to a typhoon warning the next day. Because Paka was intensifying while passing {{to the south}} of Rota, the first wind, or northeast through east winds, was less severe than the second wind from the southeast. Sustained winds on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> reached 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching 185km/h (115mph). Many trees in the mountainous portion of <b>the</b> <b>island</b> were left defoliated, which limited nesting and foraging sites for the endangered bridled white-eye bird. While passing {{to the south of}} <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Paka dropped 250–300mm (10–12in) of rain. Damage on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> totaled $4.4million (1997USD, $6.4million 2015USD). The typhoon also produced above-normal precipitation on Saipan.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of owner Charles van Raalte in 1907, his wife Florence stayed on Brownsea until 1925. Mary Bonham-Christie bought <b>the</b> <b>island</b> at an auction in 1927. In 1932, Bonham-Christie allowed 500 Scouts to camp there to {{celebrate}} the Silver Jubilee of Scouting, but shortly afterwards she closed <b>the</b> <b>island</b> {{to the public and}} it became very overgrown. In 1934, some Sea Scouts were camping on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> when a fire broke out. Mrs. Bonham-Christie blamed the Sea Scouts, although the fire did not start where the Sea Scouts were camping. The fire engulfed most of <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> burning west to east. The eastern buildings were only saved by a subsequent change in wind direction. Although it was not known how the fire started, Scouts were not allowed to camp on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> again until after Bonham-Christie's death in 1961. Her family becoming liable for inheritance tax on her estate, they put <b>the</b> <b>island</b> up for sale. Interested citizens who feared that <b>the</b> <b>island</b> would be bought by developers helped raise an endowment, and in 1962 the government allowed the National Trust to take over management of <b>the</b> <b>island</b> in lieu of the death duties.|$|E
5|$|After the {{government}} of Nova Scotia established a lifesaving station on Sable Island in 1801, workers trained some of the horses to haul supplies and rescue equipment. Lifesaving staff recorded the importation of a stallion, Jolly, taken there in 1801, who was probably similar in type to the original Acadian horses released on <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Although Jolly {{was not the first}} horse on <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> {{he was the first to}} be identified by name in historic records, and is known to have survived on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> until at least 1812. Other breeding stock, probably including horses of Thoroughbred, Morgan and Clydesdale breeding, were sent to <b>the</b> <b>island</b> during the first half of the 19th century, in the hopes of improving the type of horses found on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> and raising the price for which they could be sold on the mainland.|$|E
25|$|British {{fishermen}} took {{possession of}} <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> Only 2 years later, French forces under Rear-Admiral de Richery attacked <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> in 1796, sinking 80 British vessels. The British abandoned <b>the</b> <b>islands,</b> and <b>the</b> French destroyed the town. After this, <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> remained deserted until 1816.|$|R

5|$|All public activities, flights, {{and schools}} were either closed or {{canceled}} on Puerto Rico. Eighteen shelters were {{open on the}} eastern part of <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Also, on Anguilla, residents in the Sandy Ground, Valley Bottom, Welches and Mount Fortune areas were placed under evacuation orders. Shelters were opened throughout <b>the</b> <b>island</b> for those in need of shelter. Schools and government offices were also closed and visitors were told to leave <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track directly over <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and {{resulting in the}} issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing of metal sheeting and uprooting of trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Heavy rains produced by Amara also triggered flooding in some locations and caused soil erosion.|$|E
5|$|Anna Jai {{moved with}} about 70 former slaves to the Arlington {{neighborhood}} of Jacksonville {{to live out}} her remaining years. The ownership of <b>the</b> <b>island</b> and farms immediately following its sale by Gibbs is unknown, but after the American Civil War, the Freedmen's Bureau managed <b>the</b> <b>island</b> and recently emancipated freedmen lived in the former slave quarters and farmed the land. A New Hampshire farmer named John Rollins purchased <b>the</b> <b>island</b> in 1869 and, finding agriculture in Florida not as successful as he wished, transitioned <b>the</b> <b>island</b> into a tourist resort, building a large luxury hotel and attracting celebrities such as banker William Astor and writer Harriet Beecher Stowe. The slave quarters were displayed as tourist attractions. After the hotel burned down in 1888, the Rollins family successfully cultivated citrus until a freeze in 1894 destroyed their crop. Rollins' daughter's family {{was the last to}} live in the main house; she sold <b>the</b> <b>island</b> to private investors in 1923.|$|E

5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the fissure {{and began to}} build <b>the</b> <b>island</b> into a more circular shape. By 24 November, <b>the</b> <b>island</b> measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by the meeting of lava and sea water meant that <b>the</b> <b>island</b> consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, <b>the</b> <b>island</b> had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II over 350 soldiers of the Royal Artillery were stationed on <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Flat Holm was re-armed with four 4.5-inch guns and associated searchlights for anti-aircraft and close defence, together with two 40mm Bofors guns. A GL (Gun Laying) Mk II radar station was also placed in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences, and protected the Atlantic shipping convoys between Cardiff, Barry, and Flat Holm. These works were abandoned {{after the war and}} <b>the</b> <b>island</b> has had no military use since. Flat Holm's helipad still remains, however, at the centre of <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, <b>the</b> <b>island</b> {{became part of the}} front line for invasion and was heavily fortified. Along with other coastal resorts, <b>the</b> <b>island</b> drew in evacuees from London, though as the war progressed, these were moved to safer settlements further inland. 2000 troops were stationed on <b>the</b> <b>island</b> to guard against invasion. A battery of 4.7 inch guns was installed along the beach along with a Battery Observation post and a number of searchlights and pillboxes. Several of these installations survived and can still be seen along the south coast of <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> one of which has been converted into a cafe. After the war, <b>the</b> <b>island</b> suffered from severe winter weather in 1947 which destroyed much of the oyster fishery, and from the flooding of 1953, where numerous beach huts were swept out to sea.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to <b>the</b> <b>island</b> specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> waiting for the situation to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E

50|$|Spain {{initially}} claimed <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> {{that later}} comprised {{the territory of}} the Trust Territory of <b>the</b> Pacific <b>Islands</b> (TTPI). Subsequently, Germany established competing claims over <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> <b>The</b> competing claims were eventually resolved in favor of Germany when Spain, following its loss of several possessions to the United States during the Spanish-American War, ceded its claims over <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> to Germany in 1899 pursuant to the German-Spanish Treaty (1899). Germany, in turn, continued to retain possession until <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> were captured by Japan during World War I. The League of Nations formally placed <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> in <b>the</b> former South Pacific Mandate, a mandate that authorized Japanese administration of <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> <b>The</b> <b>islands</b> then remained under Japanese control until captured by the United States in 1944 during World War II.|$|R
