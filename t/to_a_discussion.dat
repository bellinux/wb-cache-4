5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{has been}} {{promoted}} to Assistant Regional Manager {{and as a result}} is inspired to find ways to be more productive, for himself and the office. However, his ideas for the office are ignored by Andy, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> with Jim in the warehouse about their increasing dissatisfaction with Dunder Mifflin. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in Philadelphia and offers him a possible position. However, as Jim has yet to tell Pam, Darryl says he should before going forward. When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her approval, is upset that Jim did not consult her beforehand.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{was also}} a guest of human rights festival One world, {{organized}} by a non-profit humanitarian organization People In Need. A film by a Swiss director Barbara Miller Forbidden Voices: How to Start a Revolution with a Laptop was among the films shown during the festival. The film presents three women - one of them being Sánchez - who use blogs and social networks to spread information from their countries living under authoritarian regimes, thus fighting for women rights or human rights in general. Sánchez was also invited <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> at the Charles University about independent journalism in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The author noted wryly {{that later}} in the series Allen's hair became similar to a Super Saiyan, a {{transformation}} in the Dragon Ball series where the character's hair becomes spiky. Hoshino said that early in D.Gray-mans publication, Allen {{was one of the}} hardest characters to draw. By the tenth volume, she said that the character was more difficult to draw than Yu Kanda. In the manga's first chapters, Allen's eyes have had different colors (such as red and light blue) due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> between Hoshino and her editor; it was later decided to give him silver eyes. The series' title, D.Gray-man, is meant to have several meanings, (most referring to the state of Allen and the other main characters).|$|E

5|$|Cayce {{flies to}} Moscow to meet Stella {{in person and}} watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an {{assassination}} attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her to the prison where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal {{that they have been}} spying on her since she posted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.|$|E

25|$|In May 2011 Lennart Poettering {{proposed}} systemd as a GNOME dependency. As systemd {{is available}} only on Linux, the proposal led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of possibly dropping support for other platforms in future GNOME releases. Since GNOME 3.2 multiseat support has been only available on systems using systemd. In November 2012 the GNOME release team concluded that systemd can be relied upon for non-basic functionality.|$|E

25|$|Cognitive dissonance {{occurs to}} a person {{when he or she}} voluntarily engages in (physically or ethically) {{unpleasant}} activities in effort to achieve a desired goal. The mental stress caused by the dissonance can be reduced by the person's exaggerating the desirability of the goal. In The Effect of Severity of Initiation on Liking for a Group (1956), to qualify for admission <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> group, two groups of people underwent an embarrassing initiation, of varied psychologic severity.

25|$|Criticisms of the {{suggestion}} range from treating the {{passage in the}} way it was written by Zosimus and ignoring {{the suggestion}}, to simply noting its speculative nature, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of problems with the suggestion (e.g., 'why would Honorius write to the cities of the Bruttii rather than to his own provincial governor for that region?', and 'why does far-off southern Italy belong in a passage about northern Italy any more than far-off Britain?'). The theory also contradicts the account of Gildas, who provides independent support that the reference is to Britain by repeating the essence of Zosimus' account and clearly applying it to Britain.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Mariátegui became {{alienated from}} the APRA, and he set about {{establishing}} the Socialist Party, which formally constituted in October of that year, with Mariátegui as general secretary (it later became the Communist Party of Peru). That year, he published his best-known work, Seven Interpretative Essays on Peruvian Reality, in which he examined Peru's social and economic situation from a Marxist perspective. It {{was considered one of}} the first materialist analyses of a Latin American society. Beginning with the country’s economic history, the book proceeds <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of the “Indian problem", which Mariátegui locates firmly within the “land problem”. Other essays are devoted to public education, religion, regionalism and centralism, and literature.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} sabbatical {{with a short}} trip to consult with Todt and {{the architects of the}} {{proposed}} grandiose plans for immense buildings at the Nazi's Party Day Rally site in Nuremberg. That led to a conflict over the best way to lay a sound foundation, which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> with Hitler himself, who took an intense interest in all details of the architecture. Terzaghi then returned to America, where he gave a plenary lecture at the International Conference on Soil Mechanics at Harvard University (the event led to the establishment of the International Society for Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering; Terzaghi was its first president). He made a lecture tour of many other universities but discovered that prospects for employment were dim. He returned to Vienna in September 1936, shortly after the birth of his first son Eric.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-20th century, wine {{production}} in the Barolo zone was dominated by large negociants who purchased grapes and wines from across the zone and blended it into a house style. In the 1960s, individual proprietors began estate bottling and producing single vineyard wines from their holdings. By the 1980s, {{a wide range of}} single vineyard bottlings were available, which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> among the region's producers about the prospect of developing a Cru classification for the area's vineyards. The cataloging of Barolo's vineyards has a long history dating back to the work of Lorenzo Fantini in the late 19th century and Renato Ratti and Luigi Veronelli in the late 20th century, but as of 2009 there is still no official classification within the region. However, in 1980 the region as a whole was elevated to DOCG status. Along with Barbaresco and Brunello di Montalcino, Barolo {{was one of the first}} Italian wine regions to attain this designation.|$|E
25|$|When {{a new set}} {{of county}} commissioners decided to remove the display cases, the local American Legion post then {{displayed}} Brostrom's Medal of Honor. In time, local veterans dwindled and the Legion Hall was taken over by the County. The last commander of the Preston American Legion Chapter in Preston then took Brostrom's display home for safe keeping. By this time, all of Brostrom's family had died except for a niece, who did not want the Medal of Honor display, citing that she {{would not be able to}} preserve it properly. A local lawyer, Jay MacKenzie, was asked to keep the display safe in his office. The medal sat there until a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, Sherman L. Fleek, who was then the command historian for the United States Military Academy at West Point and doing research on Pfc. Brostrom's life, called MacKenzie. This eventually led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> of how to properly honor Brostrom and display his Medal of Honor. Since Brostrom had been a lifetime member of the LDS Church, the Church History Library was contacted and agreed to preserve and display the medal there.|$|E
