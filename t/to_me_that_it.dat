25|$|I'm {{a little}} baffled {{as to why}} Stirling set this book in 1998. It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{requires}} more suspension of disbelief to pretend the world ended {{in the past when}} we know it didn't.|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
500|$|Another interpretation, that avoids duality, is the De Broglie–Bohm theory: known also as the pilot-wave model. In that theory, the photon is both, {{wave and}} particle. [...] "This idea {{seems to me}} so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and {{ordinary}} way, {{that it is a}} great mystery <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was so generally ignored", J.S.Bell.|$|E

5000|$|Kevin J. Coyne of Country Universe {{gave the}} song an A rating. [...] "It’s no {{surprise}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it’s</b> a charming record, perfectly produced and expertly sung.

500|$|McCudden, {{watching}} from 900meters (3,000feet), recalled: [...] "I saw him {{go into a}} fairly steep dive and so I continued to watch, and then saw the triplane hit the ground and disappear into a thousand fragments, for it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> literally went into powder." [...] There would be debate later whether Voss {{dropped out of the}} inverted triplane.|$|E
500|$|At first, their {{relationship}} followed the Nation of Islam's strictures concerning marriage; MalcolmX set {{the rules and}} BettyX obediently followed them. In 1969, Shabazz wrote that [...] "his indoctrination was so thorough, even <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has become a pattern for our [...] lives." [...] Over time, the family dynamic changed, as MalcolmX made small concessions to BettyX's demands for more independence. In 1969, Shabazz recalled: ...|$|E

It was the hardest video I`ve ever done so I kept thinking, why on earth did I come up with this concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff. Growing up it never occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> wasn’t a girly thing to ride a bike, covered in mud holding frogs and collecting lizards!".|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have tried}} {{striking}} piecemeal," [...] Maraton pointed out. [...] "It doesn't seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a success. What {{is called the}} Government here can deal with one strike at a time. They've soldiers enough, and law enough, for that. They haven't for a universal strike." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} you did, Miss Ruth, and <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> always better <b>to</b> go {{straight}} at what you've {{got to do}} without scheming--all fair an' aboveboard. Excuse me, my dear, but {{an old man who}} has sailed your lamented father's ships for over thirty years, and known you since you were a baby, may be allowed to say he's surprised that you should take to scheming." ...|$|R

500|$|A little {{matter that}} seems to have been {{overlooked}} by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, and it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. [...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years. [...] I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{called his}} U.S.-based {{advisers}} to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, {{as it would}} damage public morale. He also noted {{that because of the}} political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was {{despite the fact that the}} Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that [...] "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was [...] "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [...] political crisis". Johnson said to Taylor that [...] "Every time I get a military recommendation it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> calls for large-scale bombing. I have never felt that this war will be won from the air." [...] At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's {{supporting}} role of Dr. Rumack in Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker's 1980's Airplane! {{was a turning}} point in his career. The film, a parody of disaster films such as Zero Hour! and Airport, was based on building a comedy around actors known for dramatic roles. Other stars included Robert Stack, Peter Graves, and Lloyd Bridges. Nielsen's deadpan delivery contrasted with the absurdity surrounding him. When asked, [...] "Surely you can't be serious?", he responded with a curt, [...] "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley." [...] In several interviews he reflected on the line: [...] "I thought it was amusing, but it never occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was going to become a trademark. It's such a surprise... the thing comes out, people say, 'What did he say?! Nielsen said he was [...] "pleased and honored that [...] had a chance to deliver that line." [...] As of 2010, the comedic exchange was at No.79 on the American Film Institute's AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes. The American Film Institute included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time in 2008, and a 2007 survey in the United Kingdom judged it the second greatest comedy film of all time. In 2012 Empire magazine voted it No.1 in The 50 Funniest Comedies Ever poll. Critics praised the film, which also proved a long-term success with audiences. In 2010 Airplane! was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.|$|E
5000|$|They {{were quite}} splendidly {{appointed}} {{as a sort}} of private temple; but when Cardell showed me a bronze tripod which was obviously 19th century and tried <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been dug up from the ruins of Pompeii, I became rather unhappy. When he showed me a bronze statue of Thor and tried <b>to</b> tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was of a Celtic horned god. I couldn't help myself pointing out that Thor was not a Celtic god - and then he became rather unhappy.|$|R
3000|$|I had a {{class of}} lazy {{students}} not studying their book, whenever I came to class and asked the meaning of some words, they only passed me a smile. After that on I decided to push them some way else. <b>It</b> occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it’s</b> {{a good idea to}} make a picture dictionary with students to get them enjoy learning new words. Later on my students were really hungry to learn more. (Journal 48, February 28, 2015) [...]...|$|R

2500|$|While studying, Gaudron {{attempted}} to obtain articles of clerkship (then {{five years in}} duration), but was not successful.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving written use of {{the term}} {{can be found in the}} diary of 2nd Lieutenant Jackson B. A. Lowrance, who wrote the following on February 6, 1863 while in Pender County, southeastern North Carolina: [...] "I know now what is meant by the Piney Woods of North Carolina and the idea occurs <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is no wonder we are called 'Tar Heels'." ...|$|E

5000|$|In November 2008, state {{officials}} {{expressed concern that}} the program had become a [...] "dumping ground" [...] for prisoners from around the state, including those convicted of violent felonies. Bernalillo County Sheriff Darren White commented: [...] "They were established as a treatment facility and not a jail, and <b>it</b> appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> being run as such." [...] Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chávez ordered an investigation to establish the status of the inmates and Second Chance was given a deadline in December 2008 to account for its inmates.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{resulting}} representation, {{also called the}} de Broglie–Bohm theory or Bohmian mechanics, the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or quantum potential. [...] "This idea seems to me so natural and simple, to resolve the wave-particle dilemma in such a clear and ordinary way, {{that it is a}} great mystery <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was so generally ignored", J.S.Bell.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, the Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum {{formally}} petitioned Commissioner Rob Manfred for reinstatement, {{on grounds}} that Jackson had [...] "more than served his sentence" [...] in the 95 years since his banishment by Landis. [...] Manfred denied the request after an official review. [...] "The results of this work demonstrate <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not possible now, over 95 years since those events took place and were considered by Commissioner Landis, to be certain enough of the truth to overrule Commissioner Landis' determinations", he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|At this dinner Göring {{presented}} Lindbergh {{with the}} Commander Cross of the Order of the German Eagle. Lindbergh's acceptance proved controversial after Kristallnacht, an anti-Jewish pogrom in Germany {{a few weeks}} later. Lindbergh declined to return the medal, later writing: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} the returning of decorations, which were given in times of peace and as a gesture of friendship, can have no constructive effect. If I were to return the German medal, it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be an unnecessary insult. Even if war develops between us, I can see no gain in indulging in a spitting contest before that war begins." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Benaderet {{was cast}} in Petticoat Junction, she was hailed as having [...] "finally" [...] become a star. She had {{previously}} played supporting roles throughout her career, usually as a next-door neighbor, and had been openly averse to leading roles. However, in January 1963, following CBS' acquisition of Petticoat Junction, she enthused to Eve Starr of The Mercury: [...] "Isn't it nice? After all these years. ... just never occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might...golly, my own show!” During promotional interviews, Benaderet often discussed facets of the acting profession with reporters, and believed that leading a series required a [...] "feeling of responsibility", including her being more observant of on-set activity and her costars' performances, while continuously evolving her character.|$|E
2500|$|Randall Wallace, {{who wrote}} the screenplay, has {{acknowledged}} Blind Harry's 15th century epic poem The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie as a major inspiration for the film. In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, [...] "Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> spoke to my heart." [...] Blind Harry's poem is now not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film that are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the hanging of Scottish nobles at the start), there are large parts that are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella).|$|E
2500|$|Jackson stated, [...] "I {{think the}} Court's {{decision}} of the question whether it complied with the Articles of War is uncalled for. The history and {{the language of the}} Articles are to me a plain demonstration that they are clearly inapplicable to this case and it is abundantly clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is well within the war powers of the President to create a non-statutory military tribunal of the sort here in question." [...] He further wrote [...] "The right to convene such an advisory committee of his staff as a 'military commission' for the discharge of his duties toward prisoners of war is one that follows from his position as commander in chief." [...] Nonetheless, Jackson maintained that the President's power should be [...] "discharged, of course, in the light of any obligation undertaken by our country under treaties or conventions or under customs and usages so generally accepted as to constitute the laws of warfare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no. But it is strange, even <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> loving <b>it</b> so {{much and}} being so much beloved in it, I can bear to cast it away. It seems so neglectful of it, so unthankful.' ...|$|R
