5|$|Blackburn {{was killed}} when a {{pyroclastic}} flow enveloped the area where he was camped out. His car was found four days later, surrounded up to <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> ash with his body inside. The windows had been broken and ash filled {{the interior of the}} vehicle.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the 19th-century part are {{topped with}} trefoils (a {{stonework}} pattern of three overlapping circles) and set into square frames. The north wall has three windows, {{one with a}} single light (or section) and two with pairs of lights; there are two windows on the south wall (one with three lights, another with two) {{as well as a}} blocked window at the east end of the wall. The church's east window is a pointed arch with a lower section of three trefoil-headed lights and two smaller lights on top. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the extension are set into pointed arches.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge {{used his}} {{authority}} under the Antiquities Act {{to declare the}} statue a National Monument. The only successful suicide in the statue's history occurred five years later, when a man climbed {{out of one of}} <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the crown and jumped to his death, glancing off the statue's breast and landing on the base.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, the {{location}} of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> versus <b>the</b> whole of the image must be adjusted so {{that most of the}} image is seen beyond <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of viewing on a 3D TV set, it is easier to place <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> image, and to let <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane of the screen.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>windows</b> are three- and four-light, in the Perpendicular style, mostly {{dating from}} the 15th century. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north aisle is {{reticulated}} and <b>the</b> east <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chapel to the south is curvilinear. The chancel has two-light casement windows.|$|R
50|$|This {{paradigm}} {{is also known}} as restricted dataflow because instructions within <b>the</b> <b>window</b> execute <b>in</b> dataflow order (not necessarily in program order) but <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> which this occurs is restricted (of finite size).|$|R
5|$|Stained {{glass windows}} {{telling the story}} of the Book of Job are set into the walls of the {{staircases}} between the narthex and the gallery. Friend was known for delivering popular lectures on Job, and Milliner speculates that Friend had these windows included {{to address the problem of}} evil. Connick designed <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> consultation with Friend, but they were made by others after the former's death.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{occupation}} in 1940 {{led to the}} closing of the church. During World War II, services were continued, but in the spring of 1944 hooligans broke into the church and destroyed the altar with the altarpiece, the organ, the chairs and <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> <b>In</b> 1946, the congregation asked the Soviet government to list the Cathedral as a protected historical monument, but it failed to raise their interest. The church was empty for years; for some time it was used for storing grain, even plans for turning it into a swimming-pool were made.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{claims that}} another {{building}} {{associated with the}} planet Venus {{in the form of}} Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the Caracol. This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star. However <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.|$|E

5|$|Internally, {{the south}} range {{includes}} three 16th- or early-17th-century stone fireplaces that {{have probably been}} reused from the earlier house. The north room of the attic floor and principal room {{on the first floor}} include 16th- or early-17th-century timber panelling. The room over the entrance hall features late-17th-century panelling. Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The stairwell includes windows with 17th-century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated stained glass.|$|E
5|$|Moderate wind gusts {{throughout}} the state downed hundreds of trees, tree limbs, and power lines. Over 382,000people were without power, {{one of the worst}} power outages on record for area utilities. Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in Union County. One downed tree greatly damaged a house in Middletown, and in Hudson County several trees fell onto and damaged cars. A downed tree in Englewood injured a woman when she was struck, and a woman in Independence Township was killed when a fallen tree landed on the vehicle she was driving. Strong winds from Isabel blew out <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> an office building in East Rutherford, causing injuries to two women when they were struck. Throughout the state, damage totaled to about $50million (2003USD, $59million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|The nave of {{the church}} (where the {{congregation}} sat) has no aisle. The chancel (site of the altar) is at {{the east end of}} the nave. There is a porch, which contains an 18th-century memorial, {{on the south side of}} the nave towards the west end, and a vestry to the north. Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the nave have two lights (sections of window separated by mullions), save for one to the west of the porch, which has one light. The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows, the tallest in the middle.|$|E

5|$|The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers {{were added}} to the old house in the 1913 {{renovation}} (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows {{on the first floor of}} the new wing matched the old windows, but <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The house has a total of 28 rooms.|$|E
5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} {{to be used to}} deal with an external threat approaching from {{the far side of the}} river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards plenty of room to fire. The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E
5|$|William Wailes {{produced}} a {{design for the}} seven-light east window following a competition launched in 1846; however, delays in raising the money caused delays in its installation. Controversy over the design meant that it was replaced with the current depiction of the Crucifixion by Clayton and Bell in 1904. The tree design {{in the window of}} the south transept was also by Wailes and was installed in 1854. In the north transept is a memorial window to Samuel Lucas who died in 1853, designed and installed by the St Helens Crown Glass Company which later became Pilkington. Another Wailes design depicting the Offering of the Wise Men was installed in the Lady Chapel, alongside one designed by Arthur O'Connor. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the choir aisles are by Clayton and Bell who also designed the memorial to Edward Colston which is in the north wall of the north transept.|$|E

5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment over the door. The main house originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The chimney was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits behind the house. The property also had a dairy barn that was rebuilt following its destruction in the 1938 New England hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The fourth tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 2:45a.m. EST near Peacocks Crossroads in Johnston County, knocking down several trees, {{some of which}} were mature. Significant roof damage occurred after the tornado struck a double-wide mobile home and destroyed the porch of another home. Another mobile home had some of its siding torn off before the tornado dissipated. No injuries were reported {{as a result of the}} tornado and damages amounted to $30,000. The tornado was rated as an EF1 by the National Weather Service. The fifth tornado of {{the outbreak}} touched down around 3:03a.m. EST near U.S. Route 70, damaging several pine trees and causing minor roof damage. Tracking towards the northeast, the tornado destroyed a carport and the car inside. A trailer was rolled on its side and a nearby home sustained siding and shingle damage. Afterwords, the tornado struck a horse farm where it destroyed a small barn and damaged a stable. Before dissipating, the tornado blew out <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> the garage of one home. No injuries were reported as a result of the tornado and damages amounted to $75,000. The tornado was rated as a high-end EF0 by the National Weather Service.|$|E
