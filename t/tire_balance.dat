50|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>balance,</b> also {{referred}} to as tire unbalance or imbalance, describes the distribution of mass within an automobile tire or the entire wheel (including the rim) to which it is attached.|$|E
50|$|After {{the tire}} has been cured, {{there are several}} {{additional}} operations. Tire uniformity measurement is a test where the tire is automatically mounted on wheel halves, inflated, run against a simulated road surface, and measured for force variation. <b>Tire</b> <b>balance</b> measurement is a test where the tire is automatically placed on wheel halves, rotated at a high speed and measured for imbalance.|$|E
50|$|When a {{wheel and}} tire rotate, they exert a {{centrifugal}} {{force on the}} axle {{that depends on the}} location of their center of mass and the orientation of their moment of inertia. This is referred to as balance, imbalance, or unbalance. Tires are checked at the point of manufacture for excessive static imbalance and dynamic imbalance using automatic <b>tire</b> <b>balance</b> machines. Tires are checked again in the auto assembly plant or tire retail shop after mounting the tire to the wheel. Assemblies that exhibit excessive imbalance are corrected by applying balance weights to the wheels to counteract the tire/wheel imbalance.|$|E

50|$|Rotor {{dynamics}} is {{a specialized}} branch of applied mechanics {{concerned with the}} behavior and diagnosis of rotating structures. It is commonly {{used to analyze the}} behavior of structures ranging from jet engines and steam turbines to auto engines and computer disk storage. At its most basic level rotor dynamics is concerned with one or more mechanical structures (rotors) supported by bearings and influenced by internal phenomena that rotate around a single axis. The supporting structure is called a stator. As the speed of rotation increases the amplitude of vibration often passes through a maximum that is called a critical speed. This amplitude is commonly excited by unbalance of the rotating structure; everyday examples include engine balance and <b>tire</b> <b>balance.</b> If the amplitude of vibration at these critical speeds is excessive then catastrophic failure occurs. In addition to this, turbo machinery often develop instabilities which are related to the internal makeup of turbo machinery, and which must be corrected. This is the chief concern of engineers who design large rotors.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{possible}} to arrange the weight distribution of the wheels for better balancing. There are several methods of doing this, all being conceptually analogous to <b>tire</b> <b>balancing</b> with wheel weights. Most bench grinders never have these operations performed, because wheel dressing alone is enough to keep them sufficiently balanced, but these additional methods are not unusual for bench grinders and are quite common for machine tools that do grinding, such as surface grinders and cylindrical grinders. This is sometimes achieved by drilling a few holes in the steel flanges that hold the grinding wheels and then finding the angular orientation at which the holes' lack of weight balances out a heavy spot elsewhere on the rotating mass. Another method is a dedicated type of large flange with little weights that can be screwed down wherever needed for balancing (called a balancing flange).|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} about {{development}} of an omni direc-tional vehicle on a spherical tire. The vehicle moves by rolling a spherical <b>tire</b> and <b>balancing</b> on it. We selected a basketball as a spherical tire, because basketball is made of rubber. In general, rubber tire has three features, which are durability, adaptabilities to the ground surface and force transmissivity. We think that using a basketball as a spherical tire is low-cost and advantageous. Next, we describe how to calculate torque and angular velocity, which motors generate to roll a basketball. They need for driving motors and dynamic simulations. Finally, we propose an interface to operate the vehicle. One, who rides on the vehicle, can moves to all directions by shifting one’s the center of mass. A six-axis force-torque sensor senses weight shift. I...|$|R

40|$|Automobile {{wheel is}} an {{important}} component in vehicles to support the vehicle weight and maintain the contact between the vehicle body and road. Automotive wheels have evolved over the decades using materials from steels to aluminum and magnesium alloys. Aluminum wheels have gain popularity over steel wheels because they have less weight, better cosmetic appearance, and higher thermal conductivity for faster dissipation of heat from brakes. A rim is subject to mainly radial load and inflation pressure. The radial load is exerted on the rim as a vertical reaction force by road surface on four <b>tires</b> to <b>balance</b> the weight of a car. The radial load is applied to the rim at the bead seats with the tire, following a cosine function distribution around the contact area. The tire air pressure is applied directly on the rim at its outer side and indirectly at the rim flange. This project studied the influence of the radial load and the tire inflation pressure on the stress and displacement distribution in the wheel rim. A computer aided design model of an aluminum alloy wheel rim is analyzed using ANSYS. The geometrical parameters of the rim is further optimized to reduce weight...|$|R

White people call them unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Ezekiel, in the Old Testament, saw a wheel {{that looked like a}} cloud by day but a pillar of fire by night. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that that wheel was built on the island of Nippon, which is now called Japan, by some of the Original scientists. It took $15 billion in gold at that time to build it. It is made of the toughest steel. America does not yet know the composition of the steel used to make an instrument like it. It is a circular plane, and the Bible says that it never makes turns. Because of its circular nature it can stop and travel in all directions at speeds of thousands of miles per hour. He said there are 1,500 small wheels in this Mother Wheel, which is a half mile by a half mile m by 800 m. This Mother Wheel is like a small human-built planet. Each one of these small planes carry three bombs.The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said these planes were used to set up mountains on the earth. The Qur'an says it like this: We have raised mountains on the earth lest it convulse with you. How do you raise a mountain, and {{what is the purpose of}} a mountain?

6000|$|It is {{a strange}} {{conjunction}} this of roofs and mastheads, of walls and yard-arms. I remember once having the incongruity of the relation brought home {{to me in a}} practical way. I was the chief officer of a fine ship, just docked with a cargo of wool from Sydney, after a ninety days' passage. In fact, we had not been in more than half an hour and I was still busy making her fast to the stone posts of a very narrow quay in front of a lofty warehouse. An old man with a gray whisker under the chin and brass buttons on his pilot-cloth jacket, hurried up along the quay hailing my ship by name. He was one of those officials called berthing-masters-- not the one who had berthed us, but another, who, apparently, had been busy securing a steamer {{at the other end of}} the dock. I could see from afar his hard blue eyes staring at us, as if fascinated, with a queer sort of absorption. I wondered what that worthy sea- dog had found to criticise in my ship's rigging. And I, too, glanced aloft anxiously. I could see nothing wrong there. But perhaps that superannuated fellow-craftsman was simply admiring the ship's perfect order aloft, I thought, with some secret pride; for the chief officer is responsible for his ship's appearance, and as to her outward condition, he is the man open to praise or blame. Meantime the old salt ("ex-coasting skipper" [...] was writ large all over his person) had hobbled up alongside in his bumpy, shiny boots, and, waving an arm, short and thick like the flipper of a seal, terminated by a paw red as an uncooked beef-steak, addressed the poop in a muffled, faint, roaring voice, as if a sample of every North-Sea fog of his life had been permanently lodged in his throat: [...] "Haul 'em round, Mr. Mate!" [...] were his words. [...] "If you don't look sharp, you'll have your topgallant yards through the windows of that 'ere warehouse presently!" [...] This was the only cause of his interest in the ship's beautiful spars. I own that for a time I was struck dumb by the bizarre associations of yard-arms and window-panes. To break windows is the last thing one would think of in connection with a ship's topgallant yard, unless, indeed, one were an experienced berthing-master in one of the London docks. This old chap was doing his little share of the world's work with proper efficiency. His little blue eyes had made out the danger many hundred yards off. His rheumaticky feet, <b>tired</b> with <b>balancing</b> that squat body for many years upon the decks of small coasters, and made sore by miles of tramping upon the flagstones of the dock side, had hurried up in time to avert a ridiculous catastrophe. I answered him pettishly, I fear, and as if I had known all about it before.|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{stability}} and safety performance of active safety systems, vehicle control systems are increasingly incorporating sophisticated chassis actuator control functions. Thus vehicle control systems require efficient control algorithms {{to reduce the amount}} of duplicate hardware or adopt various actuator combinations in response to diverse customer demands and various hardware combinations from different suppliers. One of the main challenges for efficient controller design is how to create a flexible modular design which can respond to different reference vehicle behaviors and provide optimal actuator apportionment, while avoiding functional conflicts between chassis sub-systems. The proposed control methodology offers a total vehicle motion control solution for an active safety system by addressing the issue of flexible modular design in integrated vehicle control systems. In this thesis, modularity is realized by a model-based hierarchical control structure consisting of three layers: an upper layer for reference vehicle motions, an intermediate layer for actuator apportionment, and a lower layer for stand-alone actuator control. The reference vehicle motions can be determined by any type of reference model for vehicle stability control or collision avoidance control. The actuator apportionment uses Model Predictive Control (MPC) to provide flexibility by <b>balancing</b> <b>tire</b> forces to track target reference vehicle motions while simultaneously considering constrained conditions, such as actuator limits or available actuator combinations. Moreover, the MPC is designed to be feasible in real-time using a linear time-varying MPC approach which avoids the complexity of full nonlinear MPC and addresses the vehicle nonlinearity. The effectiveness of the proposed control structure is investigated for vehicle stability control in terms of handling stability and handling responsiveness. The handing stability and responsiveness of the control structure appear to be robust with respect to various uncertain environments including model-plant mismatch and diverse driving conditions. It is then applied to collision avoidance systems by adapting the reference vehicle motions at the upper level of the controller. Collision avoidance is found to be nearly as effective as that of the combination of an optimizing driver supported by the MPC-based stability controller; this suggests that the MPC approach could be used in future high performance collision avoidance systems...|$|R
