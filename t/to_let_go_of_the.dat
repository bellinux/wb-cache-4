5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted up slowly at first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E
5|$|The {{two men are}} {{haunted by}} the fate the girl will suffer and {{formulate}} a plan to rescue her. They break into the laboratory and free her from confinement, but the lab's alarms are triggered. The three escape in an armored truck and drive along a narrow suspended roadway over {{what appears to be}} a domed city built in a crater. Police hovercrafts are in pursuit, and one of them comes very low to the roadway to block the fugitives' truck. The roadway collapses when the protagonists try to force their way through, sending the truck plummeting. The winged girl refuses <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hands of her rescuers, and the three of them fall into the abyss.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} cake factory, {{where he is}} trapped in a vat of cake mix. His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight and the machine is activated, but while trying to get Perry <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people below to still not want to celebrate his birthday. Doofenshmirtz, defeated, drops the ice cream cone he is eating in the fight and it {{falls to the ground}} below.|$|E

5|$|They {{arrive at}} the planet and travel to an {{underground}} vault which had been ransacked. As {{they are about to}} leave, Worf discovers a secret chamber containing the sword. They are attacked by Toral (Rick Pasqualone), son of Duras who had hired the Lethean and wants the sword for the prestige of finding it. Kor, Worf and Jadzia fight past Toral and his men and after finding that they cannot transport back to the Runabout in orbit, they head into the adjoining cave system {{in order to try to}} get out of range of whatever Toral is using to block the transporter. As they travel through the caves, the Klingons begin to be affected by the prestige of the sword. Kor begins to talk about how it would allow him to overthrow Chancellor Gowron and Emperor Kahless II but Worf says that he should be the one to lead their people. Suddenly, Kor slips down the side of a cliff but refuses <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword. Worf grabs the other end of the sword, and tries to convince Kor to let go as he cannot pull him and the sword up.|$|E

25|$|Sigmund Freud {{believed}} {{that as a}} child progresses through each of the different stages in psychosexual development, during {{the third year of}} the child’s life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a castration complex (in boys) or penis envy (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the Oedipus complex occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother (Electra complex in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love for his parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.|$|E
25|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{was born}} in Stockholm as the oldest son of Duke Charles of the Vasa dynasty and his second wife, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. At the time, the King of Sweden was Gustavus Adolphus' cousin Sigismund. The staunch Protestant Duke Charles forced the Catholic Sigismund <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> throne of Sweden in 1599, {{a part of the}} {{preliminary}} religious strife before the Thirty Years' War, and reigned as regent before taking the throne as Charles IX of Sweden in 1604. Crown Prince Gustav Adolph had Gagnef-Floda in Dalecarlia as a duchy from 1610. Upon his father's death in October 1611, a sixteen-year-old Gustavus inherited the throne (declared of age and able to reign himself at seventeen as of 16 December), as well as an ongoing succession of occasionally belligerent dynastic disputes with his Polish cousin. Sigismund III wanted to regain the throne of Sweden and tried to force Gustavus Adolphus to renounce the title.|$|E

25|$|Biff {{leaves the}} {{restaurant}} in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy has picked up. They leave a confused and upset Willy {{behind in the}} restaurant. When they later return home, their mother angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries unsuccessfully to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father {{that he is not}} meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The feud reaches an apparent climax with Biff hugging Willy and crying as he tries to get Willy <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed (despite her urging him to follow her), lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he sees his long-dead brother Ben, whom Willy idolized. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house. Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out.|$|E
25|$|On Volume 30, Anderson was {{defeated}} by Madison Eagles in a match, where the winner would receive a shot at MsChif's Shimmer Championship. The following day Anderson defeated Misaki Ohata on Volume 31 and Ayako Hamada in the main event of Volume 32, before demanding a title match from the new Shimmer Champion Eagles. She received her title match on September 11, 2010, on Volume 33, but {{was defeated}} by Eagles. The following day on Volume 36 Melissa pinned Eagles to win an eight-woman elimination tag team match, where she, Ayako Hamada, Ayumi Kurihara and Serena Deeb defeated Eagles, Daizee Haze, Sara Del Rey and Tomoka Nakagawa. On October 2, 2011, at Volume 43, Melissa defeated Kana to become the number one contender to the Shimmer Championship. Later that same day on Volume 44, Melissa defeated Madison Eagles to become the fourth Shimmer Champion. During her title celebration, she was attacked from behind by Nicole Matthews. Melissa made her first two title defenses on March 17, 2012, defeating Nicole Matthews on Volume 45 and Portia Perez on Volume 46. The following day, after successfully defending the Shimmer Championship against Jessie McKay on Volume 47, Melissa lost the title to Saraya Knight on Volume 48. After pinning Knight to win a ten-woman elimination tag team match on October 28 at the tapings of Volume 50, Melissa was granted a rematch for the Shimmer Championship the following day on Volume 52, but was defeated after being hit with the title belt. On April 6, 2013, at the Volume 53 internet pay-per-view (iPPV) in Secaucus, New Jersey, Melissa defeated Knight in a steel cage match to win the Shimmer Championship for the second time. Melissa made her first successful title defense a week later on April 13 at Volume 54, where she defeated Mercedes Martinez. Later that same day on Volume 55, Melissa made another successful title defense against Courtney Rush. The following day on Volume 56, Melissa made her third and final title defense of the weekend by defeating Kalamity. Later that same day on Volume 57, Melissa took part in Allison Danger's retirement match, where she and Ayako Hamada faced Danger and Leva Bates. Melissa initially submitted Danger for the win, but the decision was reversed when Melissa turned heel and refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hold after the match. Post-match, the evil Melissa completed her heel turn by attacking Hamada. On October 19 at Volume 58, Melissa made her fourth successful title defense against Leva Bates. Post-match Melissa attacked both Bates and the retired Allison Danger, before being chased away by LuFisto. Later that same day, after another successful defense against Hiroyo Matsumoto on Volume 59, Melissa was again run off by LuFisto, who was, as a result, named the next challenger for her Shimmer Championship. The title match between Melissa and LuFisto {{took place on the}} following day's Volume 60 and saw Melissa retain the title. Following the match, Melissa was taken to a local hospital, where she received ten stitches above her left eye. As a result, Volume 61 became the first Volume in Shimmer history, which did not feature a Cheerleader Melissa match. On April 5 at the Volume 62 iPPV in New Orleans, Louisiana, Melissa successfully defended the Shimmer Championship against LuFisto in a two out of three falls match, following outside interference from Mercedes Martinez. A week later on Volume 64, Melissa made another successful title defense against Japanese wrestler Yumi Ohka. On April 13, Melissa first successfully defended the Shimmer Championship against Mia Yim on Volume 65, before teaming with Mercedes Martinez to unsuccessfully challenge the Global Green Gangsters (Kellie Skater and Tomoka Nakagawa) for the Shimmer Tag Team Championship on Volume 66. On October 18, Melissa first made another successful defense of the Shimmer Championship against Kana on Volume 67, before losing the title to Nicole Matthews in a four-way elimination match, also involving Athena and Madison Eagles, on Volume 68.|$|E
500|$|According to author Rikky Rooksby, {{the song}} is written {{in the style of}} Album-oriented rock (AOR) by bands like Boston or Foreigner. It is slowed down from the tempo of rock songs and {{utilizes}} a steadily reverberating synth keyboard to bring on the effect of a heartbeat. [...] "I'll Remember" [...] has characteristics of late Seventies song apart from the arrangement and the low bass. Madonna sings in a low-key voice which is almost overshadowed by the synth arrangement. Lyrically the song talks about Madonna looking back on a good love affair. According to Alex Balk from The Awl, the lyrics were inspirational, especially the line [...] "I learned <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illusion that we can possess", which is answered by Madonna herself that [...] " [...] remember, happiness".|$|E
5000|$|Eduardo Rivadavia from AllMusic wrote a {{predominantly}} positive {{review of the}} album, describing the band as a [...] "stubborn trio who refuse <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> their 70s proto-metal dreams".|$|R

500|$|Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature {{magazine}} {{found the}} [...] "seductive" [...] throbbing {{beat of the}} track [...] "completely at ease with Jared's risqué lyrics". Leto described [...] "Up in the Air" [...] as a passionate and energetic song that [...] "feels really free" [...] but also features the concept of constraint and tension, particularly evident in the line [...] "I'll wrap my hands around your neck so tight with love". Leto explained that the lyric plays on two different levels, giving a sexual connotation to the line, but also the idea of power and control. He further said that the song [...] "has to do with getting to a {{point in your life}} where you're ready <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, embrace change and become more of who you really are".|$|E
500|$|The song {{starts with}} a C major chord {{sequence}} and is used on the flattened seventh key of the sequence. But the actual key of the song is D major. It {{is set in a}} time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Madonna's voice spans from F3 to G4. A much stronger arrangement of drums are used in the second verse. The chorus uses the chord sequence of D–G–Bm–A while the first two lines of each verse uses the chord progression of C–D–C–D7–C–D–Bm–A. During the intermediate line [...] "I learned <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> illusion that we can possess", the structure changes to D/F–Bm–G–D–A–G–A. Backing vocals are used on the later choruses for support with the strings, cascading down to a minor arrangement before the third one. The song ends with fading out and devoid of any musical climax.|$|E
500|$|Along with {{introducing}} the band's new sound, the song opens the album as {{a statement of}} intent. Lyrically, new anticipations and appetites are suggested ("I'm ready for what's next"), as is a willingness to throw caution to the wind and take risks ("I'm ready <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steering wheel"). Some of the lyrics, particularly those in the bridge before the final chorus, use the eponymous subway station {{as a metaphor for}} time: [...] "Time is a train / Makes the future the past / Leaves you standing in the station / Your face pressed up against the glass". Bono cites the enjoyment of his first child born in 1989 as a major influence on Achtung Baby, as was his wife's second pregnancy during the album's 1991 recording. Bono says babies influenced the lines from the first verse, [...] "I'm ready to say I'm glad to be alive / I'm ready, I'm ready for the push".|$|E

500|$|In the computer-animated film , set {{two years}} {{following}} the conclusion of Final Fantasy VII, Cloud lives with Tifa {{in the city of}} Edge, along with Marlene, Barret's adopted daughter, and Denzel, an orphan afflicted with a rampant and deadly disease called Geostigma. Having given up his life as a mercenary, Cloud works as a courier for the [...] "Strife Delivery Service" [...] that Tifa set up in her new bar. Confronted by Tifa following the disappearance of Denzel and Marlene, it is revealed that he also suffers from the effects of Geostigma, and he responds that he is unfit to protect his friends and new family. However, when urged by Tifa <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, Cloud sets out for the Forgotten City in search of the children. There, Cloud confronts Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo, genetic remnants of Sephiroth left behind before he diffused into the Lifestream completely. Cloud's battle with Kadaj later takes them back to Aerith's church, where Cloud recovers from his Geostigma with Aerith's help. Kadaj, merging with the remains of Jenova, resurrects Sephiroth. Cloud, having overcome his doubts, defeats Sephiroth once more, leaving a dying Kadaj in his place. At the film's conclusion, Cloud, seeing Aerith and Zack, assures the two that he will be fine and reunites with his friends.|$|E
500|$|Michael Tedder of New York {{felt that}} the main story was weak and that the [...] "plot line might have made more sense last year, with Andy trying to take his mind off {{troubles}} with Erin or Robert California by trying to regress to his college days without it working, but these days Andy is the boss and has the girl." [...] He did, however, compliment the appearance of Colbert, writing that [...] "it was still nice to see the two Daily Show alums sparring again." [...] He was also complimentary towards the [...] "little tidbits", such as Dwight's subplot. Bonnie Stiergnberg of Paste {{felt that the}} episode was too rushed and that the storylines {{did not have a}} chance to naturally play out. She wrote that, [...] "Each thread provided some interesting character development or set up future storylines, but, crammed together in the same 21 minutes, they made for a slightly disjointed-feeling episode." [...] WhatCulture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer gave the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five and called it the [...] "first dud of the ninth season". He criticized the story, saying that [...] "the plot's failure [...] the goal of the story was not met by the means the writers chose to employ; there was no sense of grand scope or deep-rooted history, just Andy being petty and refusing <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past as he's challenged by his old friend." [...] Kratzer called Dwight and Nellie's subplot the [...] "most successful story" [...] in the episode.|$|E
