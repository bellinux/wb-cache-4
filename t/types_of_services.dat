All of the interchanges are trumpet interchanges, except the Jankomir interchange, which is a cloverleaf interchange. There {{are a number of}} rest areas along the motorway providing various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> ranging from simple parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations, restaurants and hotels. As of July 2011, the motorway has seven interchanges providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network.

They were a mixed-traffic design, being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains, and were used on all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> frequently far below their capabilities. A total of 110locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950, named after West Country resorts or Royal Air Force (RAF) and other subjects associated with the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The A9 {{motorway}} has {{at least}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each direction along its entire length, except at the Mirna Bridge and the Limska Draga Viaduct where there are two traffic lanes instead. The motorway comprises several types of interchanges at the motorway exits: At Kanfanar and Pula there are cloverleaf interchanges; Višnjan and both Vodnjan exits are trumpet interchanges; Buje exit is a diamond interchange; and the rest are partial cloverleaf interchanges. There {{are a number of}} rest areas along the motorway providing various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> ranging from simple parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations and other facilities. As of September 2011 the motorway has ten interchanges, in addition to the roundabout at the northern terminus, providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network.|$|E

In this study, a total <b>of</b> twelve <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> skill are identified. A measurement model for service skills is developed accordingly and tested with the use <b>of</b> hotel <b>service.</b> The results <b>of</b> confirmatory factor analysis reveal acceptable model fit, suggesting that these twelve <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> skill can be classified into two categories: technical versus functional.

25|$|The {{growing number}} of people living to their 80s and 90s in the {{developed}} world has strained public welfare systems and has also resulted in increased incidence of diseases like cancer and dementia that were rarely seen in premodern times. When the United States Social Security program was created, persons older than 65 numbered only around 5% of the population and the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1936 was approximately 5 years, while in 2011 it could often range from 10 to 20 years. Other issues that can arise from an increasing population are growing demands for health care and an increase in demand for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
25|$|The region, with a {{population}} of over 5.8 million inhabitants, is divided into five provinces: Naples, Benevento, Avellino, Caserta and Salerno. Over half of the population is resident in the province of Naples, where there is {{a population}} density of 2,626 inhabitants per km2. Within the province, the highest density can be found along the coast, where it reaches 13,000 inhabitants per km2 in the city of Portici. The region, which was characterised until recently by an acute economic contrast between internal and coastal areas, has shown an improvement in the last decade thanks {{to the development of the}} provinces of Benevento and Avellino. At the same time, the provinces of Naples, Caserta and in part Salerno, have developed a variety of activities connected to advanced <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
25|$|IRNSS is an {{independent}} regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It {{is designed to provide}} accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. IRNSS will provide two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS) and is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20m in the primary service area. It is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by Indian Space Research Organisation, which is under total control of Indian government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years.|$|E

500|$|Aeroflot, at its {{formation}} in March 1932, had three main purposes. They were: to {{operate and maintain}} an air transportation system, to provide different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> (such as aerial surveying, forest-fire fighting, and agricultural spraying) and to promote educational, recreational, athletic and other such activities for the public. Aeroflot, which literally translates to or air fleet, originally consisted of an amalgam of existing air transportation fleets in the Soviet Union in the 1920s. By creating Aeroflot, the Soviet government was, much like many industries in the young Soviet Union at the time, expanding and centralizing fleets like the [...] "Red Air Fleet." [...] To the general public, the aviation industry did not represent modernization; rather, it represented the means to achieve modernization and future glory.|$|E

The {{route is}} complete and {{further development of}} the motorway includes only the construction of additional rest areas. The A6 motorway consists {{of at least two}} traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction along its entire length, except in tunnels, where there are emergency bays instead. Sections of the A6 motorway steeper than 4% grade have three traffic lanes, and slow vehicles are restricted to driving in the rightmost lane. All of the interchanges are trumpet interchanges.
