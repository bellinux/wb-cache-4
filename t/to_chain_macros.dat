40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} paradigm shifts of modern business management is that individual businesses no longer compete as solely autonomous entities, but rather as supply chains. Firms worldwide have embraced the concept of supply chain management as important and sometimes critical to their business. The idea of a collaborative supply <b>chain</b> is <b>to</b> gain a competitive advantage by improving overall performance through measuring a holistic perspective of the supply chain. However, contemporary performance measurement theory is somewhat fragmented and fails to support this idea. Therefore, this research develops and applies an integrated supply chain performance measurement framework that provides a more holistic approach to the study of supply chain performance measurement by combining both supply <b>chain</b> <b>macro</b> processes and decision making levels. Therefore, the proposed framework can provide a balanced horizontal (cross-process) and vertical (hierarchical decision) view and measure the performance of the entire supply chain system. Firstly, literature on performance measurement frameworks and performance measurement factors of supply chain management will help to develop a conceptual framework. Next the proposed framework will be presented. The framework will be validated through in-depth interviews with three Thai manufacturing companies. The fieldwork combined varied sources {{in order to understand the}} views of manufacturers on supply chain performance in the three case study companies. The collected data were analyzed, interpreted, and reported using thematic analysis and analysis hierarchy process (AHP), which was influenced by the study’s conceptual framework. This research contributes a new theory of supply chain performance measurement and knowledge on supply chain characteristics of a developing country, Thailand. The research also affects organisations by preparing decision makers to make strategic, tactical and operational level decisions with respect <b>to</b> supply <b>chain</b> <b>macro</b> processes. The results from the case studies also indicate the similarities and differences in their supply chain performance. Furthermore, the implications of the study are offered for both academic and practical use. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Survival of fittest & fastest is {{the mantra}} of today’s {{business}} game. To compete successfully {{in this business}} era, the retailer must focus on the customer’s buying experience. To manage a customer’s experience, retailers should understand what “customer experience” actually means. Customer Experience Management is a strategy that focuses the operations and processes of a business around {{the needs of the}} individual customer. It represents a strategy that results in a win–win value exchange between the retailer and its customers. The goal of customer experience management is to move customers from satisfied to loyal and then from loyal to advocate. This paper focuses on the role of macro factors in the retail environment and how they can shape customer experiences and behaviors. Several ways (e. g., Brand, Price, Promotion, Supply Chain Management, Location, Advertising, Packaging & labeling, Service Mix, and Atmosphere) to deliver a superior customer experience are identified which should result in higher customer satisfaction, more frequent shopping visits, larger wallet shares, and higher profits.

40|$|We {{implement}} a binary collision approximation to study pulse propagation {{in a chain}} of o-rings. In particular, we arrive at analytic results from which the pulse velocity is obtained by simple quadrature. The predicted pulse velocity is compared to the velocity obtained from the far more resource-intensive numerical integration of the equations of motion. We study chains without precompression, chains precompressed by a constant force at the chain ends (constant precompression), and chains precompressed by gravity (variable precompression). The application of the binary collision approximation <b>to</b> precompressed <b>chains</b> provides an important generalization of a successful theory that had {{up to this point}} only been implemented <b>to</b> <b>chains</b> without precompression, that is, <b>to</b> <b>chains</b> in a sonic vacuum...|$|R
