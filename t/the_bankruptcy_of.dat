Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E
50|$|The Andersen {{indictment}} {{also put}} {{a spotlight on}} its faulty audits of other companies, most notably Waste Management, Sunbeam, the Baptist Foundation of Arizona and WorldCom. <b>The</b> subsequent <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> WorldCom, which quickly surpassed Enron as <b>the</b> then biggest <b>bankruptcy</b> in history (and has since been passed by <b>the</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> <b>of</b> Lehman Brothers and WaMu in the 2008 financial crisis) led to a domino effect of accounting and corporate scandals.|$|R

She gave weak support to US President Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions. Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties.

5|$|The Mall was {{initially}} a huge success, but its popularity declined as new retail outlets in Little Rock drew customers away. Then {{the departure of}} its anchor stores, beginning with <b>the</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> Montgomery Ward in 2001, left {{more than half the}} building empty. Throughout the 1990s, the mall steadily declined as retailers and customers left. Due to the waning popularity and litigation involving the deterioration of the building, the mall was sold in 2007 to Strode Property Company, and the remaining few tenants were told to vacate. Demolition began for the primary structure in early 2008. Prior to this, associated buildings were razed beginning in December 2007, starting with the former Montgomery Ward auto center, as well as the former JCPenney auto center, which had been used several years as an automotive maintenance facility for the City of Little Rock.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 LeMond {{joined with}} his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan & Co. fund manager Jorge Jasson {{to invest in}} the {{exclusive}} Yellowstone Club, a Big Sky, Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra. Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16billion Cushman & Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6million for their one-percent shares. In 2007, LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39million; however, he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20million payment (after having already paid the group $18 million), followed by their divorce and <b>the</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> the Club in 2009.|$|E
5|$|London's fledgling {{city centre}} mall was first opened in 1960 as Wellington Square with 400,000 sq. ft. of leasable area with Eaton’s and Woolworths as anchors. From 1986-89, Campeau {{expanded}} Wellington Square into Galleria London with 1,000,000 sq. ft. of leasable area and 200 stores including The Bay and Eaton’s. However the early 1990s recession, following by <b>the</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> Eaton's in 1999 {{and then the}} departure of The Bay in 2000 resulted in only 20 stores left by 2001.
