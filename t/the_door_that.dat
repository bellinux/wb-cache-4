The article notes that the original sliding shutters are now absent, whereas the original nomination form from 1979 stated they were not installed.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E

25|$|Early on the day, Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley {{also spent}} some time working to {{successfully}} repair <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> gives the crew access to the LiOH canisters. Mission Specialist Magnus spent {{about an hour and}} a half in the morning taking microbial air samples on various locations in the space station. The collected samples will be returned for study and further analysis. Magnus also worked the Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS). Mission Specialist Walheim along with station crew member Mike Fossum continued work with spacewalking equipment in the Quest airlock. Some of them will be left on the station, and will be utilized during an upcoming Russian spacewalks on 3 August 2011. Hurley working with station crew member Ron Garan stored some of the cargo in Atlantis's middeck to be returned. Since no astronaut was riding in the mid-deck, on the way back, it was expected to be fully packed with 1564 pounds of cargo. Among cargo brought to the space station, 2281 pounds were also in the mid-deck.|$|E

500|$|Next, Alex meets Oscar at the {{apartment}} and they leave so that Oscar can deliver drugs to his friend Victor (Olly Alexander). On the way, Alex explains parts of The Tibetan Book of the Dead to Oscar: how {{the spirit of a}} dead person sometimes stays among the living until it begins to experience nightmares, after which it attempts to reincarnate. They arrive at a bar called The Void. Oscar enters alone and sits down with a distressed Victor, who mutters [...] "I'm sorry" [...] before they are swarmed by police officers. Oscar seals himself in a bathroom stall and attempts to flush his drugs. When the flush does not work, he yells through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> he has a gun and will shoot. In response, a police officer opens fire and hits Oscar, who falls to the floor.|$|E
500|$|Although OK Computers {{influence}} on rock musicians is widely acknowledged, several critics believe that its experimental inclination was not authentically embraced {{on a wide}} scale. Footman said the [...] "Radiohead Lite" [...] bands that followed were [...] "missing [...] sonic inventiveness, {{not to mention the}} lyrical substance." [...] David Cavanagh said that most of OK Computers purported mainstream influence more likely stemmed from the ballads on The Bends. According to Cavanagh, [...] "The populist albums of the post-OK Computer era—the Verve's Urban Hymns, Travis's Good Feeling, Stereophonics' Word Gets Around, Robbie Williams' Life thru a Lens—effectively closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> OK Computers boffin-esque inventiveness had opened." [...] John Harris believed that OK Computer was one of the [...] "fleeting signs that British rock music might [...] returning to its inventive traditions" [...] in the wake of Britpop's demise. While Harris concludes that British rock ultimately developed an [...] "altogether more conservative tendency", he said that with OK Computer and their subsequent material, Radiohead provided a [...] "clarion call" [...] to fill the void left by Britpop.|$|E

Jack's line, [...] "Heeeere's Johnny!", is taken from Ed McMahon's famous introduction to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and was improvised by Nicholson. Kubrick, who had lived in England for some time, was unaware of the significance of the line, and nearly used a different take. Carson later used the Nicholson clip to open his 1980 anniversary show on NBC.|$|E
2500|$|In Pasteur's day, and {{for many}} years after his death, the word [...] "virus" [...] was used to {{describe}} any cause of infectious disease.
