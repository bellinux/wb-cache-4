5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E

5|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of {{messenger}} RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding {{sites for}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{as well as}} for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mRNA.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} {{high-frequency}} NMDA receptor activation, {{there is an}} increase in <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> protein PSD-95 that increases synaptic capacity for AMPA receptors. This is what leads to a long-term increase in AMPA receptors and thus synaptic strength and plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{morphine}} can alter <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of genes.

25|$|The TGF-β {{superfamily}} activates {{members of}} the SMAD family, which function as transcription factors. Specifically, the type I receptor, activated by the type II receptor, phosphorylates R-SMADs that then bind to the co-SMAD, SMAD4. The R-SMAD/Co-SMAD forms a complex with importin and enters the nucleus, where they act as transcription factors and either up-regulate or down-regulate in <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target gene.|$|E
25|$|Although myth was {{traditionally}} {{transmitted through}} {{the oral tradition}} on a small scale, the film industry has enabled filmmakers to transmit myths to large audiences via film. In Jungian psychology myths are <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> culture or society’s goals, fears, ambitions and dreams. Film {{is an expression of}} the society in which it was produced and reflects the culture of its era and location.|$|E
25|$|The romantic idea of {{enlightenment}} as insight into a timeless, transcendent reality has been popularized especially by D.T. Suzuki. Further popularization {{was due to}} the writings of Heinrich Dumoulin. Dumoulin viewed metaphysics as <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transcendent truth, which according to him was expressed by Mahayana Buddhism, but not by the pragmatic analysis of the oldest Buddhism, which emphasizes anatta. This romantic vision is also recognizable in the works of Ken Wilber.|$|E

25|$|The Escherichia coli-derived Tet-R {{repressor}} {{can be used}} in {{line with}} a conventional reporter gene and can be controlled by tetracycline or doxicycline (Tet-R inhibitors). Thus the expression of Tet-R is controlled by the standard two-hybrid system but the Tet-R in turn controls (represses) <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previously mentioned reporter such as HIS3, through its Tet-R promoter. Tetracycline or its derivatives can then be used to regulate the sensitivity of a system utilising Tet-R.|$|E
25|$|Transgenic {{plants have}} been {{identified}} as promising expression systems for vaccine production. Complex plants such as tobacco, potato, tomato, and banana can have genes inserted that cause them to produce vaccines usable for humans. Bananas have been developed that produce a human vaccine against Hepatitis B. Another example is <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fusion protein in alfalfa transgenic plants for the selective directioning to antigen presenting cells, therefore increasing vaccine potency against Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV).|$|E

25|$|The {{second group}} of +TIPs {{includes}} proteins which can localize on kinetochores even in absence of MTs. In this group there are two proteins that have been widely studied: CLIP-170 and their associated proteins CLASPs (CLIP-associated proteins). CLIP-170 role at kinetochores is unknown, but <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dominant negative mutant produces a prometaphase delay, suggesting that it has {{an active role in}} chromosome alignment. CLASPs proteins are required for chromosome alignment and maintenance of a bipolar spindle in Drosophila, humans and yeast.|$|E

One of the main accusations of cultural assimilation relates to the state's historic suppression of the Kurdish language. Kurdish publications created throughout the 1960s and 1970s were shut down under various legal pretexts. Following the military coup of 1980, the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in government institutions.|$|E

25|$|By extension, {{standard}} chord notation {{allows for}} <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chord built upon an interval {{of a minor}} third and a neutral third; i.e. C–E–G. Whereas a half-diminished seventh chord is achieved by diminishing {{only one of the}} two intervals needed to transform a minor seventh chord into a diminished seventh chord, a half-diminished chord without a seventh is thus achieved by only diminishing the fifth note halfway between a minor chord and a diminished chord. It would thus be noted as C, or more explicitly Cno7 to avoid confusion with a half-diminished seventh chord.|$|E
25|$|All {{twelve of}} the {{experimental}} populations show an increase in cell size concurrent with a decline in maximum population density, and {{in many of the}} populations, a more rounded cell shape. This change was partly the result of a mutation that changed <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gene for a penicillin-binding protein, which allowed the mutant bacteria to outcompete ancestral bacteria under the conditions in the long-term evolution experiment. However, although this mutation increased fitness under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to osmotic stress and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures.|$|E

50|$|The {{splicing}} of mRNA can induce its {{translation and}} functionally diversify the repertoire of proteins it encodes. The Zeb2 mRNA, {{which has a}} particularly long 5’UTR, requires the retention <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 5’UTR intron that contains an internal ribosome entry site for efficient translation. However, retention of the intron is dependent on <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> antisense transcript that complements the intronic 5’ splice site. Therefore, <b>the</b> ectopic <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antisense transcript represses splicing and induces translation of the Zeb2 mRNA during mesenchymal development. Likewise, <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> overlapping antisense Rev-ErbAa2 transcript controls the alternative splicing of the thyroid hormone receptor ErbAa2 mRNA to form two antagonistic isoforms.|$|R
