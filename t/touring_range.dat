50|$|Cycle <b>touring</b> {{beyond the}} <b>range</b> {{of a day}} trip may need a bike capable of {{carrying}} heavy loads. Although many different bicycles can be used, specialist touring bikes are built to carry appropriate loads and to be ridden more comfortably over long distances.

5000|$|A sporty engine {{with twin}} {{constant}} velocity carburettors was added, {{for the new}} [...] "Touring" [...] range. The all two-door lineup consisted of the SS, SL, and the GS on top. Power was up to [...] at 9,000 rpm, and the top-of-the-line GS received a dogleg five-speed gearbox {{to take full advantage}} of the peakier engine. The Touring GS could reach a top speed of 120 km/h. On June 15 of the same year, the Life received a minor facelift with redesigned grilles, and in September four-door versions of the <b>Touring</b> <b>range</b> appeared. Production of the lower-powered [...] "Town" [...] engine also came to an end during 1972.|$|E
50|$|A Motor (UK) {{road test}} in May 1967 reported: It seems somehow insolent to apply medium price {{standards}} to a saloon {{that for a}} combination of speed, comfort and safety {{is as good as}} any in the world, regardless of cost. A North American perspective was provided by Road & Track, whose December 1967 report concluded: Jaguar's big seller in the U.S. remains the E-type sports cars, but the 420 sedan offers just as unique a combination of qualities in its own field. For a reasonable basic price of $5900, Jaguar offers brisk performance, outstanding braking, excellent handling and ride, quality finish, and luxury in abundance, all in an automobile that's easy to maneuver in today's maddening traffic. A road test by Wheels (Australia) in August 1967 enthused: While they can continue to build and sell cars as good as this, there is hope for the man who cares about his motoring. In terms of performance measured under test conditions, 0-60 mph in under 10 seconds and a top speed of more than 125 mi/h km/h were typical. Such performance figures were superior to those of many of the 4.2-litre XJ6 models that followed. Among the few exceptions the testers took was to its 15-16mpg average fuel consumption, which even for the late 1960s was rather high. Combined with the modest size of its two 7 Imperial gallon (31.75 litre) fuel tanks, such fuel consumption gave the model a <b>touring</b> <b>range</b> of only around 250 miles (403 km).|$|E
