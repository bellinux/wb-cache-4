40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>tip</b> pain {{following}} revision total knee arthroplasty is {{a significant}} cause of patient dissatisfaction, which {{in the presence of}} an aseptic well-fixed component has no widely accepted surgical solution. A definitive cause of <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> pain remains elusive, however {{it has been suggested that}} high stress concentrations within the region of the <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> may play a role. This paper reports a finite element study of a novel clinical technique where a plate is attached to the tibia within the region of the <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> to reduce <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> pain. The results demonstrate that the plate reduces stress concentrations in the bone at the <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> of the implant.

40|$|Abstract [...] The stem design, {{geometry}} and material change the mechanical behavior of bone around tibia tray and stem after TKA. In this study a shape optimization of a cemented tibia stem {{has been carried}} out to solve the stress shielding at the proximal tibia as well as the stress concentration at the <b>stem</b> <b>tip.</b> It is found that the optimal shape is a short stem with small diameter at the distal <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> increased gradually to reach a maximum value at the proximal tibia stem. This optimal shape is increased von Mises stress at the lateral and medial cancellous bone by 130 % and 140 %, respectively compared to initial stem shape. On the other hand the stress concentration in bone at <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> using the optimal stem shape is reduced by 25 % compared to initial shape. However, the optimal stem shape is reduced the stresses in cement at <b>stem</b> <b>tip</b> by 28 % laterally and 17 % medially compared to the initial stem shape. Finally, a bimaterial stem (titanium with a polymer <b>stem</b> <b>tip)</b> has been applied to the optimal shape to improve the stress concentration reduction at the <b>stem</b> <b>tip.</b> The results are approximately the same compared to the optimal titanium stem shape.

It spreads quickly, forming dense thickets that displace native plants and threaten riparian ecosystems.

50|$|Phototropism {{in plants}} such as Arabidopsis thaliana is {{directed}} by blue light receptors called phototropins. Other photosensitive receptors in plants include phytochromes that sense red light and cryptochromes that sense blue light. Different organs of the plant may exhibit different phototropic reactions to different wavelengths of light. <b>Stem</b> <b>tips</b> exhibit positive phototropic reactions to blue light, while root tips exhibit negative phototropic reactions to blue light. Both root <b>tips</b> and most <b>stem</b> <b>tips</b> exhibit positive phototropism to red light.Cryptochromes are photoreceptors that absorb blue/ UV-A light, and they help control the circadian rhythm in plants and timing of flowering. Phytochromes are photoreceptors that sense red/far-red light, but they also absorb blue light. The combination of responses from phytochromes and cryptochromes allow the plant to respond to various kinds of light. Together phytochromes and cryptochromes inhibit gravitropism in hypocotyls and contribute to phototropism.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the migration pattern of the Lubinus SP II prosthesis stem. Migration at the stem-cement and at the bone-cement interface was assessed.

40|$|Scanning {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (STEM) was successfully applied {{to the analysis of}} silicon nanowires (SiNWs) that were self-assembled during an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) process. The ICP-synthesized SiNWs were found to present a Si–SiO 2 core–shell structure and length varying from ≈ 100 nm to 2 – 3 μm. The shorter SiNWs (maximum length ≈ 300 nm) were generally found to possess a nanoparticle at their <b>tip.</b> <b>STEM</b> energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy combined with electron tomography performed on these nanostructures revealed that they contain iron, clearly demonstrating that the short ICP-synthesized SiNWs grew via an iron-catalyzed vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism within the plasma reactor. Both the STEM tomography and STEM-EDX analysis contributed to gain further insight into the self-assembly process. In the long-term, this approach might be used to optimize the synthesis of VLS-grown SiNWs via ICP as a competitive technique to the well-established bottom-up approaches used for the production of thin SiNWs...|$|R
