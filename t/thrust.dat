5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse <b>thrust</b> systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of <b>thrust</b> reverser. This type of <b>thrust</b> reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing the <b>thrust</b> of the engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse <b>thrust</b> after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse <b>thrust.</b> Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the <b>thrust</b> levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward <b>thrust,</b> enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Florida mice breed {{throughout}} the year with a peak between July and December, a lesser peak in January and February, and a lull or cessation in April and May. Unlike most murids, copulatory behavior lacks intravaginal thrusting, the intromission <b>thrust</b> is more intense than the dismount, there is no lock, and ejaculation occurs with every <b>thrust.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of a coronal ridge alone, however, is not sufficient for effective semen displacement. It must be combined with adequate <b>thrusting</b> to be successful. It {{has been shown that}} the deeper the <b>thrusting,</b> the larger the semen displacement. No semen displacement occurs with shallow <b>thrusting.</b> Some have therefore termed <b>thrusting</b> as a semen displacement behaviour.|$|R
50|$|Most {{groups in}} Europe and the UK {{do not allow}} <b>thrusting</b> even if the weapon has a <b>thrusting</b> tip, due to {{concerns}} on the safety of such weapons. However, <b>thrusting</b> tips are much more popular in the United States where practitioners ensure that any weapons that risk the core piercing through the <b>thrusting</b> tip and into a combatant are failed in safety checks held before every game.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a victim}} {{shows signs of}} severe airway obstruction, {{abdominal}} <b>thrusts</b> should be applied in rapid sequence until the obstruction is relieved. If this is not effective, chest <b>thrusts</b> {{can also be used}}. Chest <b>thrusts</b> can also be used in obese victims or victims in late pregnancy. Abdominal <b>thrusts</b> should not be used in infants under 1 year of age due to risk of causing injury.|$|R
5|$|Fourth, camber <b>thrust</b> {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber <b>thrust</b> {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is greater than that of the rear and so can generate more camber <b>thrust,</b> all else being equal.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine <b>thrust</b> reverser deployed in-flight for reasons {{that could not be}} determined. The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the <b>thrust</b> reverser on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled to the right and crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Oregon, Siletzia {{has been}} <b>thrust</b> against the Mesozoic Klamath Mountains of southern Oregon along the Klamath—Blue Mountain Lineament (KBML). Near Roseburg this contact is exposed at the Wild Safari Fault where the Late Jurassic Dothan Formation has been <b>thrust</b> over the Roseburg Formation.|$|E

50|$|The {{behaviours}} {{associated with}} semen displacement, namely <b>thrusting</b> (number of <b>thrusts</b> {{and depth of}} <b>thrusts),</b> and duration of sexual intercourse, {{have been shown to}} vary according to whether a male perceives the risk of partner infidelity to be high or not. Males and females report greater semen displacement behaviours following allegations of infidelity. In particular, following allegations of infidelity, males and females report deeper and quicker <b>thrusting</b> during sexual intercourse.|$|R

5|$|Relatively rare amongst fighter aircraft, the RB.199 is {{fitted with}} <b>thrust</b> reversers to {{decrease}} the distance required to safely land. To fully deploy the <b>thrust</b> reverser during landings, the yaw damper {{is connected to the}} steering of the nosewheel to provide greater stability.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type <b>thrust</b> reversers. This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a door that pivots down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse <b>thrust.</b>|$|E
5|$|The X-44 MANTA, or multi-axis, no-tail aircraft, was {{a planned}} {{experimental}} aircraft {{based on the}} F-22 with enhanced <b>thrust</b> vectoring controls and no aerodynamic surface backup. The aircraft was to be solely controlled by <b>thrust</b> vectoring, without featuring any rudders, ailerons, or elevators. Funding for this program was halted in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much <b>thrust</b> as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause <b>thrust</b> vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
50|$|A {{framework}} must {{be developed}} for identifying SIS opportunities. There will certainly be competitive response, so one should proceed with strategic <b>thrusts</b> based on information technology. These moves {{are just as important}} as other strategic <b>thrusts,</b> such as acquisition, geographical expansion, and so on. It is necessary to plan rationally about acquisition, major alliances with other firms, and other strategic <b>thrusts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most modern protocols, {{including}} those of the American Heart Association, American Red Cross and the European Resuscitation Council, recommend several stages for airway obstructions, designed to apply increasingly more pressure. Most protocols recommend encouraging the victim to cough, followed by hard back slaps, and finally abdominal <b>thrusts</b> or chest <b>thrusts</b> as a last resort. Some guidelines also recommend alternating between abdominal <b>thrusts</b> and back slaps.|$|R
40|$|The Heimlich {{manoeuvre}} is {{a well-known}} intervention {{for the management of}} choking due to foreign body airway occlusion, but the evidence base for guidance on this topic is limited and guidelines differ. We measured pressures during abdominal <b>thrusts</b> in healthy volunteers. The angle at which <b>thrusts</b> were performed (upthrust vs circumferential) did not affect intrathoracic pressure. Self-administered abdominal <b>thrusts</b> produced similar pressures to those performed by another person. Chair <b>thrusts,</b> where the subject pushed their upper abdomen against a chair back, produced higher pressures than other manoeuvres. Both approaches should be included in basic life support teaching...|$|R
5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure generated from the subduction. Compressive forces caused <b>thrust</b> faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. <b>Thrust</b> faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|Doctors who {{conducted}} post mortems on the bodies recovered recorded that most victims {{had died of}} burns. On day four Air India's flight safety officer informed the inquiry that the aircraft's <b>thrust</b> lever and <b>thrust</b> reverse levers were both in the forward position, possibly indicating that the pilot intended to go around. The inquiry panel stated that information from the FDR would be released at the next hearing of the Court of Inquiry in New Delhi on 3 September 2010, {{and that of the}} CVR soon after. The Court of Inquiry would submit its report on 30 September 2010.|$|E
5|$|East–west-directed {{compression}} from subduction off {{the west}} coast affected the area in later Mesozoic and early Tertiary time by folding and <b>thrust</b> faulting strata. Evidence for the Sevier Orogeny part of this period {{can be seen in}} the Taylor Creek area in the Kolob section of the park. Chunks of Moenave strata have been compressed to the point of thrusting themselves over the same formation in the Taylor Creek <b>Thrust</b> Fault Zone, located on the east flank of the Kanarra anticline.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Female mice {{were placed}} with males and {{subjected}} to three different treatments. One group experienced a low number of pre=req- ejaculatory <b>thrusts,</b> the ejaculatory reflex {{and the formation of}} a copu-latory plug. A second group experienced a variable number of pre=req- ejaculatory <b>thrusts,</b> the ejaculatory reflex and the formation of the copulatory plug which was immediately removed. The third group experienced a variable number of pre-ejaculatory <b>thrusts</b> only. The results indicated that a large number ofpre-ejaculatory <b>thrusts</b> is neither necessary, nor sufficient, for the induction of luteal activity in the female mouse. The ejaculatory reflex and the formation of the copulatory plug are sufficient to induce luteal activity regardless of the number of pre=req- ejaculatory <b>thrusts.</b> The results are compared with those of similar work on the rat...|$|R
50|$|Pelvic <b>thrusting</b> is {{observed}} in infant monkeys, apes, and humans. These observations led ethologist John Bowlby (1969) {{to suggest that}} infantile sexual behavior may be the rule in mammals, not the exception. <b>Thrusting</b> has been observed in humans at eight to 10 months of age and may be an expression of affection. Typically, the infant clings to the parent, then nuzzles, <b>thrusts,</b> and rotates the pelvis for several seconds.|$|R
50|$|If a {{children}} {{less than one}} and is unable to breathe at all then five back blows followed by five chest <b>thrusts</b> should be done. In children {{over the age of}} one abdominal <b>thrusts</b> are recommended.|$|R
5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped {{vectored}} <b>thrust</b> twin-Spey design {{as an alternative}} to the BS100. This alternative engine arrangement was widely seen as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric <b>thrust</b> output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the positions of the}} <b>thrust</b> levers, the report points to several factors that {{may have contributed to the}} accident, such as a high volume of rain on the day, with the formation of puddles on the runway, as well as the absence of grooving. The report does not blame the length of the runway for the accident. The BEA also cleared Airbus of any misdoing because they had proposed a system warning modification regarding the incorrect <b>thrust</b> lever positions which TAM had rejected.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward <b>Thrust</b> Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system in the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area, including a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue with a station between Cherry and James streets. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970. The failure of the Forward <b>Thrust</b> ballot measures {{led to the creation}} of Metro Transit in 1972, operating bus service across King County.|$|E
50|$|In some areas, such as Australia, {{authorities}} {{believe that}} there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of abdominal <b>thrusts</b> and their use is not recommended in first aid. Instead, chest <b>thrusts</b> are recommended.|$|R

50|$|A cursory {{examination}} of Bon Kuk Geom Beop reveals {{that of the}} 26 sword methods, 5 are <b>thrusting</b> methods and 15 are cutting or slashing methods. In like manner Military sword work introduced to the Korean Military during the Japanese Occupation (Toyama Ryu) is also heavily skewed in favor of cutting over <b>thrusting.</b> Lastly, techniques associated with Korean Geom Beop reveal a ratio of roughly 12 cutting techniques to 4 <b>thrusting</b> techniques.|$|R
