A lot of forecasting models have been developed in recent years {{but none of them}} could consistently outperform the others. In real-world applications, <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasting</b> accuracy can be affected by a lot of factors. Impacts of long-term changes to traffic patterns to short-term <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasting</b> are profound and this can easily make an existing forecasting system outdated. Therefore, it is very important for forecasting systems to detect long-term changes in traffic patterns and make updates accordingly.

30|$|A spatiotemporal {{approach}} that simultaneously utilises both {{spatial and temporal}} relationships is gaining scientific interest {{in the field of}} <b>traffic</b> flow <b>forecasting.</b> Accurate identification of the spatiotemporal structure (dependencies amongst traffic flows in space and time) plays a critical role in modern <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasting</b> methodologies, and recent developments of data-driven feature selection and extraction methods allow the identification of complex relationships. This paper systematically reviews studies that apply feature selection and extraction methods for spatiotemporal <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasting.</b> The reviewed bibliographic database includes 211 publications and covers the period from early 1984 to March 2018. A synthesis of bibliographic sources clarifies {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different feature selection and extraction methods for learning the spatiotemporal structure and discovers trends in their applications.

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} accuracy of demand forecasts using a sample of recently-completed projects in Minnesota and identifies the factors influencing the inaccuracy in <b>forecasts.</b> The <b>forecast</b> <b>traffic</b> {{data for this study}} is drawn from Environmental Impact Statements (EIS), Transportation Analysis Reports (TAR) and other forecast reports produced by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) with a horizon forecast year of 2010 or earlier. The actual traffic data is compiled from the database of traffic counts maintained by the Office of <b>Traffic</b> <b>Forecasting</b> and Analysis section at Mn/DOT. Based on recent research on forecast accuracy, the (in) accuracy of <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasts</b> is estimated as a ratio of the <b>forecast</b> <b>traffic</b> to the actual traffic. The estimation of forecast (in) accuracy also involves a comparison of the socioeconomic and demographic assumptions, the assumed networks to the actual in-place networks and other travel behavior assumptions that went into generating the <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasts</b> against actual conditions. The analysis indicates a general trend of underestimation in roadway <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasts</b> with factors such as highway type, functional classifications, direction playing an influencing role. Roadways with higher volumes and higher functional classifications such as freeways are subject to underestimation compared to lower volume roadways/functional classifications.

50|$|According to the airport, {{the average}} growth of air traffic in Munich from 1997 to 2006 was {{an average of}} 7% per year, and the airport's {{capacity}} was already exhausted. Since new airlines in Munich no longer received the desired slots, a traffic-spoiling effect occurred. An air <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast</b> of Intraplan Consult GmbH estimated 58.2 million passengers for 2025, provided the airport has a tight-fitting growth. In order to exploit the expected traffic potential in Munich, the operator plans to expand today's capacity from 90 movements per hour to 120 movements per hour by constructing a third runway. The shareholders of Flughafen München GmbH (FMG) stated that {{the construction of a}} third runway was necessary for the Munich region and for Bavaria as a whole, for reasons of transport and economic policy. Various associations and institutions from economics and politics reacted in favor of the plan approval decision issued by the government of Oberbayern {{for the construction of a}} third runway at Munich Airport.|$|E
50|$|Despite these drawbacks, Laker Airways {{took the}} aircraft. The airline {{concluded}} it could fly non-stop from the UK to any point {{east of the}} Rockies by keeping the baggage limit at 40 lb and reducing single-class seating from 380 to 345. The saving {{could be used to}} carry more fuel. The calculations had shown that even with reduced seating, it had to fill only 52% of the seats to break even. Moreover, Laker Airways had figured that the aircraft's low break-even seat factor would enable it to operate its proposed London - New York Skytrain with a lower break-even factor compared to the 707, an ageing narrowbodied aircraft whose costs were higher per passenger. The DC-10s also had huge potential to boost the projected profitability of Skytrain. Revised estimates anticipated an average load factor of 70-75% and raised the <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast</b> for the first year of operation to 250,000 passengers each way. This was almost three times the original 707-based forecast. These factors swung the firm in favour of McDonnell-Douglas's offer.|$|E
5000|$|In {{many parts}} of Europe, a hybrid {{empirical}} approach to traffic design is used, combining macro-, micro-, and mesoscopic features. Rather than simulating a steady state of flow for a journey, transient [...] "demand peaks" [...] of congestion are simulated. These are modeled by using small [...] "time slices" [...] across the network throughout the working day or weekend. Typically, the origins and destinations for trips are first estimated and a traffic model is generated before being calibrated by comparing the mathematical model with observed counts of actual traffic flows, classified by type of vehicle. [...] "Matrix estimation" [...] is then applied to the model to achieve a better match to observed link counts before any changes, and the revised model is used to generate a more realistic <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast</b> for any proposed scheme. The model would be run several times (including a current baseline, an [...] "average day" [...] forecast based {{on a range of}} economic parameters and supported by sensitivity analysis) {{in order to understand the}} implications of temporary blockages or incidents around the network.

50|$|In early 1993, it was {{expected}} that about 150 passenger and about 100 freight trains would run each day. The <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast</b> for Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1992 foresaw that there would be 56 distance passenger and 95 freight trains per day in each direction on the new line in 2010. In mid-1994, Deutsche Bahn expected that 48 long-distance passenger and 60 freight trains would use the line per day. The separation of fast and slow traffic (under a program called Netz 21) had not yet been adopted. In the mid-1990s, 24 IC/ICE trains per day were expected to use the new line in each direction between Berlin, Leipzig and Erfurt in 2000 (16 of which continuing from/to Nuremberg) and 16 IC/ICE trains per day and direction on the Frankfurt-Erfurt-Leipzig-Dresden route. On the existing route, three InterRegio lines would be offered with a total of 21 trains per day in each direction. Traffic forecasts made in 1994, for 2000, projected 40 or 43 freight trains from the Leipzig/Halle direction. Other traffic forecasts from around 1995, expected 289 trains per day between Erfurt and Planena junction (the sum of passenger and freight trains in both directions). Of these 141 would run to and from Halle and 148 would run to and from Leipzig. Traffic on the existing network would remain about the same.|$|E
5000|$|The {{board of}} Deutsche Bundesbahn {{selected}} the first {{option for the}} high-speed line on 8 March 1991. The selection of the current location meant a comparatively small expenditure {{at the cost of}} a missing link to the transport network and a secluded position; it also necessitated the construction of the 2.4 km Limburg tunnel through a water protection zone. The station would be built at a green-field location about 2.5 km southeast of the city centre and close to the A 3. The <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast</b> assumed that 90 percent of rail passengers would use cars to reach or leave the station, connecting with ICEs. Prior to a decision of the Rhine route in the Federal Cabinet, the then premier of Rhineland-Palatinate, Carl-Ludwig Wagner 1989 called for a so-called option S in an interview in July. This envisaged a right bank route taking a sharp curve from Dernbach through a tunnel and a bridge over the Rhine to Koblenz before taking another a sharp curve back over another Rhine crossing to a purely right bank route to Frankfurt. The estimated additional costs of this option were DM 1.3 to 2.8 billion (about €0.7 to 1.4 billion). The Federal Transport Minister, Friedrich Zimmermann spoke of a [...] "provincial farce" [...] and suggested, as a compromise, the establishment of a high-speed station in Limburg to provide a connection with Koblenz. In addition to the establishment of the station, the compromise proposal provided for a package of other railway infrastructure in Rhineland-Palatinate. The then Deutsche Bundesbahn initially accepted the route via Limburg and Vilich in order to prevent further delays to the project.|$|E
