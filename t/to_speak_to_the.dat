5|$|Rahman was {{assisted}} by captain Mashrafe Mortaza {{to talk on}} post-match interview twice, and on a press conference once. Normally, he struggles <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media and public.|$|E
5|$|Chinese PEN Center {{director}} Bei Ling alerted Apple Daily to Lee Bo's disappearance, and {{the journal}} reported on 1 January 2016 that Lee {{had become the}} fifth member of Causeway Bay Books to disappear. His wife was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press at the time, but filed a missing person's report with the Hong Kong police the following day.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2013, Schwyzer invited adult film actor James Deen {{to return}} to his alma mater, Pasadena City College, <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> {{students}} about his career. The appearance, initially open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public, was restricted by college administrators due to [...] "public safety concerns" [...] over [...] "protesters". Deen was restricted <b>to</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> students of Pasadena City College's “Navigating Pornography” class.|$|R

50|$|External CCTV is {{displayed}} automatically on releasing the doors via an in-cab monitor, removing {{the need for}} Driver-Only Operation (DOO) equipment such as monitors/mirrors at platforms. This {{is similar to that}} already used on Southern's Electrostar units. If a passenger operates an emergency alarm, the internal CCTV {{is displayed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> driver on the in-cab monitor, so that they can view the affected area of <b>the</b> train (in addition <b>to</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> person).|$|R
5|$|In October 2004 France 2 allowed three French {{journalists to}} view the raw footage—Denis Jeambar, {{editor-in-chief}} of L'Express; , former France 2 correspondent and head of news documentaries at Arte, a state-run television network; and , former editor-in-chief of Le Monde. They also asked <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 apparently told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|The Ultimate Warrior's first WrestleMania {{appearance}} since WrestleMania XII, headlining {{the unveiling}} of the 2014 Hall of Famers, would be his last. On April 8, the day after making his last public appearance on Raw <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fans, Warrior suddenly collapsed and died at age 54 in Arizona. WWE paid tribute to Warrior on the April 14 episode of Raw.|$|E
5|$|Çakır was scrutinised by the British {{media in}} 2013 {{when he sent}} off Manchester United's Nani in a Champions League quarter-final and the English team went on to lose to Real Madrid. Manager Alex Ferguson was so enraged by the {{decision}} that he refused <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media after the game. UEFA confirmed that no action would be taken against the referee, concluding that he made the correct judgement.|$|E

60|$|A {{hundred times}} Miss Grandison tried <b>to</b> reply, <b>to</b> <b>speak,</b> <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> commonest observation, {{but it was}} in vain. She grew paler every moment; her lips moved, but they sent forth no sound.|$|R
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had {{met before}} the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs {{to be higher than}} 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Having {{resigned}} the Bishopric of Chiapas, Las Casas {{spent the}} rest of his life working closely with the imperial court in matters relating to the Indies. In 1551 he rented a cell at the College of San Gregorio, where he lived with his assistant and friend Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada. He continued working as a kind of procurator for the natives of the Indies, many of whom directed petitions to him <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emperor on their behalf. Sometimes indigenous nobility even related their cases to him in Spain, for example, the Nahua noble Francisco Tenamaztle from Nochistlán. His influence at court was so great that some even considered that he had the final word in choosing the members of the Council of the Indies.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Travers led the {{way through}} <b>the</b> drawing-room <b>to</b> <b>the</b> garden, but when all her guests, except Fan, who came last, had passed out, she came back <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> alone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> girl.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, President Bartlet {{tries to}} persuade Ellie <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> press {{to contain the}} incidence, but Ellie insists she is not as {{comfortable}} with the spotlight as {{the other members of}} the family. She later watches her mother do a light-hearted appearance on Sesame Street, to defend her right to practice medicine even after voluntarily giving up her licence. This inspires her to follow her father's advice, and give a passionate public statement about the necessity of a politically independent scientific community.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August boats from Alceste put {{the party}} ashore at Ostia, near Rome, where they {{made contact with}} a {{representative}} of the Vatican who agreed <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pope but failed to return. When it was deemed necessary to travel to Rome to re-establish contact, the priests refused to go. Maxwell sent them back to Palermo in Acorn, which returned a week later with another volunteer of Drummond's. Landed on the night of 19 September, the envoy was captured and shot as a spy the following day. Consequently, the entire plan was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 1944, {{leaders of}} the Blocco del popolo (Popular Front) in Sicily, the {{communist}} Girolamo Li Causi and Pantaleone, went <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landless labourers {{at a rally in}} Villalba, challenging Don Calò in his own personal fiefdom. In the morning tensions rose when Christian Democrat mayor Beniamino Farina – a relative of Vizzini as well as his successor as mayor – angered local communists by ordering all hammer-and-sickle signs erased from buildings along the road on which Li Causi would travel into town. When his supporters protested, they were intimidated by separatists and thugs.|$|E

60|$|Coming out of {{the theatre}} one first night, we met her in the lobby. I was {{following}} Cyril at some little distance, but as he stopped <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> her <b>the</b> movement of the crowd placed me just behind them.|$|R
5|$|The {{gameplay}} comprises first-person {{exploration of}} dungeons and battles against demons; the player can also choose <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demons, {{and attempt to}} recruit them to their party. By fusing multiple allied demons together, the player can create more powerful demons. The story is set decades after the first Shin Megami Tensei, in the encapsulated city Tokyo Millennium, which is ruled by the religious Messians from a unit called the Center. The player takes {{the role of a}} gladiator who is told that he is the Messiah, and is sent on missions around Tokyo Millennium to eradicate demons and prepare for the Thousand-Year Kingdom. The plot is influenced by choices the player makes throughout the game, determining their moral alignment.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing as}} Aiden, the game becomes monochromatic. Amongst the shades of greys, {{interactive}} objects are highlighted by an aura shining {{in one of}} several colours, with the colour of the aura indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue objects (or characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow the dead <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> living through her, grant her an ability to see events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. He plays with their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the corridors, and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS in the secondary control room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she will not be able <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Doctor again but will be there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after this, a {{representative}} delegation of barons, clergy and knights {{was sent to}} Kenilworth <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King. On 20 January 1327, Henry of Lancaster and the bishops of Winchester and Lincoln met privately with Edward in the castle. They informed Edward {{that if he were}} to resign as monarch, his son Prince Edward would succeed him, but if he failed to do so, his son might be disinherited as well, and the crown given to an alternative candidate. In tears, Edward agreed to abdicate, and on 21 January, Sir William Trussell, representing the kingdom as a whole, withdrew his homage and formally ended Edward's reign. A proclamation was sent to London, announcing that Edward, now known just as Edward of Caernarvon, had freely resigned his kingdom and that Prince Edward would succeed him. The coronation took place at Westminster Abbey on 2 February 1327.|$|E
5|$|The Adelaide leak was {{the revelation}} {{to the press}} of a dressing-room {{incident}} during the third Test, a cricket match played during the 1932–33 Ashes series between Australia and England, more {{commonly known as the}} Bodyline series. During the course of play on 14 January 1933, the Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart by a ball delivered by Harold Larwood. Although not badly hurt, Woodfull was shaken and dismissed shortly afterwards. On his return to the Australian dressing room, Woodfull was visited by the managers of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet. Warner enquired after Woodfull's health, but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion. He said he did not want <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Englishman owing to the Bodyline tactics England were using, leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken. The matter became public knowledge when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January. Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at the time, and the players were horrified that the confrontation became public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Troika {{wanted to}} make a 3D game, but was {{uncertain}} whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first- or third-person. At that time, the Source game engine was being built by Valve Corporation. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached Troika about using the engine, {{and it was the first}} external team to use it. Troika chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since it wanted players <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with Bloodlines and Valve's own Half-Life 2, Troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, and with only a single source for technical support. Troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for the nighttime setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later artificial intelligence (AI) coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.|$|E
