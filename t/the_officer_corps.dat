5|$|For {{the coup}} to be successful, the {{military}} committee needed {{to gain the}} support {{of some of the}} Syrian officer corps. The collapse of the UAR, coupled with mutinies, purges and transfers left <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> in complete disarray and open to anti-government agitation. At the time, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> was split into five different factions; the Damascus faction which supported the ancien régime, supporters of Akram al-Hawrani, a Nasserist faction, a Ba'athist faction and a group of independents. The Damascus faction was the enemy of the military committee because of their support for Nazim al-Kudsi's regime and the Hawranist were considered as rivals because of their stance against pan-Arabism. The Nasserists became allies of the Ba'ath, even while they supported Gamal Abdel Nasser and the reestablishment of the UAR.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} {{shifts in the}} social make-up of <b>the</b> Bavarian <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> during <b>the</b> German confederation {{and the development of}} <b>the</b> role <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> played in Bavarian society.

It analyses the social prestige, the inner coherence and the social self-concept of <b>the</b> Bavarian <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> and detects continuities and changes in these sectors as well as their reciprocal relations over the period of examination of five decades. The analysis clearly shows that the development of <b>the</b> Bavarian <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> had different characteristics than that of the Prussian. <b>The</b> Bavarian <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> emerges as a socially inhomogeneous military elite lacking the Prussian social exclusiveness. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> stayed in constant touch with the milieu of their family background.

Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP, at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel. The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was an extremist party, prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify. On 25 September 1930, Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections, which won him many supporters in <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sarraj and Bizri wielded {{substantial}} {{influence in}} Syrian politics, checking {{the power of}} the political factions and purging Nasser's opponents from <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b> This was a source of concern for Quwatli, but he kept both men in their posts, partially due to pressure from Nasser. Quwatli further solidified his ties with the latter by appointing Akram al-Hawrani, the prominent Arab socialist leader, as speaker of parliament, and Salah al-Din Bitar, the co-founder of the pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party, as foreign affairs minister.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, Werner {{became an}} officer in the German Reichsflotte (Imperial Fleet), which had been {{organized}} the year before. In 1852, he transferred to the Preussische Marine (Prussian Navy), at the age of 22. The Preussische Marine accepted only ten applicants to <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> that year. Werner was the only officer in the first group who was directly commissioned as a lieutenant; the other nine became officer cadets. He was promoted to the rank of kapitänleutnant (captain lieutenant) in 1856. While commanding the warship Elbe, he participated in a naval expedition to the Far East in 1859–1862.|$|E

5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration.

5|$|The Polish Second Army {{consisted}} of five infantry divisions: (5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks. Many {{of them were}} new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories. The quality of <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> has also been questioned. One of the major problems facing the People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers. Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> formed part of {{the social}} elite in Canada, and {{considered}} themselves to be much closer to the prestigious, regular military than to their equivalents in the local police forces. Commissioned officers were expected to join and participate in an officers' mess, which the police based on the corresponding military tradition. Many were members of the Freemasons, a popular movement among Protestant Canadians. The officers were made Justices of Peace, giving them powers to try civilian cases, and they also had authority to summarily try members of the force itself, potentially imprisoning constables for up a year for even minor offences.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Castillo Armas {{had begun}} to intensify his aerial attacks, with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited {{material}} success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant psychological impact. On 25 June, {{the same day that}} he received the army's ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating the Guatemalan garrison at Chiquimula. Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated that {{if it were not for}} U.S. support for the rebellion, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps</b> of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views.

5|$|In 1899, {{with the}} {{outbreak}} of the South African War, the British Army was committed to its first large-scale overseas deployment since the 1850s. The intervening period had seen extensive redevelopments of the Regular Army. The Cardwell Reforms of 18681872 had abolished the purchase of commissions, professionalising <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps,</b> and reformed the system of enlistment so that recruits now served for six years with the colours and then a further six years liable for reserve service. The new reserve system had been tested in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War (when reservists fought overseas for the first time) and during the Pendjeh Crisis, when the reserves of one cavalry regiment and fifteen infantry regiments, totalling 4,681 men, were mobilised.|$|E
5|$|In five hours, Frederick lost 9,400 of the 30,000 men {{he brought}} into the battle, more than 30 percent of his army, {{including}} five generals, 101 guns, and nearly all the tents.

On the positive side, Retzow's corps of about 6,000 men, which had not arrived in time to participate in the fighting, remained intact; Frederick had pulled his troops together for an orderly retreat; and the King retained the confidence of his soldiers.|$|E

5|$|The ADO {{is seeking}} to expand the number of Indigenous Australians it {{recruits}} and improve their retention rate. Restrictions on Indigenous Australians' ability to enlist in the military existed until the 1970s, though hundreds of Indigenous men and women had joined the military when restrictions were reduced during the world wars. By 1992 the representation of Indigenous Australians in the ADF was equivalent to their proportion of the Australian population, though {{they continue to be}} under-represented among <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b> Two of the Army's three Regional Force Surveillance Units (NORFORCE and the 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment) are manned mostly by Indigenous Australian reservists.

5|$|At {{independence}} on 30 June 1960, {{the army}} {{suffered from a}} dramatic deficit of trained leaders, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b> This was because the Force Publique had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government {{made no effort to}} train Congolese commissioned officers until {{the very end of the}} colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school. The highest rank available to Congolese was adjutant, which only four soldiers achieved before independence. Though 14 Congolese cadets were enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963. Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the Congo Crisis. Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, the Force Publique commander, wrote during a meeting of soldiers that 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring cold water on the soldiers' desires for an immediate raise in their status.|$|E
5|$|By June President Habyarimana {{had come}} to view Hutu Power, rather than the {{mainstream}} opposition, as {{the biggest threat to}} his leadership. This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion. According to Prunier, this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF, than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process. The RPF enjoyed much greater leverage following their successful February campaign, and the government eventually agreed to their power-sharing demands. The RPF were allocated up to 40% of the troops in the proposed unified national armed forces, and 50% of <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>corps.</b> With all details agreed, the Arusha Accords were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.|$|E
