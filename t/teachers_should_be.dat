25|$|To {{cope with}} the {{shortage}} of qualified teachers, the State Education Commission decreed in 1985 that senior-middle-school <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> graduates with two years' training in professional institutes and that primary-school <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> graduates of secondary schools. To improve teacher quality, the commission established full-time and part-time (the latter preferred because it was less costly) in-service training programs. Primary-school and preschool in-service teacher training programs devoted 84 {{percent of the time}} to subject teaching, 6 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 10 percent to teaching methods. In-service training for primary-school teachers was designed to raise them to a level of approximately two years' postsecondary study, with the goal of qualifying most primary-school teachers by 1990. Secondary-school in-service teacher training was based on a unified model, tailored to meet local conditions, and offered on a spare-time basis. Ninety-five percent of its curricula was devoted to subject teaching, 2 to 3 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 2 to 3 percent to teaching methods. There was no similar large-scale in-service effort for technical and vocational teachers, most of whom worked for enterprises and local authorities.|$|E

He was schooled by a governess {{until the age of}} eleven, when he began at Fir Lodge Preparatory School in West Hill, Dulwich, in southeast London. At the age of thirteen, he entered Dulwich College. The young Shackleton did not particularly distinguish himself as a scholar, and was said to be [...] "bored" [...] by his studies. He was quoted later as saying: [...] "I never learned much geography at school... Literature, too, consisted in the dissection, the parsing, the analysing of certain passages from our great poets and prose-writers... <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> very careful not to spoil [...] taste for poetry for all time by making it a task and an imposition." [...] In his final term at the school he was still able to achieve fifth place in his class of thirty-one.|$|E

2500|$|A {{rudimentary}} form of {{the teach}} the controversy strategy had emerged first among creationists following the Supreme Court's Edwards v. Aguillard decision. The Institute for Creation Research (ICR) prepared an evaluation of what the movement should try next, suggesting [...] "school boards and <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> strongly encouraged at least to stress the scientific evidences and arguments against evolution in their classes [...] [...] [...] even if they don't wish to recognize these as evidences and arguments for creationism."

The law neither required the teaching of evolution or creation science, but the instruction of both if the other were taught. Guste, regardless of his personal views on the matter, as attorney general was compelled to defend the Louisiana law. He argued that <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to present evidence favoring creation because the Supreme Court recognizes that teachers [...] "already possess" [...] the [...] "flexibility to teach all [...] the scientific evidence about the origins of life." [...] Guste noted that the monitoring of state textbooks and science curricula would continue under the creation-science law.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{argued that}} students in public schools {{do not have a}} right to free speech and that Tinker should be overturned. Thomas wrote, [...] "In my view, the history of public education suggests that the First Amendment, as originally understood, does not protect student speech in public schools." [...] He praised Hugo Black's dissenting opinion on Tinker and called it [...] "prophetic". Thomas cited the doctrine of in loco parentis, meaning [...] "in place of the parent", in his opinion. He traced the history of public education in America back to its colonial roots. According to Thomas, because originally public schools were intended to substitute for private tutors, public schools could discipline students as they liked and had a far stronger hand in what happened in the classroom. [...] "In short", he continues, [...] "in the earliest public schools, teachers taught, and students listened. Teachers commanded, and students obeyed." [...] He opined that because parents entrusted the care of their children to teachers, teachers have a right to act in the place of parents during school hours. Therefore, <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to discipline students if necessary. Thomas lambasted Tinker for [...] "usurping [...] traditional authority for the judiciary". Thomas believed that Frederick was neither speaking gibberish nor openly advocating drug use, but granting such an impertinence constitutional protection [...] "would...be to 'surrender control of the American public school system to public school students.'" ...|$|E

The whole aim of the <b>teachers</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> to produce work which could be demonstrably shown to be good and useful, and worthy of being bought, or used in any way; and after that the whole question of patronage and interest should be settled. The school should teach its art-grammar thoroughly in everything, and in every material, and should teach it carefully; and that could be done if a perfect system were adopted, and above all, if a few thoroughly good examples were put before the students. That is a point which I think of very great importance. I think it very desirable that grants should be made by the Government to obtain for the pupils of the Academy beautiful examples of every kind, the very loveliest and best; not too many; and that their minds should not be confused by having placed before them examples of all schools and times; they are confused enough by what they see in the shops, and in the annual exhibitions. Let engraving be taught by Marc Antonio and Albert Dürer,--painting by Giorgione, Paul Veronese, Titian and Velasquez,--and sculpture by good Greek and selected Roman examples, and let there be no question of other schools or their merits. Let those things be shown as good and right, and let the student be trained in those principles:--if afterwards he strikes out an original path, let him; but do not let him torment himself and other people with his originalities, till he knows what is right, so far as is known at present.|$|E
