50|$|Microfibers in {{textiles}} {{refer to}} sub-denier fiber (such as polyester drawn to 0.5 denier). Denier and Dtex are two measurements of fiber yield based on weight and length. If the fiber density is known, {{you also have}} a fiber diameter, otherwise it is simpler to measure diameters in micrometers. Microfibers in technical fibers refer to ultra fine fibers (glass or meltblown thermoplastics) often used in filtration. Newer fiber designs include extruding fiber that splits into multiple finer fibers. Most synthetic fibers are round in cross-section, but special designs can be hollow, oval, star-shaped or <b>trilobal.</b> The latter design provides more optically reflective properties. Synthetic textile fibers are often crimped to provide bulk in a woven, non woven or knitted structure. Fiber surfaces can also be dull or bright. Dull surfaces reflect more light while bright tends to transmit light and make the fiber more transparent.|$|E

40|$|Several {{applications}} in tissue engineering require transplantation of cells embedded in appropriate biomaterial scaffolds. Such structures may consist of 3 D non-woven fibrous materials whereas {{little is known}} about the impact of mesh size, pore architecture and fibre morphology on cellular behavior. In this study, we have developed polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) non-woven scaffolds with round, <b>trilobal,</b> or snowflake fibre cross section and different fibre crimp patterns (10, 16, or 28 needles per inch). Human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from adipose tissue were seeded in parallel on these scaffolds and their growth was compared. Initial cell adhesion during the seeding procedure was higher on non-wovens with round fibres than on those with snowflake or <b>trilobal</b> cross sections. All PVDF non-woven fabrics facilitated cell growth over a time course of 15 days. Interestingly, proliferation was significantly higher on non-wovens with round or <b>trilobal</b> fibres as compared to those with snowflake profile. Furthermore, proliferation increased in a wider, less dense network. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the MSCs aligned along the fibres and formed cellular layers spanning over the pores. 3 D PVDF non-woven scaffolds support growth of MSCs, however fibre morphology and mesh size are relevant...|$|E
40|$|Interest has {{surrounded}} {{the use of}} adsorbent hollow fibres (HF) {{as an alternative to}} existing adsorption technology, such as packed beds, because of their comparatively low pressure drop and efficient sorption cycles. The aim of this research was to improve the understanding of the transport phenomena within adsorbent HF, in order to optimise their design for VOC abatement based on breakthrough performance. Computational models of HF’s with circular, <b>trilobal</b> and clover shaped bores were developed, with a single and multichannel design based on a circular bore and n-butane was used as the model VOC. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were applied to resolve the conservation equations involving continuity, momentum and species transport. Convective and diffusive transport were assumed within the fibre bore whereas in the porous media transfer occurred by diffusion and adsorption, modelled using the Langmuir isotherm. The dimensions of HF’s and operating conditions were obtained from experimental work in our group. The pressure drop in the HF’s were found to be significantly lower than in packed bed. In terms of breakthrough and equilibrium times, the order of performance is smaller multichannel fibres > circular > clover > <b>trilobal.</b> Parametric studies showed that the most significant impact on breakthrough and equilibrium times results from varying the effective diffusivity of gas in the porous media, the Reynolds number in the bore and the Langmuir constant. Further considerations are required for financial weight, structural integrity and regeneration in order to confirm usage in industrial applications...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to further advance the state of the art in {{developing}} self-sufficient methods to predict the performance of an aerosol filter. The simulation methods developed in this study are based on first principles and consequently, they do not rely on empirical correction factors. These simulation methods can be used to predict the instantaneous collection efficiency and pressure drop of a filter under dust-loading conditions. In the current study, 3 -D micro- and macroscale CFD models are developed to simulate the service life of flat-sheet and pleated filters. These CFD micro- and macroscale models are also used to quantify the effects of a fiber’s cross-sectional shape on the performance of the resulting filter. As fiber manufacturing methods are rapidly advancing, these fibers are becoming more accessible. The filtration performance of <b>trilobal</b> fibers is compared with their circular counterparts under dust-loading conditions. Our results show that <b>trilobal</b> fibers do not outperform circular ones except in very limited conditions, revealing no advantage over circular fibers. In addition, a fast but approximate 2 -D model is developed to predict the filtration performance of flat and circular pleated filters. The predictions of the model are compared with predictions from the more sophisticated CFD models, as well as with experimental work in the literature. Our 2 -D model developed in this study is aimed at providing the aerosol filtration industry with a fast but fairly accurate method of designing pleated filters. With a CPU-time of practically zero, the developed model allows one to conduct a broad parameter study, altering the parameters that affect the filtration performance of pleated filters. Using this model, predictive correlations for dust-loaded pleated filters are presented. These correlations allow one to estimate the instantaneous pressure drop and collection efficiency of pleated filters effectively...|$|E
40|$|Texture is the {{perceived}} surface quality of fabrics, physiologically detected by sight or touch. Tactile textures {{refer to the}} immediate tangible feel of a surface, whereas visual textures refer to the visual impression that textures produce to human observer, which are related to local spatial variations of simple stimuli like colour, orientation and intensity in an image. In this paper {{attention is focused on}} defining the visual texture of pantyhose, in particular macro roughness and luster, and their interdependence with yarn count and composition. A set of samples in single jersey knit with yarn count ranging between 5 dtex and 78 dtex were produced. The sample included fabrics made of pure nylon, as well as blends with elastane, <b>trilobal</b> filaments and microfiber. A panel of 40 evaluators visually rated the luster and roughness of each sample. Each property was rated on a five point polar opposites scale. Luster of fabrics was examined by the opposites of lustrous/dull, whereas macro roughness was described as smooth/rough and even/uneven. A viewing cabinet with a white light source set under a 15 o angle with black background was used to standardize the evaluation. A knee-height leg model composed of vinyl chloride was used as the sample subject, with color values of L* = 59. 5, a* = 22. 4 and b* = 23. 9. A realistic leg model was chosen in order to provide a visual simulation closest to actual wearing conditions. Considerable differences in both the perception of luster and roughness were found. The perception of luster depended on the fibre content of the knits. For instance, the addition of microfiber renders the pantyhose with a matte surface, while the addition of <b>trilobal</b> filaments increases luster. Coarser yarns contribute to a smoother and more even surface texture. A Pearson’s correlation coefficient of - 0. 88 and - 0. 99 signifies a high correlation between yarn count and smoothness and evenness, accordingly. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractESCRT-I, -II, and -III protein {{complexes}} are sequentially {{recruited to}} endosomal membranes, where they orchestrate protein sorting and MVB biogenesis. In addition, {{they play a}} critical role in retrovirus budding. Structural understanding of ESCRT interaction networks is largely lacking. The 3. 6 Å structure of the yeast ESCRT-II core presented here reveals a <b>trilobal</b> complex containing two copies of Vps 25, one copy of Vps 22, and the C-terminal region of Vps 36. Unexpectedly, the entire ESCRT-II core consists of eight repeats of a common building block, a “winged helix” domain. Two PPXY-motifs from Vps 25 are involved in contacts with Vps 22 and Vps 36, and their mutation leads to ESCRT-II disruption. We show that purified ESCRT-II binds directly to the Vps 20 component of ESCRT-III. Surprisingly, this binding does not require the protruding N-terminal coiled-coil of Vps 22. Vps 25 is the chief subunit responsible for Vps 20 recruitment. This interaction dramatically increases binding of both components to lipid vesicles in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Human calumenin (hCALU) is a six EF-hand protein {{belonging}} to the CREC family. As {{other members of the}} family, it is localized in the secretory pathway and regulates the activity of SERCA 2 a and of the ryanodine receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have studied the effects of Ca 2 + binding to the protein and found it to attain a more compact structure upon ion binding. Circular Dichroism (CD) measurements suggest a major rearrangement of the protein secondary structure, which reversibly switches from disordered at low Ca 2 + concentrations to predominantly alpha-helical when Ca 2 + is added. SAXS experiments confirm the transition from an unfolded to a compact structure, which matches the structural prediction of a <b>trilobal</b> fold. Overall our experiments suggest that calumenin is a Ca 2 + sensor, which folds into a compact structure, capable of interacting with its molecular partners, when Ca 2 + concentration within the ER reaches the millimolar range...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to elucidate the differences in morphology, physical properties, chemical composition, and reactivity between facial hair and scalp hair, utilizing light and electron microscopy, tensile measurements, amino acid analyses, and reaction rates. The effect of ethnic background on fiber structure and geometry was also investigated. The beard and scalp hairs of all three ethnic groups (Caucasian, Chinese, and Negro) differed significantly in fiber morphology. Scalp fibers had smaller cross-sectional areas and were more rounded than beard fibers, which exhibited asymmetrical, oblong, and <b>trilobal</b> shapes. There were more cuticle layers, less ordered scale patterns, and more extensive medullation in beard hair than in scalp hair of the same subject. In addition, some ethnic differences were observed in fiber size, geometry, and pigmentation i both facial and scalp hair. The principal difference in chemical composition was the lower disulfide content of beard hair. In addition, beard hair was richer in aspartic acid, lysine, and tyrosine and poorer in valine and serine. The higher disulfide content of scalp hair was reflected in greater esistance to solubilization by urea-bisulfite, slower swelling rate in formic acid, and less supercontraction r permanent set in bisulfite solutions than beard hair under identical conditions...|$|E
40|$|Grafting of {{antioxidants}} {{and other}} modifiers onto polymers by reactive extrusion, has been performed successfully by the Polymer Processing and Performance Group at Aston University. Traditionally the optimum {{conditions for the}} grafting process have been established within a Brabender internal mixer. Transfer of this batch process to a continuous processor, such as an extruder, has, typically, been empirical. To have more confidence {{in the success of}} direct transfer of the process requires knowledge of, and comparison between, residence times, mixing intensities, shear rates and flow regimes in the internal mixer and in the continuous processor. The continuous processor chosen for the current work in the closely intermeshing, co-rotating twin-screw extruder (CICo-TSE). CICo-TSEs contain screw elements that convey material with a self-wiping action and are widely used for polymer compounding and blending. Of the different mixing modules contained within the CICo-TSE, the <b>trilobal</b> elements, which impose intensive mixing, and the mixing discs, which impose extensive mixing, are of importance when establishing the intensity of mixing. In this thesis, the flow patterns within the various regions of the single-flighted conveying screw elements and within both the <b>trilobal</b> element and mixing disc zones of a Betol BTS 40 CICo-TSE, have been modelled using the computational fluid dynamics package Polyflow. A major obstacle encountered when solving the flow problem within all of these sets of elements, arises from both the complex geometry and the time-dependent flow boundaries as the elements rotate about their fixed axes. Simulation of the time dependent boundaries was overcome by selecting a number of sequential 2 D and 3 D geometries, used to represent partial mixing cycles. The flow fields were simulated using the ideal rheological properties of polypropylene and characterised in terms of velocity vectors, shear stresses generated and a parameter known as the mixing efficiency. The majority of the large 3 D simulations were performed on the Cray J 90 supercomputer situated at the Rutherford-Appleton laboratories, with pre- and postprocessing operations achieved via a Silicon Graphics Indy workstation. A mechanical model was constructed consisting of various CICo-TSE elements rotating within a transparent outer barrel. A technique has been developed using coloured viscous clays whereby the flow patterns and mixing characteristics within the CICo-TSE may be visualised. In order to test and verify the simulated predictions, the patterns observed within the mechanical model were compared with the flow patterns predicted by the computational model. The flow patterns within the single-flighted conveying screw elements in particular, showed good agreement between the experimental and simulated results...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of fabricating polypropylene (PP) nanofibers has been explored by using different additives, such as sodium oleate (SO), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS), during melt electrospinning. PP of high melt flow index (1000) was used with PEG and PDMS for {{the reduction of}} the melt viscosity; and it was used with SO for improving the electrical conductivity during melt electrospinning. It was observed that all the additives used in this study helped to reduce the fiber diameter. The most promising additive, SO, was effective in reducing the fiber diameter to the nanometer scale due to the increase in the electrical conductivity. The fiber diameter was decreased by the addition of PEG and PDMS due to the decrease in the melt viscosity. The effect of die shape on the fiber cross-sectional shape was analyzed and an interesting finding is that the die shapes did not {{have an effect on the}} cross-sectional shape of the fibers. That is, irrespective of the die shapes (i. e. <b>trilobal,</b> tetralobal, multilobal and circular) used in this study, the crosssectional shapes of melt electrospun fibers were circular. The distribution of the additives in the fiber was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and was found to be uniform. Tensile tests were performed on single nanofibers with limited success, due to the problems in preparing fiber samples and successfully holding them in the jaws of the testing machine without slippage...|$|E
40|$|POY yarns {{are well}} know and commercialized since 1970 s. On the other hand, air-jet {{textured}} yarns are very common {{due to their}} unique structure which looks like natural spun-staple yarns. In the air-jet texturing process, the yarn is textured by overfeeding into a high-pressure of air to create a looped and more natural yarn appearance and also the bulkiness level of the yarn is controlled by input speed and jet-take out speed. This process reassigns flat, continous synthetic yarns into entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun like structured yarns. They are of higher bulk, exhibits increased covering power, have a more subdued lustre and are warmer in hand. Therefore, air-jet textured yarns possess some unique properties that require investigation. Hence, in this study, first the texturing process is introduced briefly and its principle of manufacturing is illustrated, later four different types of yarns were produced with two different fibre cross-sections at the three different nozzle types and three different core yarn feeding. The produced yarn production details are given and their breaking strength, elongation and work of rupture are studied along with their morphological structures by using light microscope and SEM. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of POY fibre cross-section on air-jet textured yarn mechanical properties.

Yarn produced by this technique has executed closer resemblance to preferable ring spun yarn structure as well as properties to flat multifilament yarn. Commercial success of this concept demands through study of impact of various raw materials, machine variables and process variables {{on the performance of}} this innovative yarn. This research work thereby designed to identify the influence of raw material variables on the mechanical crimp textured yarn performance. However, in order to avoid undue overlapping machine variables as well as process variables were kept constant. Empirically optimised values of these variables for polyester yarn have been adopted for this study. Fully drawn multifilament yarns belonging to two most commercially popular groups viz; Polyester and Nylon, were textured at three different false twist levels. These yarns were not only differing in terms of type of polymer group but also in terms of other contributing properties, viz; yarn fineness, filament fineness, cross sectional shape etc [...] However values of these variables were purely restricted by the availability of variations from the manufacturer end. Comparative evaluation of texturising as well mechanical properties of these product yarns have been done. All the samples irrespective of the material have shown the rise in the percent bulk, linear density, percent extension, percent boiling water shrinkage with finer <b>trilobal</b> cross section filament yarn. However, at identical yarn fineness, number of filaments (dpf) has played a detrimental role than modulus of polymeric yarn...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{assessed}} the hemodynamic performance and calcification {{potential of a}} new design of bovine pericardial valve, the Trilogy valve (Arbor Surgical Technologies Inc, Irvine, CA). We compared this new valve with the Perimount valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) in a randomized prospective study in adolescent sheep. METHODS: Nine Trilogy valves (size 21) and six Perimount valves (size 23 or 25) were implanted in the mitral position in adolescent sheep and studied during five months. Hemodynamic measurements were performed at one week, three months, and five months using transthoracic echocardiography. Valve calcification was assessed by X-ray and calcium content was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry after five months implantation in sheep. Tissues were also evaluated histologically (Von Kossa staining). RESULTS: The nine Trilogy valves had lower peak velocity, peak gradient, and mean gradient compared with the six Perimount valves. These 21 -mm Trilogy valves had similar deceleration time and effective orifice area compared with the 23 - and 25 -mm Perimount valves. Calcification of the Trilogy valves was significantly lower than Perimount valves (p < 0. 01), particularly in the commissural (p < 0. 01) and free margin regions (p < 0. 03). In all parameters assessed, the Trilogy valves exhibited less variation valve-to-valve compared with Perimount valves. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that a valve designed to reduce stress in the tissue, improve leaflet kinematics, with advanced antimineralization treatment, can exhibit superior calcification resistance in the mitral position of adolescent sheep. The <b>trilobal</b> geometry and independent leaflet suspension design, combined with an advanced tissue treatment, {{appears to be a}} promising breakthrough in the effort to develop a more durable and hemodynamically efficient bioprosthetic valve. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|While most {{filters are}} made of pleated fibrous media, almost all {{existing}} theories of aerosol filtration are developed for flat media placed perpendicular to the air flow. Expressions developed for flat sheet media do not provide accurate information directly useful for designing a pleated filter, and therefore, most progress made in developing pleated filters is based on empiricism. This study is aimed at establishing an enabling knowledge that allows for a better design and optimization of pleated aerosol filters. This study is focused on developing a predictive simulation method that accounts for {{the influence of a}} filter’s micro-scale geometric parameters, such as fiber orientation, as well as its macro-scale features, like pleat shape, in predicting the transient pressure drop and collection efficiency with or without the effects of dust loading. The dual-scale simulation method developed in this work {{is believed to be the}} only feasible approach for design and optimization of pleated aerosol filters with the current academic-level computational power. Our study is divided into two major tasks of micro- and macro-scale modeling. Our micro-scale studies are comprised of a series of CFD simulations conducted in virtual 2 -D or 3 -D fibrous geometries that resemble the internal micro-structure of a fibrous medium. These simulations are intended to isolate the effects of each micro structural parameter and study its influence on the performance of the filter medium. In detail, it is intended to propose a method to predict the performance of micro-structures with fiber size distribution. Also, the effects of micro-structural fiber orientation were investigated. Moreover, we offered methodology to predict the performance of noncircular fibers using available analytical expressions for circular fibers. It is shown that the circumscribed circle for a <b>trilobal</b> shaped fiber gives the best prediction for collection efficiency. In macro-scale simulations, on the other hand, the filter medium is treated as a lumped porous material with its properties obtained via micro-scale simulations. Our results showed that more number of pleats helps better performance of pleated filters, however, if the pleat channel becomes blocked by dust cake then this effect is no longer valid...|$|E
