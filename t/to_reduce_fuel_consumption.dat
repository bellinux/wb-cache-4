5|$|Mechanical {{specifications}} carried over, {{except for}} a new five-speed manual transmission, optional on the 1.9-litre four-cylinder and 2.85-litre six-cylinder versions. In an attempt to improve sales figures of the inline-four engine, Holden spent considerable time improving its performance and efficiency. Modifications were also made to the 2.85-litre six to lift economy, and the powerplants managed <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> {{by as much as}} 12.5 and 14percent, correspondingly. Holden released the sports-oriented Commodore SS sedan in September 1982—reintroducing a nameplate used briefly ten years prior with the HQ series. Provisioned with a choice of 4.2- or optional 5.0-litre V8 engines, both versions of the VH SS were teamed with a four-speed manual transmission. Racing driver Peter Brock's Holden Dealer Team (HDT) high performance outfit produced three upgraded versions, known as Group One, Group Two and Group Three, the latter version available in either 4.2-litre or more commonly 5.0-litre V8 configuration.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, several {{automobile}} manufacturers announced that future vehicles will use aspects of hybrid electric technology <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> {{without the use}} of the hybrid drivetrain. Regenerative braking can be used to recapture energy and stored to power electrical accessories, such as air conditioning. Shutting down the engine at idle can also be used <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and reduce emissions without the addition of a hybrid drivetrain. In both cases, some of the advantages of hybrid electric technology are gained while additional cost and weight may be limited to the addition of larger batteries and starter motors. There is no standard terminology for such vehicles, although they may be termed mild hybrids.|$|E

25|$|The DA36 E-Star, an {{aircraft}} designed by Siemens, Diamond Aircraft and EADS, employs a series hybrid powertrain with the propeller being turned {{only by a}} Siemens 70kW (94hp) electric motor. The aim is <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and emissions by up to 25%. An onboard 40hp (30kW) Austro Engines Wankel rotary engine and generator provides the electricity {{because of the small}} size, light weight and high power-to-weight ratio of the engines. The electric motor also uses electricity stored in batteries to take off and climb reducing sound emissions by eliminating the engine. The series hybrid powertrain using the Wankel engine reduces the weight of the plane by 100 kilos to its predecessor. The DA36 E-Star first flew in June 2013, making this the first ever flight of a series hybrid powertrain.

25|$|In {{second half}} of 2008 the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid model went through several levels of {{modernisation}} {{and now it is}} considered to be at the second generation by the producer. Most of the changes are that of the power system of the electric hybrid engine, making a smaller and lighter engine, the Cummins ISBe5 250B with a volume of 6.7litre and the power of 178kW. The changes meant even lower fuel consumption - the older engine has reduced fuel usage by 15% compared to purely diesel propulsion while the new engine saves 23-24%. Thanks to further optimisation the Solaris is planning <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> by 30%. Due to a lighter engine, the other power systems, like the batteries and Dual Power Inverter Module which are on the roof, work at an increased rate and produce more power. Due to this the model has also undergone a makeover of the general body, such as the aerodynamics, meaning only an air conditioning module can be fitted {{on the front of the}} bus. The estimated time for future modernisation, when new modules will be able to be added, is said to be about in 6–7 years, with an average usage of 60000km per year.|$|E

For the VE Omega and Berlina, the 3.6-litre Alloytec V6 has been downsized to 3.0-litres, the lowest engine displacement of a Commodore since the straight-six engine fitted to the 1986 VL series. This smaller capacity engine features Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) technology, and is officially claimed <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> by up to 12percent depending on the variant. Power increases to , although torque is reduced to [...] Along with the 3.0-litre engine, a 3.6-litre version of the same, producing [...] and , was also unveiled. Other than the manual transmission version of the SV6, all SIDI V6 models are coupled to GM's 6L50 automatic and fall under Holden's EcoLine banner. Benefits to fuel economy for the 3.6-litre SIDI can also be attributed to an improved [...] "deceleration fuel cut" [...] system, which terminates the fuel supply during engine coasting; a higher efficiency alternator and voltage regulator; a 50rpm lower idle speed (to 550rpm); and a new [...] "turbine damper" [...] for the automatic transmission that works to suppress vibrations at low rpms, thus enabling earlier upshifts. Omega versions of the Ute and all bi-fuel versions retain the existing 3.6-litre and four-speed automatic combination, although the LPG engine has been tweaked for further efficiency gains.|$|E

2500|$|In 1981 Alfa Romeo {{developed}} {{in collaboration with}} the University of Genoa a semi-experimental Alfetta version, fitted with a modular variable displacement engine and an electronic engine control unit.
