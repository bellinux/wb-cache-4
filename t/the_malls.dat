5|$|Central Basingstoke has two further {{shopping}} areas: <b>The</b> <b>Malls</b> and the Top of Town. <b>The</b> <b>Malls</b> {{area had}} declined since {{the opening of}} Festival Place and the closure of its Allders department store, though still home to several major retailers. The leasehold was purchased in 2004 by the St Modwen development group {{in partnership with the}} Kuwait property investment company Salhia Real Estate, with provision for redevelopment The redevelopment of <b>The</b> <b>Malls</b> started in late 2010, and the shopping centre was given a major facelift. The existing canopies were removed and a clear roof canopy installed, to protect the centre from bad weather, but still allow natural light and air in. The whole shopping centre has been repaved and new street furniture installed. A new gateway entrance to <b>The</b> <b>Malls</b> links it to the rail station. The redevelopment was completed {{in the last quarter of}} 2011. The redevelopment work has been carried out by Wates Group using a variety of subcontractors.|$|E
5|$|Immediately outside <b>the</b> <b>Malls,</b> in {{the centre}} of Basingstoke's Wote Street stands Willie, the {{heaviest}} sculpture of a male organ on public display in the UK, weighing seven tons. The image of a mother and child is carved {{into the side of}} the sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Route 17 {{has been}} the object of several studies {{exploring}} a Bergen BRT, a bus rapid transit system that would potentially alleviate some traffic congestion and decrease automobile dependency. While funding has not been identified, the potential routes of the system have centered around the vicinity radiating from <b>the</b> <b>malls</b> of Paramus.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mall</b> {{was opened}} {{along with the}} Venetian in 1999. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> has indoor canals, where gondolas take people around <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> is {{anchored}} by a flagship, high-fashion Barneys New York store and contains many designer and upscale boutiques. Live performances can be found throughout <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mall</b> {{opened in}} 1978, {{at a time}} when <b>The</b> Boulevard <b>Mall</b> was <b>the</b> city's only other major indoor mall. In September 1978, after <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> opening, Dayton-Hudson {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> would be sold as part of corporate downsizing. At the time of opening, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> included 7,600 parking spaces and two anchor stores: Diamond's and The Broadway. Sears and JCPenney stores were scheduled to open in 1979, thus completing <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> Approximately 3,000 people were expected to ultimately be employed at <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mall's</b> name is derived from the English word for Las Vegas: Meadows.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> {{was sold}} to Hull Storey Gibson who cited Sumter's {{position}} as the retail and financial center of the surrounding area {{as the reason for}} purchasing <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> In 2002, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> was renovated and renamed Sumter <b>Mall.</b> In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> had its grand opening under its new name. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> is one of the counties largest taxpayers paying $1.3 million annually. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> is fully enclosed and employs approximately 850 people. <b>The</b> <b>mall's</b> size was originally reported as being 431,617 square feet, but was later reported as 345,000 square feet.|$|R
5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came {{under pressure from}} <b>the</b> <b>malls</b> where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits {{in the event of}} an attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold {{in the event of an}} attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} London Overspill plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became <b>The</b> <b>Malls.</b> The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The {{central part of the}} shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Kent County, M-37 follows Cherry Valley Road through Caledonia. As {{the highway}} transitions to Broadmoor Avenue, the landscape also transitions from rural to suburban. North of 76th Street, Broadmoor widens to a four-lane boulevard which passes a campus of Davenport University near the M-6 freeway {{on the outskirts}} of the Grand Rapids area. This section is dominated by light industrial complexes west of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in the suburb of Kentwood. These complexes change over to retail establishments north of 32nd Street. At 28th Street, Broadmoor Avenue ends, and East Beltline Avenue begins. This same intersection also marks the western terminus of M-44, which starts concurrent with M-37 in Kentwood. These two highway designations follow East Beltline Avenue between the Woodland Mall and the Centerpointe Mall. North of <b>the</b> <b>malls,</b> M-37/M-44 passes through the campus of Calvin College and along residential areas at the east end of Reeds Lake. The intersection of East Beltine Avenue and Fulton Street is the western terminus for M-21, a highway that runs east across the state to Flint. North of this junction, M-37/M-44 meets I-96.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mall</b> {{had only}} <b>the</b> second {{location}} of Lancaster department store Watt & Shand. The lifestyle center portion of <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> Fountain Shoppes, is accessible {{from the main}} level. <b>The</b> <b>mall's</b> only fountain can be found here. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> has had no indoor fountains for over 25 years. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> is located approximately halfway between Baltimore and Philadelphia.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1969, and <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> {{opened with a}} {{dedication}} ceremony on February 21, 1972. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> has been renovated and expanded in 1980 and 1993. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> is located {{less than a mile}} away from <b>the</b> Northshore <b>Mall,</b> in Peabody, although both malls are primarily owned and managed by Simon Property Group. Since the 1980s, <b>the</b> Liberty Tree <b>Mall</b> has focused more on the discount end, whereas <b>the</b> Northshore <b>Mall</b> has focused on the mainstream/upscale end, thus enabling them to coexist semi-peacefully. Ann & Hope, one of the former anchor stores of <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> opened in 1969 before <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> was completed. Lechmere was <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> other anchor, which opened with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> in 1972.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{demolition}} plans and rent increases, tenants either relocated within <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> or left <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> entirely. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> {{plans to begin}} demolition {{in the summer and}} complete its changes by the end of 2010. <b>The</b> <b>mall's</b> second floor is to be used for office space and medical clinics. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> will be without a food court for 18 months.|$|R
25|$|As the Canary Wharf {{office complex}} grew, Canary Wharf DLR station was redeveloped {{from a small}} wayside station to a large one with six {{platforms}} serving three tracks and a large overall roof, fully integrated into <b>the</b> <b>malls</b> below the office towers.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>malls</b> {{have shared}} a {{turbulent}} recent history, coming under common ownership in 2003 under Dunedin Property. Protego’s UK Actively Managed Shopping Centre Fund acquired the centres in 2006, serviced by a loan provided by Lehman Brothers. Defaulting on £82m of that loan, the centres entered receivership {{with the collapse}} of Lehman.|$|E
25|$|They {{announced}} a tour to New Zealand and Australia in 2007, where {{they made a}} series of public appearances at shopping malls owned by the Westfield Group in February and March 2008. During the tour, which included visits to Melbourne and Sydney, they performed live styling sessions and gave fashion advice to customers at the Westfield centres. Their appearances at <b>the</b> <b>malls</b> attracted crowds of thousands and the tour finished on 8 March 2008. Woodall and Constantine also appeared on The Morning Show hosted by Kylie Gillies and Larry Emdur, to give one of the viewers a complete makeover. They currently write a weekly column for The Sun in Britain.|$|E
50|$|Simon Property Group {{purchased}} <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> in 1999. <b>The</b> company stopped {{paying the}} debt on <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> in October 2015 and the noteholder took ownership of <b>the</b> <b>Mall.</b> At <b>the</b> {{time of the}} takeover by the note holder, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> was performing very poorly. In November 2015, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> was appraised at $14.7 million but had a loan value of $45 million.|$|R
50|$|Soon, {{problems}} began developing with <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> hurried construction. As {{early as}} July 1975, a malfunction in <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> sprinkler system caused a six-hour shutdown of <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> Later that year, {{a small fire}} in a trash compactor forced an evacuation of <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> In November, acrobat Jimmy Troy fell to his death from the trapeze during a circus at <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bankers Life sold <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> in 1985 to Jacobs Visconsi Jacobs (later The Jacobs Group). Westfield Group bought <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> in 2001. In June, 2012, Starwood Capital Group {{acquired}} <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> from Westfield. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> {{is managed}} by CBL & Associates Properties.|$|R
25|$|Trinidad has a rich {{tapestry}} of cultures which create occasions for celebrations beyond many's expectations {{for a small}} Caribbean island; thus {{there is much to}} see and do after work hours in Port of Spain, even long after the annual Carnival celebration. While the popularity of the major shopping area around Frederick Street as a nightspot centre has remained steady or declined, expansion of entertainment venues into <b>the</b> <b>malls</b> and outlying towns has occurred. St. James, 'uptown' Port of Spain (St. Clair and Woodbrook) have seen a boom in nightclubs, sports bars and fine dining restaurants as workers from government offices and large corporations disgorge on evenings from high-rise headquarters built in newly commercialized formerly upscale neighbourhoods.|$|E
25|$|New Jersey, {{the most}} densely {{populated}} {{state in the}} United States, and in the suburban sphere of influence of both New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a comparatively large number of notable malls throughout the state. Paramus, in Bergen County, {{is one of the}} largest shopping meccas in the country, with its four major shopping malls accounting for a significant proportion of the over $5 billion in annual retail sales generated in the borough, more than any other ZIP Code in the United States. This high level of retail sales persists despite the fact that the County, in general, and the Borough, in particular, have blue laws that force <b>the</b> <b>malls</b> and other retailers to close on Sunday.|$|E
25|$|Paramus {{is known}} for its {{multitude}} of stores and malls. It has five major indoor shopping centers, serving residents in the areas of Bergen County and Passaic County in New Jersey and Rockland County in New York. New Jersey does not levy a sales tax on clothes and shoes, which makes it an attractive shopping destination for people even further away in New York City, who pay sales tax on clothing items above $110 in price, in addition to the lower standard rate of 7% in New Jersey, compared to 8.875% in New York City. The spending levels generated by <b>the</b> <b>malls</b> have made Paramus one of the top retail ZIP codes in the country.|$|E
50|$|Allegany County Transit {{provides}} bus {{services to}} <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> Many of <b>the</b> lines stop by <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> and Walmart. Morning service, Green, Gold, Purple, Evening Service have a destination at <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> Some buses for Frostburg State University bring students to <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mall</b> opened June 30, 1983, {{featuring}} Kmart, Great American supermarket (now OfficeMax), and J. C. Penney. For dining, Applebee's {{has served}} <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> patrons since <b>the</b> opening of <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> Kmart closed in 2003. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> was sold by Glimcher Realty Trust in 2005.|$|R
50|$|Also {{leading to}} <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> demise was <b>the</b> {{opening of a}} Walmart Supercenter roughly a mile away from <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> drawing from <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> {{customer}} base. Around the same time, <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> Italian Oven restaurant closed, as {{it was discovered that}} the restaurant could not legally serve alcohol. By 2001, <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> food court would be devoid of restaurants. Kmart's bankruptcy filings in 2002 resulted in the closure of <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> Kmart location; Phar-Mor would close the same year, also as part of bankruptcy.|$|R
25|$|On October 3, 2006, the LDS Church, which {{owned the}} ZCMI Center Mall and Crossroads Mall, both on Main Street, {{announced}} plans to demolish <b>the</b> <b>malls,</b> a skyscraper, and several other buildings {{to make way for}} the $1.5billion City Creek Center redevelopment. It combined several new office and residential buildings (one of which is the city's third-tallest building) around an outdoor shopping center featuring a stream, fountain, and other outdoor amenities; it opened on March 22, 2012. Sugar House is a neighborhood with a small town main street shopping area and numerous old parks, which will soon be served by the S Line (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar). Sugar House Park is the second largest park in the city, and is host to frequent outdoor events and the primary Fourth of July fireworks in the city.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} of the Courtney Bay / Forebay and south of New Brunswick Route 1 is the East Side, where the city has {{experienced}} its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's current airport is located further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods are found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. <b>The</b> <b>malls</b> were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.|$|E
2500|$|Augusta Mall, {{seven miles}} (11km) from Regency Mall, opened for {{business}} on August 3, 1978. [...] Developed by the Rouse Company, Augusta Mall {{had been in}} the planning stages since 1972; however, its construction had been delayed due to economic uncertainty. [...] The smaller Augusta Mall had 100 stores but only two anchors, Rich’s and Davison’s; both of these were Atlanta-based chains, while Regency Mall featured a combination of Georgia-based and national chains. [...] However, both malls operated successfully through the 1970s and much of the 1980s. [...] They had drawn large retailers to close their downtown stores and relocate to <b>the</b> <b>malls,</b> and many smaller stores had opened stores in one, or both, of <b>the</b> <b>malls.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> {{already started to}} {{encounter}} problems. One of <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> largest challenges were the local gangs that used <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> as a gathering place. It was also {{due to lack of}} organization from <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> changing hands with different management companies as well as city leaders who had a financial interest in the success of <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> These problems continued into and in the late 1980s, and the developers made a new revitalization plan to renovate <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> to attract more people.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mall</b> has {{an unusual}} architecture. The Target is {{detached}} {{from the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> across a common parking lot and has its own parking garage. The Best Buy is the entire upper level of <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> <b>The</b> McDonald's is also located in a detached location, in front of <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mall</b> was {{developed}} in 1976 by the Homart Development Company and originally had wood and glass railings and an overall off-white and brown theme. The pillars in <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> were made of white pebbles. There was no elevator in <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> and originally <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> featured a large ramp {{for access to the}} second floor by wheelchair. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> was designed with a sunken basement-level foodcourt. <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> featured <b>the</b> department stores Powers Dry Goods and Sears. Powers' store became Donaldson's in 1985, then Carson Pirie Scott in 1987. Later, a Target store was constructed adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> and connected by a walkway.|$|R
2500|$|The Bergen Mall was {{the target}} of a lawsuit by nuclear-freeze advocates who {{challenged}} <b>the</b> <b>malls</b> restrictions on distribution of literature to shoppers. On October 12, 1984, Bergen County Superior Court judge Paul R. Huot ruled that the organization should be allowed to distribute literature anywhere and anytime in a shopping mall, noting that [...] "The Bergen Mall has assumed the features and characteristics of the traditional town center for the citizens who reside in Paramus and surrounding Bergen County towns." ...|$|E
2500|$|The mid-'80s saw the popularising of the Walkman. [...] It {{was one of}} the {{key factors}} in {{contributing}} to the rise of the cantopop culture. Leslie Cheung, Anita Mui and Alan Tam were among the biggest pop stars. Other shows related to Super Sentai and Transformers were translated and broadcast regularly. The franchising of toy stores such as Toys [...] "R" [...] Us flooded <b>the</b> <b>malls</b> of Hong Kong. Japanese import stores like Sogo in Causeway Bay also made Hello Kitty a cultural icon.|$|E
2500|$|An {{estimate}} of 400,000 vehicles {{take on the}} city streets and roads every day. [...] The oldest districts were not built {{with the advent of}} the automobile in mind and therefore lack efficient roadways to accommodate the overwhelming number of vehicles. [...] Newer developments, such as <b>the</b> <b>malls,</b> have been built with the car in mind allowing for large parking lots to accommodate their visitors. [...] In the last decades, several of the boulevards and avenues have been retrofitted with grade separations to ease up the flow of traffic.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, plans {{called for}} {{developing}} a shopping area around <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> that would have more than , including <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mall</b> would also be renovated {{as part of the}} plan that included Standard selling part of their development, including <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> to Pacific Rim Development Corporation.|$|R
