Christiania established the country's first uniformed corps of constables in 1859, which gave the force a more unified appearance. Similar structures were soon introduced in many other cities. From 1859 the municipalities would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police to use those forces outside the municipal borders. The first organized education of police officers started in Christiania in 1889.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this essay, {{we address}} three {{questions}} that {{are central to the}} literature on the emergence of democracy and economic globalization: First, does democratization foster trade and capital account liberalization? Second, does trade and capital account openness promote <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>democratization?</b> Third, is <b>the</b> effect of <b>democratization</b> on trade and capital account openness similar across developing countries from different regions around the globe? We conduct some empirical tests to answer these questions and also review the literature that attempts to address the puzzles posited above. Our analysis reveals that statistical evidence for <b>the</b> claim that <b>democratization</b> fosters trade and capital account liberalization is robust but that empirical support for the predicted positive effect of economic openness on the likelihood of democracy is weak. We also emphasize here that more theoretical work {{needs to be done to}} fully understand <b>the</b> link between <b>democratization</b> and economic liberalization and to this end we provide possible topics for future research...|$|R
