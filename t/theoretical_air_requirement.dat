40|$|AbstractIt {{is needed}} to make {{ultimate}} analysis of coal when testing boiler efficiency by traditional method. However, it is so costly and so long {{that it is impossible}} to test boiler efficiency frequently. However, it is much easier to make proximate analysis of coal, and most enterprise may operate. In this paper, a mathematics model has been established based on proximate analysis so as to replace ultimate analysis of coal in boiler efficiency testing. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirement,</b> heat loss due to exhaust gas, and heat loss due to unburned gases were compared by this new model. Errors are no more than 5 %, and it shows that the method is feasible and valid...|$|E
40|$|Energy audit {{is the key}} to a {{systematic}} approach for decision-making in the area of energy management. Energy audit will help to understand more about the ways energy and fuel are used and help in identifying the areas where waste can occur and where scope for improvement exists and to retrofit for energy conservation equipment etc. Energy audit can be classified into two types namely preliminary audit and detailed audit. This study deals with mythologies to quantify the energy losses both electrical and thermal energy and provide the help in comprehensive energy auditing to establish the conclusion to arrive the retrofit equipments and also to arrive the optimum conditions particularly the boiler operations. The equipment considered for retrofit to the rotary equipments such as pumps, fans and compressors in the chemical process industries in which energy saving can be achieved are variable speed drives. Variable speed drives operation can be understood from the affinity laws. The example an energy saving in forced draft fan and induced draft fan in a boiler which produces steam for the process are considered and discussed. A quick method of combustion calculations and the <b>theoretical</b> <b>air</b> <b>requirement</b> by graphical method is given. Primary and secondary air blowers supply air required for the good combustion of coal in a balanced draft maintained in the furnace is discussed...|$|E

50|$|Displacement {{ventilation}} {{was used}} as the primary ventilation in CH2. The advantages of using a displacement ventilation system include increased cost effectiveness in operation, improved air quality within occupied zone, greater operational efficiency, ability to conceal, quiet, and finally flexibility. The minimum fresh <b>air</b> <b>requirement</b> at CH2 is 22.5 litres/second/person. This is much higher than the Australian Standard of 10 litres/second/person (AS 1668.2)The higher turnover rate was chosen because research has shown that low fresh <b>air</b> <b>requirements</b> can be directly linked to low productivity and sickness, including colds and flu.|$|R

40|$|In {{conventional}} {{office building}} design, fresh <b>air</b> <b>requirements</b> are estimated for full occupancy in the building. Typically, fresh <b>air</b> <b>requirements</b> range from 5 to 15 {{cubic feet per}} minute per person expected to occupy the building. While the design total amount of fresh air used is satisfactory for full occupancy of the building, there are many instances less than the design occupancy. Thus, there may be many instances in a commercial building where more fresh air is used than is actually required because the occupancy is below the design occupancy. In hot and humid climates, such as the Gulf Southwest, a considerable portion of the cooling energy in a commercial building is expended cooling and dehumidifying the air needed to maintain fresh <b>air</b> <b>requirements.</b> If {{the total amount of}} fresh air could be reduced to just match that needed by the number of occupants in a building, {{it would be possible to}} reduce the energy use for cooling. This paper summarizes the design and use of an occupancy counter/transmitter that can be used to count the number of people entering/leaving a building and make adjustments in the amount of fresh air used in the building. Sample economics of the system, including initial costs and savings are also provided...|$|R
