Both oscillators are underpre-stressing terms. Two different methods are implementedfor tracing system behaviours: (i) the timeevent-driven technique which builds exact solutions ofgoverning equations {{of the system}} phase by phase and(ii) the multi-scale method which <b>traces</b> <b>system</b> behavioursat different scales of time. It detects invariant ofthe system at fast timescale and equilibrium/singularpoints at slow timescales. The pre-stressing terms producea more complex shape for the invariant, whiledetected dynamics at slow timescale let us have controlat the behaviour of the system during its quasi-steadystateregime(s) which leads to have analytical designtools for tuning parameters of nonlinear energy sink according to design purposes (passive control and/orenergy harvesting) ...|$|E

We present qualitative data comparing initial visits to the exhibit {{with those in the}} Video Traces environment to argue that Video Traces offers a promising means of exploring visitors ’ current understandings of exhibit phenomena, as well as mediating new understandings of these phenomena. We illustrate this argument with two vignettes drawn from our data that show the flexibility of Video Traces for supporting different forms of inquiry.

40|$|Abstract Sequential pattern mining is an {{important}} data mining technique which discovers closed frequent sub sequence from a sequence database. Sequential pattern mining was used in a great spectrum of areas. Some of the applications of sequential pattern mining are namely bio-informatics, web access <b>traces,</b> <b>system</b> utilization logs etc. The data is naturally {{in the form of}} sequences. However it is very difficult as it generates explosive number of sub sequence in candidate generator and test approach. Previous sequential pattern mining algorithm like Clospan, Sequence generator, closed sequence-sequence generator mining (CSGM). In sequential pattern mining and web log mining a traditional algorithm Apriori is always reminded but due to some performance issues they were replaced with other algorithms and techniques. Many different techniques for mining frequent sequential patterns from the log data have been proposed in the recent past but still mining data from weblog files an effective and efficient algorithm is required that works with high performance. Moreover; it is required to authenticate the algorithm for that purposes we have used a traditional algorithm for mining sequential pattern from web log data. Thus the aim of the present work is to bridge these gaps by developing and proposing a new algorithm “Sequential ID 3 ” for sequential pattern mining and their experimental validation on web log data...|$|E

40|$|In many applications, e. g., bioinformatics, {{web access}} <b>traces,</b> <b>system</b> {{utilisation}} logs, etc., {{the data is}} naturally {{in the form of}} sequences. People have taken great interest in analysing the sequential data and finding the inherent characteristics or relationships within the data. Sequential association rule mining is one of the possible methods used to analyse this data. As conventional sequential association rule mining very often generates a huge number of association rules, of which many are redundant, it is desirable to find a solution to get rid of those unnecessary association rules. Because of the complexity and temporal ordered characteristics of sequential data, current research on sequential association rule mining is limited. Although several sequential association rule prediction models using either sequence constraints or temporal constraints have been proposed, none of them considered the redundancy problem in rule mining. The main contribution of this research is to propose a non-redundant association rule mining method based on closed frequent sequences and minimal sequential generators. We also give a definition for the non-redundant sequential rules, which are sequential rules with minimal antecedents but maximal consequents. A new algorithm called CSGM (closed sequential and generator mining) for generating closed sequences and minimal sequential generators is also introduced. A further experiment has been done to compare the performance of generating non-redundant sequential rules and full sequential rules, meanwhile, performance evaluation of our CSGM and other closed sequential pattern mining or generator mining algorithms has also been conducted. We also use generated non-redundant sequential rules for query expansion in order to improve recommendations for infrequently purchased products...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedA {{pendulum}} is statically unstable in its upright inverted state {{due to the}} Earth's gravitional attraction which points downward. However, {{with proper}} forcing, the pendulum can be stabilized in its upright inverted state. Special interest is on periodic vertical forcing applied to the pendulum's base to stabilize it around the upright inverted equilibrium. Many researchers have studied how to stabilize the system by varying various parameters, in particular its amplitude and frequency. Most {{have focused on the}} single degree of freedom inverted pendulum case, which with linear assumption can be described via Mathieu's equation. The system stability can then be characterized by Floquet theory. Our focus is on searching for the periodic solutions inside the linearly stable region of the pendulum's inverted state when the pendulum is under proper periodic forcing. Our research shows that under appropriate excitation by controlling the forcing amplitude and frequency, the pendulum can maintain certain periodic orbits around its inverted state which we characterize in a systematic way.; In this thesis, we applied four different kinds of geometric realizations of the system response: system time <b>traces,</b> <b>system</b> phase portraits, three dimensional views of the system phase portrait as a function of input forcing, and the system's power spectral density diagram. By analyzing these four diagrams simultaneously, we characterize different kinds of multi-frequency periodic behavior around the pendulum's inverted state. To further discuss the effect of the nonlinearity, we applied perturbation techniques using the normalized forcing amplitude as a perturbation parameter to carry out the approximate periodic solutions on a single degree of freedom inverted pendulum nonlinear model.; We also discuss the multiple degree of freedom inverted pendulum system. Both numerical simulation and experiments were performed and detailed comparisons are discussed. Our numerical simulations show close qualitative agreement with experiments...|$|E

40|$|Reducibility between {{different}} cryptographic primitives {{is a fundamental}} problem in modern cryptography. As one of the primitives, traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>systems</b> help content distributors recover the identities of users that collaborated in the pirate construction by tracing pirate decryp-tion boxes. We present the first negative result on designing efficient traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>systems</b> via black-box constructions from symmetric cryptographic primitives, e. g. one-way functions. More specifically, we {{show that there is}} no secure traitor tracing scheme in the random oracle model, such that `k · ` 2 c ≥ Ω̃(n), where `k is the length of user key, `c is the length of ciphertext and n is the number of users, under the assumption that the scheme does not access the oracle to generate user keys. To our best knowledge, almost all the practical (non-artificial) crypto-graphic schemes (not limited to traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>systems)</b> via black-box constructions satisfy this assumption. Thus, our negative results indicate that most of the standard black-box reductions in cryptography cannot help construct a more efficient traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>system.</b> We prove our results by extending the connection between traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>systems</b> and dif-ferentially private database sanitizers to the setting with random oracle access. After that, we prove the lower bound for traitor tracing schemes by constructing a differentially private sanitizer that only queries the random oracle polynomially many times. In order to reduce the query complexity of the sanitizer, we prove a large deviation bound for decision forests, which might be of independent interest. ...|$|R
