40|$|Poverty, food insecurity, and {{malnutrition}} are {{pervasive in}} the semi-arid tropics (SAT) of South Asia, including India. In rural areas, {{most of the}} poor make their livelihoods {{on the use of}} natural resources, which are degraded and inefficiently used. This is because of the inadequate traditional management practices of managing agriculture as well as the fact that resulting crop yields are much below the expected potential yields. ICRISAT in the early 1970 s initiated research on watersheds for integrated use of land, water, and crop management technologies for increasing crop production through efficient use of natural resources, especially rainfall that is highly variable in the SAT and is the main cause of year-to-year variation in crop production in India. Improved watershed management on Vertisols more than doubled crop productivity, and rainfall-use efficiency increased from 35 % to 70 % when compared with traditional technology. After many years of implementing and evaluating these improved technologies in on-farm situations, many lessons were learned and they formed part of the integrated watershed management model currently being pursued by ICRISAT in community watersheds in rural settings. This watershed model is more holistic and puts rural communities and their collective actions at center stage for implementing improved watershed technologies with <b>technical</b> <b>backstopping</b> and convergence by consortium partners.

Watershed development programs in India are silently revolutionalizing dryland areas. Number of impact assessment studies of watershed projects in India showed that the accrued benefits of watershed projects are not at the desired level and concurrent with the investments. Meta-analysis of 311 case studies and the recent comprehensive assessment of watershed programs showed that 68 per cent of watershed projects performed below average for the economic, efficiency and sustainability parameters. The assessment also identified the capacity building as the weakest link for scaling-up the benefits of watershed programs.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of volunteer farmer trainers in promoting adoption of agricultural technologies in western Kenya. Specifically, {{the purpose was to}} assess the type of information they disseminated, farmer trainers' characteristics desirable to farmer trainees, and how trainees evaluate farmer trainers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through focused group and open discussions, and interviews with 44 farmer trainers (32 % women) and 91 trainees (63 % women). Effectiveness of training was assessed based on level of learner satisfaction and attributes pertaining to knowledge, skill, attitude and application of the learning on farms. Other topics examined included selection of farmer trainers, organization of training, type, how and to whom information is disseminated, and farmer trainers' constraints and opportunities. Findings: Farmer trainers played important roles such as mobilizing and training fellow farmers, hosting demonstration plots, bulking and distributing planting materials. They were, however, rated slightly lower in follow-ups and seed bulking. Farmer trainers disseminate on average two to four different types of technology. Crop-based technologies were disseminated more than livestock-based ones because of their simplicity. <b>Technical</b> <b>backstopping</b> from extension workers remains a challenge, which may compromise quality of information disseminated. The survey showed that the approach is sustainable, with farmer trainers continuing their work several years after project support had ended. Practical implications: The results from this study are of use to development programmes keen on using low-cost, community-based dissemination approaches. Recommendations are also given on selecting farmer trainers, organizing training, types of technologies to disseminate incentives, and sustainability. Originality/value: The added value lies in filling information gaps in the use and effectiveness of the farmer trainer approach in promoting technology dissemination...|$|R
40|$|Land {{clearing}} {{has been}} the traditional tool for creating greater agricultural production since time began. All who consume {{the products of the}} land, in whatever form, are part of the sacrifice, willing or not, of biodiversity to generate sustenance and wealth (Declaration of Madrid, 2001). The farmer is omnipresent in areas which produce food and fibre and in many where timber is a product; he should be encouraged to become a “steward of the land”, receiving environmental services payments for this responsibility. These are not subsidies, first because the off-farm benefits to society of ZT adoption (achieved, overwhelmingly, at the farmer´s expense) generate huge social transfers and, second, the WTO regulations do not classify these payments as such. The mitigation potential of land use intensification with integrated ZT crop x livestock systems (ICLZT), can vary between 0. 8 and 2. 5 ha of reduced demand for land clearing for each hectare in the system. By using a ZT crop ley for two to four years, the cost of pasture renovation is defrayed and pasture carrying capacity is trebled, from an average of about 0. 7 animal units (AU) /ha to over 2 AU/ha. Both historical data surveyed and five spreadsheet models of real farms developed in this study, substantiate this. The study also shows higher net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) values accompanying this new technology. Brazil has now established a national programme for ICLZT.

Seven DVOs and 1 Non Government Organization (NGO) representative were interviewed as key informants and one focus group discussion was conducted with a farmer group in Nakapiripirit to collect qualitative data. Questionnaire data was analyzed using SPSS version 19. Key messages from interviews and the focus group discussion were recorded in a notebook and reported verbatim. 70 % of the farmers revealed that CAHWs are the most readily available animal health care service providers in their respective villages.

Accordingly, women group-based commercial pullet rearing as an input for smallholder poultry production was initiated by the Office of Agriculture and Rural Development (OoARD) and IPMS. To develop the program, a credit scheme was initiated by the Regional Rural Finance Fund Administration, using IPMS’s credit innovation funds. With assistance of OoARD, eighty women subdivided into five (village) groups, collectively purchased 4000 day-old chicks (50 /woman) and other inputs such as feed, vaccines, hay box brooder and watering equipment. The women were trained and developed their skills through their group structures. The required vaccinations were also given by the women themselves {{under the auspices of}} the group structures that taught them how to make best use of available vaccine size (500 doses/vial). After 4 – 5 months, 3470 pullets survived and were kept by the women or sold to others for egg production. Empirical results show that: i) the group approach helped to improve linkages, communication, and access to knowledge, technology, finance, inputs (day-old chicks and feed), veterinary service, and market; ii) the groups were able to successfully produce and supply pullets thus making an additional income of Ethiopian birr (ETB) 1 833 /hh; iii) the approach stimulates growing demand for the 5 months-old pullets, especially by government/donor financed programs.

40|$|Like other {{mountain}} {{areas in the}} world, the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Ongoing climate change processes are projected {{to have a high}} impact on the HKH region, and accelerated warming has been reported in the Himalayas. These climate change impacts will be superimposed on a variety of other environmental and social stresses, adding to the complexity of the issues. The sustainable use of natural resources is crucial to the long-term stability of the fragile mountain ecosystems in the HKH and to sustain the socio-ecological resilience that forms the basis of sustainable livelihoods in the region. In order to be prepared for these challenges, it is important to take stock of previous research. The ‘People and Resource Dynamics Project’ (PARDYP), implemented by International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), provides a variety of participatory options for sustainable land management in the HKH region. The PARDYD project was a research for development project that operated in five middle mountain watersheds across the HKH – two in Nepal and one each in China, India, and Pakistan. The project ran from 1996 to 2006 and focused on addressing the marginalisation of mountain farmers, the use and availability of water, issues relating to land and forest degradation and declining soil fertility, the speed of regeneration of degraded land, and the ability of the natural environment to support the growing needs of the region’s increasing population. A key learning from the project was that the opinion of land users is crucial to the acceptance (and, therefore, successful application) of new technologies and approaches. A major challenge {{at the end of every}} project is to promote knowledge sharing and encourage the cross-fertilization of ideas (e. g., in the case of PARDYP, with other middle mountain inhabitants and practitioners in the region) and to share lessons learned with a wider audience.

40|$|The {{mission of}} the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) is to develop and {{disseminate}} appropriate technologies, in collaboration with partners and collaborators, that will contribute to agricultural productivity, and thus bring about sustainable improvements in the livelihoods of Kenyan citizens. To achieve this mission, KARI {{has a number of}} priority research programmes, which are carried out by researchers within the Institute. For many years, although KARI has continued to develop new technologies, they have had only minimal impact on the productivity of farmers, more than 75 % of which are smallholder farmers. This lack of impact was mainly attributed to the low levels of adoption of technologies. KARI therefore recognized that its research would have to become more responsive to the needs of farmers. Projects funded under the ATRI initiative focus on technologies that will contribute to food security, poverty reduction and sustainable natural resource management. In cases where KARI does not have the required technology or information, it acts as a broker, linking farmers´ groups with relevant technology providers. Either way, the farmers´ demands are translated into project proposals according to a set format and submitted to a KARI centre-based regional steering committee for review. The selected proposals are then forwarded to the national steering committee for further review and funding approval. The successful projects are implemented according to an agreed work plan, with <b>technical</b> <b>backstopping</b> by KARI scientists or other relevant technology/service providers. The initiative has now been introduced in KARI´s 16 regional centres. So far, about 225 CBOs have proposed some 306 agricultural technologies, which will have direct benefits for 15, 000 farmers and indirectly on 150, 000 others. At first, KARI´s researchers had difficulties conceptualizing ATIRI. Training courses were therefore organized for the scientists to explain the initiative and what it would entail. Although this yielded satisfactory results, some researchers were concerned that implementing ATIRI would effectively reduce the time available for basic research. As a result, the mode of ATIRI implementation is now being reassessed. Public sector extension staff and other service providers are being encouraged to collaborate further with the CBOs in the formulation and implementation of ATIRI projects. Under this new arrangement, KARI´s researchers will continue to help build the capacity of the CBOs, and act as brokers in the provision of the technologies demanded by the farmers, in addition to their role in providing quality assurance.

Field days and seminars should be provided for extensionists, with required extension materials produced by thelaboratoryThe honey quality laboratory should monitor local production and introduce survey results into beekeeping extension. The laboratory should also make testing services available to the private sector. Research should be conducted on issues of immediate impact to practical beekeeping. Field days and seminars should be provided for beekeeping extensionists, and required extension materials should be produced by the laboratoryTarget groups for a beekeeping development programme should be identified and approached, and a socio-economic profile study of beekeepers practicing honey-hunting should be conducted. It was recommended that an extension programme be designed, {{based on the results of}} all studies, with priority given to direct participation of the target beneficiaries. Small pilot projects could be undertaken to find solutions to various technical and organizational difficulties, which could later be applied on a larger scale in the framework of the development programm...|$|R
40|$|In The Netherlands, the Research Station for Cattle, Sheep and Horse Husbandry (in Dutch {{abbreviated}} as PR) bridges the {{gap between}} more basic and disciplinary research done at universities and research institutes {{on the one hand}} and the extension service and the farmers on the other hand. The PR adopted from the beginning a very practica 1 approach. Applied research and technology development geared towards solving farmers’ problems are the main tasks. A major characteristic of the research is the integrated approach. Research is done under conditions similar to those on practica 1 farms, while besides technical results also economie evaluations of solutions and new technologies are taken into account. The PR played an important role in the modernization and intensification process of dairy farming in The Netherlands. Developments in housing, fodder conservation, especially grass silage, slurry application on grassland, feeding according to individual requirements and integrated economie farm models were among those initiated by the PR. The practica 1 approach of the PR and its experimental farms attracts the interest of farmers, not only in The Netherlands but also from abroad. Farmers from neighbouring countries use research results from PR and adapt them to their own situation. The large number of foreign visitors indicates the interest in the work and organization of the PR. Although the major task of PR is to conduct applied research for and transfer the findings to the Dutch farmers, PR has also provided advice and assistance to the development of the farming industry and agricultural research in several countries in Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Since the seventies, foreign contacts became more frequent and intensive. International contacts and activities of PR have been mainly initiated through bilateral contacts of staff members. Because of the expertise available at PR, experts have been asked regularly for missions to evaluate or prepare dairy projects in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe as part of activities in the field of development cooperation or improvement of economie relations and/or export. The international activities have also led to joint projects in which PR provided <b>technical</b> <b>backstopping</b> or was the executive agent. On the occasion of the 25 th anniversary of PR as a research organization and the retirement of Mr. Sije Schukking, PR considered it worthwhile to highlight the international activities in this publication. This publication contains contributions from colleagues from the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries describing the role of PR in international activities and a review of the international activities by colleagues from PR. However, above all we appreciate very much the contributions from colleagues from the different countries PR has co-operated and maintained contacts with namely from Poland, Estonia, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Tanzania and Kenya. Each of them describing the situation regarding the dairy husbandry in their respective countries and the cooperation with The Netherlands and PR in the further development of the dairy industry in their countries. The driving force behind all these international activities was Mr. Sije Schukking. Like shown in the different contributions, his wide experience and practica 1 knowledge in the field of dairy and live-stock farming in general and his personal abilities to cape with different situations and people makes him a much appreciated advisor in many countries. With pleasure I dedicate this publication to Mr. Schukking on the occasion of his official retirement and wish him and his family all the best for the future. However, I know that Mr. Schukking will conti-nue contributing to some of the current projects for some time. So you may see him again in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Landcare is a {{movement}} of farmer led organizations supported by local governments with <b>backstopping</b> from <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> providers- that share knowledge about sustainable and profitable agriculture on sloping lands while conserving natural resources. From its humble beginning of 25 farmers in 1996, they evolved into a dynamic voluntary movement with now more than 500 farmers involved into 250 groups from 5 municipalities in northern, central and eastern Mindanao. Today, Landcare becomes the melting pot for farmers, professionals, government people, students and the business sector to discuss issues, share lessons, invest talents, skills and other resources geared towards better land husbandry and {{protection of the environment}} from degradation. It threads a path for constructive, long term and practical action at a community level for tackling environment and sustainability issues for the well-being of the people and their communities. The success of Landcare stemmed mostly from the strength of a tripart relationship of three key actors: the farmers and other community members, the Local Government, and Technical Facilitators. These three actors depend on each other, finding strength in working together- thus, forming an interdependent relationship to form a solid base for participatory program management. Although, our experience in Landcare is just recent, we believe that the lessons drawn are enormous and have potential application to a range of development issues. Participation in the triadic approach is fundamental i...|$|R
40|$|The International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) {{is one of}} 13 centres {{supported}} by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). It {{is one of two}} centres dedicated to livestock research; the other is the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) in Nairobi. ILCA's goal is to increase sustainable livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa and its main target groups are smallholders and agropastoralists in the semi-arid, subhumid, humid and highland zones. The Centre's work is organized in six major research areas or thrusts: cattle milk and meat; small ruminant meat and milk; animal traction; animal feed resources trypanotolerance; and livestock policy and resource use. African national programmes have been closely involved {{in the development of the}} research programmes for each thrust, and will participate in them through collaborative projects and networks. The research is backed by training and information services to national programme staff. Two major networks are already operating under the animal feed resource thrust: the Pasture Network for Eastern and Southern Africa (PANESA) and the African Research Network on Agricultural Byproducts (ARNAB). PANESA includes multilocational pasture and forage germplasm screening trials in East and Southern Africa and is involved in developing feeding packages. The network is dual-purpose, providing a means of exchanging information and experience and acting as a coordinating body for collaborative research. The focus of ARNAB is the use of agricultural by-products, such as straws and stovers, as animal feed. A major objective of the network is to develop standardized methods for feed evaluation both in the laboratory and in feeding trials, in order to improve the comparability of results from different situations. Under ILCA's new strategy the former Small Ruminant and Camel Group network will now focus on sheep and goats only. The network is being developed into a collaborative research network under the small ruminant meat and milk thrust. The livestock policy and resource use thrust also has an existing information network the African Livestock Policy Analysis Network. Other networks are planned, including one to study the role of credil in livestock development. The African Trypanotolerant Livestock Network, coordinated jointly by ILCA and ILRAD, was established to study the complex interactions that influence trypanosomiasis and its effects on livestock performance. Two other major networks are planned: one on animal traction and one to study dairy production in West Africa. A recurrent theme in all ol ILCA's research efforts, and in the networks, is the need to share information. To help meet this need, ILCA has established an information centre unique in Africa, which includes a comprehensive library on livestock and related topics, a collection of nonconventional literature microfiched in African countries, and a variety of computerbased current awareness services. The library holds more than 15, 000 books and some 1300 general and scientific periodicals. The microfiche collection comprises more than 25, 000 documents, ranging from university theses to unpublished national programme reports, many of them selected and microfiched national programme reports, many of them selected and microfiched by ILCA in the 24 African countries covered so far. The entire library collection, including the microfiche collection, is now computerized allowing on-line searches. Several computer-based reference and current awareness services are available to African national programmes, including: - On-line literature searches of ILCA's in-house data base AGRIS, AGRICOLA and CAB International, parts of which are available on CD-ROM (see Spore 9) at ILCA; - Selective dissemination of information based on the AGRIS and CAB International data base; - Current titles, in which the contents pages of periodicals received in the library are copied and grouped into five categories (animal nutrition, animal science, agronomy and soil science, agricultural economics and rural sociology, and animal health and veterinary medicine) and sent to agricultural libraries throughout sub-Saharan Africa; - Document delivery, providing users with microfiche copies and photocopies; and - Specialized bibliographies prepared by ILCA's documentation staff. These information <b>services</b> <b>backstop</b> the research by ILCA and its African partners, providing researchers with the solid base of current information necessary for effective research.
