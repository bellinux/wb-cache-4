5000|$|The Cel Damage {{graphics}} engine uses a rendering technique called cel-shading to produce this cartoon-like appearance. Furthermore, the physics engine in Cel Damage is unique. Rather than aiming to simulate realistic real-world physics, it emulates complex cartoon physics; the physics engine calculates the relevant parts of physical interaction {{as they would}} in reality, and then distorts the physical laws to produce a cartoon-like interaction. This can be seen, for example, when a car turns and the entire shape of the car deforms and flexes into the <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> Cars and game objects can realistically be sliced into pieces, flattened, frozen, shattered, shredded, impaled, lit on fire (and subsequently burn to a crisp and fall into ashes), and more. Chris Hecker, editor of Game Developer magazine, described Cel Damage's cartoon-style graphics as [...] "state-of-the-art for computer-game physics".|$|E

5000|$|Quite commonly, azimuths or compass {{bearings}} are {{stated in}} {{a system in which}} either north or south can be the zero, and the angle may be measured clockwise or anticlockwise from the zero. For example, a bearing might be described as [...] "(from) south, (turn) thirty degrees (toward the) east" [...] (the words in brackets are usually omitted), abbreviated [...] "S30°E", which is the bearing 30 degrees in the eastward direction from south, i.e. the bearing 150 degrees clockwise from north. The reference direction, stated first, is always north or south, and the <b>turning</b> <b>direction,</b> stated last, is east or west. The directions are chosen so that the angle, stated between them, is positive, between zero and 90 degrees. If the bearing happens to be exactly in the direction of one of the cardinal points, a different notation, e.g. [...] "due east", is used instead.|$|E
50|$|The three {{cylinder}} {{two-stroke engine}} used a Drehschieber ("rotary valve", a turning disk, with intake holes for exact {{timing of the}} fuel-air mixture intake). The fuel-air mixture was sucked in by the vacuum in the three crankshaft housings as usual. The Drehschieber does the intake timing for all three cylinders. The engine was not a radial engine associated with aircraft {{and there was no}} need for a flywheel. All three cranks worked on one common gear. This arrangement and the recoil of the pistons in the <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> secured a perfect balance of the moving parts. The cylinders were made of KS (Kolbenschmidt) iron cylinder walls and were embedded in the Silumin alloy engine housing. The only things that could be visibly identified as engine parts were the alloy cylinder heads with multiple cooling fins and the exhaust pipes located between the spokes of the cast alloy front wheel. These flat spokes were designed to serve as a functional cooling fan. The two-speed transmission was built as a differential transmission and used slope-meshed gears. The clutch was made of conventional clutch disks. The clutch (with the springs at the outer circle) was located in front of the transmission. The transmission was actuated by foot-operated steel cables. All parts of the engine allowed easy access for service work. After the removal of the engine - only two bolts and some wiring had to be removed - all important parts were within reach.|$|E
40|$|Seven {{mouldboard}} ploughing {{experiments were}} conducted to systematically investigate the effect of different tillage directions on soil redistribution on hillslopes. The present study included tillage directions other than parallel to the gradient or along the contour, that is, in our experiments the slope gradient changed simultaneously in tillage and in <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> Using physical tracers we developed {{a model of the}} two-dimensional tracer displacement as a function of topography and tillage variables. The displacements in tillage and in <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> were separately described as 2 nd degree polynomials in both tillage and in turning directions. This model fully accounted for the directionality of tillage. Displacement in <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> additionally depended on tillage depth, while that in tillage direction was affected by tillage speed and soil bulk density. We found a large effect of tillage directionality on soil redistribution, and tillage at 45 to the gradient turning soil upslope was the least erosive tillage direction. We obtained non-linear relationships between soil redistribution and profile curvature, instead of the linear relationships reported previously. Consequently tillage erosivity varied in tillage direction and a unique tillage transport coefficient could not be obtained for all tillage directions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

The absolute values of these two difference scores were then averaged to create a single value reflecting the magnitude of heading change as a function of experience in the environment. Higher values thus reflected a tendency during later trials to adjust heading in the direction of an upcoming turn, collapsed across left and right <b>turn</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} EEG-based Brain-computer interface (BCI) {{that uses}} error related brain activity to im-prove {{the prediction of}} driver’s intended <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> In experiments while subjects drive in a realistic car simulator, we show a directional cue before reaching intersection, and analyze error related EEG potential to infer if the presented direction coincides with the driver’s intention. In this protocol, the directional cue provides an initial estimation of the driving direction (based on EEG, environmental or previous driving habits), and {{we focus on the}} recognition of error-potentials it may elicit. Experiments with 7 healthy human subjects yield an average classification 0. 69 ± 0. 16, which confirms the feasibility of decoding these signals to help estimating driver’s <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> This study can be further exploited by intelligent cars to tune their driving assistant systems to improve their performance and enhance the driving experience.

40|$|Determining {{where another}} person is {{attending}} {{is an important}} skill for social interaction that relies on various visual cues, including the <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> {{of the head and}} body. This study reports a novel high-level visual aftereffect that addresses the important question of how these sources of information are combined in gauging social attention. We show that adapting to images of heads turned 25 ° to the right or left produces a perceptual bias in judging the <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> of subsequently presented bodies. In contrast, little to no change in the judgment of head orientation occurs after adapting to extremely oriented bodies. The unidirectional nature of the aftereffect suggests that cues from the human body signaling social attention are combined in a hierarchical fashion and is consistent with evidence from single-cell recording studies in nonhuman primates showing that information about head orientation can override information about body posture when both are visible...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} chair seat height and <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> on the Timed Up and Go scores of patients after stroke. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. Setting: A geriatric day hospital in Hong Kong. SUBJECTS: Twenty-five patients with sub-acute stroke. METHODS: The time taken to complete the Timed Up and Go test with various chair seat heights (65 %, 90 % and 115 % of each subject’s leg length – distance from lateral knee joint line to ground in sitting) and turning directions (toward the affected and unaffected side) was recorded using a stopwatch with randomized test order. RESULTS: There were significant differences in Timed Up and Go scores between the 3 levels of chair seat height (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), with the lowest Timed Up and Go scores recorded when the seat height was 115 % of the subject’s leg length and the highest at a seat height of 65 % of the subject’s leg length. Turning toward the affected side {{was found to be}} significantly quicker than turning toward the unaffected side (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Chair seat height and <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> significantly influence the Timed Up and Go scores of patients after sub-acute stroke. Optimizing chair seat height with reference to subject’s leg length and <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> is essential when using the Timed Up and Go test as an outcome measure in stroke rehabilitation.

40|$|In this thesis, robot {{navigation}} {{using the}} Particle Filter based FastSLAM approach for obstacle avoidance {{derived from a}} modified Velocity Potential Field method was investigated. A switching controller was developed to deal with robot’s efficient <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> when close to obstacles. The determination of the efficient <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> {{is based on the}} local map robot derived from its on board local sensing. The estimation of local map and robot path was implemented using the FastSLAM approach. A particle filter was utilized to obtain estimated robot path and obstacles (local map). When robot sensed only obstacles, the estimated robot positions was regarding to obstacles based the measurement of the distance between the robot and obstacles. When the robot detected the goal, estimation of robot path will switch to estimation with regard to the goal in order to obtain better estimated robot positions. Both simulation and experimental results illustrated that estimation with regard to the goal performs better than estimation regarding only to obstacles, because when robot travelled close to the goal, the residual error between estimated robot path and the ideal robot path becomes monotonously decreasing. When robot reached the goal, the estimated robot position and the ideal robot position converge. We investigated our proposed approach in two typical robot navigation scenarios. Simulations were accomplished using MATLAB, and experiments were conducted with the help of both MATLAB and LabVIEW. In simulations and experiments, the robot successfully chose efficiently <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> to avoid obstacles and finally reached the goal...|$|E

The right hand and right foot were significantly dominant for the able-bodied sample. Able-bodied participants showed a significant turning preference towards the left, which was opposite to the dominant hand and foot. The amputees were significantly right-hand dominant and the side of the amputation influenced foot dominance. The amputee sample showed no preferred <b>turning</b> <b>direction.</b> Turning bias indices in the amputee sample were not significantly associated with handedness, footedness, side of amputation, or dominance prior to amputation. The lack of a preferred direction of turn in the amputee sample suggests that biomechanical asymmetries can influence turning bias...|$|E

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based rehabilitation centre. Participants: Twenty-five healthy adults aged ≥ 50 years. Outcome measures: Distance covered in the 6 MWT (6 MWD) was recorded in metres. Number of turns during the test using walkways of various lengths (10, 20 and 30 m) and different turning directions (turning towards dorminant and non-dorminant side), rate of perceived exertion and heart rate were recorded before and after the test. Results: The 6 MWD and the number of turns differed significantly with walkway length (P < 0. 05). The greatest 6 MWD and the lowest number of turns were recorded in the 30 -m walkway. Significant increases in heart rate and rate of perceived exertion (P < 0. 05) were found between the pre-test and post-test for all testing conditions. No significant difference was found between the two turning directions for any distance covered. Conclusion: The length of the walkway had a significant effect on the 6 MWD, but the <b>turning</b> <b>direction</b> did not.

40|$|Variation in the {{structural}} complexity of a habitat {{is known to}} have significant affects on the evolution of different populations and can shape behavior, morphology, and life-history traits. Here, we investigated whether habitat complexity influences a species’ capacity for spatial learning and cue choice by comparing the performance of 4 goby species from 2 contrasting habitats in a spatial task. Gobies were collected from dynamic, homogenous sandy shores and stable, spatially complex rock pool habitats. We trained fish to use a T-maze to find a hidden reward and asked whether they used local visual landmarks or body-centered methods for orientation (i. e. <b>turn</b> <b>direction)</b> to do so. It was expected that fish from rock pools would learn the spatial task much faster and use different orientation cues than fish from sandy shores. We found that rock pool species learnt the location of the reward arm much faster, made fewer errors and used both types of cues available (visual landmarks and <b>turn</b> <b>direction)</b> to locate the reward, whereas sand species relied on <b>turn</b> <b>direction</b> significantly more than plant landmarks to orientate.
