[...] Geoffrey D. Roberts of Real Talk Reviews criticized the episode, writing that [...] "the story is thin and the laughter absent." [...] The episode sparked controversy over a depiction of the Charwoman cleaning character, a character used by Carol Burnett [...] in The Carol Burnett Show that was used in the episode without her consent. Burnett sued, but the case was later dismissed.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{running time}} for [...] "The Front" [...] was [...] "way, way short", and the writers {{had to use}} [...] "every trick in the book" [...] to make the episode reach the minimum length. Even after greatly {{expanding}} the original script and adding an extra-long couch gag during the opening sequence, the episode was still one minute too short; [...] "The Adventures of Ned Flanders" [...] was added to address the problem. The segment, which plays {{at the end of}} the episode, was designed purely as filler and had nothing to do with the other events of the episode. Showrunner Mike Reiss later commented, [...] "As always, when we try something bold and new the general reaction is, 'What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> that?'" [...] The scene was also an homage to Archie Comics, which sometimes used a similar technique to fill a final page; the font used in the scene's title card is similar to the font used by Archie. The short inspired writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein to produce the season seven episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield".|$|E
500|$|The Indians {{played against}} the New York Giants in the 1954 World Series, {{but unlike the}} 1948 Series, Feller did not make an appearance. The Indians were swept in four games by the Giants. Indians manager Al López said of not {{starting}} Feller, [...] "I know Feller wanted to start one of the games in the 1954 World Series (when the Indians were swept by the New York Giants), though we never really talked about it ... If we had won {{the first or second}} game in New York, I was going to start Feller in Cleveland in the fourth game. But when we didn't (win either game in New York), why in <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> I going to pitch Feller? He was the fifth starter on the club at that time, and wasn't the Feller he'd been (earlier in his career)." [...] In 1955, Feller spent part of the season as a starter, then was moved to the bullpen later in the season. He won and lost four games each in 25 appearances. During the offseason, he became chairman of the Ohio March of Dimes and served as player representative for the American League. He worked with National League representative Robin Roberts throughout the offseason, discussing the possibility of player arbitration and pensions with baseball owners; he then became president of the Baseball Players' Association.|$|E
500|$|Tom Hall {{chose the}} Quake engine for Anachronox; its {{developer}} John Carmack took interest {{in its use}} for a role-playing game. Ion Storm would soon switch to the id Tech 2 engine, necessitating a transition from December 1997 to March 1998. The team would implement engine support for 32-bit color, particle systems, a spline-based camera scriptor, facial deformations, and lip-synching. Facial deformation involved moving the vertices of a character's face, thereby creating emotional expressions and body language. Developers built the first models in Lightwave; the main characters had polygon counts of 500-700. By the end of 1997, Hall had scripted interaction with 130 non-player characters for 160 planned locations. Hall cited Chrono Trigger as a strong influence; previewers drew parallels with the Final Fantasy series and Ultima III. As in Chrono Trigger, battles were scripted and not caused by random, unavoidable encounters. Hall explained, [...] "if there's a dragon guarding a door, I want the chance to say, 'whoah, look at the time, gotta run', not, 'think I'll check this door. (*roaaar*) Dragon? Where <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> that?!?'" [...] The team expanded the Final Fantasy-style combat by allowing actions to be queued in advance. Hall listed some of his inspirations for Anachronox in mid-2000: [...] "In movies, some inspirational people are Spielberg, Hitchcock, George Roy Hill, Rob Reiner, and now Sam Mendes. Also {{a big fan of}} Chuck Jones, who directed Warner Brothers cartoons. Novels: Gateway, Ender's Game, Snow Crash, Hitchhiker's, so many more. Games: Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, LucasArts adventures (Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer rock), Ape Escape (buy it now), Mario, Ultima III, Wizardry I, oh, I'm sure I'm forgetting some!" [...] Hall also drew dramatic inspiration from a scene in Chrono Trigger in which the characters discuss the theme of regret around a campfire.|$|E

500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, {{there was a bit}} too much flash cutting [...] it was just like a {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1997, Warner Bros. {{approached}} cult filmmaker {{and comic}} book writer Kevin Smith, who had then just finished writing Superman Lives, to script a Green Lantern film. Smith {{turned down the}} offer, believing there were more suitable candidates to make a Green Lantern film. At one point Quentin Tarantino was offered the chance to write and direct. Warner also considered the property as an action comedy; by 2004, Robert Smigel had completed a script which was set to star Jack Black in the lead role. However, the studio dropped the comedy idea following poor fan reaction from the Internet. David S. Goyer was offered the chance to write and direct either a Green Lantern or Flash film after Warner Bros. was impressed with his screenplay for Batman Begins, but he opted to direct the latter. Actor-writer Corey Reynolds, a comic book fan of the John Stewart character, pitched Warner {{an idea for a}} trilogy, with him starring as John Stewart and performing screenwriting duties. Reynolds intended to introduce Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern Corps and Justice League in possible sequels. He finished the script for Green Lantern: Birth of a Hero in June 2007, receiving positive feedback from Warner Bros. with a potential 2010 release date. However, the studio abandoned Reynolds' concept, and in October 2007, Greg Berlanti signed to direct the film and co-write it with comic-book writers Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim. A draft of the trio's 2008 script, leaked on the Internet, revealed a story that included the hero's origin and included the characters Carol Ferris, Kilowog, Sinestro, and Guy Gardner in a cameo appearance, and appeared [...] "to set up Hector Hammond as Hal Jordan's ... first major nemesis...." [...] Shortly afterward, Guggenheim said that the script would contain characterizations inspired by the Denny O'Neil-Neal Adams run on the comic in the 1970s, and Dave Gibbons' work in the early 1980s. He added that he and his co-writers also looked to the 2000s Geoff Johns stories, saying, [...] "It’s been interesting because we finished a draft just before [...] '' [...] started up. [...] "So I’ve been reading 'Secret Origin' with a real interest in seeing 'OK, how did Geoff solve this problem?' There are certain elements just for anyone trying to retell Hal’s origin for a modern day audience has to address and grapple with. For example, why <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>was</b> Abin [...] flying in a space ship when he's a Green Lantern? You don't ask that question back in the Silver Age, but when you're writing in the Modern Age, you have to answer these things." ...|$|E

He'll do things that sound like they're going to be terribly dissonant, but when it's all put together, It's beautiful. It's actually a great sort of philosophy." ...|$|E
