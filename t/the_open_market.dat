5|$|Late 20th-century {{technical}} examination has shown {{significant differences in}} technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies {{may be the result}} of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market,</b> with the donor panel added after a patron was found.|$|E
5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. On <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had {{a better chance of}} winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E
5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E

5|$|Playing in {{the final}} year of his contract, Glencross set {{personal}} highs of 24goals and 43points in 2010–11. While the Flames received offers from other teams for Glencross at the trade deadline, the team chose to hold on to him though they risked losing him as an unrestricted free agent following the season. Glencross chose to remain in Calgary, agreeing to a four-year, $10.2million contract with the Flames on May 17, 2011. Glencross felt that he could have earned a bigger contract on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market,</b> but chose to take less money to remain in Calgary. With 26 goals in 2011–12, Glencross finished second on the team to Jarome Iginla's 32. He was the league's most efficient scorer, scoring on 23.6 percent of his shots on net.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{means of}} paying for the statue was a commemorative coin. In early 1899, the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $50,000 {{in the form of}} 100,000 commemorative half dollars, that could be sold to the public at a premium. Such a method had helped to finance (though with mixed success) the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Instead, Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3, 1899, a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50,000 silver one-dollar pieces to be granted to the commission. The bullion for the striking was to be purchased on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> and was not to come from the Mint's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act, though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904. Congress placed a ceiling on the cost of the silver at $25,000. In the event, the United States Treasury bought 38,675.875 troy ounces of silver for $23,032.80. The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E

The two {{disagreed}} on the valuation of the site, Davies offered what {{was believed to be}} the market price of GB£3.5M, Goodway demanded £14M for the relocation of Council staff. In October 1997, both the Welsh Office and Cardiff Council agreed to the District Valuer providing an independent assessment of the market value of Cardiff City Hall and the cost of staff relocating to an equivalent standard of accommodation. The District Valuer advised that <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> value of Cardiff City Hall was £3.5M. There was not enough information available for the District Valuer to make a decision. A bid of £2.5M was made by the Welsh Office on 14 November 1997, which was rejected on 21 November 1997. A final offer of £3.5M was made on 24 November and this too was rejected by Cardiff County Council. Davies later announced his decision not {{to go ahead with the}} Cardiff City Hall site for the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the REO bid to develop the site, in February 2012, Battersea Power Station was put up for sale on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> {{for the first time in}} its history.

In May 2012, several bids were received for the landmark site, which was put on the market after Nama and Lloyds Banking Group called in loans held by Treasury Holdings' Real Estate Opportunities (REO). Bids were received from Chelsea F.C. with other interested parties including a Malaysian interest, SP Setia, London & Regional, a company owned by the London-based Livingstone brothers and housebuilder Berkeley. If sold, the new owner would have to pay £500 million for the power station, including £325 million to cover the debts held by Nama and Lloyds, and a £100 million contribution to the Northern line extension. If the sale is unsuccessful, the agent would have a duty to maintain and preserve the site in line with its listed status.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{was used}} to {{decrease}} the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall-Héroult process. These two uses dominated the market {{until the middle of}} the 1990s. After the end of the nuclear arms race, the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> further reduced prices. In the mid 1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near Kings Mountain, North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market,</b> while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E

In 1989, Lasseter's growing animation department, originally composed of just four people (Lasseter, Bill Reeves, Eben Ostby, and Sam Leffler), {{was turned into a}} division that produced computer-animated commercials for outside companies. In April 1990, Pixar sold its hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar's approximately 100 employees. That same year, Pixar moved from San Rafael to Richmond, California to Burbank, California. Pixar released some of its software tools on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> for Macintosh and Windows systems. RenderMan was one of the leading 3D packages of the early 1990s, and Typestry was a special-purpose 3D text renderer that competed with RayDream addDepth.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the workhouse {{can be traced to}} the Poor Law Act of 1388, which {{attempted}} to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers, and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor. But mass unemployment following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular, and a series of bad harvests, meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable. The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse. Some Poor Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates, who generally lacked the skills or motivation to compete in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market.</b> Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones, crushing bones to produce fertiliser, or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike, perhaps the origin of the workhouse's nickname.|$|E

5|$|His seat on MGM's {{board would}} last {{less than a}} year. After the {{unexpected}} death of studio head Harry Cohn in late February 1958, Columbia's board of directors selected a committee to pursue hiring his replacement. In early April {{it was confirmed that}} Briskin {{was one of those who}} they were considering. In April 1958 Briskin resigned from MGM, in order to return to Columbia, this time as Vice President in Charge of West Coast Activities. In addition to his executive production roles, Briskin was also made one of 9 members of Fico's board of directors. Fico was a company formed with the express purpose of buying up shares of Columbia stock on <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> as a way to display confidence in the company. By the end of 1958, Briskin was Vice President and General Manager of the studio. In April 1959, Briskin announced an ambitious plan for Columbia, wherein they scheduled 99 films for release over an 18-month span, and studio head Abe Schneider (also Briskin's brother-in-law) tagged Briskin to head the program. Among the films scheduled for production during this span included Anatomy of a Murder, A Raisin in the Sun, and Suddenly, Last Summer. Also in 1959, Briskin made Glenn E. Miller Productions a Columbia affiliate, the new arm specializing film production for military and defense purposes. Something Briskin had experience in during World War II. In July, Briskin's brother, Irving, sold his independent television production company to Screen Gems, Columbia's wholly owned subsidiary. After the sale, he went back to work at Columbia, where he had been prior to forming his own company. Shortly after, Briskin, reunited with his brother, announced that he was re-integrating Screen Gems back into Columbia, and it would no longer operate as a separate entity. Under Briskin, in July 1959 production hit an all-time high at Columbia, with over $11.5 million in production at one time. In August, despite rising production costs, Briskin took the unprecedented step of lowering the fees Columbia charged independent producers under contract to the studio. In September 1959 it was announced that Briskin had been elected to Columbia's board of directors, a position he held until his death. At the same time as Briskin was being elected to Columbia's board, it was announced that his son, Jerry, would be joining him at Columbia, working in the Screen Gems division as the producer for the television series, Manhunt. In December, Briskin's contract with Columbia was up for renewal by their shareholders.|$|E

25|$|When {{a company}} lists its {{securities}} {{on a public}} exchange, the money paid by the investing public for then newly issued shares goes directly to the company (primary offering) {{as well as to}} any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings (secondary offerings) as part of the larger IPO. An IPO, therefore, allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth, repayment of debt, or working capital. A company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market</b> to price and trade their shares. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market,</b> money passes between public investors. For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the IPO process, the IPO represents an opportunity to monetize their investment. After the IPO, once shares trade in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market,</b> investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>market,</b> or sell a large block of shares directly to the public, at a fixed price, through a secondary market offering.
