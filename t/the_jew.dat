5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his wife did not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have come next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A hint of the feud between father and son {{is the fact that the}} image of Ivan Sratsimir was not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines Luther 2 ̆ 7 s {{attitudes toward}} <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> {{and seeks to}} discover the contexts which gave rise to those attitudes. An historical introduction outlines {{the relationship between the}} church and <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> until <b>the</b> sixteenth century. Christendom could not tolerate the presence of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> qua Jews in its midst; <b>the</b> only tolerable <b>Jew</b> was a Jewish convert to Christianity. An examination of Luther 2 ̆ 7 s writings reveals that Luther never changed his theological outlook toward <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b> There was, however, a change in his public attitude towards them. At first coldly theological, Luther called for better treatment of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in <b>the</b> early 15202 ̆ 7 s with the hope of converting them to evangelical Christianity. By the end of the 15202 ̆ 7 s he saw the futility of his hope and viewed <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> as a threat to Christian welfare. Luther believed that <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> committed public blasphemy by slandering Christ and everything Christian. He urged that action be taken against <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in order to curtail this blasphemous activity and to avoid the complicity of Christians in such activity. This call for action against <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> was entirely consistent with his dealings with other opponents: papists, Turks, Anabaptists, and Sacramentarians. <b>The</b> <b>Jews</b> were, for Luther, the prime example of opposition to the Gospel which all other groups imitated. Consequently, his opposition to all these groups was alike in intensity and tone; Luther treated <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in no way different than he treated all those whom he considered opponents of the Gospel. To single out his outbursts against <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> is to miss this crucial connection. The basic reason for Luther 2 ̆ 7 s call to action against <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> grew out of his pastoral concern for his people and for <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b> <b>The</b> issues of blasphemy and complicity were important because behind them lay the issue of salvation. Luther 2 ̆ 7 s first call for toleration of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> was given in the hope of their conversion to Christianity. His subsequent call for 2 ̆ 2 sharp mercy 2 ̆ 2 toward <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> was for <b>the</b> sake of the salvation of the Christians and, secondarily, with the hope that such 2 ̆ 2 sharp mercy 2 ̆ 2 might bring some Jews to faith...|$|R
