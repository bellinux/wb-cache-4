5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>in</b> {{regard to}} Wood's patent; {{the rest of}} the constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Ernest {{was staying}} with the King at Windsor Castle when severe {{disturbances}} broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland, and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the Government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with <b>the</b> <b>Irish.</b> <b>In</b> January 1829, the Wellington Government {{announced that it would}} introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London, {{and was one of the}} leaders against the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the Bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation, and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have little support in the Commons, and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.|$|E

25|$|Some {{writers have}} assumed that <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>in</b> 19th-century North America were impoverished.

Irish-born and Canadian-born Irish accumulated wealth in a similar way, and that being Irish was not an economic disadvantage by the 1890s.

25|$|In contrast, most Irish Nationalists and Fenians {{supported}} {{the abolition of}} slavery.

25|$|In 1850 {{more than}} half of the Irish were unskilled laborers. A large portion of the Saint Paul Police Department have been Irish since the 1850s. <b>The</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>in</b> Saint Paul, like those in the Eastern United States participated heavily in politics.

25|$|The {{introduction}} of column stills by the Scottish blenders in the mid-19th-century enabled increased production that the Irish, still making labour-intensive single pot still whiskey, could not compete with.

The Scottish producers won within some jurisdictions, and blends became recognised in the law of that jurisdiction as whiskey. <b>The</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>in</b> general, and Jameson in particular, continued with the traditional pot still production process for many years.|$|E

25|$|In the 1641 Rebellion, the Munster Plantation was {{temporarily}} destroyed, {{just as it}} had been during the Nine Years' War. Ten years of warfare took place in Munster between the planters and their descendants and the native Irish Catholics. But the ethnic/religious divisions were less stark in Munster than in Ulster. Some of the earlier English Planters in Munster had been Roman Catholics and their descendants largely sided with <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>in</b> the 1640s. Conversely, some Irish noblemen who had converted to Protestantism – notably Earl Inchiquin – sided with the settler community.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of baking Easter breads, {{also known as}} hot cross buns, have been documented to exist {{at least since the}} 1500s.

It is uncertain, however, how cross buns are similar to shlissel challah, other than the fact that people have always made signs or symbols on their bread.|$|E

Migration of large numbers Irish to the island continued into the 18th century.|$|E
