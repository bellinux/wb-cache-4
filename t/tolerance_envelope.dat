The controller is designed from the fuzzy interval ranges {{of the system}} parameters using an alpha-cut methodology. Indeed, for a given alpha-cut of the fuzzy system parameters representing an uncertainty level, the control objective {{can be viewed as}} maintaining the system output within a <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope,</b> around the exact trajectory, specified by the degree of preference on the fuzzy trajectory. The stability is ensured {{in the way that the}} controller restricts the system output divergence within the <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope.</b> The validity of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation examples...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the fault}} {{tolerant}} {{capabilities of the}} neural aided sliding mode controller for autolanding under actuator failures and severe winds developed earlier are improved significantly by incorporating a novel anti-windup strategy and a phase compensation scheme. This controller further increases {{the size of the}} fault <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope</b> for various types of control surface stuck faults and provides complete coverage at every point within the envelope boundaries. Earlier work by the authors showed the existence of a neural-aided sliding mode controller which could handle a wide range of actuator stuck faults. One of the major drawbacks of this earlier controller {{is that it does not}} ensure that all points within the range of minimum and maximum bounds of the fault <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope</b> are covered. The anti-windup proposed in this paper is a generalization of the scheme used for proportional derivative-integral controllers to the cascaded trajectory following controllers designed by the authors. This scheme can handle requirements of state limiting as well as multiple redundant control surface saturation. The proposed anti-wind up design is a simplification over the command filter approach used for adaptive backstepping. The approach is demonstrated for a fixed-wing aircraft undergoing unknown actuator stuck failures and subject to severe wind disturbances during autolanding. An example of three control surface failures (both ailerons and rudder) handled by this controller is also presented...|$|E

Space mission systems are necessarily compact and must minimize shielding and distance to enhance system level efficiencies. Technology development efforts to support fission power generation scenarios for future space missions include studying the radiation tolerance of component materials. The fundamental principles of material magnetism are reviewed {{and used to}} interpret existing material radiation effects data for expected fission power conversion components for target space missions. Suitable materials for the Fission Power System (FPS) Project are available and guidelines are presented for bounding the elevated temperature/radiation <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope</b> for candidate magnetic materials...|$|E

By predicting future levels of factors such as temperature, rainfall, and salinity, new range boundaries are then predicted. These methods are good for examining large numbers of species, but are likely not a good means of predicting effects at fine scales.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{assessed}} {{the capability of}} various neural-aided classical feedback controllers that have been designed for autolanding of a typical modern high performance fighter aircraft under unknown actuator failures and external wind disturbances. Analysis of the fault <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelopes</b> of these neural-aided controllers revealed that position and rate saturation of the healthy actuators resulted in loss of control and failure to complete the autolanding task. Therefore, the over-all fault-tolerance region was not simply connected and exhibited gaps. In this paper we have successfully overcome the problem of gaps in the fault-tolerance envelope of the basic feedback controller by a judicious choice of feedback variables and developing a strategy for optimal gain selection to enlarge the failure <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelopes</b> {{in the presence of}} severe winds. The controller is motivated by Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) approach and is able to handle six different types of single / double control surface failures. This is achieved by exploiting the full capability of control allocation inherent in the redundant control surfaces. The autolanding controller discussed in this paper is the most robust controller designed so far for the benchmark autolanding problem chosen for study...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{how to do}} stability analysis, variation simulation and <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelopes</b> for deformable cables and hoses. In this way, the well-established methods for analyzing and minimizing the propagation of geometric variation are extended from rigid and sheet metal assemblies to large deformations of slender parts. This extension is highly motivated, not at least, by the increased amount of cables and hoses in electrified and hybrid solutions in the automotive industry. To secure the geometric correctness of the analysis, we use a nonlinear rod approach {{in the implementation of}} a simulation model of flexible cables that accounts for large deformations and supports a wide range of common cable clip types, cable joints and branches. A selection of measures and visualizations that reflect the spatial effects of geometric variation in deformable cables is incorporated in established variation analysis techniques. In particular, the concept of <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelopes</b> for rigid parts has been extended to also handle system of slender parts such as cables and hoses. This article extends previous research on robust design and variation simulation to cables subject to large deformations and has been successfully applied on two typical industrial cases: a wiring harness attached with various types of clips to a static surrounding and a cooler hose subjected to a high-frequency sampled engine motion...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} {{if presented}} for {{the synthesis of}} sculptured surface models subject to several functional design constraints. A design environment is specified {{as a collection of}} polyhedral models which represent components {{in the vicinity of the}} design surface, or regions which the surface should avoid. The primary functional constraint is formulated as a proximity penalty function such that the design surface is induced to avoid a <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope</b> around each component. In addition, a constraint based on surface area is formulated to counteract the expansion effect of the proximity constraint. Secondary design constraints are formulated to maintain consistent surface topology, and exploit part symmetry. Surface synthesis is thus formulated as an optimization problem and solved via simulated annealing. Several example applications are presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the technique...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for modeling parametric variation in planar parts and for efficiently computing approximations of their tolerance envelopes. Part features are specified by algebraic equations defining their position and shape {{as a function of}} parameters whose nominal values vary along tolerance intervals. Their tolerance envelopes model perfect form Least and Most Material Conditions (LMC/MMC). We derive geometric properties of the tolerance envelopes and describe efficient algorithms for computing first-order linear approximations with successive accuracy. We show that the <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope</b> of a parametric arc-line polygonal part with features has segments and can be computed in is the maximum number of non-zero partial feature functions derivatives evaluated at nominal parameter values. Our implementation shows that the algorithms are practical on part models with tens of parameters. Keywords: parametric models, tolerance envelopes, LMC and MMC boundaries 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a framework and algorithms for robust kinematic design of mechanical assemblies. The framework, developed {{over a period}} of ten years, is based on the configuration space method and supports automatic modeling, nominal and toleranced analysis, and part <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope</b> computation of open and closed loop planar mechanisms with multiple, changing contacts. It also supports nominal and toleranced kinematic synthesis of planar pairs based on a parametric part model. The tools help designers select nominal parameter values, identify failure modes, and optimize nominal values and tolerance allocation. We illustrate the concept of robust design with a realistic design scenario and show how our tools support the kinematic design process. We briefly describe the configuration space approach and the algorithms we have developed for nominal and toleranced kinematic mechanism analysis, tolerance parts envelopes computation, and robust kinematic synthesis of higher pairs. 1...|$|E
40|$|Using {{sophisticated}} microscopy techniques, {{we observed}} the spatial pattern of bacteria colonizing a sterile 316 L stainless steel coupon as bulk water containing bacteria flowed across the coupon. The experiments used stainless steel of differing roughness and surface chemistry. The ultimate {{goal was to}} identify surface features which influence bacterial adsorption. The immediate statistical goal was to distinguish patterns consistent with complete spatial randomness from patterns showing regularity or aggregation. This goal was accomplished by using modified analyses of distance functions commonly applied in field ecology. The method protected against a potential multiple comparisons problem. For the null value of the distance function, we calculated <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelopes</b> such that the tolerance level was simultaneous for all distances of concern. Computer simulation experiments showed that the nominal level was accurate. The methodology was effective for detecting and describing patterns of colonization known not to be completely spatially random...|$|R
40|$|We inoculated {{susceptible}} chicken embryos {{with the}} endogenous avian leukosis virus Rous-associated virus- 0 (RAV- 0) on day 6 of incubation. At 1 week after hatching, RAV- 0 -infected and control chickens were inoculated with either RAV- 1 or RAV- 2, exogenous viruses belonging to subgroups A and B, respectively. The chickens injected with RAV- 0 as embryos remained viremic with exogenous virus longer and either failed to develop type-specific humoral immunity to exogenous virus or developed it {{later than the}} control chickens not inoculated with RAV- 0. The RAV- 0 -injected chickens also developed neoplasms {{at a much higher}} frequency than did the control chickens. We suggest that the lower immune responses of the RAV- 0 -injected chickens were due to an immunological <b>tolerance</b> to <b>envelope</b> group-specific glycoproteins shared among endogenous and exogenous viruses...|$|R

The process according to the invention {{is characterized by the}} fact that the path travelled z and the total path z of the joint part are calculated from the defined use of energy W<-i of the process tool per pulse or per impact, and the presetting of the tolerance ranges for the process operation takes place at the start of the process on basis of actual measured path per impact z<-act in such a way that, during the jointing process, <b>tolerance</b> bands (<b>envelopes)</b> are generated, whereby the measured values must lie within the relevant tolerance band to obtain a fault-free process, and that, in the case of failure, a fault strategy dependent on the concrete failure case is applied...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{a technique}} for {{the synthesis of}} sculptured surface models subject to several constraints based on design and manufacturability requirements is presented. A design environment is specified {{as a collection of}} polyhedral models which represent components {{in the vicinity of the}} surface to be designed, or regions which the surface should avoid. Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) are used for surface representation, and the control point locations are the design variables. For some problems the NURBS surface knots and/or weights are included as additional design variables. The primary functional constraint is a proximity metric which induces the surface to avoid a <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope</b> around each component. Other functional constraints include: an area/arc-length constraint to counteract the expansion effect of the proximity constraint, orthogonality and parametric flow constraints (to maintain consistent surface topology and improve machinability of the surface), and local constraints on surface derivatives to exploit part symmetry. In addition, constraints based on surface curvatures may be incorporated to enhance machinability and induce the synthesis of developable surfaces;The surface synthesis problem is formulated as an optimization problem. Traditional optimization techniques such as quasi-Newton, Nelder-Mead simplex and conjugate gradient, yield only 2 ̆ 2 locally 2 ̆ 2 good surface models. Consequently, simulated annealing (SA), a global optimization technique is implemented. SA successfully synthesizes several highly multimodal surface models where the traditional optimization methods failed. Results indicate that this technique has potential applications as a conceptual design tool supporting concurrent product and process development methods...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic marine ectotherms {{look back}} on several million years of {{adaptation}} to constant extreme cold temperatures. Most endemic species are cold stenothermal, with low and not thermally compensated metabolic rates, low scope for routine activity and a narrow thermal <b>tolerance</b> <b>envelope</b> (Peck 2002, Polar Biol. 25, 31 - 40, for rev.). Their being prey to warm blooded top predators creates a need for temperature compensation of burst swimming in polar fishes. Hence, their scope for exercise activity is well comparable to temperate fish (for rev. see Pörtner 2002, J. Exp. Biol. 205, 2217 - 2230). We have recently reviewed antioxidant capacity in polar and temperate ectotherms (Abele & Puntarulo 2004, CBPA in press) and found a mismatch between thermally slowed standard and routine metabolism and a well compensated antioxidant system in polar invertebrates and fish. This does not only apply to enzymatic antioxidant capacities (SOD, catalase, glutathione peroxidase), but, more importantly, polar animals display far higher glutathione and &# 945;-tocopherol tissues concentrations. As oxygen radical formation is largely a function of metabolic activity, the question arises what creates the elevated need for antioxidant protection in cold blooded polar animals?Mechanisms of accelerated ROS production could be rooted {{in a loss of}} oxygen buffering by low or absent oxygen binding pigments, and also in higher lipid unsaturation in the cold. Moreover, the fraction of oxygen converted to ROS in mitochondria from polar bivalves is higher than in temperate bivalve mitochondria. Several features, like slow oxygen diffusion and low myoglobin oxygen buffering in muscle of Antarctic ectotherms at habitat temperatures, indicate higher oxidative stress may accompany fatiguing exercise in polar fauna, if compared to similar temperate speciesIn our presentation we will summarize current knowledge to model the mismatch between thermally suppressed routine metabolism and compensated burst activity, as one potential cause of elevated ROS production and the need for sustained high levels of antioxidant defence in polar ectotherms...|$|E
40|$|The JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) is {{designed}} to meet the JWST science requirements for mid-IR capabilities and includes an Imager MIRIM provided by CEA (France). A double-prism assembly (DPA) allows MIRIM to perform low-resolution spectroscopy. The MIRIM DPA shall meet a number of challenging requirements in terms of optical and mechanical constraints, especially severe optical <b>tolerances,</b> limited <b>envelope</b> and very high vibration loads. The University of Cologne (Germany) and the Centre Spatial de Liege (Belgium) are responsible for design, manufacturing, integration, and testing of the prism assembly. A companion paper (Fischer et al. 2008) is presenting the science drivers and mechanical design of the DPA, while this paper is focusing on optical manufacturing and overall verification processes. The first part of this paper describes the manufacturing of Zinc-sulphide and Germanium prisms and techniques to ensure an accurate positioning of the prisms in their holder. (1) The delicate manufacturing of Ge and ZnS materials and (2) the severe specifications on the bearing and optical surfaces flatness and the tolerance on the prism optical angles make this process innovating. The specifications verification is carried out using mechanical and optical measurements; the implemented techniques are described in this paper. The second part concerns the qualification program of the double-prism assembly, including the prisms, the holder and the prisms anti-reflective coatings qualification.

40|$|Background: Multidrug {{resistant}} Klebsiella pneumoniae {{have caused}} major therapeutic problems worldwide {{due to the}} emergence of the extended-spectrum b-lactamase producing strains. Although there are. 10 major facilitator super family (MFS) efflux pumps annotated in the genome sequence of the K. pneumoniae bacillus, apparently less is known about their physiological relevance. Principal Findings: Insertional inactivation of kpnGH resulting in increased susceptibility to antibiotics such as azithromycin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, ertapenem, erythromycin, gentamicin, imipenem, ticarcillin, norfloxacin, polymyxin-B, piperacillin, spectinomycin, tobramycin and streptomycin, including dyes and detergents such as ethidium bromide, acriflavine, deoxycholate, sodium dodecyl sulphate, and disinfectants benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and triclosan signifies the wide substrate specificity of the transporter in K. pneumoniae. Growth inactivation and direct fluorimetric efflux assays provide evidence that kpnGH mediates antimicrobial resistance by active extrusion in K. pneumoniae. The kpnGH isogenic mutant displayed decreased <b>tolerance</b> to cell <b>envelope</b> stressors emphasizing its added role in K. pneumoniae physiology. Conclusions and Significance: The MFS efflux pump KpnGH involves in crucial physiological functions besides being an intrinsic resistance determinant in K. pneumoniae...|$|R
40|$|The Department of Production and Industrial Administration of The College of Aeronautics {{has made}} a {{detailed}} analysis into the performance of numerically controlled machine tools, and this shows that when these machines are operating under light cutting loads, the total <b>envelope</b> <b>tolerance</b> is about 0. 003 ins. Further investigation into {{the source of the}} errors showed that about 80 per cent of this error was due to mechanical mechanisms in the machine tool. The electronic equipment operated inside a total band of 0. 0004 ins. over small distances, and 0. 0006 ins. over 10 inches. This situation appeared to justify a comprehensive survey into the methods which may be used to improve the mechanical performance of these machines. After due consideration had been given to a number of possible alternatives, it was decided to fit hydrostatic lubrication to the slides, nut and screw arrangement, and the thrust bearings used on the X and Y axes of an existing No. 3 Archdale Milling Machine. The Z axis {{was not included in the}} redesign, because analysis showed that a new head casting would have been necessary. It was thought that this additional expense was not justified and that the data obtained from an examination of the performance given by the X and Y axes would show whether the system could be used with advantage in the design of new machines. The paper gives details of the calculations used to establish the dimensions of the new features fitted to the machine to satisfy the target performance conditions which appeared to be possible and are given in the introduction.
