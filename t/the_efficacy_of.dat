40|$|Many links {{exist between}} cocaine abuse and stress. The {{literature}} and laboratory studies in rats {{suggest that this}} could be because stress increases <b>the</b> reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> cocaine. Using male Long-Evans rats, experiments in this thesis tested effects of footshock on <b>the</b> reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> cocaine using a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. They also examined effects of footshock on <b>the</b> reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> a half-maximal dose of cocaine. Finally, they tested the effects of footshock on cocaine self-administration in rats initially resistant to acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Footshock did not increase reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> cocaine on a PR schedule of reinforcement, nor did it enhance sensitivity to a half-maximal dose of cocaine. Footshock did, however, cause acquisition of cocaine self-administration in acquisition-resistant rats. Therefore, while footshock stress may be capable of sensitizing acquisition-resistant rats to <b>the</b> reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> cocaine, it does not appear that it significantly increases <b>the</b> reinforcing <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> cocaine in rats with a history of cocaine self-administration...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare <b>the</b> <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> {{ethylene}} oxide gas (EOG), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (PLASMA), and low-temperature steam formaldehyde (LTSF) sterilization methods.

PLAS-MA failed to adequately sterilize materials on multiple trials in several experiments, including two of three plates, two of three instruments, and all process challenge devices.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> {{chemical}} pesticides {{tends to}} diminish over time. This is because any organism that manages {{to survive the}} initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this way, {{some of the most}} serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E
