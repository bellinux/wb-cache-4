5000|$|The {{abstract}} of a 2012 meta-analysis by Credé and Niehorster (k = 237, N = 44,668) reads: [...] "The review, {{based on}} studies using the Student Adaptation <b>to</b> <b>College</b> Questionnaire, is organized around three primary themes: (1) {{the structure of}} students’ adjustment <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> (2) the relationship of adjustment <b>to</b> <b>college</b> constructs with possible antecedents and correlates, and (3) the relationship of adjustment <b>to</b> <b>college</b> constructs with college grades and college retention. Meta-analytic results indicate that adjustment <b>to</b> <b>college</b> is multidimensional, predictive of college grades, and an unusually good predictor of <b>college</b> retention. Adjustment <b>to</b> <b>college</b> is also shown to be moderately related to individual traits, social support, and students’ relationships with their parents. Weaker relationships are evident with demographic variables, prior achievement, coping approaches, and variables that reflect students’ psychological independence from their parents. Theoretical and practical implications {{for the study of}} students’ adjustment <b>to</b> <b>college,</b> academic performance, and retention are discussed." ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{research}} has established several factors related <b>to</b> <b>college</b> adjustment in traditional college students (e. g., self-esteem, perfectionism, family environment), {{few studies have}} examined whether these factors also relate <b>to</b> <b>college</b> adjustment in non-traditional students. The present study examined whether the factors related to academic and emotional adjustment <b>to</b> <b>college</b> differed between traditional and nontraditional college students. Three hundred thirteen college students (78 % traditional; 22 % non-traditional) completed the almost perfect scale revised, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, the Student Adaptation <b>to</b> <b>College</b> Questionnaire, and the family environment scale. Non-traditional college students displayed significantly greater academic and emotional adjustment <b>to</b> <b>college</b> than did traditional college students. Academic adjustment was related to self-esteem in both groups; in addition, perfectionism related to academic adjustment in traditional students. Emotional adjustment related to self-esteem and independence in both groups; in addition, emotional adjustment related to achievement motivation and organizational skills in non-traditional students and discrepancy between self and ideal in traditional students. College administrators may wish to emphasize different factors for these two groups when discussing adaptation <b>to</b> <b>college</b> during orientation sessions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{highlights}} {{the relationships between}} learning and study strategies with student adaptation <b>to</b> <b>college.</b> Postsecondary students (n = 146) completed a demographic questionnaire, the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI), and the Student Adaptation <b>to</b> <b>College</b> Questionnaire (SACQ). Students were trifurcated into low, average, and high achieving groups by GPA. Data was analyzed using multiple regression and correlational techniques. LASSI subscales significantly predicted adaptation <b>to</b> <b>college</b> {{as measured by the}} SACQ for average and high achieving students, but did not significantly predict adaptation <b>to</b> <b>college</b> for low achieving students. The unique contributions of the LASSI subtests varied in the two significant predictions. Anxiety and attitude significantly contributed to the prediction of adaptation <b>to</b> <b>college</b> for average achieving students. Anxiety was the only significant contributor for high achieving students. Upon further exploration, anxiety was found to influence distinct facets of student adaptation <b>to</b> <b>college</b> depending on level of student achievement. Anxiety correlated significantly with personal-emotional adjustment for average achieving students. For high achieving students, anxiety significantly correlated with all four dimensions of student adaptatio...|$|R
