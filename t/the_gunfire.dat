5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about <b>the</b> <b>gunfire</b> and whether he knew its source. He {{said he had not}} been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E
5|$|Shabazz {{was in the}} {{audience}} near the stage with her daughters. When she heard <b>the</b> <b>gunfire,</b> she grabbed the children and pushed them to the floor beneath the bench, where she shielded them with her body. When the shooting stopped, Shabazz ran toward her husband and tried to perform CPR. Police officers and MalcolmX's associates used a stretcher to carry him up the block to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.|$|E

5|$|Swiftsure {{had taken}} {{significant}} damage to its masts, rigging and sails during {{the exchange of}} fire, a deliberate ploy by the French captains to limit the ship's movement and prevent its escape. This had minimised casualties on deck by distracting <b>the</b> <b>gunfire,</b> {{and as a result}} only two men were killed and eight wounded, two of whom subsequently also died. French losses were more severe, with four casualties on Indivisible and six killed and 23 wounded on Dix-Août, although neither ship was significantly damaged in the action.|$|E
5|$|About {{ten minutes}} after the surrender, Pritchard heard rapid gunfire to the north. He left Davis and the {{captured}} men {{in the hands of}} his 21-year-old adjutant. Once he had approached <b>the</b> <b>gunfire,</b> he realized it was the 4th Michigan and the 1st Wisconsin shooting at each other with Spencer repeating carbines, neither realizing who they were shooting at. Pritchard immediately ordered his men to stop and shouted to the 1st Wisconsin to identify the parties. In the five-minute skirmish, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry had suffered eight men wounded, while the 4th Michigan Cavalry had lost two men killed and one wounded.|$|E
5|$|Around 17 hours later, {{the plane}} loses {{auxiliary}} power, {{and the lights}} go out inside. Despite Neerja and the other attendants' attempts to explain, the terrorists assume the Pakistanis cut the power deliberately, and anticipate an imminent Pakistani raid on the plane. The panicking hijackers begin shooting down passengers indiscriminately; at great peril to her own life, Neerja opens the rear door and deploys the chute, directing passengers out of the plane. Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from <b>the</b> <b>gunfire.</b> The film ends with a tribute to Neerja, who was eventually honoured posthumously with the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest military decoration awarded for peacetime valor, courageous action or self-sacrifice.|$|E
50|$|SAS elements, then {{embarked}} on HMS Hermes, were tasked with eliminating the threat, with naval {{support from the}} Type 22 frigate HMS Broadsword as Hermes defensive escort and the County class destroyer HMS Glamorgan to provide naval gunfire support with its Mark 6 4.5 inch guns. <b>The</b> Naval <b>Gunfire</b> Support Forward Observer (NGSFO) {{who was responsible for}} co-ordinating <b>the</b> naval <b>gunfire</b> support was Captain Chris Brown RA of 148 Battery 29 Commando Regiment Royal Artillery.|$|R

5|$|Maryland steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to the 7th Fleet under Admiral Kinkaid. The fleet sortied 12 October and Maryland joined Task Group 77.2, which was <b>the</b> <b>gunfire</b> and covering force for the invasion of Leyte. She, along with four other battleships and numerous cruisers and destroyers, steamed into Leyte Gulf on the morning of 18 October. Maryland took position between Red and White Beaches and began bombarding them ahead of the invasion, which began at 10:00 20 October. Securing the beaches quickly, Maryland then took up a sentinel position in Leyte Gulf to guard the beaches against Japanese counterattack by sea.|$|E
5|$|McCausland's Brigade was on {{the south}} side of the South Branch of the Potomac River. The 14th Virginia Cavalry, {{commanded}} by Captain Edwin E. Bouldin, was the portion of McCausland's Brigade camped closest to the ford where the road crossed the river. Bouldin faced a mob of men crossing the river that consisted of a mix of Union and Confederate soldiers. For a short while, he was able to slow down Gibson's Brigade—which was becoming scattered and disorganized. After hearing <b>the</b> <b>gunfire,</b> Lieutenant Colonel John T. Radford ordered the 22nd Virginia Cavalry into the fray. Radford's cavalry rode to the west side of the 14th Virginia, and joined the fight.|$|E
50|$|Early {{the next}} day, U-198 located the British steam {{merchantman}} Leana.

5|$|On 8February 1913, the Ottoman navy {{supported}} an {{amphibious assault}} at Şarköy. Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin, {{along with two}} small cruisers provided artillery support to the right flank of the invading force once it went ashore. The ships were positioned about a kilometer off shore; Turgut Reis was the second ship in the line, behind her sister Barbaros Hayreddin. The Bulgarian army resisted fiercely, which ultimately forced the Ottoman army to retreat, though the withdrawal was successful in large part due to <b>the</b> <b>gunfire</b> support from Turgut Reis {{and the rest of}} the fleet. During the battle, Turgut Reis fired 225rounds from her 10.5cm guns and 202 shells from her 8.8cm guns.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{conducted}} by South Vietnamese Regional Force troops on Phu Quoc Island in September were assisted by Market Time assets. Point Partridge and Point Banks assisted with naval gunfire support on 9 September which destroyed three bunkers, killing four and wounding several others. Ten Viet Cong were captured. On 20 September, Point Cypress and RVN MSC-116 assisted Regional Forces troops {{that had been}} ambushed by Viet Cong forces by lending naval gunfire support. Point Hudson, , and U.S. Navy PCF-50 and PCF-3 arrived shortly after the action started and joined in <b>the</b> <b>gunfire</b> support. Small boats from the cutters helped evacuate wounded Regional Force troops.|$|E

She was hit by accidental gunfire eight days later. <b>The</b> <b>gunfire</b> hit her superstructure, and caused 69 casualties (18 killed, 51 wounded). After a few repairs at the island of Ulithi, she joined in the pre-invasion shelling group for the invasion of Okinawa at Kerama Retto. She stayed at Okinawa until 22 May, providing anti-aircraft cover and fire support for the invasion troops. On 6 August, she {{returned to}} the occupied Okinawa to sail to Japan for its occupation. On 27 August, she covered the airborne occupation of Atsugi Airfield.|$|E

Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the island}} of Iwo Jima was not {{declared}} to be captured until 16 March, Texas departed from the Volcano Islands on 7 March, and returned to Ulithi Atoll {{to prepare for the}} invasion of Okinawa (Operation Iceberg). She departed from Ulithi with Task Force 54, <b>the</b> <b>gunfire</b> support unit, on 21 March, and arrived in the Ryukyu Islands on the 26th. Texas moved in close to Okinawa and began her prelanding bombardment that same day. For the next six days, she fired multiple salvos from her main guns to prepare the way for several Army and Marine divisions to make their amphibious landings on 1 April.|$|E
5|$|Trapped {{refugees}} began {{piling up}} bodies as barricades {{and tried to}} dig into the ground to hide. Some managed to escape that first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. By the second day, <b>the</b> <b>gunfire</b> was reduced to potshots and occasional fusillades when a trapped refugee moved or tried to escape. Some also recall planes returning that second day to fire rockets or drop bombs. Racked with thirst, survivors resorted to drinking blood-filled water from a small stream running under the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Later {{analysis}} of naval support during the pre-landing phase {{concluded that the}} navy had provided inadequate bombardment, given the size and extent of the planned assault. Kenneth P. Lord, a U.S. Army planner for the D-Day invasion, says that, upon hearing <b>the</b> naval <b>gunfire</b> support plan for Omaha, which limited support to one battleship, two cruisers and six destroyers, he and other planners were very upset—especially in light of <b>the</b> tremendous naval <b>gunfire</b> support given to landings in the Pacific.|$|R

5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location. They said that it came from behind thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined <b>the</b> <b>gunfire</b> came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the debate}} at large traces its roots {{back to the}} end of World War II, the current debate began in 1992 with the {{retirement}} of the last active Iowa-class battleship, , {{as a result of the}} reduced demand for naval artillery, the rise of ship and submarine-launched missiles and aircraft-launched precision guided munitions (such as laser-guided bombs, which can accurately strike and destroy an enemy target with a single strike). The most striking point of the debate in the United States centers on battleships: owing to the longtime maintenance and upkeep that the four completed Iowa-class battleships have undergone during their time in the navy's active and mothball fleets, many still view battleships as viable solutions for gunfire support, and these members have questioned if the navy can adequately replace <b>the</b> <b>gunfire</b> support provided by a battleship's main guns with the smaller guns on its current fleet of cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
5|$|At 14:00 on 8 February, {{four days}} after leaving the Îles des Saintes, Junon was spotted passing close to the Virgin Islands by the small British brigs HMS Superieure and , who signalled the {{approaching}} ship to halt and prepare for boarding. Ignoring the orders from the smaller ships, Rousseau continued northwards, passing through the Virgin Islands closely followed by Superieure, although Asp was unable to keep up and fell far behind during the night. At 08:00 {{on the morning of}} 9 February, with Virgin Gorda northwest, Superieure was close enough to open fire, a few long range shots failing to damage the large frigate, which responded with an ineffective broadside. <b>The</b> <b>gunfire</b> attracted other ships, and during the afternoon Superieure was joined by the British frigate HMS Latona, under Captain Hugh Pigot.|$|E
