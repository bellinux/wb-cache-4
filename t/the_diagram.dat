5|$|The Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year, {{originally}} {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Diagram</b> Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, {{commonly known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Diagram</b> Prize for short, is a humorous literary award that is given annually to a book with an unusual title. The prize is named after <b>the</b> <b>Diagram</b> Group, an information and graphics company based in London, and The Bookseller, a British trade magazine for the publishing industry. Originally organised to provide entertainment during the 1978 Frankfurt Book Fair, the prize has since been awarded every year by The Bookseller and is now organised by the magazine's diarist Horace Bent. The winner was initially decided {{by a panel of}} judges, but since 2000 the winner has been decided by a public vote on The Bookseller′s website.|$|E

5|$|Also, Newton {{describes}} QR as the {{versed sine}} of the arc with P at its centre and length twice QP. Although {{this is not}} strictly {{the same as the}} QR that he has in <b>the</b> <b>diagram</b> (Fig.1), in the limit, they become equal.|$|E
5|$|As can be {{seen from}} <b>the</b> <b>diagram,</b> the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor. After overcoming the manufacturing challenges posed by the curved refractor panels and the cabinet legs, the speaker entered production in late 1957.|$|E
5|$|As {{regards the}} line of battle, we are given a little {{information}} by Ammianus. He reports that the right flanks of each line, front and reserve, were held by two auxilia regiments and {{the centre of the}} reserve line was held by the Primani legion. A possible order of battle that fits the available evidence is shown in <b>the</b> <b>diagram</b> of the battle.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} parameters in <b>the</b> collapse <b>diagrams</b> is <b>the</b> selected accelerograms to analyze the structure. As it was seen in <b>the</b> IDA <b>diagrams,</b> <b>the</b> structure shows hardening behavior to some accelerograms and softening behavior to some others and thus it possible for the accelerogram to be selected in such away that all or most of them have stiffening behavior which makes <b>the</b> resulted collapse <b>diagram</b> to show a low collapse probability. In contrast, the accelerograms can be selected {{in such a way that}} <b>the</b> <b>diagrams</b> display softening behavior and <b>the</b> resulted collapse <b>diagram</b> show a high collapse probability. Thus the selection of the accelerograms affects <b>the</b> collapse <b>diagrams</b> and <b>the</b> acquired collapse <b>diagrams</b> here in are based on the accelerograms used in this study.|$|R
5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in <b>the</b> <b>diagram,</b> {{this structure}} {{is below the}} optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs are {{generally}} regarded {{members of the}} Lophotrochozoa, a group defined by having trochophore larvae and, {{in the case of}} living Lophophorata, a feeding structure called a lophophore. The other members of the Lophotrochozoa are the annelid worms and seven marine phyla. <b>The</b> <b>diagram</b> on the right summarizes a phylogeny presented in 2007.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diagram</b> {{shows an}} example checkmate position. The white king is {{threatened}} by the black queen; the square to which the king could move is also threatened; it cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by the rook.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{provide an}} {{effective}} way to organize and visualize the various terms in the perturbation series, and they naturally account for the flow of electrons and photons during the scattering process. External lines in <b>the</b> <b>diagrams</b> represent incoming and outgoing particles, internal lines are connected with virtual particles and vertices with interactions. Each of these graphical elements is associated with mathematical expressions that contribute to the amplitude of the respective process. <b>The</b> <b>diagrams</b> are part of Feynman's very efficient and elegant algorithm for computing the probability of scattering processes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Wireless {{networks}} {{have a lot}} of geometric properties since the signal strength corresponds directly to the distance. Earlier research findings in geometry, such as Voronoi diagram, have found a lot of applications in wireless networks. In this paper, a new geometric diagram, referred to as <b>the</b> umbrella <b>diagram,</b> is proposed. <b>The</b> umbrella <b>diagram</b> is comparable to <b>the</b> Voronoi <b>diagram.</b> <b>The</b> Voronoi <b>diagram</b> deals with a set of points, whereas <b>the</b> umbrella <b>diagram</b> deals with a set of different networks. <b>The</b> umbrella <b>diagram</b> of a set of hexagonal networks is to divide the plane into regions such that the points in a region have a larger distance to one network than to the other networks. Unlike <b>the</b> Voronoi <b>diagram,</b> <b>the</b> regions in <b>the</b> umbrella <b>diagram</b> are not necessarily convex. The paper gives an efficient solution to compute <b>the</b> umbrella <b>diagram</b> of n networks with the same cell size and orientation. Like <b>the</b> Voronoi <b>diagram,</b> <b>the</b> umbrella <b>diagram</b> has potential to be used in many areas. To illustrate its usefulness, the paper further gives two applications in wireless networks: the optimal network deployment and the maximum base station reuse. The optimal network deployment intends to find the best position to fix the network such that the network is closest to all existing base stations. The maximum base station reuse problem is to maximize the number of base stations that can be reused under a given bound...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{analyses}} some management tools on {{the level}} of the team as: <b>the</b> „tree ” <b>diagram,</b> <b>the</b> matrix <b>diagram</b> and <b>the</b> priority matrix. The study of this diagram is focused on the practical aspects of <b>the</b> <b>diagrams</b> and <b>the</b> analysis of the conditions of use in some branch of activity. At the same time some useful tools are pointed out for the practical activity. The problem of the study also deals with <b>the</b> matrix <b>diagram.</b> This tool allows the individuals from the team to identify and clarify the relations between two or more variables. The information is presented in a table and can be subjective or objective, with symbols with or without numerical values. There are four implementation criteria as one can see in {{the upper part of the}} matrix. The priority matrix is the most difficult of the management tools. This study analyses some management tools {{on the level}} of the team as: <b>the</b> „tree ” <b>diagram,</b> <b>the</b> matrix <b>diagram</b> and <b>the</b> priority matrix.

50|$|Like <b>the</b> Voronoi <b>diagram,</b> <b>the</b> power <b>diagram</b> may be {{generalized}} to Euclidean spaces of any dimension. <b>The</b> power <b>diagram</b> of n spheres in d dimensions is combinatorially equivalent to the intersection {{of a set of}} n upward-facing halfspaces in d + 1 dimensions, and vice versa.|$|R
5|$|A Penrose tiling is {{an example}} of non-periodic tiling {{generated}} by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir Roger Penrose, who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry, as in <b>the</b> <b>diagram</b> at the right.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the award}} {{was created by}} The Bookseller, {{the idea of an}} award celebrating books with odd titles was {{proposed}} by Trevor Bounford of <b>the</b> <b>Diagram</b> Group in order to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978. Originally known as <b>the</b> <b>Diagram</b> Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for The Bookseller, took over administrative duties. Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given {{due to a lack of}} odd titles, The Bookseller opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by Bent. In 2009, online submissions sent on Twitter were accepted. This resulted in the highest number of submissions for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), almost three times the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance at people who gave submissions that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880. The 2014 prize allowed nominations from self-published works, the first book being Strangers Have the Best Candy by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All the irregular moons are probably captured objects that were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. <b>The</b> <b>diagram</b> illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E

5|$|By convention, {{the game}} pieces {{are divided into}} white and black sets, and the players are {{referred}} to as White and Black respectively. Each player begins the game with 16 pieces of the specified color, which consist of one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set out as shown in <b>the</b> <b>diagram</b> and photo, with each queen on a square of its own color, the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.|$|E
5|$|For example, in <b>the</b> <b>diagram</b> on the right, {{after the}} natural but mistaken 10...0-0?! White can {{immediately}} realise his strategic goal with 11.c5! Then if Black accepts the temporary sacrifice after 11...Qxc5 12.Rc1 Qd6 13.Qxd6 cxd6 14.Rd1 White gets his pawn back and {{has created a}} weak pawn in d7, while if Black declines the pawn he has difficulties in developing his queenside (for example 11...d6 might be followed by 12.cxd6 Qxd6 13.Qxd6 cxd6 and the pawn on d6 is weak). Therefore Black generally tries to hinder the c4–c5 push with moves like d7–d6, b7–b6 or Rf8–d8 (if this creates a hidden vis-à-vis between the Rd8 and the Qd2).|$|E
5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 unit vector may be {{considered}} the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See the upper right corner of <b>the</b> <b>diagram</b> at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing {{the sum of the}} vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In <b>the</b> <b>diagram</b> at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>diagram</b> {{makes clear}} that the power set is a graded poset. <b>The</b> second <b>diagram</b> has <b>the</b> same graded structure, but by making some edges longer than others, it {{emphasizes}} that the 4-dimensional cube is a union of two 3-dimensional cubes. <b>The</b> third <b>diagram</b> shows some of the internal symmetry of the structure. In <b>the</b> fourth <b>diagram</b> <b>the</b> vertices are arranged like {{the elements of a}} 4×4 matrix.|$|R
40|$|In human {{reasoning}} and multi-modal information processing, <b>the</b> <b>diagrams</b> offer a visual clarity in examining spatial constraints. Special diagrams like transitions maps are introduced for assisting {{the elaboration of}} operational procedures and for helping the training of operators.
