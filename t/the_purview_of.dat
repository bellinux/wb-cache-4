5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that there may be some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within <b>the</b> <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> judicial review.|$|E
50|$|For {{nearly a}} {{millennium}} {{prior to the}} invention of printing or photographic reproduction, the process of multiple recension was the primary method of preserving literary, religious, and artistic tradition.

Zhong Yuan informed the emperor of their mother's plans, however, and the emperor promptly exiled Nuou Jin.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond <b>the</b> <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|A {{referendum}} in Croatia {{can be called}} by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within <b>the</b> <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> parliament, or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic.

5|$|Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, {{the capital}} was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway {{over most of}} the capital, and the City of London Police, who were {{responsible}} for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into <b>the</b> <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 1936, all {{police forces}} {{throughout}} Germany were united under <b>the</b> <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> Himmler and the SS. Himmler and Heydrich thus became {{two of the}} most powerful men in the country's administration. Police and intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; regular uniformed police). In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. This further increased the collective authority of the SS.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{producers}} {{have used a}} wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and electric), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used. More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under <b>the</b> <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} the Deputy Führer had final {{approval}} over civil service appointments, and Bormann reviewed the personnel files and made the decisions regarding appointments. This power impinged on <b>the</b> <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, and {{was an example of}} the overlapping responsibilities typical of the Nazi regime. Bormann travelled everywhere with Hitler, including trips to Austria in 1938 after the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany), and to the Sudetenland after the signing of the Munich Agreement later that year. Bormann was placed in charge of organising the 1938 Nuremberg Rally, a major annual party event.|$|E

As a key supporter of Diệm, Đính was named commander of the III Corps, because the Ngô family trusted him to defend them in the face of any coup attempts. Under the III Corps were the 5th and the 25th Divisions.|$|E
5000|$|The INCB is criticised {{for their}} {{behaviour}} in urging sovereign states {{to stay in}} bounds of the conventions. It is not their place to comment on matters that are <b>the</b> sole <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> national governments. <b>The</b> move to a more political role combined with a very rigid interpretation of the drug control conventions, passing judgement on states, is considered problematic.|$|R
50|$|Resolution 665 {{was adopted}} by 13 votes to none, with two abstentions from Cuba and Yemen. It avoided invoking <b>the</b> {{authority}} and <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council under Article 42, Chapter VII, which would make the blockade legally enforceable.|$|R
50|$|Middlebrook {{then took}} an {{interesting}} detour from {{her study of}} poetry and poets in her next book, Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy Tipton (1998). The story of a jazz musician who was born a woman but lived for more than 50 years as a man, the book also sold well and showed that Middlebrook could range outside <b>the</b> traditional <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English Department.|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

5|$|Then-Philippines {{president}} Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ordered for {{precautionary measures}} to be undertaken by agencies under <b>the</b> <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> the National Disaster Coordinating Council(NDCC). In response, the German Foreign Office allocated €50,000 (US$67,000) {{to assist in}} preparations for Nanmadol. The Spanish Red Cross were forced to maintain relief supplies in the provinces of Aurora and Quezon in addition to managing ongoing relief efforts for regions impacted by Tropical Depression Winnie. Individual Red Cross chapters were tasked with closely monitoring the movement of relief stockpiles during these preparatory measures.|$|E
5|$|Back in Salisbury, the Southern Rhodesian {{government}} was coming {{under pressure from}} Britain to put its armed forces under <b>the</b> <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> a regional command. Huggins decided in late October 1942 to join a unified Southern African Command headed by South Africa's Jan Smuts. This choice was motivated {{by a combination of}} strategic concerns and geopolitical manoeuvring. Apart from considering South Africa a more appropriate partner in geographical, logistical and cultural terms, Huggins feared that the alternative—joining the British East Africa Command—might detract from the autonomous nature of Southern Rhodesia's war effort, with possible constitutional implications. A shift in the deployment of the colony's troops duly occurred. For the rest of the war the majority of Rhodesian servicemen went into the field integrated into South African formations, prominently the 6th Armoured Division.|$|E
50|$|Law {{enforcement}} in Malaysia is performed by numerous {{law enforcement agencies}} and generally comes under <b>the</b> direct <b>purview</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Malaysia Police, the main government agency entrusted with the maintenance {{of law and order}} in the country. Like many federal nations, the nature of the Constitution of Malaysia mandates law and order as a subject of the state, therefore the bulk of the policing lies with the respective states and territories of Malaysia.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{beginning}} of substantial democratization in South Korea in 1987-1988 and the subsequent, gradual liberalization of the higher education system, the KCUE was increasingly able to accomplish its original purposes and expand its functions, particularly in research and training of university staff.
