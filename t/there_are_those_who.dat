5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This may seem an absurd mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as {{the expression of a}} certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> will {{consider}} it their duty, as {{friends of the}} Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

50|$|One thing should, perhaps, be {{made clear}} about the phrase. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> thought (correctly) that you couldn't find seven and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> felt (stuffily) that the seven were not arts. Lively was {{for the most part}} unchallenged. The sacred 7 came from the classics, from 'the seven arts' (which was also the name of a {{magazine}} recently defunct) and I never tried to categorise the contents of the book to conform to the figure.|$|R

25|$|Detailed {{scholarly}} {{attention has}} focused on prescribing female dress in conformity with hijab. The four major Sunni schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali) hold that the entire body of the woman, except her face and hands– though a few clerics say face, hands– must be covered during prayer and in public settings (see Awrah). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> allow the feet to be uncovered {{as well as the}} hands and face.|$|E
25|$|In {{its final}} four verses, the ballad’s tone changes from {{narrative}} to whimsy and fantasy. During the night, says the ballad, Salomon grows wings and flies over the area. The balladeer allows that “maybe {{it was just}} a dream/maybe just a legend”. In the morning, the last two verses tell us, “the accursed valley was filled with the chirping of birds/and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> say that to this day/along the Yarkon/the birds sing of Yoel Moshe Salomon”.|$|E

60|$|I suppose {{things are}} just the same elsewhere,--I mean the {{peculiar}} kind of discontent that crept into the Church of England congregation in Mariposa after the setting up of the Beacon. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> claimed that they had seen the error from the first, though they had kept quiet, as such people always do, from breadth of mind. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had felt years before how it would end, but their lips were sealed from humility of spirit. What was worse <b>was</b> that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> others who grew dissatisfied with the whole conduct of the church.|$|R

In this chapter, I consider the war-time activities of both kinds of mathematicians and I discuss the effect of the War on their careers as well as on mathematics itself...|$|R
25|$|Since the Rebbe's death, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have {{persisted in}} the belief that Schneerson is still the Messiah, {{sometimes}} extremely vocally. Chabad messianists (meshichists) either believe Schneerson will be resurrected, or (a vocal minority) refuse to admit that Schneerson died, instead proclaiming that he is still alive. The Chabad–Lubavitch umbrella organization, Agudas Chasidei Chabad, and the governing body of Chabad–Lubavitch rabbis, Vaad Rabonei Lubavitch, have both denounced the messianic behavior. The issue received much negative attention. To this day it remains controversial.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{argue against}} a {{division}} into modern and postmodern periods. Not all critics {{agree that the}} stage called modernism is over or even near the end. There is no agreement that all art after modernism is post-modern. Contemporary art is the more-widely used term to denote work since roughly 1960, though it has many other uses as well. Nor is post-modern art universally separated from modernism, with many critics seeing it as merely another phase in modern art or as another form of late modernism.|$|E
25|$|Among {{advanced}} players, {{there is}} little argument about whether technological changes have enabled higher scoring. The general consensus has been that they have. Yet <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> have seen their scores decline, often {{because they did not}} change their technique or bowling balls appropriately. Some argue that such high technology unfairly affects competition, making high scores too dependent on how much money one spends on equipment. The USBC, for various reasons, has struggled to regulate these changes well enough to protect the integrity of their honor score award program.|$|E
50|$|The Roman Republic's policy {{regarding}} expansion and overseas territory <b>was</b> frequently conflicted. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> satisfied with diplomacy, creating allies on its borders that acted as buffer states against more distant threats. On the other hand, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> saw opportunities for glory and riches. central government in rome was often far from civil and military {{commanders in the}} field, and local ambitions often dragged Rome into expanding its frontiers. The military exploits of Lucullus and Pompey {{towards the end of}} the Mithridatic wars created an eastern expansion far beyond the vision of the Senate.|$|R
50|$|Among {{descendants}} of Sephardic Anusim, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> attempted to maintain crypto-Judaism. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> people still today in Spain, Portugal and throughout Hispanic America and Brazil who retain familial customs of Jewish origins.|$|R

25|$|Inexpensive small wax candles {{sold for}} Hanukkah burn for {{approximately}} {{half an hour}} so should be lit no earlier than nightfall. Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the candles must be lit before sunset. However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual, followed by the Shabbat candles. At {{the end of the}} Shabbat, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} ten years, the {{national}} and international stages have drastically changed. People across North America and the world are divided by religion, race, politics and economics. A divided world needs the unifying voice of Christ. But the voice of Christ, {{if it is to}} properly convey its healing power, demands the unity of His Church here and across the globe. The work begun ten years ago must continue and be brought to fruition. As long as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> hear and do the word of the Lord in North America, the message of Ligonier will not be silenced.|$|E
25|$|Fuad al-Rikabi {{founded the}} Iraqi Regional Branch in 1951 or 1952. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> trace the branch's {{founding}} to Abd ar Rahman ad Damin and Abd al Khaliq al Khudayri in 1947, after their {{return from the}} 1st National Congress, which was held in Syria. Another version is that the branch was established in 1948 by Rikabi and Sa'dun Hamadi, a Shia Muslim. However, Efraim Karsh and Inari Rautsi contend that the Regional Branch {{was established in the}} 1940s, but that it received official recognition as a Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party in 1952 by the National Command. What is certain is that Rikabi was elected the Regional Branch's first Regional Secretary in 1952.|$|E
