25|$|Transposon {{silencing}} {{is a form}} of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> targeting transposons. <b>Transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> is {{a product}} of histone modifications that prevent the transcription of a particular area of DNA. Transcriptional silencing of transposons is crucial to the maintenance of a genome. The “jumping” of transposons generates genomic instability and can cause extremely deleterious mutations. Transposable element insertions have been linked to many diseases including hemophilia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and predisposition to cancer. The silencing of transposons is therefore extremely critical in the germline in order to stop transposon mutations from developing and being passed on to the next generation. Additionally, these epigenetic defenses against transposons can be heritable. Studies in Drosophila, Arabidopsis thaliana, and mice all indicate that small interfering RNAs are responsible for transposon silencing. In animals, these siRNAS and piRNAs are most active in the gonads.|$|E
25|$|The siRNA induced post <b>transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> {{starts with}} the {{assembly}} of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The complex silences certain gene expression by cleaving the mRNA molecules coding the target genes. To begin the process, {{one of the two}} siRNA strands, the guide strand, will be loaded into the RISC while the other strand, the passenger strand, is degraded. Certain Dicer enzymes may be responsible of loading the guide strand into RISC. Then, the siRNA scans for and direct RISC to perfectly complementary sequence on the mRNA molecules. The cleavage of the mRNA molecules is thought to be catalyzed by the Piwi domain of Argonaute proteins of the RISC. The mRNA molecule is then cut precisely by cleaving the phosphodiester bond between the target nucleotides which are paired to siRNA residues 10 and 11, counting from the 5’end. This cleavage results in mRNA fragments that are further degraded by cellular exonucleases. The 5’ fragment is degraded from its 3’ end by exosome while the 3’ fragment is degraded from its 5’ end by 5' -3' exoribonuclease 1(XRN1). Dissociation of the target mRNA strand from RISC after the cleavage allow more mRNA to be silenced. This dissociation process is likely to be promoted by extrinsic factors driven by ATP hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|The {{compressed}} {{nature of}} genes in yeast requires that transcription units be well defined to prevent read-though transcription from one gene into an adjacent gene. Failure to terminate transcription {{may result in}} transcriptional interference of downstream-positioned <b>genes.</b> <b>Transcriptional</b> interference has been studied in several budding yeast gene systems and, interestingly, {{may be used as}} a general mechanism of gene regulation. The realization that extensive numbers of noncoding RNAs are transcribed between and across protein-coding genes greatly increases the complexity and subtlety of <b>gene</b> regulation through <b>transcriptional</b> interference. This may be achieved by somehow directly blocking RNA polymerase access to promoters or by the formation of repressive chromatin structures. Furthermore, in fission yeast, read-through transcription from convergent genes may generate double-strand RNAs.

Both proteins are located at telomeres and prevent telomere fusions. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the Hip-interacting protein Umbrea. We found that Umbrea interacts directly with Hip, HP 1 and HOAP in vitro. Umbrea, Hip and HP 1 are partners in a protein complex in vivo and completely co-localize in the pericentric heterochromatin and at telomeres. Using a Gal 4 -induced RNA interference system, we found that after depletion of Umbrea in salivary gland polytene chromosomes, they exhibit multiple telomeric fusions. Taken together, these results suggest that Umbrea cooperates with Hip, HP 1 and HOAP and plays a functional role in mediating normal telomere behaviour in Drosophila...|$|R

50|$|While RNA {{silencing}} is {{an evolving}} class of mechanisms, {{a common theme}} is the fundamental relationship between small RNAs and gene expression. It has also been observed that the major RNA silencing pathways currently identified have mechanisms of action which may involve both post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) as well as chromatin-dependent gene silencing (CDGS) pathways. CDGS involves the assembly of small RNA complexes on nascent transcripts and is regarded as encompassing mechanisms of action which implicate <b>transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> (TGS) and co-transcriptional gene silencing (CTGS) events.

40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>silencing</b> and RNA-mediated virus {{resistance}} are two {{remarkable and}} potentially useful phenomena {{that occur in}} higher plants. However,in light of recent research {{it seems likely that}} the post- <b>transcriptional</b> type of <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> and RNA-mediated virus resistance are actually manifestations of the same phenomenon. The occurrence of both post-transcriptional <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> (PTGS) and RNA-mediated virus resistance require sequence homology between a transgene and an endogenous gene or a transgene and an infecting virus,respectively. Furthermore,both processes are characterized by high transcription rates of homologous,silenced (trans) genes but low steady-state levels of their transcripts (in case of virus- infected plants,low steady-state transcript levels of the silenced transgene and homologous viral RNA which eventually leads to virus resistance). Therefore,PTGS is a potential tool for creating virus-resistant transgenic plants that express a sequence homologous to the invading virus. It is very unlikely,though,that PTGS in plants has evolved solely for the purpose of transgene suppression so it is perhaps not surprising that some natural virus defense systems have been found to resemble <b>gene</b> <b>silencing.</b> In addition,although plants may combat virus infections by gene silencing,there is recent evidence that some plant viruses can fight back by suppressing the plant 's ability to carry out the silencing process.

Host disease resistance and defense responses are achieved by activation and repression of a large array of genes.

40|$|Methylation of histone H 4 at lysine 20 (K 20) {{has been}} implicated in <b>transcriptional</b> activation, <b>gene</b> <b>silencing,</b> {{heterochromatin}} formation, mitosis, and DNA repair. However, {{little is known about}} how this modification is regulated or how it contributes to these diverse processes. Metabolic labeling and top-down mass spectrometry reveal that newly synthesized H 4 is progressively methylated at K 20 during the G 2, M, and G 1 phases of the cell cycle in a process that is largely inescapable and irreversible. Approximately 98 % of new H 4 becomes dimethylated within two to three cell cycles, and K 20 methylation turnover in vivo is undetectable. New H 4 is methylated regardless of prior acetylation, and acetylation occurs predominantly on K 20 -dimethylated H 4, refuting the hypothesis that K 20 methylation antagonizes H 4 acetylation and represses transcription epigenetically. Despite suggestions that it is required for normal mitosis and cell cycle progression, K 20 methylation proceeds normally during colchicine treatment. Moreover, delays in PR-Set 7 synthesis and K 20 methylation which accompany altered cell cycle progression during sodium butyrate treatment appear to be secondary to histone hyperacetylation or other effects of butyrate since depletion of PR-Set 7 did not affect cell cycle progression.

50|$|The Soil-borne Wheat Mosaic Virus {{uses the}} fungal-like protist Polymyxa graminis, an endoparasitic slime mold as a vector. The P. graminis {{produces}} resting spores that contain the viral RNA and movement protein {{for up to}} 30 years. Dormant resting spores can germinate and produce an infection from the virus containing zoospore. The zoospores need water to reach the host so saturated soil conditions maximize dissemination. When the zoospore reaches the host plant, it encysts {{on the surface of}} a cortical root cell and develops a spear like bag which when mature will punch through the adjoining zoospore and host walls. Along with the bag, the zoospore contents as well as the virus particles are emptied into the host cortical cell. How the virus is attached to or carried by the zoospore and how the virus is transferred from the zoospore to the plant root is not fully understood although the actual virus and movement protein but not capsid protein have been found within P. graminis sporosori. After the cortical root cell puncture, one of two types of plasmodia of P. graminis may form inside. These plasmodia differentiate to give rise to either secondary zoospores (part of the asexual secondary cycle) or resting spores, the sexual primary cycle. The infection of the root cells causes substantial stunting and mosaic meaning a local infection on the root with secondary symptoms of stunting and mosaic formation.The virus itself contains two types of particles. The longer particle contains RNA 1, which is approximately 7100 nucleotides long and encodes three proteins. Two of these, measuring 150 kDa and 209 kDa, allow virus replication. The other protein is 37 kDa and allows cell-to-cell movement protein. The 150 kDa and 209 kDa proteins are translated directly from the message sense viral RNA, whereas the 37 kDa protein is expressed via a subgenomic mRNA. The shorter particle contains RNA 2 (approximately 3600 nucleotides), which also encodes three different proteins. The first is the 19 kDa coat or capsid protein (CP). Sometimes, the coat protein UGA termination codon is suppressed allowing translation of an 84 kDa CP-readthrough protein, which is believed to be required for virus transmission by its protist vector P. graminis. The third protein is a 19 kDa cysteine-rich protein that is expressed via a subgenomic mRNA and may function as a suppressor of post <b>transcriptional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> countering the host resistance to the virus. Optimal temperatures for P. graminis vary depending on where they are found: example 80-86ᵒF in India varies in comparison to Belgium, Canada, Japan and France (59-64ᵒF) and an optimal temperature for transmission of 59ᵒF in New York state. Since no significant transmission occurs at 44ᵒF, fall or spring in temperate climates are believed to be the times of the year the infections occur.|$|E

Silencing of c-myc led to growth arrest, reduced clonogenic potential and senescence of c-myc over-expressing prostate cancer cells with minimal effect on normal cells.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} whether epigenetics {{plays a role in}} P. infestans, the expression patterns of <b>genes</b> involved in <b>transcriptional</b> and post-transcriptional <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> were investigated and several were found to be up-regulated in both pre-infection stages and in planta. A histone deacetylase (Pi-HDA 1) was selected for functional characterization using RNA interference (RNAi). Silencing Pi-HDA 1 produced large aberrant zoospores indicating that it may be required for development. In addition silencing of Pi-HDA 1 resulted in reactivation of INF 1 production in inf 1 -transgenic silenced strains, therefore suggesting that Pi-HDA 1 may be directly involved in the silencing of inf 1 in inf 1 - transgenic silenced strains. In addition an RNA helicase, Pi-RNH 1 was also found to be specifically up-regulated in zoospores. Pi-RNH 1 -silenced strains produced large aberrant zoospores that had undergone partial cleavage and often had multiple flagella on their surface. The Pi-RNH 1 -silenced zoospores were also sensitive to osmotic pressure and they often ruptured upon release from the sporangia. These findings indicate that Pi-RNH 1 has a major function in zoospore development. In addition the mechanism of internuclear <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> was further investigated. In P. infestans internuclear <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> is a process where silencing is transmitted from nucleus to nucleus in heterokaryotic strains. Previously it was demonstrated that internuclear <b>gene</b> <b>silencing</b> is a <b>transcriptional</b> silencing process. In several eukaryotes transcriptional silencing has been shown to involve methylation of cytosines.

40|$|RATIONALE: Blood flow-induced {{shear stress}} {{controls}} endothelial cell (EC) physiology during atherosclerosis via transcriptional mechanisms that are incompletely understood. The mechanosensitive transcription factor TWIST is expressed during embryogenesis but {{its role in}} EC responses to shear stress and focal atherosclerosis is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether TWIST regulates endothelial responses to shear stress during vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis, and compare TWIST function in vascular development and disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression and function of TWIST 1 was studied in EC in both developing vasculature and during the initiation of atherosclerosis. In zebrafish, twist was expressed in early embryonic vasculature where it promoted angiogenesis by inducing EC proliferation and migration. In adult porcine and murine arteries, TWIST 1 was expressed preferentially at low shear stress regions as evidenced by qPCR and en face staining. Moreover, studies of experimental murine carotid arteries and cultured EC revealed that TWIST 1 was induced by low shear stress via a GATA 4 -dependent <b>transcriptional</b> mechanism. <b>Gene</b> <b>silencing</b> in cultured EC and EC-specific genetic deletion in mice demonstrated that TWIST 1 promoted atherosclerosis by inducing inflammation and enhancing EC proliferation associated with vascular leakiness. CONCLUSIONS: TWIST expression promotes developmental angiogenesis by inducing EC proliferation and migration. In addition to its role in development, TWIST is expressed preferentially at low shear stress regions of adult arteries where it promotes atherosclerosis by inducing EC proliferation and inflammation.
