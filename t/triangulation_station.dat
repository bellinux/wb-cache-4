Also within the parish of Compton Bishop is Wavering Down which reaches a height of , and is marked with a <b>triangulation</b> <b>station.</b> Around the small village of Cross is Wavering Down House which was, for the last 20 years of his life, {{the home of the}} British comedian Frankie Howerd. The house is now a tourist attraction, and in the summer hosts concerts and opens {{regularly}} as a museum of Howerd's collection of memorabilia to raise fund for charities.

The bowl barrow is [...] in diameter and approximately [...] high. Slightly west of the bowl barrow is a disc barrow surrounded by a bank and ditch which enclose an area about [...] across.

500|$|Zennor Head [...] is a 750-metre (2,460ft) long {{promontory}} on the Cornish {{coast of}} England, between Pendour Cove and Porthzennor Cove. Facing the Atlantic Ocean, it lies 1 kilometre north-west {{of the village}} of Zennor and 1.6 kilometres east of the next promontory, Gurnard's Head. The granite (Killas) cliffs rise over [...] from {{the sea and the}} highest point of the headland is [...] above sea level, with an Ordnance Survey <b>triangulation</b> <b>station.</b> Zennor Head is on the South West Coast Path, which follows the cliff edge closely, skirting the entire perimeter of the headland. The promontory is part of the Penwith Heritage Coast, and is the largest coastal feature in the United Kingdom that begins with the letter [...] "Z". It gets its name from a local saint, Senara. Zennor Head was mined for copper and tin in the Victorian Era. There is no longer any residential or commercial occupancy on the headland, but it is occupied by a variety of coastal animals and plants, such as kestrels and gorse.|$|E
25|$|Several {{of these}} hills - the Wilseder Berg, the Falkenberg, the Haußelberg and the Breithorn - {{were used by}} the mathematician, Carl Friedrich Gauss, as <b>triangulation</b> <b>stations</b> in his {{topographical}} surveys of the Kingdom of Hanover from 1821–1825.|$|R
50|$|These markers were {{installed}} in 1899 {{and are the}} predecessors to the modern <b>triangulation</b> <b>stations</b> used in Japan today.

50|$|Mount Oizuru, at 1841 m, is {{the tallest}} {{mountain}} {{in the northern part}} of the Ryōhaku Mountains. Just north of the mountain is Mount Ōgasa (大笠山 Ōgasa-yama), which is slightly shorter at 1821 m. There are three <b>triangulation</b> <b>stations</b> on the mountain's thin peak.|$|R
2500|$|Apparently no peak has an {{elevation}} of 10,740’, and all sources agree that the JEFFERSON <b>triangulation</b> <b>station</b> is on the southern peak. Decades of use would have “Hollowtop” to the north, and perhaps the newer maps reflect this usage.

50|$|The HGRS87 datum is {{implemented}} by a first order geodetic network, {{which consists of}} approximately 30 <b>triangulation</b> <b>stations</b> throughout Greece and is maintained by the Hellenic Military Geographical Service. The initial uncertainty was estimated as 0.1 ppm (1x10−7). However, there are considerable tectonic movements that move parts of Greece towards different directions, causing incompatibilities between surveys taking place at different times.|$|R
5000|$|Survey markers, {{also called}} survey marks, survey monuments, or {{geodetic}} marks, are objects placed to mark key survey {{points on the}} Earth's surface. They are used in geodetic and land surveying.

Horizontal position markers used for triangulation are also known as <b>triangulation</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

They typically then log their finds online.
