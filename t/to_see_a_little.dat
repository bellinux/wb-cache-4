She stated, [...] "I was just really intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone [...] I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what scared me the most – how I {{was going to find}} it within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I would love <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of the old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced. I think it would make a lot of sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were mostly positive, calling it [...] "refreshing." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the episode's extended chicken fight scene, going on to note, [...] "Like every other encounter with the Giant Chicken, this was highly entertaining, incredibly creative and just the type of sequence the Family Guy needs more of." [...] In contrast, Brett Love of TV Squad found the chicken scene to be too long, stating, [...] "there are only 22 minutes per episode [...] Taking a quarter of that for the chicken fight is just ridiculous." [...] Love did enjoy the scenes involving Chris's time at Morningwood Academy, however, going on to mention that he [...] "would have liked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more of Chris and Carter bonding over Skull and Bones adventures." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{attending}} USC School of Cinematic Arts {{and working}} at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who {{do well in school}} are said to be [...] "acting white". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who look like her doing". The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> black girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{satisfactory}} to think, as he briskly passed on, {{as one who}} {{has much}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time, that the incident in the Tuileries Gardens had not yet caused the captain's wife to change her quarters.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will not}} tease the poor little thing, {{when she has}} enough to torment her already. If you had known her husband, and watched her last winter, you would be only too thankful <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more like herself." ...|$|R

6000|$|Madame Merle {{smiled with}} her usual grace. [...] "It's a weighty question--let me think.
