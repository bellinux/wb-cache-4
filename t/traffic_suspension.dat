40|$|The <b>traffic</b> <b>suspension</b> due to wave {{overtopping}} is {{happened on}} the coastal road of National Route No. 231 at Yudomari district along the Sea of Japan in Hokkaido. In this paper, {{the relationship between the}} wave run-up height and the offshore wave height was shown based on the field observation. It was also revealed that the wave splash acted on passing vehicles when the offshore wave height exceeded 3 - 4 meters. Hydraulic model tests on wave overtopping were conducted to find the necessary height of the wave splash barrier {{in order to protect the}} coastal road against storm waves. The characteristics of wave force on the vertical wall of the seawall were also examined by the hydraulic model tests. Based on the test results, the use of transparent material such as aramid fiber sheet was proposed for the wave splash barrier...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{characteristics of}} 1, 310 landslide disasters along national highways in Japan {{for fifteen years}} from FY 1990 to FY 2004, and shows a trial example of roadside landslide hazard map. Road bureau of Ministry of land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) of Japan government collected 1, 310 landslide disasters with road <b>traffic</b> <b>suspension</b> on the direct administrative highway of 20, 000 kilometers from FY 1990 to FY 2004. More than 90 percent of landslide disasters were caused by rainfall. Surface failure was the most abundant and constituted 81 % of all landslide disasters. Disaster-prone geology was generally Neogene green tuff and sedimentary rock. And then we focused on 404 landslide disasters after the road facility comprehensive inspection campaign in FY 1996 for disaster prevention. We classified 404 disasters into groups by both of evaluation results and landslide types. It results {{that half of the}} disasters occurred out of inspected area. They were overlooked as the landslide sources located out of road administrative zone. Besides, we applied a roadside landslide hazard map to a highway in mountains to prevent from landslide disasters under a heavy rain. The hazard map shows weakness in heavy rainfall and countermeasure on roadside at a glance. We accumulated results of the road facility comprehensive inspection, air-photo interpretation and disaster records to the map at a scale of 1 : 5, 000. Twenty-two slope units including slope and torrents in a range between a roadside slope and a ridge were associated each other. Eight slope units were necessary of countermeasure. It indicated that the map was useful for road administrators to determine priority sections requiring countermeasures...|$|E

25|$|The {{founding}} chapter at the University of Alabama {{was suspended}} in 1988 on cocaine-trafficking charges and {{for violating the}} university's code against drug use and <b>trafficking.</b> The <b>suspension</b> was lifted in 1990, but with a checklist of improvement goals that the chapter was required to fulfill; in 1992, the chapter was suspended again for failing to meet the outlined goals.|$|R
40|$|Jamming is a {{phenomenon}} occurring in systems as diverse as <b>traffic,</b> colloidal <b>suspensions</b> and granular materials. A theory on the reversible elastic deformation of jammed states is presented. First, an explicit granular stress-strain relation is derived that captures many relevant features of sand, including especially the Coulomb yield surface and a third-order jamming transition. Then this approach is generalized, and employed to consider jammed magneto- and electro-rheological fluids, again producing results that compare well to experiments and simulations.

50|$|The {{construction}} {{started on}} 11 February 2011. The new crossing was opened on 30 December 2011. About a week later, the crossing was again closed for all <b>traffic,</b> because the <b>suspension</b> cables {{were found to}} vibrate {{in a manner that}} was considered harmful. The Hovenring was finally opened to the public on 29 June 2012.|$|R
50|$|As {{a measure}} to reduce the level of {{unemployment}} in the 1930s, a suspension bridge was planned {{to take the place}} of the old Reichsbrücke. The technical plans were drawn up by the architects Siegfried Theiß and Hans Jaksch, with artistic control being given to Clemens Holzmeister. The pillars of the old bridge were extended downstream and the structure was shifted by 26 m in less than seven hours. The new bridge could thus be built on the line of the old bridge without long-lasting disruptions to <b>traffic.</b> This <b>suspension</b> bridge, built between 1934 and 1937, carried four lanes of traffic, two tram lines and footpaths on both sides. The bridges over the flood plains were also expanded. The new bridge was opened on 10 October 1937 by Cardinal Innitzer and Bundespräsident Wilhelm Miklas.|$|R

50|$|Belle Isle {{is a small}} (540 acre) {{island in}} the city of Richmond, Virginia. Belle Island lies within the James River, and being owned by the city it serves as a city park. It is {{accessible}} to pedestrian and bicycle <b>traffic</b> via a <b>suspension</b> footbridge that runs under the Robert E. Lee Bridge from the northern shore of the James. Except when the water level of the James is high, it is also reachable by foot from the southern shore via easy boulder-hopping. From Belle Isle, one can see Hollywood Cemetery, the old Tredegar Iron Works, and Richmond City's skyline. Belle Isle has many bike trails around the island, and has a small cliff used for rock climbing instruction.|$|R
50|$|After emancipation, {{the city}} {{slightly}} accelerated {{the pace of}} growth experienced since the 1950s, earning a higher quality in their public services, given {{the proximity of the}} municipal government with the reality of the local population. In the 1980s, the city gained new impetus to its growth {{with the opening of the}} Small Sea Bridge (in the final stretch of the Highway of Immigrants), linking the island of Sao Vicente in the city, and solving two problems at once: as well as relieve <b>traffic</b> on saturated <b>Suspension</b> Bridge, the city gained a direct link to the capital without the need of going through the cities of Santos and Sao Vicente, in order to access the Via Anchieta, then the only option to reach the capital. Thus, Playa Grande became the resort closest to the capital.|$|R

50|$|The DMV TVB is an {{administrative}} court {{that is not}} part of the judiciary, but an executive agency with different procedures regarding elements ranging from rules of evidence to threshold for conviction. The function of the judge is carried out by {{an administrative}} law judge, or ALJ. The sole options are to plead guilty or not guilty: plea bargains are not conducted, nor can the judge reduce a charge, only rule guilty or not guilty on the stated charge. After a guilty finding, the DMV ALJ may impose any penalty authorized by the Vehicle and <b>Traffic</b> Law, including <b>suspension</b> or revocation of a driver's license and/or motor vehicle registration, but not including imprisonment. There is no absolute right to a supporting deposition, and rules on admissibility of hearsay evidence are far more lax than in court. Typically, the hearing consists simply of each side presenting its story, the allowance of hearsay negating the necessity of formalities such as sworn witnesses and the like.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Hybrid {{suspension}} system with permanent-magnet and electromagnet consumes little power consumption, and can realize larger suspension gap. We took magnetic flux signal {{as a state}} variable, and put this signal back to suspension control system. So we got the hybrid suspension mathematical model based on magnetic flux signal feedback. With application of MIMO feedback linearization theory, we can realize linearization of the hybrid {{suspension system}}. Then PIDB (proportion, integral, differentiation, magnetic flux density B) controller was designed. Some hybrid suspension experiments had been done on CMS 04 magnetic suspension bogie of NUDT (National University of Defense Technology) in China. The experiment results denote that hybrid suspension control algorithm based on magnetic flux signal feedback designed has more advantages than traditional position-current double cascade control algorithm. Obviously the robustness and stability of hybrid suspension system have been enhanced. Introductions A hybrid electromagnets made of permanent-magnet and electromagnet, which consumes little power consumption, and can realize larger suspension gap. So the hybrid <b>suspension</b> <b>traffic</b> will have more developments in the future. The CMS 04 maglev vehicle (Fig. 1) designed by Nationa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One {{application}} in structural engineering is measuring {{the movement of}} suspension bridges. Under unfavourable wind conditions or heavy <b>traffic</b> loads cable <b>suspension</b> bridges may move up to a few metres. Therefore a positioning system used to monitor bridge movements can provide valuable information. For such monitoring applications it is desirable for the positioning system to deliver equal precision in all position components, all of the time. GPS {{has the potential to}} deliver cm-level positioning accuracy, through use of the very precise carrier-phase measurement. However, the same level of accuracy cannot be guaranteed in all three position components, twenty hour hours a day, in every situation. Additionally, GPS signals are very weak and easily obstructed, especially in built-up urban environments. One solution to improving the GPS satellite geometry and the availability of ranging signals is to use ground-based transmitters of GPSlike signals (called “pseudolites”). A major advantage of pseudolite devices is the ability to control where they are located, improving a geometrically poor GPS constellation. In this paper proof-of-concept for the use of pseudolites in the monitoring of suspension bridges is demonstrated through an experimental trial conducted on the Parsley Bay suspension footbridg...|$|R

Weedlun, the Nebraska Supreme Court held {{revocation}} of {{a driver}} 2 ̆ 7 s license upon accumulation of twelve or more traffic violation points meets due process requirements despite {{the absence of}} statutory provisions for prior hearing and notice to the driver. The decision merits further consideration in light of an earlier case, Bell v.

This casenote considers the grounds on which the Nebraska Supreme Court distinguished revocation of a driver 2 ̆ 7 s license for <b>traffic</b> violations from <b>suspension</b> pursuant to financial responsibility laws.

40|$|Conference Name: 3 rd International Conference on Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Materials, CEABM 2013. Conference Address: Jinan, China. Time:May 24, 2013 - May 26, 2013. Dynamic stress {{computation}} of long suspension bridges {{under both}} railway and wind loading {{is required for}} either strength or fatigue assessment. However, the effect of dynamic coupling among bridge, railway vehicle and wind on bridge stress response is not well understood. This paper presents a method for predicting bridge dynamic stress responses with coupling effects included. The bridge model (bridge subsystem) and vehicle model (vehicle subsystem) are established using the finite element method, and they are {{related to each other}} through wheel-rail contact conditions. The spatial distribution of both buffeting forces and self-excited forces over the bridge deck surface is considered to facilitate the computation of local stress responses. The Tsing Ma suspension bridge in Hong Kong and the data recorded by a Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System (WASHMS) installed in the bridge are utilized as a case study to verify the proposed method to some extent. The railway loading and wind speed measured by the WASHMS are taken as input for the computation simulation. The computed local stress responses are compared with the measured ones. The results from the case study demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively predict the local stress responses of the coupled <b>traffic</b> vehicles and <b>suspension</b> bridge system in cross winds. ?
