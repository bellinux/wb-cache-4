5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E

This was discovered in 2003 by studying the variation in reactions of larvae of the common fruitfly Drosophila to <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heated probe and an unheated one. The larvae reacted to the touch of the heated probe with a stereotypical rolling behavior that was not exhibited when the larvae were touched by the unheated probe. Although nociception has been demonstrated in insects, {{there is not a}} consensus that insects feel pain consciously.|$|E

Due to the bulky tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. On Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster {{was replaced by a}} level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Tyco Toys created {{a line of}} action figures called The Incredible Crash Dummies based on the {{characters}} from the NHTSA television advertisements. They were intended to fall apart at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button on their abdomens. Vehicles which could be crashed into walls and broken were also produced. Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy were produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{incandescent}} gas lighting in factories, homes {{and in the}} streets, replacing oil lamps and candles with steady clear light, almost matching daylight in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night shift work possible in industries where light was all important—in spinning, weaving and making up garments etc. The social significance of this change is difficult for generations brought up with lighting after dark available at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> switch to appreciate. Not only was industrial production accelerated, but streets were made safe, social intercourse facilitated and reading and writing made more widespread. Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets {{to the majority of}} urban households. The invention of the gas meter and the pre-payment meter in the late 1880s {{played an important role in}} selling town gas to domestic and commercial customers.|$|E

40|$|A {{flat surface}} {{is more often}} judged to be convex after <b>the</b> <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concave surface than after <b>the</b> <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> convex surface. This haptic {{after-effect}} increases with the time of contact with the curved surface till it saturates, and it decreases with the time-lapse between <b>the</b> <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first surface and the next one. In this paper, the haptic after-effect <b>of</b> two successively <b>touched</b> spherically curved surfaces is investigated. It is found that both surfaces contribute to the after-effect, but the after-effect is not additive. The time course of the after-effect of two successive surfaces can be described by a first-order integrator with a single time constant of about 7 s and an amplitude equal {{to the difference between}} the saturation levels of the after-effects of the two surfaces when measured in isolation. The new saturation level is therefore equal to that of the after-effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most recently <b>touched</b> surface...|$|R

500|$|The GTS has usually used a more {{powerful}} engine and robust drivetrain than other HSV models, however the E-Series 1 GTS shared the 6.0L LS2 V8 engine with 412bhp (307kW) of power and 405lb·ft (550 N·m) of torque, with the cheaper Clubsport and the luxury Senator. The major difference between the E-Series GTS and other HSV models in the range is the Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide"). MRC utilises magnetorheological dampers to improve the car's handling and dynamics. In the GTS, the MRC can be switched between Performance and Track response modes at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. MRC is not available on the Clubsport; it is standard equipment of the Senator, but switches between [...] "Luxury" [...] and [...] "Performance", there is no [...] "Track" [...] mode like the GTS has.|$|E
500|$|Nitrogen trichloride (NCl3) is a dense, volatile, and {{explosive}} liquid whose {{physical properties}} {{are similar to}} those of carbon tetrachloride, although one difference is that NCl3 is easily hydrolysed by water while CCl4 is not. It was first synthesised in 1811 by Pierre Louis Dulong, who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies. As a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour. Nitrogen tribromide (NBr3), first prepared in 1975, is a deep red, temperature-sensitive, volatile solid that is explosive even at −100°C. Nitrogen triiodide (NI3) is still more unstable and was only prepared in 1990. Its adduct with ammonia, which was known earlier, is very shock-sensitive: it can be set off by <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> feather, shifting air currents, or even alpha particles. For this reason, small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesised as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of [...] "chemical magic".|$|E

500|$|In 2014, CIM {{began moving}} forward with adding a rental {{residential}} tower atop Block 37. In March 2014, rumors began that an apartment building exceeding 500 units was being planned. On September 11, CIM issued a press release that it had obtained permits for a 34-story, 690-unit apartment tower, which Crain's Chicago Business described as [...] "the biggest apartment tower the Loop has seen in decades". The official commencement of the glass-walled project was on October 29 with expected completion by Summer 2016 to include amenities such as outdoor pool and spa, plus a rooftop spa and fitness center. At the time the retail spaces were only 52 percent occupied. The apartment building construction eliminated the {{plans to build a}} hotel atop the structure. The apartment building construction coincided with plans to bring an 11-screen AMC Theatres dine-in movie theater to the building. The 4th floor AMC theater opened its doors on December 17, 2015 as scheduled as the Loop's only major chain movie theatre. The theatre is Chicago's first Dine-In Theatre in which patrons order food by <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button from their seats. On June 1, 2016, the 38-story, 690-unit Marquee at Block 37 opened at 25 West Randolph, marking the conclusion of construction at Block 37.|$|E

Also, the other partner may indicate reciprocal interest by engaging in intimate behaviour of their own.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Angel - a 2015 Polish {{documentary}} {{directed by}} Marek Tomasz Pawłowski. It {{is a very}} personal, poetic memoir <b>of</b> <b>a</b> deaf man who returns to the places where he found refuge as a Jewish boy during WWII. He finds his hiding places and bunkers still standing, bringing back horrific memories. The film emphasizes the role of Poles in saving persecuted Jews and indifference {{of the international community}} at large in the face of Nazi threats.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} {{during the season}} that around 100 phone-phreak hackers with power-dialing hardware and software were able to place as many as 10,000 votes a night from a single phone line with <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. [...] However, FremantleMedia, which produces the show, contended that the hackers have had 'statistically insignificant' effect on the vote. Simon Cowell also insisted that Tamyra Gray's unexpected ouster from the show only strengthened the producers' contention that the voting was fair. [...] Nevertheless, concerns were raised about possible unfairness in the situation of a tight vote. [...] Ken Warwick later said in Season 5 that equipment {{was put in place}} afterwards to address this issue but it has never detected such a problem since.|$|E
2500|$|The {{later years}} of this {{generation}} of Toronado saw new features mostly confined to minor styling tweaks to the grille and trim, although in 1977, the XS and XSR models debuted. Both featured a three-sided, hot wire [...] "bent-glass" [...] rear window and, on the XSR, electric t-tops which slid inwards at <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. However, as built in prototype form, the XSR had no means of channeling water away from the retractable sections, and water would inevitably leak into the cabin. No workable {{solution to the problem}} was found, and as such, the XSR model was scrapped. The XS, which did enter production, was offered with GM's more reliable (and no doubt more leak-resistant) Astroroof sliding sunroof instead. Air conditioning was standard.|$|E

Virgin began heavily advertising the release of the new album, set for the end of October 1981. [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] was accompanied by a futuristic looking promotional video, a rarity at the time. Whilst it was still in the charts, Dare premiered to critical acclaim. It was also condemned by the Musicians' Union, who believed the new technology employed by the Human League was making traditional musicians redundant and a threat to their monopoly.

He was infamous for his [...] "office fortress" [...] desk, which had two automatic guns built into it that could be fired by <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. According to the memoirs of SS intelligence officer Wilhelm Hoettl, Schellenberg was very suspicious of Gestapo Chief Müller, whom {{he claimed to have}} evidence against by way of radio surveillance recordings (allegedly revealing Müller's plans to work with the Russians); when he informed then RSHA chief Ernst Kaltenbrunner of possessing proof to that end, he was ignored. Kaltenbrunner disliked Schellenberg, perhaps due to his direct access to Himmler, and complained about him in particular on a number of occasions. Despite Kaltenbrunner's animosity towards Schellenberg, the latter's soothing manners kept him in good graces with Himmler and allowed him to [...] "retain the ear of the SS overlord".|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Nintendo {{released}} the Nintendo DS, its fourth major handheld system. The DS is a dual screened handheld featuring touch screen capabilities, which respond {{to either a}} stylus or <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finger. Former Nintendo president and now chairman Hiroshi Yamauchi was translated by GameScience as explaining, [...] "If we can increase {{the scope of the}} industry, we can re-energise the global market and lift Japan out of depression – that is Nintendo's mission." [...] Regarding lukewarm GameCube sales which had yielded the company's first reported operating loss in over 100 years, Yamauchi continued: [...] "The DS represents a critical moment for Nintendo's success over the next two years. If it succeeds, we rise to the heavens, if it fails, we sink into hell." [...] Thanks to titles such as Nintendogs and Mario Kart DS, the DS became a success. In 2005, Nintendo {{released the}} Game Boy Micro in North America, a redesign of the Game Boy Advance. The last system in the Game Boy line, it was also the smallest Game Boy, and the least successful. In the middle of 2005, Nintendo opened the Nintendo World Store in New York City, which would sell Nintendo games, present a museum of Nintendo history, and host public parties such as for product launches. The store was renovated and renamed as Nintendo New York in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{commanding}} {{view of the}} harbor, {{the roof}} of the warehouse has long been the site of various operations. [...] Starting in the early 1920s, the Marine Exchange operated on its roof, providing lookout reports on ships entering and leaving the port. [...] In 1925, the Radio Corporation of America located its harbor receiving station {{to the top of the}} massive warehouse. [...] A new four-room lookout station for use by the Marine Exchange was built in 1928 atop the warehouse. [...] The new station had a large circular window giving telescopes a commanding view of the harbor and ocean, and also included a neon red beacon which shed a red glow over the building at night. [...] In 1939, the Los Angeles Times described the Exchange as [...] "a world all its own up there on Warehouse No. 1." [...] In eight-hour shifts, three men manned the Exchange, climbing seven flights of stairs to reach the lookout station. [...] The Times described the station as follows: [...] "In one room with big windows commanding every approach from the sea, there is a large telescope on wheels. [...] It can be pointed in any direction with <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finger. [...] At a little desk looking out over the channel and the harbor sits one of the three men who are on duty as lookouts ..." [...] During World War II, as blackout rules were applied along the coast, the Marine Exchange ceased operations but resumed its lookout operations atop the warehouse in late 1945. [...] In 1964, a new 26 x [...] perch was built atop the warehouse for use by the Marine Exchange. The roof was also the site of a weather observation and signal facility for many years.|$|E
