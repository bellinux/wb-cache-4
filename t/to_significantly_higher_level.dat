40|$|The Authors studied {{psychological}} {{effects of}} chronic dietary restriction in different pathological groups, with exogenous or self prescribed dieting: {{a group of}} Type 1 diabetic subjects, {{and a group of}} chronic anorexic subjects. In addition to the comparison with a group of normal controls, the two groups with dietary restriction were compared to a group of bulimic subjects, who displayed dyscontrol of eating behaviour. Four groups of 11 young adult subjects (Anorexics, Bulimics, Type 1 Diabetics and Controls), age range 20 - 39 years, were studied by I. P. A. T. ASQ (anxiety questionnaire), I. P. A. T, CDQ (Clinical Depression Questionnaire) and Draw a Person test. Variance analysis showed significant differences between groups: both Eating disorders groups showed clinically relevant depression levels, that were significantly higher than controls, whereas Diabetic subjects had scores not different from normal controls. The variable dyscontrol over eating behaviour was related (Bulimic Ss.) <b>to</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of anxiety in comparison with other groups. At Draw a Person test, Anorexic and Diabetic Ss. showed a less articulated body concept than normal and Bulimic Ss. While diabetes free from long term complications {{does not seem to be}} a cause of clinical depression or anxiety, the body dimension is involved in these subjects, in the area of cognitive and emotional dependence.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} a chronic high-fat diet (HFD) and chronic endurance exercise (CEE) upon muscles of varying oxidative (Ox) and glycolytic capacities. We report that chronic HFD leads <b>to</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of blood glucose and insulin concentrations. These high concentrations were due to the reduction in the activity of key proteins in the insulin-signaling (IS) cascade, leading to blunted rates of glycogen synthesis (GSR) and reduced glucose- 6 -phosphate (G 6 P) content in all muscles fiber types (MFTs) of HF-fed rodents. Conversely, CEE increased insulin sensitivity, increased GSR and G 6 P content. Our work has shown that hyperlipidemia causes all MFTs to develop insulin resistance regardless of Ox capacity. However, it appears that the Ox fibers are more severely affected by insulin resistance and that the pathogenesis of insulin resistance is different between muscle fiber types...|$|R

Theories of school choice suggest that parents need to and can make informed decisions. Choice parents should have more incentives to gather information about their child’s schools than parents without schooling options. Alternatively, a lack of any increase in information levels among school choosers would suggest that having choices per se is not sufficient motivation to overcome the costs of information gathering.

40|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} can be {{best understood}} as {{a balance between the}} production and elimination of bilirubin, with a multitude of factors and conditions affecting each of these processes. When an imbalance results because of an increase in circulating bilirubin (or the bilirubin load) <b>to</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> (severe hyperbilirubinemia), it may cause permanent neurologic sequelae (kernicterus). In most infants, an increase in bilirubin production (e. g., due to hemolysis) is the primary cause of severe hyperbilirubinemia, and thus reducing bilirubin production is a rational approach for its management. The situation can become critical in infants with an associated impaired bilirubin elimination mechanism {{as a result of a}} genetic deficiency and/or polymorphism. Combining information about bilirubin production and genetic information about bilirubin elimination with the tracking of bilirubin levels means that a relative assessment of jaundice risk might be feasible. Information on the level of bilirubin production and its rate of elimination may help to guide the clinical management of neonatal jaundice...|$|R

Here, we present the first quantitative and comparative analysis of locust transcripts, in particular pacifastin-related precursor (SGPP- 1 - 3) mRNAs, between isolated-reared (solitary) and crowd-reared (gregarious) desert locusts, revealing a phase-dependent transcriptional regulation of the corresponding genes.

Right ventricular compensation maintained cardiac index in the hemorrhage-alone group and the pneumonectomy-alone group but could not maintain cardiac index in the shock-plus-pneumonectomy group, despite maximal increases in right ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate, and right ventricular end diastolic volume. These data indicated that resuscitation from shock plus pneumonectomy cannot be effectively accomplished because increased PVR leads to right ventricular failure, which limits left ventricular preload to levels that are insufficient to maintain cardiac index...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{evolving}} and maintaining cooperation in both ecological and artificial multi-agent systems has intrigued scientists for decades. In this paper, we present an evolutionary game model that combines direct and spatial reciprocity {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of two different learning mechanisms used to promote cooperative behaviour in a social dilemma game – the N-player Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (NIPD). Unlike the two-player game, in the NIPD the action of a player typically results in a non Pareto-optimal outcome for all other players within a social group given the relative costs and benefits associated with particular actions. Consequently, promoting system-wide cooperation is extremely difficult. We use comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation experiments to show that evolutionary-based strategy adaptation and update leads <b>to</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of cooperation in the NIPD when compared to social learning via cultural imitation. This finding suggests that when designing decentralised multi-agent systems, evolutionary adaptation mechanisms should {{be incorporated into the}} model where efficient collective actions are required...|$|R
