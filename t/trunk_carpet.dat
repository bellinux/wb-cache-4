2500|$|A new ACR {{was added}} to the Viper line-up after the 2008 model year. Its {{upgrades}} were more drastic than the original, including street-legal racing tires (Michelin Pilot Sport Cups which Michelin describes as [...] "Ultra-High Performance Sport tires"), two-piece brake rotors, adjustable suspension, and significant aerodynamic revision. No engine modifications were made, so power and torque remain at 600hp (450kW) and 560lb·ft (760 N·m) as in the standard SRT-10. The ACR is street-legal, and is similar to the MOPAR Viper that Dodge displayed at various auto shows. Weight was also decreased by [...] by using the [...] "Hardcore Package", without AC, radio, speakers, amplifier, <b>trunk</b> <b>carpet,</b> hood pad or tire-inflator. Its aerodynamic upgrades produce up to 1000 pounds (4.45 kN) of downforce at , or roughly 10 times the downforce the standard Viper SRT-10 can produce at the same speed. The interior was upgraded only by the addition of a beacon-tripped lap timer (Hardcore Edition Only).|$|E

In most cars, the spare tire is secured with a bolt and wing-nut style fastener. Usually a stiff sheet of cardboard lies on top of the spare tire well with the <b>trunk</b> <b>carpet</b> on top of it to hide the spare tire and provide a pleasant look to and a flat surface for the trunk space.|$|E

When {{they got to the}} place they found the diligence in the archway, and several men were employed in carrying up <b>trunks</b> and <b>carpet</b> bags to the top of it and stowing them away there. In doing this they ascended and descended by means of a long step ladder. The men took Mr. George's trunk and Rollo's and packed them away with the rest. There were several persons who looked like passengers standing near, waiting, apparently, for the diligence to be ready.|$|R

2500|$|In 1968 Oldsmobile {{continued}} to produce five well appointed 98 body styles. Standard equipment included: dual master cylinder, four way flasher, energy-absorbing steering column, back-up lights, side marker lights, seat belts, cross-flow radiator, rear armrest ashtrays, power brakes, electric clock, special moldings, shoulder belts, Deluxe steering wheel, power steering, <b>carpeted</b> <b>trunk</b> and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission.

50|$|A {{combination}} of changes to aerodynamics and suspension tuning {{to the new}} Shelby® GT350R Mustang leads to most race-ready road-legal Mustang ever.Significant engineering innovations result in weight savings, aero improvements to benefit on-track performance; Ford is the first major automaker to introduce carbon fiber wheels as standard equipment on Shelby GT350R Mustang. Items removed include air conditioning, the stereo system, rear seats, <b>trunk</b> floorboard and <b>carpet,</b> backup camera and emergency tire sealer and inflator. Exhaust resonators also have been removed for weight savings {{with the benefit of}} creating a sharper exhaust tone.|$|R
50|$|Grand Ville enjoyed {{moderate}} success from 1971 to 1973. However, the {{oil crisis}} of late 1973 and early 1974 led to gasoline shortages, long lines at filling stations, and skyrocketing pump prices. These factors would sharply cut into full-sized car sales in 1974 as Americans were shunning big gas guzzlers {{in favor of}} smaller more fuel-efficient cars. For 1975, the Grand Ville became the Grand Ville Brougham and included more standard equipment than in previous years, such as power windows and a <b>carpeted</b> <b>trunk.</b> This would be the final year for the Grand Ville series, which also included Pontiac's last convertible until 1983. For 1976, the Grand Ville nameplate was dropped and the lineup was renamed Bonneville Brougham, returning that nameplate back to its former flagship status.|$|R

Deluxe models added halogen headlamps, remote-locking gas filler door, <b>carpeted</b> <b>trunk</b> and rear wiper-washer on the wagon.

XE offered cut pile carpeting, analogue quartz clock, remote rear window opener, low-fuel warning light, AM-FM Clarion stereo radio, power steering, tachometer and 155/13 whitewall radial tires. Sunroof was available as an option.|$|R
5000|$|EMS—Introduced in 1972, the EMS (Electronic {{injection}} Manual transmission Special) was a sportier {{model that}} was originally only {{available in a}} two-door version; but became available in the three-door 'wagonback' body from 1974 (1978 in the USA). It had a stiffer suspension and was sold in yellow or a copper coral metallic paint in '73, Sterling Silver or Sunset orange in '74, black or Sterling silver in '75 and '76, black, Sterling silver, or Cardinal red in 1977, and Sterling silver or Cardinal red in '78.

5000|$|Fury {{was offered}} in three basic {{subseries}} for 1975 in sedans and coupes and {{two for the}} station wagon.

The Salon featured plush velour bench seats with recliners and folding armrests and <b>carpeted</b> <b>trunks,</b> along with a spring-loaded hood ornament with the Plymouth logo. In addition to the Road Runner, the Fury coupes were offered in base, Custom and Sport models.

The wagons were available as either the Fury Suburban or Fury Custom Suburban.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning {{with the}} first E36 M3s delivered, BMW racers began {{pressuring}} BMW for a homologation version with which to compete against Porsche 911s in sports-car racing. A homologation version is a car with special modifications from the factory that are allowed in racing as [...] "production" [...] cars, if enough cars are made and sold.In 1995, BMW relented and offered the M3 Lightweight. The major changes to the car were to lower the weight for racing. The cars came without a radio (although the speakers were installed and the car pre-wired for the radio), air conditioning, leather seats, tool kit, or a sun roof. The doors have aluminum skins. There is no underbonnet insulation blanket and the <b>trunk</b> only has <b>carpet</b> on the floor. The under body insulation is thinner and there is special carpeting to lower weight. Overall the changes added up to 200 lb less than a standard M3.|$|R
6000|$|Did {{you ever}} try it, reader? If not, take an {{imaginary}} trip with us, just for experiment. [...] "There's the boat!" [...] exclaims a passenger in the omnibus, {{as we are}} rolling down from the Pittsburg Mansion House to the canal. [...] "Where?" [...] exclaim a dozen of voices, and forthwith a dozen heads {{go out of the}} window. [...] "Why, down there, under that bridge; don't you see those lights?" [...] "What! that little thing?" [...] exclaims an inexperienced traveller; [...] "dear me! we can't half of us get into it!" [...] "We! indeed," [...] says some old hand in the business; [...] "I think you'll find it will hold us and a dozen more loads like us." [...] "Impossible!" [...] say some. [...] "You'll see," [...] say the initiated; and, {{as soon as you get}} out, you do see, and hear too, what seems like a general breaking loose from the Tower of Babel, amid a perfect hail storm of <b>trunks,</b> boxes, valises, <b>carpet</b> bags, and every describable and indescribable form of what a westerner calls [...] "plunder." ...|$|R
5000|$|Racing {{equipment}} includes tubular exhaust headers, {{an electric}} fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical leaf springs, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, locking differential, auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by Goodyear and Mickey Thompson (himself {{a recipient of}} one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the clutch in case of disintegration under load. The claimed compression ratio was 13.5:1. Other weight-saving measures include the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side windshield wiper, arm rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, sound deadening material, <b>carpeting,</b> <b>trunk</b> mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire. Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the Econoline van; the carpeting was replaced with a black rubber mat. The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit. The high-beam headlights were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427. Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high-low 5.75 inch (146 mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch. Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics make the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.|$|R
