The news stories also reported that Genie's mother died of unspecified natural causes at the age of 87 and featured an interview with Genie's brother, who was living in Ohio, which was the only time he publicly spoke about his or Genie's lives; he told reporters that since leaving the Los Angeles area he had visited Genie and their mother only once, in 1982, and had refused to watch or read anything about Genie's life until just prior to the interview, but said he had recently heard Genie was doing well. A story by journalist Rory Carroll in The Guardian, published in July 2016, stated that Genie still lived in state care and that her brother died in 2011, and said that despite repeated efforts Susan Curtiss had been unable to renew contact with Genie.|$|E
