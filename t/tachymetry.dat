40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to compare and assess suitability of two methods of geodetic measurements (<b>tachymetry</b> i interferometry) used to determine changes of the geometric condition of building and engineering structures. The paper presents the selected results of experimental tests under dynamic loads that were conducted on a railway metal culvert. The dynamic loads were caused by the passages of various trains. The measurements were made for all trains which had been running over the culvert during a 24 hour period. Advantages and disadvantages of both applied methods were characterized. The disadvantage of the <b>tachymetry</b> method is the discreteness of measurements and the lack of the possibility of verifying the results after finishing the field works. The <b>tachymetry</b> measurements were conducted using precise <b>tachymetry</b> manufactured by Leica TC 2002. The IBIS microwave coherent radar was used in the interferometry method. Moreover, a special microwave horns IBIS-H 23 type with a maximum gain of 23 dBi were used as the interferometer antennas (transmitting and receiving). Conclusions drawn from the tests can be helpful in the measurements of such culverts...|$|E

40|$|Topographical map is {{literally}} interpreted as written explanation on the field. This {{is a job}} where state planimetric position above the earth's surface and {{the shape of the}} ground surface is measured and drawn on paper with symbols on a certain scale. Several methods for topographic mapping are <b>tachymetry,</b> offset, photogrammetry, and a measurement of field table. There are two ways form of topographic mapping with photogrammetric, that are the aerial and terrestrial. To obtain more precise data it is not unusual that both of two methods are combined. The instruments used have also been growing very rapidly such as imaging and sensing technology known as remote sensing. In addition, photogrammetric method has more high accuracy, speed and ease of obtaining coverage detailed topographic. The map-making with photogrammetry are consists of basic map-making stage with photogrammetry, flight plans, aerial cameras, benchmarks and pre-mark installation, grand control surveys, aerial triangulation, aerial rectification photographs, field identification and delineation or cartographic. Several sources of error in photogrammetry, among others are scale errors, incorrect main location, negligence camera data, un-vertical shooting, and different flying height. Photogrammetric is so important, therefore careful planned in preparing the photogrammetry is required. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of spatial relationship between sensors on a hydrographic vessel {{is crucial to}} achieving accurate multibeam bathymetry data. This project suggests undertaking the measurement of vessel’s sensor offsets by <b>tachymetry</b> and 3 D laser scanning technique. All stages of such a survey are thoroughly discussed emphasising the determination of a reference frame for a survey vessel allowing the successful deployment of survey sensors. Fundamentals of geodesy are provided to lay foundations for the proper understanding {{of the notion of}} the reference frame in surveying. Main concepts of vessel geometry are discussed to provide a reference to the used terminology. Multibeam system is briefly described focusing on the errors stemming from the misalignment of its sensors. Next, technological and methodological opportunities for successful determining of the spatial relationship between sensors located on the vessel are investigated based on the procedures practised by global hydrographic companies. Finally, the results of the undertaken survey using Leica TCR 307 Total Station and Leica C 10 Laser Scanner are analysed and compared leading to a discussion aiming at underlying strengths and limitations of both methods and recommending the most practical solution for sensor offset measurement...|$|E
40|$|A {{very large}} infrastructural {{work is being}} {{undertaken}} in Delft. A tunnel {{is going to be}} constructed to replace the current rail viaduct. As in any large infrastructural work, the monitoring of the land deformations during the period of the tunnel’s construction is highly essential. In this project, one study was performed to analyse the feasibility of PSInSAR as an independent technique for monitoring of land subsidence. The driving mechanisms for deformation were studied to find out the relations among them. Soil geophysics, hydrology, infrastructures and thermal expansion were studied in relation with deformation. Besides these, the traditional deformation monitoring methods were also studied, since they are the competitors of this technique. LiDAR, photogrammetry, <b>tachymetry,</b> levelling and GPS were considered in this study for the comparison with radar. The major attention has been given in this study to assessment of the geolocalisation quality of PSInSAR observations. We have found that the accuracy and point density of PSInSAR is sufficient for deformation monitoring. While its repeat interval {{might not be able to}} detect quick failure mechanisms, other techniques have proven to be excellent complements for this deficiency. Radar measurements are also good for validation in other fields, showing that they correlate well with thermal expansion and soil mechanics theory. Further work should be directed to improving geolocalisation and deformation models...|$|E
40|$|For {{crime scene}} {{investigation}} {{in cases of}} homicide, the pattern of bloodstains at the incident site is of critical importance. The morphology of the bloodstain pattern serves to determine the approximate blood source locations, the minimum number of blows and the positioning of the victim. In the present work, {{the benefits of the}} three-dimensional bloodstain pattern analysis, including the ballistic approximation of the trajectories of the blood drops, will be demonstrated using two illustrative cases. The crime scenes were documented in 3 D, using the non-contact methods digital photogrammetry, <b>tachymetry</b> and laser scanning. Accurate, true-to-scale 3 D models of the crime scenes, including the bloodstain pattern and the traces, were created. For the determination of the areas of origin of the bloodstain pattern, the trajectories of up to 200 well-defined bloodstains were analysed in CAD and photogrammetry software. The ballistic determination of the trajectories was performed using ballistics software. The advantages of this method are the short preparation time on site, the non-contact measurement of the bloodstains and the high accuracy of the bloodstain analysis. It should be expected that this method delivers accurate results regarding the number and position of the areas of origin of bloodstains, in particular the vertical component is determined more precisely than using conventional methods. In both cases relevant forensic conclusions regarding the course of events were enabled by the ballistic bloodstain pattern analysis...|$|E
40|$|Newgrange Passage Tomb is 76 m in {{diameter}} and 12 m high. A single 19 m inner passage leads to a chamber some 6 m {{in diameter}} and height. The possibility of further chambers existing {{has been the subject}} of interest since the partial excavation completed in 1975. Multiple passageways and chambers exist at nearby tombs at Knowth and Dowth - could there be hidden chambers at Newgrange that could be detected using geophysical methods? We present the results from a multi-method geophysical survey. The principal method used was microgravity which has found hidden cavities in the Great Pyramid at Giza in Egypt. The method has also been used to detect the presence of medieval crypts but there has been little research in the use of microgravity in the detection of chambers in mounds due to their generally small dimensions. The situation in mounds at Brú na Bóinne is different. The major chambers have quite large dimensions, thus enhancing the detection capability of microgravity. A computer simulation to predict the gravity anomaly over the Newgrange chamber was carried out. This showed that the calculated effect on gravity of the chamber volume together with its depth within the mound would produce a measurable negative gravity anomaly. The key objective of the survey was to investigate the potential of the microgravity method in the initial detection of the known chamber and subsequently in searching for possible hidden chambers. The processing and interpretation of the microgravity survey was informed by ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography, multi-frequency electromagnetic and earth resistance results. Initial gravity measurements were made over and in the vicinity of the known chamber. The position of each measurement point was precisely determined using a combination of differential GPS and laser <b>tachymetry</b> methods. Strong winds at the time of survey required windshields to be used to protect the instruments from gusts and each measurement was verified by repeat readings. The average error from repeated and independently controlled measurement points was +/- 15 microGals. This is relatively high but acceptable in the case of this survey. Data were processed to remove the effects of elevation, tidal variation, topography, latitude, and instrument drift. Topography corrections were made using LiDAR data. The output was a gravity anomaly map draped on a 3 -D model made from the LiDAR data which presents the properties and geometry of sub-surface inhomogeneities. The map shows a well developed negative anomaly over the centre of the chamber. The size of the anomaly at its centre is several times larger than the precision of the instrument and also the average error of the instruments. Further gravity measurements were made on the mound and in the chamber in order to seek further anomalies and refine the gravity model of the known chamber. The results confirm the measured gravity anomaly is significantly larger than the computed anomaly based on laser <b>tachymetry</b> measurements of the spaceform of the chamber. This leads us to believe there is an unknown feature or structure of low density associated with the known chamber. ...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{elevation}} models (DEM) {{are widely}} used to determine characteristics of mass movement processes such as accumulation and deposition of material, volume estimates or the orientation of discontinuities. To create such DEMs point cloud data is provided by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and recently used for analysis of mass movements. Therefore the reliability of TLS data was investigated in a comparative study with <b>tachymetry.</b> The main focus was {{on the possibility of}} determining movement patterns of landslides &lt; 100 mm. Therefore, several post processing steps are needed and the reliability of those were analyzed. The post processing steps that were investigated include: (1) The registration process is a crucial step considering long term TLS monitoring of an object and can be significantly improved using an iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm; (2) Filtering methods are necessary to create DEMs in order to separate favored laser points on the terrain surface (ground points) from topographically irrelevant points (non-ground-points). Therefore GIS tools were applied. Surfaces with and without vegetation cover were differentiated; (3) Displacement vectors are used to determine slope movement rates. They were created from TLS data after the computation of true orthophotos. Using the methodology presented {{it was not possible to}} determine movement rates &lt; 50 mm per period. However, if the quality of the point density is described and areas with very low point density are detected, reliable conclusions can be made regarding slope movement patterns and erosion and deposition of material for changes &lt; 100 mm for the investigated slope...|$|E
40|$|The metric {{documentation}} {{of architecture and}} cultural heritage with multi-image spherical panorama has already achieved good results, accurate and reliable (Fangi 2008, 2009). Panoramic images are generally acquired with expensive linear array rotating panoramic cameras having very high metric performances (Luhmann, Maas, 2003, 2004, and 2006). On the contrary the multiimage spherical panorama photogrammetry consists in the acquisition of partly-overlapping images taken from a unique point of view with a common digital camera and then projected on a virtual sphere with commercial stitching software; the sphere is mapped on the cartographic plane according to the equirectangular projection, producing the so-called spherical panorama. From the panorama image coordinates, the direction angles –horizontal and vertical – of an arbitrary object point are derived {{and can be used}} in a normal topographic adjustment procedure for the 3 d evaluation, obviously provided more than one panorama taken from different points of view. Two angular corrections are necessary to compensate for the non perfect verticality of the sphere axes that are the two rotation angles around the horizontal axes. Differently from <b>tachymetry</b> where all the stations are normally linked by direct measurements along the traverse legs, in spherical photogrammetry the station points are connected together by coplanarity, observing a minimum of common points, as it is usually done in photogrammetry. Finally the block bundle adjustment estimates the coordinates of the tie points and the six orientation parameters per panorama, i. e. the three sphere center coordinates and the three direction angles.

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the accuracy of LiDAR derived DEM generated based on different interpolation methods and slope classes. Initially, the study area is divided into three slope classes: (a) slope class one (0 ° ' 5 °), (b) slope class two (6 ° ' 10 °) and (c) slope class three (11 ° ' 15 °). Secondly, each slope class is tested using three distinctive interpolation methods: (a) Kriging, (b) Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and (c) Spline. Next, accuracy assessment is done based on field survey <b>tachymetry</b> data. The finding reveals that the overall Root Mean Square Error or RMSE for Kriging provided the lowest value of 0. 727 m for both 0. 5 m and 1 m spatial resolutions of oil palm area, followed by Spline with values of 0. 734 m for 0. 5 m spatial resolution and 0. 747 m for spatial resolution of 1 m. Concurrently, IDW provided the highest RMSE value of 0. 784 m for both spatial resolutions of 0. 5 and 1 m. For rubber area, Spline provided the lowest RMSE value of 0. 746 m for 0. 5 m spatial resolution and 0. 760 m for 1 m spatial resolution. The highest value of RMSE for rubber area is IDW with the value of 1. 061 m for both spatial resolutions. Finally, Kriging gave the RMSE value of 0. 790 m for both spatial resolutions...|$|E
40|$|Pavescan is a {{low cost}} mobile system for road {{modelling}} survey. Because {{of the absence of}} navigation sensors it has several practical drawbacks compared to most of the other mobile mapping systems, but those sensors are very expensive and do not fulfil most of the accuracy requirements. Pavescan will be more attractive if some of the practical drawbacks are reduced. Pavescan measures road profiles across the road by laser scanning at a series of positions. The separate scans are linked via control points, which have to be measured in an additional survey. The accuracy in height of the scans is most important (e. g. for volume calculations) and has to be in the range of millimetres. It is evaluated if integrating close range photogrammetry can achieve millimeter accuracy of the scan and reduce the number of control points. A test survey was conducted with a downward looking camera, which was mounted close to the scanner at a height of around 3. 6 metres above the road's surface. The position and orientation of the camera at each exposure is retrieved by bundle adjustment. The accuracy of the bundle adjustment depended strongly on the configuration of the control points. Due to the narrow shape of a strip of images, this configuration will always be weak. For a sequence of 28 images (43 metres), around five control points are needed to achieve sub-centimetre accuracy of the object points. If more than 36 images or fewer than four control points were used, the bundle adjustment diverged (i. e. no solution could be obtained). A reduction of control points is therefore not possible. The practical feasibility for integrating close range photogrammetry into Pavescan is low, since too many control points are needed that should spatially be well distributed and measured with <b>tachymetry</b> (or with similar accuracy). Therefore it is not recommended to integrate photogrammetry in Pavescan. Department of Optical and Laser Remote SensingAerospace Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{last years}} have seen a few severe cases of {{structural}} damage to buildings in the Netherlands. A recent case was the shopping mall ‘t Loon in Heerlen. It would be beneficial if structural failures could be avoided, or at least be predicted. New satellite technology, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), proves {{that it is possible}} to detect structural deformation in buildings at the level of millimeters and to receive weekly updates. TU Delft has shown that for the Heerlen case, the deformation could already be detected years before the collapse. The InSAR data was also used for forensic research at Heerlen. The previously discussed developments resulted in the main research question of this thesis: How can InSAR data contribute to forensic engineering and building monitoring in general? The objective is to determine in which cases data provided by radar interferometry can be used, and how this data should be interpreted for building monitoring and forensic engineering. A literature review is conducted to identify the general properties and limitations of InSAR. To research the potential contribution to forensic engineering, an analysis of a damage database is made to determine InSAR’s potential as a forensic engineering tool. The database is assessed according to the guiding principles of forensic engineering using InSAR as laid out by this thesis: opportunistic character, large deformations and no sudden deformations. A research methodology for forensic engineering with InSAR is proposed and tested with a couple of case studies. Building monitoring is subdivided into object-driven building monitoring and data-driven building monitoring. Conventional building monitoring techniques are analysed to research the potential of InSAR as a building monitoring tool. To research object-driven building monitoring, a literature study is conducted to examine the different variables that cause building movement that influence the InSAR data. One dominant variable is analysed to research the relation between a variable and the InSAR data. To research data-driven buildings monitoring, general building limits for deformations are discussed. InSAR data of Delft, provided by the TerraSAR-x satellite, is used to analyse the potential of InSAR as a data-driven building monitoring tool. Deformation areas with very high deformation rates are examined to find out how to work with InSAR as a data-driven building monitoring tool. ? The development of the movements caused by torsion, inelastic deformation, fracture, second order effects and buckling are hard to detect with InSAR. Deformation caused by failure needs to be visible on the outer shell of the structure. Damage on the outer shell is visible to InSAR, as are damages that influence the supporting structure of the building. Deformations of the supporting structure can be damped in the outer shell; this is caused by the structural integrity. One fifth of the damage cases of the damage database have potential to be researched with InSAR. Only failures caused by aging and structural errors were suitable for research. Deformation measurements for buildings is one of the building monitoring fields in which InSAR can compete. Competitors in this field are Lidar, photogrammetry, levelling, and <b>tachymetry.</b> One of the main advantages of monitoring with InSAR is that large areas can be monitored with one measurement, and no one needs to be present at the site. Object-driven monitoring of buildings can be done by monitoring a building and identifying explanations for building movements. The movement of a Persistent Scatter point (PS-point) is caused by forces that work on a building and by the resistance of the building. Forces that do not change over time will not make the building move, unless there is degradation of the building elements. InSAR measurements are most suitable for vertical deflection monitoring because of the sensitivity of the satellite measurements. Factors that are suitable to monitor with InSAR are temperature, settlement and groundwater change. Data-driven monitoring is most suitable for monitoring foundation problems. The movements are often gradual over time, and large deformations limits are allowed. Attention should be paid to the translation of the top structure of the movement. Movements of 3 mm/year of a PS-point in vertical direction, or 1. 5 mm/year relative to another PS-point on a building, are alarming. InSAR can become an addition to conventional monitoring techniques for building research. For forensic engineering InSAR can indicate which parts of building elements were influenced by the failure, and when deformation started to develop. InSAR can support evidence for the possible cause of the failure, when the failure is expressed in deformation. For building monitoring InSAR may support the indication of the development of deformation that may cause damage. The monitoring of vertical deformations is limited by the sensitivity and the phase ambiguity. These boundaries make InSAR most suitable for monitoring gradual deformations, often found in deformations of foundations.
