5|$|The Reformatory School and Cottages (1855 datestone) on Walnut Lane, is a two-storey {{building}} with three windows, now converted in cottages, <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> a rectangular courtyard. The school originally cost £255 to build.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have a blood–brain {{barrier that}} allows metabolism inside {{the brain to}} operate differently from metabolism {{in other parts of}} the body. Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> neurons, including levels of ions and nutrients.|$|E
5|$|The Narayan Sarovar is a lake <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> {{the main}} monument. The lake {{contains}} holy waters from 151rivers and lakes that {{are believed to}} have been sanctified by Swaminarayan, including Mansarovar. Surrounding the Narayan Sarovar are 108gaumukhs, symbolising Janmangal Namavali or the 108names for god, from which holy water issues forth.|$|E

5|$|The areolar glands {{are in the}} areola <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> {{the nipple}} in the female breast. These glands secrete an oily fluid that lubricates the nipple, and also secrete {{volatile}} compounds that are thought {{to serve as an}} olfactory stimulus for the newborn. During pregnancy and lactation these glands, also called Montgomery's glands, become enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid follicles {{are small}} spherical groupings of cells 0.02–0.9mm in {{diameter}} that play the main role in thyroid function. They {{consist of a}} rim that has a rich blood supply, nerve and lymphatic presence, <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> a core of colloid that consists mostly of thyroid hormone precursor proteins called thyroglobulin, an iodinated glycoprotein.|$|E
5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> a species population.|$|E

5|$|Downtown Amman, {{the city}} centre area (known in Arabic as Al-Balad), has been {{dwarfed by the}} {{sprawling}} urban area <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. Jabal Amman is a well-known touristic attraction in old Amman, where the city's greatest souks, fine museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous Rainbow Street and the cultural Souk Jara market.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus zapfei can be {{identified}} as a Miniopterus {{on the basis of}} the possession of three lower premolars (designated p2, p3, and p4, because the original first premolar has been lost); a two-rooted p3; and the nyctalodont molars, with the posterolophid (a crest at the back of the molar) behind the entoconid cusp. M.zapfei is about 30% larger than M.fossilis and has a more slender p4. Compared to living Miniopterus, the cingulum (shelf) <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> the P4 is less well-developed and the parastyle crest is weaker.|$|E
5|$|People {{associated}} with the church include Henry Maurice (elected Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford {{shortly before his death}} in 1691; his father, Thomas, was the perpetual curate of the church) and the 19th-century writer and priest Owen Wynne Jones (who was the curate for a time in the early 1860s). The 19th-century Calvinistic Methodist preacher Richard Owen was born in the parish, and is buried in the graveyard <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> the church.|$|E

5|$|The England manager {{may also}} involve himself in wider issues beyond the on-the-field team issues. The England manager is {{expected}} to advise the FA on how to approach the complex bidding system <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> the arrangement of fixtures for a qualifying campaign. On a more tactical level, {{a host of other}} details can be influenced; Capello is even believed to have instructed the Wembley ball boys to return balls at speed when they go out of play.|$|E
5|$|The choir {{is where}} the priest and/or a choral group sings the psalms. It {{is located in the}} central nave between the main door and the high altar, and built in a semicircular fashion, much like Spanish cathedrals. It was built by Juan de Rojas between 1696 and 1697. Its sides contain 59reliefs of various saints done in mahogany, walnut, cedar and a native wood called tepehuaje. The railing <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> the choir was made in 1722 by Sangley Queaulo in Macao, China and placed in the cathedral in 1730.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found in nearly every protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|E

5|$|Archaea {{can also}} be commensals, benefiting from an {{association}} without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii {{is by far the}} most common archaean in the human flora, making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human gut. In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> plant roots (the rhizosphere).|$|E
5|$|At the {{southeast}} end of Spring Street is Riverside Drive, which {{provides some of}} the most scenic views of the Ohio River and the eastern Louisville shoreline because of the limited alterations compared to other sections of the Ohio River in the Louisville area. Houseboats are docked along the Ohio River {{on the south side of}} Riverside Drive. The north side of Riverside Drive has a variety of architectural styles and is mostly residential. Unlike the other prominent streets, Riverside drive is outside the flood-wall <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> most of the city and was built two feet higher than the height the Ohio River flood of 1937.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{of active}} {{volcanic}} {{activity on the}} moon Io was probably the greatest surprise. It {{was the first time}} active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the Solar System. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire Jovian system. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> the planet influenced by the planet's strong magnetic field. Sulfur, oxygen, and sodium, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by impact of high-energy particles, were detected at {{the outer edge of the}} magnetosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Historian David Detzer {{has argued}} that the fame <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> the 11th New York is misplaced. During its time in service, the 11th New York Regiment saw little {{fighting}} compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York, 20th Maine, and 28th Massachusetts. The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York, also known as the Second Fire Zouaves, which fought at Antietam, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. In addition, Ellsworth failed to consider that the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes. The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment. In that respect, 11th New York was no different than many regiments, North and South.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the Pectinidae family, the Antarctic scallop is a {{suspension}} feeder, extracting its nourishment from the sea water <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> it. Bands of cilia on the velum, a curtain-like fold of the mantle, waft particles towards the gills. Oxygen is absorbed by the gills and food particles, mostly microscopic algae, are trapped in mucous and transported to the mouth by cilia. There is a seasonal increase in microscopic ice algae which become available to suspension feeders when the sea ice melts in the summer, and most of the annual growth takes place at this time. Research has shown that this is {{as a result of the}} rise in sea temperature and not the greater availability of food.|$|E
5|$|Skírnir {{requests}} that Freyr {{give him}} a horse and Freyr's sword; a sword which fights jötnar by itself. Under the cover of darkness, Skírnir rides the horse over nations and dew-covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr, {{the home of the}} jötnar, and proceeds to Gymir's courts. Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden fence <b>that</b> <b>surrounds</b> Gerðr's hall. Skírnir rides out to a herdsman (unnamed) sitting on a mound, greets him, and asks the herdsman how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir's dogs. An exchange occurs between the herdsman and Skírnir, during which the herdsman tells Skírnir that he will never speak to the girl.|$|E
