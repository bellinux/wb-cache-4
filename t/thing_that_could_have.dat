25|$|For their sophomore release, {{the band}} {{chose to stay}} with their record label The Control Group, founded by Nabil Ayers. Ayers stated that touring with Vendetta Red was the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{happened}} to the band, comparing it to touring with the band Green Day. He expressed that touring with a band with a similar style and an already established fanbase would influence the band members positively.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely mixed. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "disappointing". Despite noting that it is [...] "a totally serviceable episode of Adventure Time", {{he argued that the}} episode felt too much like an episode from the show's first or second seasons, when installments were often lacking in depth and a bit more uneven across the board. He noted that, [...] "Tonight’s episode is for the kids. It’s simple and easy to follow, and doesn’t contain any unsettling imagery … but that also prevents it from being especially memorable." [...] Ultimately, he felt that the show's returned fixation on Finn and Jake proved that the expansion of the show's universe was [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> happened to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Hed PE {{signed with}} Jive Records, {{releasing}} their self-titled debut album in 1997. In {{his review of}} the album, Allmusic's Steve Huey wrote [...] "There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well with late-'90s metal and punk fans." [...] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "We had these romantic visions of the music industry, and {{we thought it would be}} cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also probably the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> happened. [...] We've had offers from Sony and others that we can't take because we owe Jive so much money." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Häkkinen {{said that he was}} [...] "pleased" [...] to win the race and admitted that he waited until the pit stop phase to have any chance of overtaking Michael Schumacher. He said that his team had more work to do on his car and was looking forward to the next race. Coulthard believed he made the right decision to compete in the Grand Prix despite his injuries and that the result was [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> happened for the team and myself." [...] He also said he was looking forward to resting over the coming days to allow his injuries to heal. Barrichello admitted that the race had not been good for him until his overtake on Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher and said the absence of Stepney caused his second pit stop to be slower than usual.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Stransky was {{favorable}} of both Strong's narration {{and performance}} in the fifth season episode [...] "The Best <b>Thing</b> <b>That</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Have</b> Ever Happened", describing Mary Alice's role in the episode as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and writing: [...] "I know we hear Brenda Strong nearly every week in her voiceovers, {{but it was so}} nice to see her on screen again! That lady can act." [...] Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic was bored by Mary Alice's flashback scenes in the sixth season episode [...] "Epiphany", believing them to be unrealistic. Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing: [...] "There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of [...] Lane and politely promise to keep in touch and visit, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know: They won’t keep in touch, and they won’t visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings we experience every day, even as we try to deny their finality." [...] Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming [...] "one of the most familiar on television". As a result of her popularity as the series' narrator, Anna Silman of Vulture magazine described Strong as [...] "everybody's favorite deceased housewife/omniscient narrator" [...] in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Starr {{expressed}} {{regret for}} ever having asked the Department of Justice to assign him {{to oversee the}} Lewinsky investigation personally, saying, [...] "the most fundamental <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been done differently" [...] {{would have been for}} somebody else to have investigated the matter.|$|E

Sue says it was her gun and she misfired it while checking it, to protect Becky. Coach Roz replaces Sue as the cheerleader squad coach and takes her office. Sue later starts working as a personal trainer, and Blaine tries {{to get her back}} on McKinley's faculty, but she denies his offer by saying that getting fired was the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> ever happened to her, because now, as a trainer, people respect her, and also admits that does not miss the Cheerios at all.|$|E
2500|$|Coming off {{his third}} NHL season, Clarke {{was the last}} player Team Canada {{selected}} {{to play in the}} Summit Series. His line with Ron Ellis and Paul Henderson turned out to be Canada's best during the series, Clarke tallying two goals and four assists in the eight game series won by Canada as well as being awarded Team Canada MVP in game one of the series. Clarke's play earned the respect of many during the series, Henderson saying, [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> happened to Ronnie (Ellis) and me was to get this young kid making plays for us. He was terrific!" [...] Wayne Cashman would add, [...] "There were guys on Team Canada who took their game to new heights in that series. A perfect example would be Bobby Clarke." [...] The Soviet team's assistant coach, Boris Kulagin, thought Clarke was Canada's best player. Clarke's strong play was largely attributed to the fact that, unlike many of the Canadian players, Clarke reported to training camp in top physical condition, as he had always followed a strict off-season training regimen. [...] Though he earned much praise due to his play, he was also criticized for an incident during the sixth game which is often referred to as, [...] "The Slash." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the praise}} from the England side, Pietersen {{claimed he was}} dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen {{felt that this was}} due to the country's racial quota system, in which provincial sides were {{required}} to have at least four black players. Pietersen's view was that players should be judged on merit, and described it as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] when he was left out of the side, although he later reflected [...] "it turned out it was the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> happened". Pietersen has since firmly criticised the quota system, which he feels forced him out of the country of his birth. He has also criticised Graeme Smith, who became captain of the South African side in 2003, calling him [...] "an absolute muppet, childish and strange" [...] and that his behaviour [...] "leaves a lot to be desired". Smith opposed this, saying, [...] "I'm patriotic about my country, and that's why I don't like Kevin Pietersen. The only reason that Kevin and I have never had a relationship is because he slated South Africa". Pietersen's outspoken views published in his autobiography, Crossing the Boundary, in September 2006, and in an interview for the South African edition of GQ magazine, led to unsuccessful calls for an ICC investigation regarding bringing the game into disrepute.|$|E

5000|$|Ramis {{notes in}} the DVD {{documentary}} that TV Guide had originally given the film two stars (out of four) when it began showing on cable television in the early 1980s, but over time, the rating had gone up to three stars.

50|$|The {{expedition}} team {{lived in}} a small town called Mandisha for the length of their stay. The day after Stromer's arrival, his plans to start exploring were stopped by worsening weather that included, of all <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> hindered them in the desert, rain. He commenced to plan exploring the morning after, but around midnight a huge sandstorm blew into Mandisha that continued to rage on through the next day, forcing everyone to stay in the tent.|$|R
2500|$|The {{removal of}} such {{officials}} was controversial, with {{one member of}} the anti-Chávez coalition stating that [...] "In hindsight, it was the most idiotic <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been done, ... But we had just come out of an ambush and we were venting our distaste for the people who occupied those positions, so everyone applauded the dissolution." [...] "The way the provisional government abandoned the constitution produced a very strong reaction – it was a big mistake" [...] said Congressman Felipe Mujica, member of a socialist party that had broken with Chávez but been excluded from the new government. [...] "That, and the way they were pursuing his political allies, arresting them, created the impression that this was not the right way." [...] Such actions fragmented the broad anti-Chávez coalition which had supported the coup, with many viewing it as [...] "the triumph of a small oligarchic elite." [...] "Carmona was really placed in a trap" [...] Anibal Romero, a Venezuelan political science professor, told The Los Angeles Times. [...] "He couldn't leave the National Assembly in power and govern the country, because it was full of Chávez supporters. But if he dissolved it, he would be declared anti-democratic." [...] Another mistake was that, although he had spent months working closely with labour leader Carlos Ortega, he appointed no labor leaders to his cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|After her mother's presumed death, Kiki starts {{building}} {{a relationship with}} Silas. Actress Hayley Erin said [...] "They have a little relationship, and it's sweet" [...] but Silas cannot replace Ava. Kiki really tries to establish that connection with Silas and they do but [...] "She just wishes he were around more." [...] In [...] "losing" [...] Ava, Kiki [...] "lost herself" [...] and resorts to questionable actions such as drugging Michael {{in an attempt to}} make sure he loses custody of their sister. Kiki descends further into turmoil when she finds Silas stabbed to death and believing Franco is guilty she feels [...] "sheer hatred" [...] for him. What makes it most difficult is that she has trusted Franco so much. Kiki is very relieved when Franco is proven to be innocent of her father's murder and Ava, who has been passing herself off as Ava's twin is revealed to be alive. Hayley Erin was quite upset by the decision to kill off Silas. [...] "I took it personally" [...] she said. The actress later continued, [...] "But it made for a great storyline {{and there was a lot}} of great material for all of us." [...] Instead of focusing on whether Kiki was aware that Ava was truly alive in her portrayal, Erin went with the most basic off all the emotions with Kiki only being happy to have her mother back. Kiki's glee at having Ava back is ruined when she learns about Ava and Morgan's secret affair. Erin noted the irony of Kiki having Ava for a mother as [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> happened to anyone" [...] while the actress said getting to work opposite Maura West is the [...] "greatest thing that could ever happen to anyone." [...] She continued, [...] "I love it, because she makes me step up my game." ...|$|E

It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do something else. That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship."
