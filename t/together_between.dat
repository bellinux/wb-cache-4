5|$|Male Scyllarus latus carry spermatophores at {{the base}} of the last two pairs of pereiopods in April. Fertilisation has not been {{observed}} in this species, but most reptant decapods mate with the ventral surfaces <b>together.</b> <b>Between</b> July and August, females carry around 100,000 eggs on their enlarged, feathery pleopods. The eggs develop from being a bright orange colour to a dark brown before being shed into the water after around 16 days of development. There is normally only one generation per year.|$|E

5|$|By the 9th century, kings {{from all}} the four castes had {{occupied}} the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India. Admitting Kshatriyas to Vedic schools along with Brahmins was customary, but {{the children of the}} Vaishya and Shudra castes were not allowed. Landownership by people of all castes is recorded in inscriptions Intercaste marriages in the higher castes were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys, but was relatively frequent among other castes.

5|$|The 2010 box set Collaborations was one {{of several}} reissue {{projects}} celebrating Shankar's 90th birthday.

The first two of these albums had long been out of print, and their inclusion in the box set marked the debut CD release for both titles. Disc four contains a previously unissued concert film from 1974, titled Music Festival from India – Live at the Royal Albert Hall.|$|E
5|$|The ten {{pre-production}} gliders {{were eventually}} {{delivered by the}} end of 1942, and the first production glider was put <b>together</b> <b>between</b> March and April 1943. Production of parts and the building of complete gliders continued throughout 1943, but production schedules continued to fall behind, particularly when the United States Army Air Forces became interested in the glider, requiring a significant number to be completed for Operation Overlord, the airborne landings in Normandy, and a number of others {{to be used in the}} Far East. This placed further pressure on GAL and the Hamilcar Production Group, as the USAAF demands would require further production and new flight trials to see if the glider would operate effectively in a tropical climate. In late 1943 the USAAF required 140 Hamilcars, which would be used to transport bulldozers and other construction equipment for airfield building, and in November it was agreed that 50 would be supplied to them by June 1944. However, the continued slow production of the gliders so concerned the USAAF that it cancelled its requirement in February 1944; this meant that American personnel who had been helping with the production of the gliders were withdrawn and production times were further delayed. It also meant that only British airborne forces would use the Hamilcar. By January 1944 only 27 Hamilcars had been erected and were ready for use; a total of 53 had been produced, but the rest were in storage awaiting parts to complete them or to be erected. Finding personnel to erect the gliders, and airfields to store them, continued to be a problem. By June, however, eighty of the gliders had been manufactured and erected and were ready for use in airborne operations, in time for a small number to be used during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy. Production continued throughout the conflict and finally ended in 1946, with a total of 344 being produced.|$|E

This congregation held Puritan beliefs comparable to other non-conforming movements (i.e., groups not in communion with the Church of England) led by Robert Browne, John Greenwood, and Henry Barrowe. As Separatists, they also held that their differences with the Church of England were irreconcilable and that their worship should be independent of the trappings, traditions, and organization of a central church—unlike those Puritans who maintained their membership in and allegiance to the Church of England.|$|E

The couple toured there widely <b>together</b> <b>between</b> December 1924 and late February 1925, when, after Willem Mengelberg had failed to persuade Erb to sing the St Matthew Passion in New York City, amid press sensations offering to 'buy' the performance, Erb left Maria to complete her tour and went home. He had to deliver Matthew Passions twice each in Munich, Elberfeld, Dortmund, Hagen, Cologne and Haarlem, all between 22 March and 13 April. America did not suit Erb as it suited Ivogün, and although their partnership continued for several years, they began to go their separate ways.|$|E

25|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Geological Society of London on 18 December 1912, Charles Dawson claimed that a workman at the Piltdown gravel pit had given him a {{fragment}} of the skull four years earlier. According to Dawson, workmen at the site discovered the skull shortly before his visit and broke it up in the belief that it was a fossilised coconut. Revisiting the site on several occasions, Dawson found further fragments of the skull and took them to Arthur Smith Woodward, keeper of the geological department at the British Museum. Greatly interested by the finds, Woodward accompanied Dawson to the site. Though the two worked <b>together</b> <b>between</b> June and September 1912, Dawson alone recovered more skull fragments and half of the lower jaw bone. The skull unearthed in 1908 was the only find discovered in situ, with most of the other pieces found in the gravel pit's spoil heaps.|$|E

25|$|Liverpool did {{the double}} over Everton in 2007–08. However, the meeting at Goodison Park was {{shrouded}} in controversy when after a coming <b>together</b> <b>between</b> Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Everton's Tony Hibbert, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded Liverpool a penalty {{and seemed to}} change his mind in favour of a red card for Hibbert after Gerrard appeared to have said something to him, when most pundits felt a caution would have been sufficient. Everton dominated the game after going behind, but were denied what seemed to be two clear penalties in the closing stages of the game when Joleon Lescott was twice wrestled to the ground by Jamie Carragher at Everton corners. The victory helped secure a top-four finish and Champions League qualification for Liverpool, leaving Everton to settle for a UEFA Cup place. Referee Clattenburg was not chosen to officiate again at Goodison Park after that match until December 2013, six years later, and in that period only officiated one Everton game, away at Aston Villa.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), {{the federal}} agency {{responsible}} for funding health research, recommended in 2010 against funding a pan-Canadian trial of liberation therapy {{because there was a}} lack of evidence on the safety or efficacy of the procedure. It suggested a scientific expert working group made up of the principal investigators for the seven MS Society-sponsored studies. The health minister accepted the CIHR recommendation and said that Canada was not going to fund clinical trials. The expert panel was created by the end of 2010 <b>together</b> <b>between</b> the CIHR and the MS Society of Canada. It has been proposed that the creation of this expert panel was partly directed to cope with the high levels of social pressure the CCSVI theory had raised and at the same time try to maintain a scientific perspective in the funding and investigation of CCSVI. The main task of the panel was to monitor the results of the ongoing studies in the relationship between CCSVI and MS and recommend the funding of a clinical trial in case that there was evidence of a true relationship between the two. In 2011, the Canadian federal government announced that they would fund clinical trials of the procedure to widen the veins since CIHR considered that evidence of venous abnormalities in MS was enough for small treatment trials. It has been proposed that the recommendation to fund phase I and II trials instead of a big study was a compromise between the high levels of social and political pressure and the low level of evidence on the theory.|$|E

500|$|... "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} English {{musician}} John Lennon that was released as the opening track of the 1973 album Ringo by Ringo Starr.
