5|$|As {{the site}} of the Necropolis station had been {{intentionally}} chosen to abut the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted as an obstacle to any {{increase in the number of}} lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC <b>track.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E

Many of his works have been published in histories of New Zealand but his name is best known now through the Heaphy <b>Track</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north-west corner of the South Island. He and Brunner were probably the first Europeans to walk through this area of the South Island and the Heaphy Track, though he never followed its route, is named in his honour.|$|E

5|$|Norsk Vinterturistforening {{was founded}} in 1899 to work towards {{encouraging}} English tourists to visit Oslo, specifically by building tobogganing tracks. A committee was established in 1904 to look into building a new tobogganing <b>track</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holmenkollen area. It proposed that two new tracks be built, one from Voksenkollveien to Peisestuen, and one from Peisestuen to Midtstuen, and that Korketrekkeren be upgraded to allow for safer tobogganing. The investments cost 7,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) and the annual operating costs estimated at NOK2,000. The investments were financed with NOK2,000 by Christiania Brænnevinssamlag and NOK5,000 by Akeforeningen. The latter was established in 1905 and was also responsible to operating the track.|$|E

5|$|As {{the film}} opens a black Ferrari circles on a race <b>track</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert, its engine roaring {{in and out}} of the shot. When it {{eventually}} stops, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) steps out. Marco is a Hollywood actor who, despite his recent rise to fame, does not feel much meaning in his daily life. He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star (Michelle Monaghan), gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy (Chris Pontius), a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco spends much time alone, driving his Ferrari motorcar, drinking beer, taking pills, and having casual sex with various women. Twice he has pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) set up their equipment and perform in his room, the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.|$|E
