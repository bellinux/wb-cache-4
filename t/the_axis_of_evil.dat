A large number of e-mails protesting the race results crashed the Olympic Committee's email server, and thousands of accusatory letters, many of which contained death threats, were sent to Ohno and the committee. Ohno shared his thoughts on the Koreans' hostile reaction by saying, [...] "I was really bothered by it. I grew up around many Asian cultures, Korean one of them. A lot {{of my best friends}} were Korean growing up. I just didn't understand. Later on I realized that was built up by certain people and that was directed at me, negative energy from other things, not even resulting around the sport, but around politics, using me to stand on the pedestal as the anti-American sentiment". Earlier the same year, President George Bush had named North Korea as one of three members of <b>the</b> <b>Axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evil,</b> which had upset some South Koreans; directing their anger at Ohno was a less direct way of voicing anger against Bush's decision. The controversy continued at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held jointly in South Korea and Japan several months after the Olympics. When the South Korean football (soccer) team scored a goal against the U.S. team, Korean players Ahn Jung-Hwan and Lee Chun-Soo made an exaggerated move imitating the move Ohno had made during the speed skating event to indicate the other athlete had drifted into his lane.|$|E

Benjamin supported banning partial-birth abortion, except for cases where the mother's life is at risk, and abolishing unfunded Medicaid mandates on municipalities.

5000|$|The phrase was {{attributed}} to former Bush speechwriter David Frum, originally as <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> hatred and then evil. Frum explained his rationale for creating <b>the</b> phrase <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>evil</b> in his book The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush. Essentially, the story begins in late December 2001 when head speechwriter Michael Gerson gave Frum the assignment of articulating the case for dislodging the government of Saddam Hussein in Iraq {{in only a few}} sentences for the upcoming State of the Union address. Frum says he began by rereading President Franklin D. Roosevelt's [...] "date which will live in infamy" [...] speech given on December 8, 1941, after the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. While Americans needed no convincing about going to war with Japan, Roosevelt saw the greater threat to the United States coming from Nazi Germany, and he had {{to make the case for}} fighting a two-ocean war.|$|R
40|$|After War was {{published}} five years too late. Had the book been in print in 2003 —and had George W. Bush read it—he might {{have realized that}} invading Iraq to topple Saddam Hus-sein and light the fires {{of democracy in the}} Middle East would be a fool’s errand. Four thousand American lives and untold billions in national treasure later, the process of Iraqi nation-building is still ongoing (as it is in Afghanistan, for that matter), with no end in sight. Even before Woodrow Wilson pledged to “make the world safe for democracy ” by dis-patching an armed expeditionary force to the fields of Flanders, the United States had been attempting to export its liberal values at the point of a gun. Christopher Coyne, an assistant professor of economics at West Virginia University, begins After War by summarizing the record of American military interventionism in the 20 th and 21 st centuries. Beginning with Cuba and the Philippines in 1898, both of which were occupied by US forces during and after the Spanish-American War, Coyne reckons that the United States has intervened mili-tarily on foreign soil 27 times since, a count that includes two more invasions of Cuba, three of Nicaragua, and two each of Panama, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. He then rates the US occupations as successes or failures according to whether the occupied country achieved a score of + 4 or better on the Polity IV scale at intervals of five, ten, 15 and 20 years on. Although a score of + 4 is not a very high hurdle (Iran rated a + 3 in 2003), Coyne finds that military occupation and reconstruction has failed more often than not. The handful of success stories includes the Philippines, which was occupied from {{the turn of the century}} until the end of the Second World War; the principal members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>Axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evil</b> (Aus...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Large-scale {{anomalies}} {{have been}} reported in CMB data with both WMAP and Planck data. These could be due to foreground residuals and or systematic effects, though their confirmation with Planck data suggests they are not due to a problem in the WMAP or Planck pipelines. If these anomalies are in fact primordial, then understanding their origin is fundamental to either validate the standard model of cosmology or to explore new physics. We investigate three other possible issues: 1) the trade-off between minimising systematics due to foreground contamination (with a conservative mask) and minimising systematics due to masking, 2) astrophysical secondary effects (the kinetic Doppler quadrupole and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect), and 3) secondary cosmological signals (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect). We address the masking issue by considering new procedures that use both WMAP and Planck to produce higher quality full-sky maps using the sparsity methodology (LGMCA maps). We show the impact of masking is dominant over that of residual foregrounds, and the LGMCA full-sky maps can be used without further processing to study anomalies. We consider four official Planck PR 1 and two LGMCA CMB maps. Analysis of the observed CMB maps shows that only the low quadrupole and quadrupole-octopole alignment seem significant, but that <b>the</b> planar octopole, <b>Axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evil,</b> mirror parity and cold spot are not significant in nearly all maps considered. After subtraction of astrophysical and cosmological secondary effects, only the low quadrupole may still be considered anomalous, meaning the significance of only one anomaly is affected by secondary effect subtraction out of six anomalies considered.
