2500|$|Socrates asks Hippias if Homer has not portrayed Achilles as a wily man. [...] Hippias {{counters}} that Achilles {{is the most}} straightforward of men, simple and true, and cites a passage where Achilles declares his hatred for men who <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> and say another, or who do not do {{what they say they}} will do. [...] Socrates does not object to Hippias' literalism, and seems to abandon the literary question, saying that Homer is dead, and the thing cannot be resolved (365d). He tells Hippias that because he agrees with Homer that a simple and true man is better than a wily and cunning one, he will let him speak for Homer.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} there will," [...] said Ralph. [...] "Sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> and {{sometimes}} another. One week I'm full of a scheme about a new garden and a conservatory, and a bow-window to the drawing-room; and then, the next week, I think that the two rooms I live in at present will be enough for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{there he}} fell in with a deep, dark, deadly, and {{destructive}} war, waged by the princes and potentates of those parts, both spiritual and temporal, against what do you <b>think?</b> <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> I am sure of. That unless I told you, you would never know; nor how they waged that war either; for all their strategy and art military consisted in the safe and easy process of stopping their ears and screaming, [...] "Oh, don't tell us!" [...] and then running away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} got a licking, no doubt, señor; but I was pretty {{accustomed}} to that, {{and it did not}} trouble me in any way. At any rate, it did not cure me of my love for mischief. I am afraid I never shall be cured of that. I used to have no end of fun in the regiment, and I think that it did us all good. It takes some thinking to work out a bit of mischief properly, and I suppose if one can <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> out well, one can think out another." ...|$|E
6000|$|Helen sighed. [...] "I suppose," [...] she confessed, [...] "I am {{the narrowest}} person on earth. I can <b>think</b> of <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> and <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> only. If Mr. Lessingham keeps his word, Dick {{will be here}} perhaps in a month, perhaps six weeks--certainly soon!" ...|$|R

6000|$|But I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> if anything, would stagger their simple old Saxon faith; {{one thing}} {{would make them}} fearful, as indeed it makes the preacher this day, that the time of real brotherhood and peace is still but too far off; and that the {{achievements}} of our physical science, the unity of this great Exhibition, noble as they are, are still only dim forecastings and prophecies, as it were, of a higher, nobler reality. And they would say sadly to us, their children: [...] "Sons, {{you ought to be}} so near to God; He seems to have given you so much and to have worked among you as He never worked for any nation under heaven. How is it that you give the glory to yourselves, and not to Him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{about that}} we know nothing. St. Paul himself never says that hell is below the earth. Indeed (and {{this is a very}} {{noteworthy}} thing) St. Paul never, in his epistles, mentions in plain words hell at all; so what St. Paul thought about the matter, we can never know. Whether by Christ's descending into the lower parts of the earth, he meant descending into hell, or merely that our Lord came down on this earth of ours, poor, humble, and despised, laying his glory by for a while, this we cannot tell. Some wise men <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> some another. Two of the wisest and best of the great old fathers of the Church think that he meant only Christ's death and burial. So how dare I give a positive opinion, where wiser men than I differ? ...|$|E

Besides," [...] said Catherine, [...] "I have got plenty of money of my own. We shall be very well off; and now hasn't he got his business? I am delighted about that business." [...] She went on talking, showing {{a good deal of}} {{excitement}} as she proceeded. Her aunt had never seen her with just this manner, and Mrs. Penniman, observing her, set it down to foreign travel, which had made her more positive, more mature. She thought also that Catherine had improved in appearance; she looked rather handsome. Mrs. Penniman wondered whether Morris Townsend would be struck with that. While she was engaged in this speculation, Catherine broke out, with a certain sharpness, [...] "Why are you so contradictory, Aunt Penniman? You seem to <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> at one time, and another at another. A year ago, before I went away, you wished me not to mind about displeasing father; and now you seem to recommend me to take another line. You change about so." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{can give}} you some green tea, though I am afraid {{it might be a}} good deal better than it is, and our crockery is not all you have been used to," [...] he said. [...] "You see, we have only time to <b>think</b> of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> until the sowing is through." ...|$|R
60|$|She withdrew {{somewhat}} hastily, and Alison sat still, {{almost too}} troubled {{to be capable}} of indignation, forcing herself to <b>think.</b> <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> was becoming clear; she must escape from Winnipeg before the unpleasant suggestion was made to her again, perhaps by some man in person, and go on farther West. After all, she had one friend, the one her mother had persecuted, living somewhere within reach of a station which she had discovered was situated about three hundred miles down the line, and Florence might take her in, for a time at least. She decided to set out and try to find her the next day. Rising with sudden determination, she walked across to the station to make inquiries about the train, and as she reached it a man strode up to her. It was evident that he meant to speak, and as there was just then no official to whom she could appeal, she drew herself up and faced him resolutely. He was a young man, neatly dressed in store clothes, though he did not look like an inhabitant of the city, and he had what she could not help admitting was a pleasant expression.|$|E
5000|$|In his own time, it was {{challenged}} by Hobbes {{who in the}} Objections says, “Moreover, M. Descartes should consider afresh what 'more reality' means. Does reality admit of more and less? Or does he <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> can {{be more of a}} thing than another? If so, he should consider how this can be explained to us with that degree of clarity that every demonstration calls for, and which he himself has employed elsewhere.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... a) The {{action of}} a {{deceitful}} person is to <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> speak something else {{and do something}} entirely different. There is no harmony in his thought, speech and actions. Such a person loses credibility very quickly and lives in constant anxiety and fear of his deception being exposed. Being straightforward or honest, oils the wheel of life. You will {{be seen to be}} reliable and trustworthy. Deceitful actions lead to the influx of karmas.|$|E

5000|$|In his {{acceptance}} speech, Hoskins asked the question, [...] "What is success?", {{and part of}} his answer was, [...] "I didn't get to do what I wanted so I did something I could live with. I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that's been {{very important to me}} is that I try not to live in the past." [...] He also thanked the audience: [...] "...I want to thank {{each and every one of}} you. I'm sure glad you didn't forget me." ...|$|E
50|$|Corbet {{talking about}} the casting and {{characters}} in the film said that I have intentionally not revealed {{the identity of the}} (the boy who will become leader) character. And it's a funny thing because it's not for the reasons that people <b>think.</b> <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> I will happily tell everybody is that the character is not Hitler laughs. And the character is not Mussolini. It's someone else. And there's the dramatic event where you learn who this person is and that's something I want to save for people. Robert Pattinson is not playing Hitler as you now know laughs. I'll go on the record saying that.|$|E
5000|$|Centuries later, French {{scientist}} and philosopher, Blaise Pascal wrote that [...] "People ... arrive at their beliefs {{not on the}} basis of proof, but on the basis of what they find attractive." [...] Baruch Spinoza characterized emotions as having the power to [...] "make the mind inclined to <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> rather than another." [...] Disagreeing with Seneca the Younger that emotion was a corrupter of reason, the 18th century English philosopher George Campbell argued, instead, that emotions were allies of reason, and that they aid in the assimilation of knowledge. At the same time, Campbell warned of the malleability of emotion and the consequent risk in terms of suggestibility: ...|$|E

The Billy character's final {{monologue}} in the film echoes remarks Dylan made in a 1997 interview with David Gates of Newsweek: [...] "I don't think I'm tangible to myself. I mean, I <b>think</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> today and I think another thing tomorrow. I change {{during the course of a}} day.

Also honored that year were Sidney Poitier, Lena Horne, Ruby Dee and Quincy Jones. He was interviewed about his career then and now: [...] "I want it on record that I never once traded on the name of Farina. I have built a pretty good name for myself in the rehabilitation field and I hate to sound like a braggart...
