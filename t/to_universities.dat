40|$|Due {{to large}} {{immigrant}} student numbers enrolled in post-secondary education in Canada, adjustment of immigrant youth to mainstream {{culture at the}} university level is an important issue for Canadian educators. However, research on immigrant students’ adjustment while attending Canadian educational institutions is scarce. The purpose of the present thesis was to address this gap by examining Canadian immigrant students’ adjustment <b>to</b> <b>university</b> and <b>to</b> identify potential protective factors that predict immigrant students’ successful adjustment. The adjustment of immigrant students <b>to</b> <b>university</b> was examined by comparing immigrant and Canadian-born students on attachment <b>to</b> <b>university</b> and academic, social and emotional adjustment <b>to</b> <b>university</b> using the Student Adjustment to College Questionnaire (SACQ). Participants were 75 students from two Canadian universities. Results showed that Canadian-born students scored higher in attachment <b>to</b> <b>university</b> than foreign-born students, but did not differ on the other adjustment scales. There were similarities and {{differences between the two groups}} in how family demographic and relationship variables related <b>to</b> <b>university</b> adjustment. Neither age at arrival nor years in Canada were found <b>to</b> relate <b>to</b> <b>university</b> adjustment in the immigrant group. While raising new questions, the present study contributes to existing research on the adaptation of foreign-born youth to the host culture as well as to findings on students’ adjustment <b>to</b> <b>university...</b>|$|R

5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their {{contribution}} to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached <b>to</b> <b>universities</b> and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{education}} system was {{enhanced by the}} establishment of the University of Mysore in 1916 by Maharaja Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV. Until reorganisation and renaming of Mysore State, Mysore University was the supreme university and prescribed education in and around the Kingdom of Mysore. Various disciplines were, later, delegated to subsidiary institutions, which later grew up <b>to</b> <b>universities.</b> Owing to rapid increase in the student population, department of medicine was transferred to Rajiv Gandhi University in 1984. Later, in 1998, a surge in engineering disciplines and students forced the spawning of Visvesvaraya Technological University. Old institutes that were affiliated of the University in these disciplines now continue to operate in affiliation to the new ones or in autonomy: Mysore Medical College & Research Institute is affiliated to Rajiv Gandhi University, while engineering and technical institutions like the National Institute of Engineering and SJCE function autonomously.|$|E
40|$|Whilst new {{friendships and}} an active social life are {{commonly}} discussed features of ‘being a student’, {{there is limited}} empirical research that has quantitatively studied the contribution that social factors play in students’ university experience.

This paper presents research into students’ social relationships at <b>university,</b> their attachment <b>to</b> the <b>university,</b> and how these elements link <b>to</b> <b>university</b> adjustment. Undergraduates (n = 135) completed questionnaires measuring their attachment <b>to</b> <b>university</b> peers, attachment <b>to</b> the <b>university,</b> experiences of problematic peer relationships, and quality of adjustment <b>to</b> <b>university</b> life. Students who reported strong attachment with their peers also had higher levels of university adjustment and university attachment. Students who reported difficulties in their relationships with other students had lower levels of peer attachment and <b>university</b> adjustment. Attachment <b>to</b> <b>university</b> peers was the strongest predictor of university adjustment, followed by attachment <b>to</b> the <b>university.</b> The research highlights the role of social relationships in institutional belonging, {{and the importance of}} nurturing peer relationships and institutional affiliation for a positive student experience...|$|R

5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} 190 {{universities}} in Turkey. Entry {{to higher education}} depends on the Student Selection and Placement System (ÖSYS). In 2008, the quota of admitted students was 600,000, compared to 1,700,000 who took the higher education exam in 2007. Except for the Open Education Faculties (AÖF) at Anadolu, Istanbul and Atatürk University; entrance is regulated by the national ÖSYS examination, after which high school graduates are assigned <b>to</b> <b>universities</b> according to their performance. According to the 2012–2013 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the top university in Turkey is Middle East Technical University (in the 201–225 rank range), followed by Bilkent University and Koç University (both in the 226–250 range), Istanbul Technical University and Boğaziçi University (in the 276–300 bracket). All state and private universities are {{under the control of}} the Higher Education Board (YÖK), whose head is appointed by the President of Turkey; executive order 676 of October 2016 has created a system where in addition the President directly appoints all rectors of all state and private universities.

5|$|In {{this period}} Scottish {{universities}} largely had a Latin curriculum, {{designed for the}} clergy and civil and canon lawyers. They did not teach the Greek that was fundamental to the new Humanist scholarship, focusing on metaphysics, and putting a largely unquestioning faith {{in the works of}} Aristotle, whose authority would be challenged in the Renaissance. They provided only basic degrees. Those wanting to study for the more advanced degrees that were common amongst European scholars needed to go <b>to</b> <b>universities</b> in other countries. As a result, large numbers of Scots continued their studies on the Continent and at English universities. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and {{would be one of the}} most important ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. By 1497 the Humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. Another major figure was Archibald Whitelaw, a teacher at St. Andrews and Cologne who later became a tutor to the young James III and served as royal secretary from 1462 to 1493.|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} of rugby {{in the first}} half of the 19th century was driven by ex-pupils from many of England's Public Schools, especially Rugby, who, upon finishing school, took the game with them <b>to</b> <b>universities,</b> to London, and to the counties. England's first international match was against Scotland on Monday 27 March 1871. Not only was this match England's first, but it also proved to be the first ever rugby union international. Scotland won the match by a goal and a try to a try, in front of a crowd of 4,000 people at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh. A subsequent international took place at the Oval in London on 5 February 1872 which saw England defeat Scotland by a goal, a drop goal and two tries to one drop goal. In those early days there was no points system, it was only after 1890 that a format allowing the introduction of a points system was provided. Up until 1875 international rugby matches were decided by the number of goals scored (conversions and dropped goals), but from 1876 the number of tries scored could be used to decide a match if teams were level on goals.|$|E
5|$|This {{situation}} was {{transformed by the}} founding of St John's College, St Andrews in 1418. Henry Wardlaw, bishop of St. Andrews, petitioned the anti-Pope Benedict XIII during the later stages of the Great Western Schism, when Scotland {{was one of his}} few remaining supporters. Wardlaw argued that Scottish scholars in other universities were being persecuted for their loyalty to the anti-Pope. St Salvator's College was added to St. Andrews in 1450. The other great bishoprics followed, with the University of Glasgow being founded in 1451 and the King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. Both were also papal foundations, by Nicholas V and Alexander VI respectively. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. St. Andrews was deliberately modelled on Paris, and although Glasgow adopted the statues of the University of Bologna, there, like Aberdeen, there was an increasing Parisian influence, partly because all its early regents had been educated in Paris. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law. They provided only basic degrees. Those wanting to study for the more advanced degrees that were common amongst European scholars still needed to go <b>to</b> <b>universities</b> in other countries. As a result, Scottish scholars continued to visit the Continent and returned to English universities after they reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who wished}} to attend {{university}} had to travel to England or the continent, and just over 1,000 students {{have been identified as}} doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. Major intellectual figures produced by Scotland with this system included John Duns Scotus, Walter Wardlaw, William de Tredbrum, Laurence de Lindores and John Mair. This situation was transformed by the founding of St John's College, St Andrews (1418). St Salvator's College was added to St. Andrews in 1450, followed by foundations at Glasgow in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495.
