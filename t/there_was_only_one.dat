5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The {{tips of his}} fingers were severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play.

5|$|After Ealdred's death, {{one of the}} {{restraints}} on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred {{was one of a}} few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one,</b> Wulfstan II of Worcester.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion, U.S. General William Westmoreland {{concluded}} that the Viet Cong still had the strength to continue the attacks on Đồng Xoài. In contrast, South Vietnamese forces within the vicinity of Đồng Xoài were severely depleted, and did not have sufficient strength to defeat the Viet Cong. Furthermore, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> remaining battalion in South Vietnam’s strategic reserve, and it {{may not be enough to}} drive the Communist out from the area if it was committed.|$|E

Three months later, Wenninger misidentified the 74-ton French fishing ship Jesus Maria as a destroyer. UB-17 launched a torpedo which struck the ship and killed all six men of Jesus Marias crew.|$|E
5|$|Historical supernovae {{are known}} simply {{by the year}} they occurred: SN185, SN1006, SN1054, SN1572 (called Tycho's Nova) and SN1604 (Kepler's Star).

SN, for SuperNova, is a standard prefix. Until 1987, two-letter designations were rarely needed; since 1988, however, they have been needed every year.|$|E

5|$|It was as yet {{too early}} to assume 'night {{cruising}} order.' The enemy could have compelled us to fight before dark, he could have prevented our exercising our initiative, and finally he could have cut off our return to the German Bight. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> way of avoiding this: to inflict a second blow on the enemy with another advance carried through regardless of cost...It also offered {{the possibility of a}} last attempt being made to bring help to the hard-pressed , or at least of rescuing her ship's company.|$|E
5|$|On 4/5 May the Luftwaffe hit Exeter severely. That night MacLachlan claimed {{destroyed}} two He 111s of Küstenfliegergruppe 506. He trailed the German bombers back to France {{and attacked}} {{them where they}} believed they were safe. In fact both of his victims were Ju 88s which crashed near Dinard. From Feldwebel Robert Bogel's Wrk Nr. 1528, only the gunner was able to bail out, while observer Leutnant zur See (naval rank) Roman Wallner and Obergefreiter Johan Beibl were killed. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> survivor from Unteroffizier Josef Palmer's Ju 88D-4 Wrk Nr. 1154; Unteroffizier Karl Schorn managed to bail out but Leutnant zur See Ernst Tramp and Richard Staub were killed.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{declared}} war on Britain on 18 June 1812. Despite his preparations, Brock was worried about Canadian security. In Upper Canada, besides the militia, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> British regular infantry regiment, a detachment of retired veterans, and a company of artillery. These had to be dispersed among several widely separated posts. Brock's advantage was that the armed vessels of the Provincial Marine controlled the lakes, and allowed him to move his reserves rapidly between threatened points.|$|E

In Veracruz, the highest precipitation reading associated with Gert was 117mm, (4.61in) in El Higo. However, damage overall was minimal, amounting to $6million (2005USD, $60million 2005 MXN), and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> reported fatality, {{from a man}} who was carried away by the La Silla River when he was pushing a stalled car across the flooded stream.|$|E
5|$|The log {{discusses}} {{a telephone}} call made at 3:26am on 7 August to Chelmsford police station.

Bamber's defence team argues otherwise. They say that the radio log is not a duplicate log of Bamber's call, but that it shows Nevill also telephoned the police that night.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 20thcentury, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> {{recognized}} species of fork-marked lemur, although size and coloration differences had been noted previously. After comparing museum specimens, paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall and physical anthropologist Colin Groves recognized three new subspecies in 1991: the Pale fork-marked lemur (P.f.pallescens), Pariente's fork-marked lemur (P.f.parienti), and the Amber Mountain fork-marked lemur (P.f.electromontis). In 2001, Groves elevated all four subspecies to species status based on noticeable color, size, and body proportion {{differences between the}} fragmented populations. Although Tattersall disagreed with this promotion, citing inadequate information for the decision, the arrangement is generally accepted.|$|E
5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> possible way to implement the function.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30 the two battalions of the Turkish 77th Infantry Regiment were in position, {{and with}} the 27th Infantry they counter-attacked again. At 15:30 and at 16:45 McCay, now under severe pressure, {{requested}} reinforcements. The second time he was informed <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> uninvolved battalion left, the 4th, and Bridges was keeping them in reserve until more troops from the New Zealand and Australian Division had been landed. McCay then spoke to Bridges direct and informed him the situation was desperate and if not reinforced the Turks would get behind him. At 17:00 Bridges released the 4th Battalion to McCay who sent them to the south forming on {{the left of the}} 8th Battalion along Bolton's Ridge. They arrived just in time to help counter Turkish probing attacks, by the 27th Infantry Regiment, from the south.|$|E
