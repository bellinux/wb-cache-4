40|$|Climate {{change is}} the major problem that every human being is facing over the world. The rise in fossil fuel usage {{increases}} the emission of `greenhouse' gases, particularly carbon dioxide continuously into the earth's atmosphere. This causes {{a rise in the}} amount of heat from the sun withheld in the earth's atmosphere that would normally radiated back into space. This increase in heat has led to the greenhouse effect, resulting in climate change and rise in temperature along with other climatological parameters directly affects evaporation losses. Accurate modelling and forecasting of these evaporation losses are important for preventing further effects due to climate change. Evaporation is purely non-linear and varying both spatially and temporally. This needs suitable data driven approach to model and should have the ability to take care of all these non-linear behaviour of the system. As such, though there are many empirical and analytical models suggested in the literature for the estimation of evaporation losses, such models should be used with care and caution. Further, difficulties arise in obtaining all the climatological data used in a given analytical or empirical model. Genetic programming (GP) is one such technique applied where the non-linearity exist. GP has the flexible mathematical structure which is capable of identifying the non-linear relationship between input and output data sets. Thus, it is easy to construct 'local' models for estimating evaporation losses. The performance of GP model is compared with <b>Thornthwaite</b> <b>method,</b> and results from the study indicate that the GP model performed better than the <b>Thornthwaite</b> <b>method.</b> Forecasting of meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity has been performed using Markovian chain series analysis subsequently it is used to estimate the future evaporation losses using developed GP model.

To assess the role of percolation in the water balance, we compared the water budget from climate forcing scenarios using 10 GCMs with the water budget from experimental data of a basin in São Paulo state, Brazil.

40|$|Grass {{reference}} evapotranspiration (ETo) is {{an important}} agrometeorological parameter for climatological and hydrological studies, {{as well as for}} irrigation planning and management. There are several methods to estimate ETo, but their performance in different environments is diverse, since all of them have some empirical background. The FAO Penman-Monteith (FAD PM) method has been considered as a universal standard to estimate ETo for more than a decade. This method considers many parameters related to the evapotranspiration process: net radiation (Rn), air temperature (7), vapor pressure deficit (Delta e), and wind speed (U); and has presented very good results when compared to data from lysimeters Populated with short grass or alfalfa. In some conditions, the use of the FAO PM method is restricted by the lack of input variables. In these cases, when data are missing, the option is to calculate ETo by the FAD PM method using estimated input variables, as recommended by FAD Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56. Based on that, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of the FAO PM method to estimate ETo when Rn, Delta e, and U data are missing, in Southern Ontario, Canada. Other alternative methods were also tested for the region: Priestley-Taylor, Hargreaves, and Thornthwaite. Data from 12 locations across Southern Ontario, Canada, were used to compare ETo estimated by the FAD PM method with a complete data set and with missing data. The alternative ETo equations were also tested and calibrated for each location. When relative humidity (RH) and U data were missing, the FAD PM method was still a very good option for estimating ETo for Southern Ontario, with RMSE smaller than 0. 53 mm day(- 1). For these cases, U data were replaced by the normal values for the region and Delta e was estimated from temperature data. The Priestley-Taylor method was also a good option for estimating ETo when U and Delta e data were missing, mainly when calibrated locally (RMSE = 0. 40 mm day(- 1)). When Rn was missing, the FAD PM method was not good enough for estimating ETo, with RMSE increasing to 0. 79 mm day(- 1). When only T data were available, adjusted Hargreaves and modified <b>Thornthwaite</b> <b>methods</b> were better options to estimate ETo than the FAO) PM method, since RMSEs from these methods, respectively 0. 79 and 0. 83 mm day(- 1), were significantly smaller than that obtained by FAO PM (RMSE = 1. 12 mm day(- 1).

40|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} (PET) {{is one of}} the inputs to the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). A {{common approach}} to calculating PDSI is to use the <b>Thornthwaite</b> <b>method</b> for estimating PET because of its readily available input data: monthly mean temperatures. PET estimates based on Penman-type approaches are considered to be more physically realistic, but require more diverse input data. This study assesses the differences in global PDSI maps using the two estimates for PET. Annually accumulated PET estimates based on alternative Thornthwaite and Penman-Monteith, parameterizations have very different amplitudes. However, we show that PDSI values based on the two PET estimates are very similar, in terms of correlation, regional averages, trends, and in terms of identifying extremely dry or wet months. The reason for this insensitivity to the method of calculating PET relates to the calculations in the simple water balance model which {{is at the heart of}} the PDSI algorithm. It is shown that in many areas, actual evapotranspiration is limited by the availability of soil moisture and is at markedly lower levels compared to its potential value. In other areas, the water balance does change, but the quantity central to the calculation of the PDSI is, by construction, a reflection of the actual precipitation, which makes it largely insensitive to the use of the Thornthwaite PET rather than the Penman-Monteith PET. A secondary reason is that the impact of PET as input to a scaling parameter in the PDSI algorithm is very modest compared to the more dominant influence of the precipitation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Groundwater is an {{important}} part of the hydrological cycle, accounting for more than 25 % of human needs on the global scale. As a result of aquifer overexploitation associated with climate change, even in the most conservative future climate scenarios, mean water-table levels can experience drastic drops. Although there are efforts to include groundwater dynamics in global climate models (GCMs), its influence is still not taken into full account in GCM water budgets, although it is as important as the other water sources considered. To assess the role of percolation in the water balance, we compared the water budget from climate forcing scenarios using 10 GCMs with the water budget from experimental data of a basin in São Paulo state, Brazil. We used the delta factor approach to correct the bias of the model’s temperature and precipitation for a control period from 1970 to 1999, and calculated evapotranspiration using the <b>Thornthwaite</b> <b>method.</b> Experimental data for runoff and interception were derived for the basin’s representative crops (sugar cane and pasture) for both water budgets. As the GCMs ignore subsurface flow and the only input considered is precipitation and snow melt, the excess surface water is assumed to be redistributed among the other water budget components. The experimental data shows that there is enough available water for infiltration, indicating that recharge cannot be ignored in the water balance. This leads to the possibility of the models ’ overestimating the other components to compensate for the ignored recharge. Key words groundwater; global climate models; water budge...|$|E
40|$|The ArcView Geographic Information System {{was used}} to the water balance calculation, by {{adopting}} an water availability capacity of 100 mm, and by using the <b>Thornthwaite</b> <b>method</b> to estimate the evapotranspiration, for the South Meso-Region of Bahia State. The water balance demonstrated that studied area presents potential rates of evapotranspiration between 1000 mm. year- 1 in the interior, and 1500 mm. year- 1 in the coast. This {{is caused by the}} high energetic potential in the region. The real evapotranspiration can be kept in potential levels in almost all region during the year, with amounts between 900 mm. year- 1 in the Northwest and Southeast, and 1500 mm. year- 1 in the North Coast of the region. The water surplus follows the precipitation lines, which greater volumes occur in the Northeast of the region, decreasing to the Southeast, with amounts between 1000 mm. year- 1 and 100 mm. year- 1 respectively. The lack of water has a inverse characteristic, and presents the greatest amounts in the Southeast of the region, reaching 225 mm. year- 1 near the border with Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo States. The annual hydric availability is satisfactory {{to the development of the}} cultivations in a large part of the region, except in the Southwest end, in the proximities of the border with the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, where are found values of water availability "R" index inferior to 0. 6 in the months of June, August and October.
