5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> <b>Also</b> as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|The Thamnophilidae {{contains}} {{several large}} or very large genera and numerous small or monotypic ones. Several, which {{are difficult to}} assign, seem to form a third, hitherto unrecognised clade independently derived from ancestral antbirds. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>also</b> confirmed suspicions of previous researchers that some species, most notably in Myrmotherula and Myrmeciza, need to be assigned to other genera. Still, due to the difficulties of sampling from such {{a large number of}} often poorly known species, the assignment of some genera is still awaiting confirmation.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese {{field study}} found that S.spraguei was the {{dominant}} fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean Pine, {{both in terms of}} ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of biomass present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S.spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random—the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>also</b> suggested that S.spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores.|$|E

A 2015 government report found that Edinburgh {{is one of only}} two Scottish universities (along with St Andrews), London-based recruitment and elite professions such as investment banking consider applicants from.

25|$|The {{pointing}} gesture is a human-specific signal, is referential in its nature, and is {{a foundation}} building-block of human communication. Human infants acquire it weeks before the first spoken word. In 2009, a study compared the responses {{to a range of}} pointing gestures by dogs and human infants. The study showed little difference in the performance of 2-year-old children and dogs, while 3-year-old children's performance was higher. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>also</b> showed that all subjects were able to generalize from their previous experience to respond to relatively novel pointing gestures. These findings suggest that dogs demonstrating a similar level of performance as 2-year-old children can be explained as a joint outcome of their evolutionary history as well as their socialization in a human environment.|$|E

25|$|In June 2013, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} announced that they had sequenced the DNA of a 560–780 thousand year old horse, using material extracted from a leg bone found buried in permafrost in Canada's Yukon territory. Prior to this publication, the oldest nuclear genome that had been successfully sequenced was dated at 110–130 thousand years ago. For comparison, the researchers also sequenced the genomes of a 43,000-year-old Pleistocene horse, a Przewalski's horse, five modern horse breeds, and a donkey. Analysis of differences between these genomes indicated that the last common ancestor of modern horses, donkeys, and zebras existed 4 to 4.5 million years ago. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>also</b> indicated that Przewalski's horse diverged from other modern types of horse about 43,000 years ago, and had never in its evolutionary history been domesticated.|$|E
500|$|Playing {{within the}} {{universe}} of The Lord of the Rings was appealing {{to a number of}} reviewers, which found that it generally increased the game's entertainment value.

[...] <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>also</b> pleased 1UP.com, which was convinced that fans of The Lord of the Rings could not afford to miss purchasing the game. Game Revolution complimented the game's merge with the Lord of the Rings universe, observing that the franchise's mythology and the game's frenetic battles came together in a very satisfying bundle. The integration of The Lord of the Rings into a video game satisfied Game Informer, and the magazine predicted the game would be [...] "another winner for Electronic Arts".|$|E
