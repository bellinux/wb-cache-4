5|$|Analyses {{has been}} {{published}} by currency strategists at RBS, scoring countries on their potential to undertake intervention, measuring their relative intention <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> their currency and their capacity to do so. Ratings {{are based on the}} openness of a country's economy, export growth and real effective exchange rate (REER) valuation, as well as the scope a country has <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> its currency without damaging its economy. As of January 2013, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Chile and Sweden are the most willing and able to intervene, while the UK and New Zealand are among the least.|$|E
5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using cloud seeding <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification. Its most important goal was to try <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|However, cooler waters {{eventually}} {{caught up}} to Humberto and it began <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> once again early on August 31 as it tracked into the north Atlantic. That afternoon, Humberto weakened to a tropical storm as its circulation became embedded into a circulation of a nearby extratropical low in a high-shear environment. It continued <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> that evening, and early on September 1, the tropical storm was absorbed by the larger system.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter, the {{hurricane}} began <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> while moving across Florida, falling to Category1 intensity only several hours after landfall late on September15. Eventually, it curved north-northeastward {{and approached the}} east coast of Florida again. Late on September16, the storm emerged into the Atlantic near St. Augustine and weakened to a tropical storm early on the following day. The cyclone made another landfall near the Georgia-South Carolina state line later on September17. The system continued <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near the border of North Carolina and Virginia early on September18.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time that Météo-France {{assessed}} Hondo to have peaked, the JTWC reported that the storm had attained winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds), equivalent to a strong Category 4 hurricane. Shortly after reaching peak intensity, the cloud tops around the eye began to warm, meaning that the storm was beginning <b>to</b> <b>weaken.</b> Hondo also turned towards the southwest and kept a steady pace as two subtropical highs began influencing its movement. The storm continued <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> as cloud tops warmed but remained an intense tropical cyclone as its eye was still well-defined. Hondo briefly re-intensified later on February8 despite the structure of the storm deteriorating. The cyclone maintained intense tropical cyclone status through February10 due to the formation of a large eye which helped maintain the storms structure. Hondo gradually began <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> due to a combination of decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing forward motion. On February10, Hondo started a gradual curving path due to a trough located to the south and strengthening high pressure systems to the north. At 0600UTC, the storm was downgraded to a tropical cyclone as winds decreased to 155km/h (100mph).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Nate passed 125statute miles (200km) {{south of}} Bermuda on September 8 and reached peak {{intensity}} of 90mph (160km/h). Nate then began <b>to</b> <b>weaken.</b> After turning north, it became extratropical over the central Atlantic Ocean on September 10.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Yap, Mitag {{turned to}} the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough. It passed {{to the north of}} Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) on March5. The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, the storm had dissipated well to the east of the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|After making landfall, Nida {{weakened}} {{and then}} turned more northward and slowed down. Re-entering the warmer waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, Nida's winds restrengthened to 150 mph (250km/h).

The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Maria {{moved to}} the {{northeast}} the official forecasts called for the storm to continue <b>to</b> <b>weaken</b> slowly but an interaction with an upper-level trough caused Maria to strengthen again. It was also predicted that the storm would rapidly become extratropical, but Maria retained tropical characteristics for 48hours longer than some forecasts indicated. Maria weakened into a tropical storm on September 9 before finally becoming extratropical about midway between the Azores and Newfoundland early on September 10.|$|E
