5|$|The façade, though {{built in}} the style of <b>the</b> <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal,</b> lacks {{symmetry}} as the vertical axis has been given prominence which has resulted in an unbalanced appearance to the tomb. The dome is more elongated; the central part has a taller pishtaq. The four minarets at the four corners are part of the main mausoleum which was totally a different concept in elevation compared to <b>the</b> <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal</b> where the towers are detached and away from the facade of the tomb.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the tomb is praised and also derided; it is derided {{for the lack of}} proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had observed that the tomb has the “colour of potted meat”. Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “rather florid”. Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to <b>the</b> <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal</b> or the Humayun Tomb, as, {{at the time it was}} built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “thread bare”.|$|E

5|$|Jali are pierced stone screens with {{regularly}} repeating patterns. They {{are characteristic}} of Indo-Islamic architecture, for example in the Mughal dynasty buildings at Fatehpur Sikri and <b>the</b> <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal.</b> The geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5- and 8-pointed stars. The patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition. Jali functioned as windows or room dividers, providing privacy but allowing in air and light. Jali forms a prominent element of the architecture of India. The use of perforated walls has declined with modern building standards {{and the need for}} security. Modern, simplified jali walls, for example made with pre-moulded clay or cement blocks, have been popularised by the architect Laurie Baker. Pierced windows in girih style are sometimes found elsewhere in the Islamic world, such as in windows of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a spoiled, materialistic princess, the writers eventually re-wrote Jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin's mother from the script, while borrowing story elements from the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953). Several months after securing the role, Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess, but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise. Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares, Salonga was cast as Jasmine's singing voice based on her performance in the musical Miss Saigon; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney character to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actors. Animated by Mark Henn, Jasmine's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources, including an anonymous theme park guest, Henn's own sister, and actress Jennifer Connelly, while elements of <b>the</b> <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal</b> were incorporated into the character's hair, clothing and physique.|$|E
