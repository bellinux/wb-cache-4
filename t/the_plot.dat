40|$|As {{a method}} of {{estimating}} the theoretical distribution of hydrologic data, anexpedient using the concept of <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> Positions has been proposed by severalauthors. In this paper, the difference is discussed between <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> positions whichmean <b>the</b> empirical probability of observed data and <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> values appropriatefor estimating {{the parameters of the}} theoretical distribution of hydrologic data. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> values of <b>the</b> Extremes, the Log-Extremes and the Log-Normals in the hydrologic statistics are examined. And in addition, the theory ofconfidence limits of <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> values and <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> positions is discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{more weight}} {{is given to}} the costs {{compared}} to the RMSEs of the variables of interest, the smaller <b>the</b> optimal <b>plots</b> with a fixed plot number. With fixed budget, having more, smaller plots is optimal, if the transfer time between <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> is short. However, the distance between <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> within a cluster and therefore also the transfer time needs to be selected long enough to avoid high autocorrelation between <b>the</b> <b>plots.</b>|$|R
30|$|To {{minimise}} the cloudy {{explanation of}} all the variables presented on <b>the</b> <b>plots,</b> <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> should be interpreted as follows: there are x- and y-axes used. <b>The</b> <b>plots</b> (e.g. (yield stress) versus (2 -D Shape PathTotal)) indicate variations of the y-axis values (e.g. yield stress) {{as a function of}} the x-axis values (e.g. 2 -D Shape PathTotal (which is when analysis is done following the path of the 2 -D shape function due to the TOTAL process)). The variables corresponding to the y-axes are labelled on <b>the</b> <b>plots.</b>|$|R

Neelambari (Ramya Krishnan) initially loves Padayappa, but plans to humiliate him after his family humiliates her father (Radha Ravi). The rest of <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> deals with Padayappa overcoming all the obstacles placed by Neelambari.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Quantum of Solace in 2008, {{producer}} Barbara Broccoli commented that Skyfall, untitled at the time, may continue <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of the Quantum organisation, introduced in Casino Royale and continued in Quantum of Solace.

40|$|Choosing <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> {{positions}} for <b>the</b> QQ-plot {{has been a}} subject of much debate in the statistical and engineering literature. This paper looks at this problem objectively by considering three frameworks: distribution-theoretic; decision-theoretic; game-theoretic. In each framework, we derive <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> positions and show {{that there are more}} than one legitimate solution depending on the practitioner's objective. This work clarifies the choice of <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> positions by allowing one to easily find the mathematical equivalent of their view and choose the corresponding solution. This work also discusses approximations to <b>the</b> <b>plotting</b> positions when no closed form is available...|$|R

5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E

5|$|Cartman's {{involvement}} with the fried chicken black market closely mirrors <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman {{in the role of}} Tony Montana, and Colonel Sanders in the role of Alejandro Sosa. In the episode, Cartman travels to a foreign land to meet a dealer, usurps the illegal operation from his local boss, and is ultimately brought down because he becomes addicted to his own product, plot points that mirror <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of Scarface. Specific scenes patterned after ones in Scarface, include one in which Cartman watches Tommy being executed by being hanged from a helicopter, and the final scene in which Cartman's compound is attacked by gunmen. The episode also includes references to the 1991 crime film New Jack City.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{understory}} dwarf bamboo (Sasa kurilensis) on the seasonal changes in soil temperature was studied in a dense secondary forest of Betula ermanii in northern Japan. Four plots {{were established in}} the Betula ermanii forest with Sasa kurilensis in the understory, and Sasa was removed in two <b>plots</b> of <b>the</b> four. The soil temperatures at 5 em below the surface were monitored in <b>the</b> four <b>plots</b> from May 1999 to September 2000, and were compared between <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with and without Sasa. The daily maximum soil-temperature was ca. 0. 5 'C lower in <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> without Sasa than in <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with Sasa during the snow-cover period. On the contrary, the daily maximum soil-temperature was ca. 3 - 4 'C higher in <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> without Sasa than in <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with Sasa just after the snowmelt in mid-May 2000. The difference in soil temperature between <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with and without Sasa decreased gradually from the snowmelt toward the snow-cover period. The solar radiation was highest at around late Mayor early June 2000, and decreased toward winter. In addition, much solar radiation penetrated through the overstory layer from the snowmelt till early June when the leaf emergence of overstory trees started. Therefore, the absolute difference in solar radiation on the soil surface between <b>the</b> <b>plots</b> with and without Sasa {{was thought to be}} highest after the snowmelt, and gradually decreased till the snow cove...|$|R
5|$|During the Consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin {{assassination}} plots, {{including the}} Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and <b>the</b> <b>Plot</b> of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also {{known as the}} Infernal Machine) two months later. In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, {{even though he had}} not been involved in <b>the</b> <b>plot.</b> Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

5|$|Fielding's thirteenth play, The Modern Husband, first ran on 14 February 1732. The play ran for 13 {{nights at}} Drury Lane, rivalling {{the run of}} the Provok'd Husband and Zara for {{production}} length. Although early-20th-century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and <b>the</b> <b>plot</b> of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts. <b>The</b> <b>plot</b> deals with a man selling his wife for money and the attempted abuse of the adultery laws.|$|E

All <b>the</b> treated <b>plots</b> were then used for a maize culture (Zea mays, var IKENE). The experimental design was that of Fischer with 9 treatments and 4 replicates per treatment.
