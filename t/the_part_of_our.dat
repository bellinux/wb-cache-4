5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E
500|$|In September 1943, AGF representatives {{met with}} Devers {{to discuss his}} needs, and he asked for 250 of the new T26E1 tanks (later redesignated the M26 Pershing) to be {{produced}} and shipped {{as a matter of}} urgency. The Ordnance Department concurred, but added on 1,000 T23 series tanks, an advanced design handicapped by problems with the reliability of its electric transmission. McNair disapproved the request, writing that [...] "the M4 tank, particularly the M4A3, has been widely hailed as the best tank on the battlefield today... Other than this particular request, which represents the British view—there has been no call from any theater for a 90mm tank gun. There appears to be no fear on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank... there can be no basis for the T26 tank other than the conception of a tank versus tank duel—which is believed unsound and unnecessary... {{there is no indication that}} the 76mm antitank gun is inadequate against the Mark VI (Tiger) tank." ...|$|E
500|$|The 7th Infantry Division {{was formed}} the {{following}} month and placed {{under the command of}} Major-General Richard O'Connor. The division was deployed to Palestine on internal security duties as part of a build-up of 18,500 men in the region. This force then began to suppress the revolt. Meanwhile, Palestinian guerrillas had overrun the Old City of Jerusalem. O'Connor's men proceeded to sweep the area, declaring the Old City free of militants on 19October. The same day, the division seized Acre {{and by the end of}} the month were clearing Jaffa of rebels. Many Palestinians were detained and rebel activity significantly dropped off in the area. In the north, the 8th Infantry Division, under Major-General Bernard Montgomery, and Special Night Squads engaged in counter-terror operations, with O'Connor writing that one brigadier [...] "always encouraged his men to be brutal". General Officer Commanding British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan Robert Haining wrote in late 1938 that [...] "unnecessary violence, vindictiveness ..., [...] killing in cold blood" [...] had to be curbed. O'Connor was likewise opposed to the measures in the north, and wrote [...] "harshness and unnecessary violence on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> soldiers" [...] had to be curbed. During the operation in Jerusalem, only four to nineteen guerrillas were killed. In early 1939, the revolt finally came to an end.|$|E

[...] Saltonstall's ineptitude at Penobscot would lead to his being dismissed from the Navy as being [...] "ever after incompetent to hold a government office or state post" [...] the following October by the [...] "Committee for Enquiring into the Failure of the Penobscot Expedition" [...] of the Massachusetts General Court which determined that failure of the expedition was primarily the result of the [...] "want of proper Spirit and Energy {{on the part of the}} Commodore", that he [...] "discouraged any Enterprizes or offensive Measures on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Fleet", and that the destruction of the fleet was occasioned [...] "principally by the Commodore's not exerting himself at all at the time of the Retreat in opposing the Enemies' foremost Ships in pursuit".|$|E
2500|$|Ten {{days before}} he died, Lindbergh wrote to each of his European mistresses, imploring them to {{maintain}} the utmost secrecy about his illicit activities with them even after his death. The three women (none of whom ever married) all managed to keep their affairs secret even from their children, who during his lifetime (and {{for almost a decade}} after his death) did not know the true identity of their father, whom they had only known by the alias Careu Kent and they had only seen him when he briefly visited them once or twice per year. However, after reading a magazine article about Lindbergh in the mid-1980s, Brigitte's daughter Astrid deduced the truth; she later discovered snapshots and more than 150 love letters from Lindbergh to Brigitte. After Brigitte and Anne Lindbergh had both died, she made her findings public; in 2003 DNA tests confirmed that Lindbergh had fathered Astrid and her two siblings. Reeve Lindbergh, Lindbergh's youngest child with Anne, wrote in her personal journal in 2003, [...] "This story reflects absolutely Byzantine layers of deception on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> shared father. These children did not even know who he was! He used a pseudonym with them (To protect them, perhaps? To protect himself, absolutely!)" ...|$|E
