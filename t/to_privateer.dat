5|$|Although Morgan {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque <b>to</b> <b>privateer</b> captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. Morgan was not entirely friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Roberts {{has been}} a strong proponent of raising the image of {{motorcycle}} racing among the general public. During his riding career, he {{made a point of}} returning to the United States during the mid-season break in the Grand Prix calendar to race in the Laguna Seca 200 as a way to increase the profile of the event in order for it to gain Grand Prix status. The race eventually attained Grand Prix status in 1988 and in 1993, Roberts took on the role of promoter, providing financial backing for the 1993 United States Grand Prix. In the 1990s when Grand Prix racing faced diminishing numbers of competitors due to increasing costs, Roberts demanded that Yamaha provide engines <b>to</b> <b>privateer</b> teams in order to bolster the number of racers.|$|E
2500|$|Musette (or Muzette) was a {{merchant}} ship built at Nantes in 1781. In June 1793 her owners commissioned her {{there as a}} 20-gun privateer, but the French Navy requisitioned her in November and classed her as a corvette. In May 1795 the Navy returned her <b>to</b> <b>privateer</b> service. [...] captured her in December 1796 and the Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Musette. She never went to sea again and the Navy sold her in 1806.|$|E

2500|$|Behind {{the podium}} finishers, Citroën's Dani Sordo easily picked off Henning Solberg to claim fourth place. Henning's brother Petter Solberg {{maintained}} his sixth position, never really {{being in a}} position to challenge the Stobart Ford driver. [...] Matthew Wilson shrugged off his cold to finish in seventh with eighth place going <b>to</b> <b>privateer</b> Conrad Rautenbach, scoring his second points finish of the season. Federico Villagra and Barry Clark finished ninth and tenth, thus earning the Munchi's Ford team three valuable manufacturer points.|$|E
2500|$|As well {{as being}} a racing team Cooper {{was very much a}} business, as shown by the 1958 International Trophy where 19 Coopers of various types made up more than half the grid. Right from the outset the T51 was {{designed}} to be produced in large numbers and offered for sale <b>to</b> <b>privateer</b> teams, with Rob Walker getting full-works cars and the rest receiving slightly more workmanlike models. No fewer than ten other entrants ran T51s in Formula 1 during 1959, and with the works team switching to the T53, and Walker using Lotus 18s, many of the ex-works cars were sold and continued to be entered in 1960. Indeed, the T51 continued to appear on minor, non-championship F1 race entry lists as late as the 1967 Rhodesian Grand Prix! ...|$|E

25|$|Port Royal {{was once}} home <b>to</b> <b>privateers</b> {{encouraged}} <b>to</b> attack Habsburg Spain's vessels when smaller European powers dared not directly make war on Spain. As a port city, it was notorious for its gaudy displays {{of wealth and}} loose morals. It was a popular homeport for the English and Dutch-sponsored <b>privateers</b> <b>to</b> spend their treasure during the 17th century. When those governments abandoned the practice of issuing letters of marque <b>to</b> <b>privateers</b> against the Spanish treasure fleets and possessions in the later 16th century, many of the crews turned pirate. They continued to use the city as their main base during the 17th century. Pirates {{from around the world}} congregated at Port Royal, coming from waters as far away as Madagascar.|$|R
25|$|The {{withdrawal}} of the Royal Navy squadron from Indian waters had left the EIC's trade vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>privateers</b> from Île de France (Mauritius). The EIC therefore decided to equip a squadron of its merchantmen as cruisers to protect its trade.|$|R

5000|$|Illyrian piracy {{could be}} more {{correctly}} termed privateering, as it was endorsed by the state.

50|$|Tactically, {{submarines}} of the First World War {{were similar}} <b>to</b> <b>privateers</b> {{in the age}} of sail, because they were employed primarily to destroy the enemy's merchant traffic in an extremely opportunistic sense rather than engage in battle with enemy naval vessels. Individually, submarines were only capable of sinking a small number of ships because of their limited supply of torpedoes and shells.|$|R
