This is the report of some experiments successively made on the feeding values of beet top silage, sun-cured beet tops, beet pulp silage and beet pulp. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1) The beet top silage made without any additive had a good value of pH 3. 7, and contained 3. 6 per cent lactic acid and 0 per cent butyric acid. Pro-vitamin A content of the beet top silage was 1 - 2 mg. per 100 g. The silage was found to be a favourite feed with live-stock. Beet top silage contained 544 mg. oxalic acid per 100 g. The nutrient loss in fermentation process was 24 per cent in organic matter and 9 per cent in crude protein. The results of digestion experimets on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 78 per cent; the digestible crude protein was 2 per cent and the <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> <b>nutrient</b> 10. 4 per cent(cf. Table 9). 2) The beet tops lost 24 per cent of organic matter, 17 per cent of crude protein and 86 per cent of carotene during 10 days of sun-curing. The results of digestion experiments on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 66 per cent, lower than that of fresh beet tops or beet top silage. The sun-cured beet tops were less palatable to rabbits than the fresh beet tops or the beet top silage. The contents of digestible crude protein and <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> <b>nutrient</b> were 8. 4 per cent and 42. 0 per cent respectively. 3) A good silage was able to be prepared from beet pulp. Furthermore, addition of morea in silage-making with the beet pulp was effective and the morea added silage was palatable to live-stock; it had the following properties: pH 4. 15, lactic acid 1. 89 per cent. acetic acid 0. 25 per cent and butyric acid 0 per cent. The results of digestion trials on goats are shown in Table 19.

This supplement contains soya bean meal (SBM) and has been developed using different protein sources, such as Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Ec), soya bean waste sauce (SBWs), wheat pollard (WP) and WP bypass protein (WPBp). It has also been developed using medicated block (MB). The objective is to introduce the P- 32 tracer for obtaining a new feed supplement, to apply UMMB-SBM on beef cattle for fattening, and to test UMMB-MB on cows in the field. Parameters measured include microbial protein synthesis (MPS) in rumen liquid, daily live weight gain (DLWG), milk production and total count of worm in feces. Statistical analysis used were Latin squares, Student’s t-test, and completely randomized design. The UMMB-SBM was better than UMMB-Ec, UMMB-SBWs, and UMMB-WP, because it was able to increase MPS by up to 205. 67 %, superior to the other feed supplements (51. 01 %, 34. 04 %, and 73. 94 % respectively).

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the replacement of soybean meal by inactive dry yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) from sugar cane on nutritive value of diets for Saanen goats in the peripartum. Twenty - four Saanen goats (nine primiparous, 55. 35 ± 4. 55 kg and fifteen multiparous, 73. 12 ± 8. 51 kg) in prepartum and postpartum periods were distributed in a completely randomized design with a 3 × 2 (diet × parturition order) factorial arrangement. Diets were composed of soybean meal, soybean meal plus dry yeast or dry yeast as protein source, and other ingredients: ground corn, mineral supplement and limestone. The roughage source used was the whole plant corn silage (40 % of the total diet). Diets were evaluated as dry matter intake and digestibility of nutrients. The diet with total dry yeast inclusion promoted a reduction on the ether extract intake (postpartum) and ether extract digestibility (prepartum and postpartum), due its lower ether extract content {{when compared to the}} other diets. Multiparous goats presented higher intakes for dry matter, nutrients and <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> <b>nutrients</b> in both evaluated periods due their higher intake capacity. Primiparous goats in postpartum had better coefficients of digestibility for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and total carbohydrates, and so a higher energetic value, attributed to <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> <b>nutrients</b> compared to multiparous ones. Dry yeast can replace soybean meal with no changes on nutritive value of diets for Saanen goats...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultivation}} {{of the sugar}} beet in warm regions has been encouraged {{for the purpose of}} decreasing importation of sugar and of utilizing by-products of the sugar beet cultivation to live-stock feeding. With a view to making clear the chemical composition and the feeding value of by-products of the sugar beet cultivated in warm regions, some experiments have been made. The results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) No distinct variation in chemical composition of sugar beet tops could be found between the various varieties, nor between beet tops harvested at different times. Crude protein content of blades was over 20 per cent. (2) Oxalic acid contents in various parts of sugar beets were determined. (cf. Table 4). Beet tops contained 0. 25 - 0. 51 per cent. oxalic acid. In beet tops of such varieties as KL-E. Verna and Polish content of oxalic acid was comparatively high, but in those of KL-AA and Cesena rather low. (cf. Table 5). (3) Carotene content was 2. 9 mg. / 100 g. in beet tops in the bolting Period and 2. 7 mg. / 100 g. in beet top silage. (4) The results of digestion experiments on rabbits using beet tops (with dry matter content 12. 2 percent.) showed that the digestibility of organic matter was 91. 7 per cent; the digestible crude protein was 1. 64 per cent. and the <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> <b>nutrient</b> 9. 5 per cent. (cf. Tables 6 and 7). (5) The beet top silage made without any additive had a satisfactory pH 4. 09, and contained 2. 65 per cent. lactic acid, 0. 47 per cent. acetic acid, and 0 per cent. butyric acid. The rate of ammoniacal nitrogen to the total nitrogen was 5 per cent. The silage seemed to be palatable to live-stock. (6) Oxalic acid content of the beet top silage was 0. 43 per cent. It was found that about thirty percent of oxalic acid diminished during storage. (7) The results of digestion experiments with the beet top silage on rabbits are shown in Table 12. Contents of dry matter, digestible crude protein and the <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> <b>nutrient</b> of the silage were 13. 5, 1. 5 and 9. 6 per cent. respectively. (8) The loss of dry matter during storage was 27 per cent. Besides, the loss of nutrients in oozed juice was also studied. (cf. Table 16) ...|$|R
40|$|Objetive. This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the best sunflower meal concentration in Massai grass silage. Materials and methods. The treatments were composed of 0, 8, 16, and 24 % sunflower meal (natural matter basis) during ensiling of Massai grass, with four repetitions. Results. The regression equation showed that the inclusion of sunflower meal between 2. 14 % and 13. 91 % obtained a silage dry matter between 25 and 35 %, which are the values recommended {{for the production of}} high quality silage. The addition of sunflower meal showed a linear increase in crude protein, reaching 18 % DM with the highest concentration of sunflower meal. The highest feed value index was obtained with the addition of 24 % sunflower meal in the silage. The estimated <b>total</b> <b>digestible</b> <b>nutrient</b> of silage increased linearly with sunflower meal concentration. The silage pH values had a quadratic effect, reaching the lowest value (4. 1) with 15 % sunflower meal addition. Conclusions. Based on the chemical composition and forage quality, a concentration of 14 % sunflower meal should be used for high-quality silage with good nutritional value...|$|R
