5|$|Fishers {{have been}} trapped since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers due to <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fur, {{which has been}} used for scarves and neck pieces. The best pelts are from winter {{trapping}} with secondary quality pelts from spring trapping. The lowest-quality furs come from out-of-season trapping when fishers are moulting. They are easily trapped, and <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.|$|E
5|$|A third {{method is}} for {{authorities}} simply to talk down <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> currency by hinting at future action to discourage speculators from betting on a future rise, though sometimes this has little discernible effect. Finally, {{a central bank}} can effect a devaluation by lowering its base rate of interest; however this sometimes has limited effect, and, {{since the end of}} World War II, most central banks have set their base rate according to the needs of their domestic economy.|$|E
5|$|As {{investor}} {{confidence in the}} global economic outlook fell in early August, Bloomberg suggested the currency war had entered a new phase.

Other hoards, however, {{such as those}} found at Thetford and Beaurains consist mostly of coins, jewellery, and small tableware items; these two hoards probably are pagan votive offerings.

5|$|The Wimbledon and Sutton Railway (W) was {{a railway}} company {{established}} by an Act of Parliament in 1910 {{to build a}} railway line in Surrey (now south-west London) from Wimbledon to Sutton via Merton and Morden in the United Kingdom. The railway was promoted by local landowners hoping to increase <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> land through its development for housing. It was initially planned that services on the railway would be operated by the London Underground's District Railway (DR) by an extension of its existing service from Wimbledon.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} boom was {{not limited}} to express stations, with fifteen-story apartment buildings built by Cord Meyer, an eighty-family apartment house built by the Rego Park Construction Corporation, and 300 one-family homes built along Woodhaven Boulevard by Pherbus Kaplan, all surrounding the 63rd Drive local station. These development companies all sought out to continue to increase <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> properties in anticipation of the opening of the subway.|$|E

5|$|The natural {{populations of}} black wildebeest, endemic to the {{southern}} part of Africa, were almost completely exterminated in the 19th century, due to their reputation as pests and <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hides and meat. However, the species has been reintroduced widely from captive specimens, both in private areas and nature reserves throughout most of Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa. It has also been introduced outside its natural range in Namibia and Kenya.|$|E

Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant. Since the show does not generally provide airfare or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes alleviate contestants' financial burden. An exception is provided for returning champions who must make several flights to Los Angeles.|$|E

The Mounties {{had a reputation for}} running these posts honestly, although accusations were made that they took bribes. Prospectors, on the other hand, tried to smuggle prize items like silk and whiskey across the pass in tins and bales of hay: the former item for the ladies, the latter for the saloons.|$|E

5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{is defined by}} its cells (often a one- or two-dimensional array), a finite set <b>of</b> <b>values</b> or states that can go into each cell, a neighborhood associating each cell with a finite set of nearby cells, and an update rule according to which <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> all cells are updated, simultaneously, as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> neighboring cells.|$|R
5|$|After the {{collapse}} {{of the power of the}} Howards, the county of Suffolk was controlled by an oligarchy of Protestant gentry by the 17th century and did not play a prominent part in the English Civil War that occurred between 1642–6. Framlingham Castle escaped the slighting that occurred to many other English castles around this time. Hitcham's bequest had meanwhile become entangled in the law courts and work did not begin on the poorhouse until the late 1650s, by which time the internal buildings of castle were being broken up for <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> stone; the chapel had been destroyed in this way by 1657.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} bidding, TETCO raised {{the money to}} pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E

5|$|Mosley {{was elected}} to his third term as {{president}} of the FIA in 2001. From 2000, Formula One saw the return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers, who feared that under Ecclestone's management F1 coverage would go to pay television, reducing <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> investment. In 2001, the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA) announced an alternative world championship, the Grand Prix World Championship to start by 2008. The GPMA stipulated that the championship should not be regulated by the FIA, which Lovell believes was because the organisation believed Mosley was too close to Ecclestone. The proposed championship came to nothing and the GPMA later became the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA).|$|E
5|$|Restrictions on Jews {{were already}} in place before the invasion, {{including}} a prohibition on marrying Christians. After the invasion, Randolph Braham writes, the Hungarian government immediately began the process of isolating Jews {{from the rest of}} the community. From 5 April Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3.8 x 3.8inch (10 x 10cm) yellow badge. They were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling or moving home, and had to declare <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, non-Jews could not work in Jewish households. Books by Jews were removed from libraries and Jewish authors could no longer be published.|$|E
5|$|Robert {{endeavours}} {{to steal}} the funds needed for King Richard's ransom, and begins robbing the rich {{with the help of}} Sherwood's outlaws, whom he has gradually befriended. At the same time, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother, is working to raise the ransom through more legal methods: by taxing clergy and laymen for a quarter of <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> property, confiscating the gold and silver treasures of the churches, and imposing scutage and carucage taxes. Back in the small village of Locksley, Marian is captured and sent to the Sheriff's dungeon, where she is given an ultimatum: marry DeLacey or find herself charged with witchcraft. She is rescued by Robert, who arrives with his friends to free her. Just as they are about to be arrested by a wrathful Prince John, whose money has been stolen by the outlaws, King Richard arrives unexpectedly, allowing Robert and his associates to escape.|$|E

5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> liquor license.|$|E

Jews had to declare <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> property, and were forbidden from moving home, travelling, owning cars or radios, listening to foreign radio stations, or using the telephone.

5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E
