40|$|Abstract: WebTOP is a three-dimensional, {{interactive}} {{computer graphics}} system developed at Mississippi State University to help students learn about waves and optics. It {{has been used to}} help teach undergraduate introductory physics and upper-level optics classes. Currently, it is comprised of sixteen modules spanning eight different subject areas. The subject areas are waves, geometrical optics, reflection and refraction, polarization, interference, diffraction, lasers, and scattering. WebTOP simulations have the following characteristics. First, they are three dimensional, i. e., they have navigation controls that allow the user to rotate the scene, pan, or zoom, in order to view it from any desired orientation. Secondly, they are interactive. The user can change the parameters either by typing in the desired values into the appropriate <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>box,</b> or by using the mouse cursor to move the appropriate widget in the scene. Thirdly, the simulations are animated, for those phenomena for which animation is appropriate. Furthermore, the simulations include VCR-type controls that allow the user to record his/her interactions with the simulation for later retrieval, viewing, and editing. Finally, these modules run inside a web browser. They can be run from our website...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{molecule}} editor, that is {{program for}} input and editing of molecules, is an indispensable {{part of every}} cheminformatics or molecular processing system. This review focuses on a special type of molecule editors, namely those that are used for molecule structure input on the web. Scientific computing is now moving {{more and more in}} the direction of web services and cloud computing, with servers scattered all around the Internet. Thus a web browser has become the universal scientific user interface, and a tool to edit molecules directly within the web browser is essential. The review covers a history of web-based structure input, starting with simple <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>boxes</b> and early molecule editors based on clickable maps, before moving to the current situation dominated by Java applets. One typical example - the popular JME Molecule Editor - will be described in more detail. Modern Ajax server-side molecule editors are also presented.

There {{is currently a}} lack of evidence regarding the self-reported concerns of SCT patients before and after SCT. Aim and design: This exploratory study performed a secondary analysis of self-reported, written concerns of SCT patients before and after transplant to determine patients&# 39; concerns. Methods: Content analysis of <b>text</b> <b>box</b> <b>entries</b> of SCT patients collected between 2005 and 2007 at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. <b>Text</b> <b>box</b> <b>entries</b> were collected as part of symptom assessment using the Electronic Self-Report Assessment &ndash; Cancer instrument. The assessment was presented to 137 patients undergoing SCT at two time points: prior to ambulatory visits before any therapy had begun (T 1) and at the first visit after hospital discharge following SCT (T 2). Results: <b>Text</b> <b>box</b> <b>entries</b> were made before (n = 52) and after (n = 87) the transplant, resulting in 139 <b>text</b> <b>box</b> <b>entries</b> made by 137 patients representing 133 concerns. Using content analysis, the entries were categorized and ranked according to frequency. After symptom concerns, patients ranked work and financial issues the most frequent concerns prior to SCT. After SCT, symptoms remained the most frequently entered area of concern, followed by survival. Conclusion: Oncology providers need to assess SCT patients for work and financial concerns before and after transplant. Appropriate and timely referrals may ease the burden of these concerns for patients. Thus, assessment of financial and work concerns by the oncology team should {{be an integral part}} of quality health care for patients undergoing SCT.

Proposed is a {{new method}} to enter text using a reduced keypad, as is {{typically}} found on telephones, with particular extensions for one with a display window above it, as is typically found on mobile phones. In this method each {{of the most commonly}} used characters is entered by selecting two keys in succession. The so-called KC-method may be programmed into a conventional mobile phone without any modification of hardware. The superiority of KC over traditional multi-tap lies in the elimination of key tap time-out, uniform <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> rate and appealing visual feedback during the entry process.

Responses to the System Usability Scale (SUS) for each <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> technique and informal interview data were also collected. From a Repeated-measures analysis of variance a significant effect of the <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> method on <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> rate was seen (F 1, 19 = 47. 140, p < 0. 0001). The effect of the session (i. e. learning) was also statistically significant (F 2, 18 = 3. 631, p = 0. 047).
