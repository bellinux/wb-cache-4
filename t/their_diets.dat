5|$|Because of {{this ability}} to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their mouths. <b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the giant}} panda, they cannot digest cellulose, {{so they must}} consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. <b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichens, and grasses. Occasionally, they {{supplement}} <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> with fish and insects. They {{do little more than}} eat and sleep due to their low-calorie diets.|$|E
5|$|Although rodents {{have been}} {{regarded}} traditionally as herbivores, {{a number of}} species opportunistically include insects, fish, or meat in <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> and more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and {{a few members of}} the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white-footed mouse, normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter.|$|E
25|$|Since {{they are}} prone to candida infections this is best {{addressed}} in <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b> Remove everything from <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> that encourage fungal growth, like refined flour (most commercial egg foods are flour based) and sugar (most ripe fruits). Add as many natural antifungals to <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> as you can. Fresh crushed garlic is an excellent antifungal. Also herbs like oregano, thyme and rosemary. With proper husbandry and a more natural approuch to <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> Scarlet-chested parakeets prove to be hardy and long lived.|$|R
25|$|The Inuit {{believe that}} <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> has many {{benefits}} over the western Qallunaat food. They are adamant about proving that <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> will make one stronger, warmer, {{and full of}} energy.|$|R
50|$|Swamp sparrows {{generally}} forage on {{the ground}} near the water's edge, in shallow water or in marsh vegetation. In winter, <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> is principally fruit and seeds, while during the breeding season <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> is mainly arthropods.|$|R
5|$|The ideal {{habitat for}} these rabbits {{is in an}} area between mature and young forests. They use the dense mature forests as {{protection}} and {{for the presence of}} pampas grass, in the summer, and acorns, in the winter, for <b>their</b> <b>diets.</b> They also use the high density of perennial grasses and herbaceous ground cover in the young forests for <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> during different times of the year. Therefore, the best habitat for them to live in is where they have easy access to both young and mature forests with no obstructions between the two forest types.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons require ample {{protein and}} {{nutrients}} in <b>their</b> <b>diets.</b> Since {{they are a}} large cat breed {{with high levels of}} energy, it is best to feed them quality food. Food that lists meat as the first ingredient is best for the Maine Coon.|$|E
5|$|The pudús are herbivorous, {{consuming}} vines, {{leaves from}} low trees, shrubs, succulent sprouts, herbs, ferns, blossoms, buds, tree bark, and fallen fruit. They can survive without drinking water {{for long periods}} due to the high water content of the succulent foliage in <b>their</b> <b>diets.</b>|$|E
50|$|While in {{breeding}} season, {{they eat}} insects and spiders. When the season changes, <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> also includes ripe fruit, which quickly passes through their digestive tract. During the winter, <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> consists of fruit, nectar, insects and seeds.|$|R
5000|$|Mantis shrimps make up over 15 {{percent of}} <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b> Crabs {{are the most}} common item on <b>their</b> <b>diet,</b> and fishes like Bluehead Wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum; Boga, Inermia vittata; {{goatfishes}} and small morays are included.3 Preferably, shrimps and octopuses.|$|R
50|$|A 1956 study saw {{no effect}} on {{reproduction}} in rats during their lifetime at up to 5% of <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> being polysorbate 80. Reproduction decreased at 20% of <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b> A 1993 study raised concerns that polysorbate 80 might decrease fertility in rats.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E
5|$|Despite its slow {{metabolism}} rate, the Sunda slow loris has a high-energy diet. Its slow lifestyle {{may be due}} to {{the energy}} costs of detoxifying certain secondary plant compounds in many genera of food plants <b>their</b> <b>diets.</b> The largest amount of time is spent eating phloem sap (34.9%), floral nectar and nectar-producing plant parts (31.7%), and fruits (22.5%). It also consumes gums and arthropods such as spiders and insects. Gum is taken by licking wounds on trees. They are also known to feed on molluscs, including the giant land snail Achatina fulica, and birds' eggs.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious animals, {{hartebeest}} form {{herds of}} 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place {{throughout the year}} {{with one or two}} peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
50|$|Hickory shad are piscivorous, feeding {{primarily}} on small fishes, although crustaceans and squid contribute to <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> (Cooper 1983; Munroe 2002). One {{study showed that}} <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> on the spawning grounds was almost exclusively fish (97% by weight; Harris et al. 2007).|$|R
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diet</b> {{is mainly}} ants and termites.|$|R
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diet</b> {{consists}} {{mainly in}} sponges and tunicates.|$|R
5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that {{have adapted to}} life in a marine environment, sea snakes ingest {{considerably}} more salt than their terrestrial relatives through <b>their</b> <b>diets,</b> and when seawater is inadvertently swallowed. This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved {{to allow them to}} expel salt with their tongue action.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{originally}} inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family {{such as the}} Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett. While cultivation of crops like squash and corn supplemented <b>their</b> <b>diets,</b> these tribes were generally dependent on hunting, gathering and fishing {{for most of their}} food. Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as longhouses, and tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems.|$|E
5|$|Waterfowl, rails, {{and some}} colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by otters in various areas. Susceptibility {{of these species}} is {{greatest}} during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn. The otters have also been known to catch and consume moulting American wigeon (Mareca americana) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca). Other species of birds found within <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> include: northern pintail (Anas acuta); mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); canvasback (Aythya valisineria); ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis); and the American coot (Fulica americana).|$|E
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diet</b> {{consists}} {{mostly of}} seeds and fruit.|$|R
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diet</b> {{consists}} of lizards, and small rodents.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{omnivorous}} taking seeds, berries, insects and other invertebrates. They do not drink water and obtain all the moisture they need from <b>their</b> <b>diet.</b> Tenebrionid beetles {{were found to}} be especially numerous in one study. Plant material makes up more of <b>their</b> <b>diet</b> during the non-breeding season.|$|R
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. <b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E
5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. <b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will not let go easily.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of <b>their</b> <b>diets,</b> such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>diet</b> {{includes}} cephalopods, fish, and birds. Stomach contents {{have been}} analyzed and shown to include anchovy, barracuda, flounder, hagfish, lamprey, red cod, school shark, {{and many other}} species. There are different factors that affect <b>their</b> <b>diet,</b> such as season, sex, breeding, surrounding colony, oceanography, and climatic patterns.|$|R

5|$|Subfamilies exhibit {{different}} feeding strategies. While Bovinae species graze {{extensively on}} fresh grass and diffused forage, Cephalophinae species (with {{the exception of}} Sylvicapra) primarily consume fruits. Reduncinae and Hippotraginae species depend on unstable food sources, but the latter are specially adapted to arid areas. Members of Caprinae, being flexible feeders, forage even in areas with low productivity. Tribes Alcelaphini, Hippotragini, and Reduncini have high proportions of monocots in <b>their</b> <b>diets.</b> On the contrary, Tragelaphini and Neotragini (with the exception of Ourebia) feed extensively on dicots. No conspicuous relationship exists between body size and consumption of monocots.|$|E
5|$|The Australian blacktip shark {{is known}} to form large groups, {{segregated}} by size and sex. It preys mainly on teleost fishes, including ponyfishes, grunters, tunas, and herring. Cephalopods are a secondary food source, which are particularly important around April. This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks, including snaggletooth sharks (Hemipristis pristis), spottail sharks (C. sorrah), and sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon). <b>Their</b> <b>diets</b> shift with age: smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom-dwelling fish, while larger individuals feed on proportionately more midwater fish and cephalopods. Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms Fossobothrium perplexum and Platybothrium sp., and the copepod Perissopus dentatus.|$|E
5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because <b>their</b> <b>diets</b> contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract.|$|E
