25|$|Answers {{are worth}} one point {{for every person}} in the 100-member survey who gave them. The winning family in each round scores the total points for all {{revealed}} answers <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal (if applicable). The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round, and as the game progresses, certain rounds are played for double or triple point value. The first family to score 300 points wins the game and advances to the Fast Money bonus round for a chance to win a cash bonus. Until 1992, both teams received $1 per point scored.|$|E

[...] On October 13, 2014, during a debate against Democratic challenger Rob Zerban in Kenosha, Wisconsin both candidates were asked if human activity was to blame for climate change, and Ryan answered: [...] "I don't know the answer <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> I don't think science does, either." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 26, 2010, Levy's then-64-year-old father, Robert, {{took the}} stand and refuted {{statements}} about his past suspicions of Condit. Robert Levy testified that he told authorities {{during the early years}} of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: [...] "I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain." [...] Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was [...] "guilty until we learned about this character here," [...] referring to Guandique. On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and Chandra Levy had been involved in a sexual relationship. He replied, [...] "I am not going to respond <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> out of privacy for myself and Chandra." [...] FBI biologist Alan Giusti testified that semen found on underwear from Levy's apartment contained sperm matching Condit's DNA profile.|$|E

It was serviced as an extended play, {{where it was}} bundled with three remixes, by MK (Mark Kinchen), Felix da Housecat and Brackles. The song was ultimately excluded from Katy's second studio album, entitled Little Red. During an interview with Clash, Katy was asked about why she had not included the song in the album's track listing. <b>To</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> she responded: [...] "I just felt that I wanted to put some music out there, really. Like, 'Aaliyah' from Danger EP is on the album, but I loved collaborating with Jessie Ware. But [...] {{means a lot to}} me , so I wanted to get it out there, regardless of whether it was on the album." [...] Having a length of three minutes and fifty-five seconds (3:55), [...] "What Love Is Made Of" [...] is an uptempo dance and house track that has been described as [...] "rave-y" [...] and [...] "trance-y". Its instrumentation contains the sounds of pianos and synthesizers. Jordan Sargent of Spin observed that it continued the musical style first introduced in Katy's 2012 extended play (EP), Danger EP, which was [...] "straight-forward house". Idolator's Sam Lansky compared her performance in the song to recording artist Siobhán Donaghy.|$|E

To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents.

2500|$|The {{dimension}} of Euclidean -space is [...] When trying to generalize to {{other types of}} spaces, one is faced with the question [...] "what makes [...] -dimensional?" [...] One answer is that to cover a fixed ball in [...] by small balls of radius , one needs {{on the order of}} [...] such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the Minkowski dimension and its more sophisticated variant, the Hausdorff dimension, but there are also other answers <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> For example, the boundary of a ball in [...] looks locally like [...] and this leads to the notion of the inductive dimension.

He also warned world leaders that they and their anti-terror forces could be targets for charges similar to those in the report. At the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu called the report biased and unjust, asking: [...] "Will you stand with Israel or will you stand with the terrorists?

2500|$|The Labour Party came {{to power}} in 1997 with a {{manifesto}} saying, [...] "We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned." [...] A new private member's bill, introduced by Michael Foster MP, received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time. The Burns Report in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting [...] "seriously compromise the welfare of the fox", but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, Lord Burns also stated that [...] "Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... The short answer <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> is no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area." [...] Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an 'options bill' which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and self-regulation. The House of Commons voted for a banning bill and the House of Lords for self-regulation. The 2001 general election was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.|$|E
