5|$|Males having short, cut hair {{are in many}} {{cultures}} viewed as being under society's control, such as while in the military or prison or as punishment for a crime. Although recently in The United States {{it has become more}} socially acceptable and more common for men to have hair reaching all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> their upper back. Long, thick hair has been a sign of wealth, power or prominence throughout time and history.|$|E
5|$|When {{the safety}} car {{came in on}} lap42, Hamilton led, while Heidfeld and Piquet were running second and third. Behind them were Massa, Kubica, Kovalainen, Trulli, Vettel, Alonso, Webber, Rosberg and Räikkönen. Webber's Red Bull had been {{dripping}} oil {{for a couple of}} laps after picking up debris from Glock's crash, and on lap40 he pulled out of the race. Räikkönen quickly passed Rosberg, and then overtook the squabbling Vettel and Alonso on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the hairpin, while Hamilton desperately tried to pull away at the front. Räikkönen passed Trulli twolaps later, while Kovalainen overtook Kubica for fifth place. Coulthard and Barrichello collided on the 48thlap with both cars pitting for repairs. Barrichello retired threelaps later due to damage sustained {{as a result of the}} incident. Hamilton pitted on lap50, coming out behind Heidfeld, Piquet, Massa and Kovalainen. Kovalainen let his teammate past at the hairpin one lap later, meaning that Hamilton was now fourth. On lap52, Heidfeld set a new fastest lap time of 1:15.987. He was the only driver to go under one minute 16 seconds during the Grand Prix. At the end of the following lap, Heidfeld entered the pits with a sizeable gap over Piquet, returning to the field comfortably ahead of Kovalainen, but behind Hamilton.|$|E
25|$|The {{formulae}} {{from the}} previous section are only applicable if the laws of gravity are approximately valid all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Planck scale. In particular, for black holes with masses below the Planck mass (~), they result in impossible lifetimes below the Planck time (~). This is normally seen as {{an indication that the}} Planck mass is the lower limit on the mass of a black hole.|$|E

The Ghirshmans concentrated on excavating a single part of the site, the hectare sized Ville Royale, taking it all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> bare earth. The pottery found at the various levels enabled a stratigraphy to be developed for Susa.|$|E

It was {{developed}} by WLWT to mimic the format and look of fellow talk show The Phil Donahue Show, all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Jerry's haircut and glasses, making him look like Phil Donahue (both were produced by Multimedia Entertainment). It started as a politically oriented talk show, a longer version of Springer's commentaries. Guests included Oliver North and Jesse Jackson, and topics included homelessness and gun politics.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{production}} in Alsace is of AOC wine, {{since there is}} no Vin de pays region which covers Alsace. Thus, the only alternative to producing AOC wine is to declassify it all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Vin de table, which generally means that neither grape varieties, region of origin or vintage may be identified. However, this solution is mostly avoided since edelzwicker and gentil may be blended from several varieties, i.e. varieties that exceed the AOC rules in the concerned season.|$|E
50|$|The walk {{was first}} {{described}} in the 1960s and a Challenge Recorder was appointed: all persons who submitted a full verified account received a woven badge.

25|$|Summits and views: The {{highest point}} on Watermillock Common is Swineside Knott (1,814 feet/553m), a rounded grassy mound {{but with some}} rocks protruding, {{especially}} on its steep eastern side. Swineside Knott has what has been claimed to be “the most sumptuous view” of Ullswater; certainly {{it is the most}} extensive view, from the head of the lake (and the fells on either side of Patterdale beyond that) all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the foot of the lake at Pooley Bridge.|$|E
25|$|The Body: Neapolitan jackets {{tend to be}} shorter in the back; in Neapolitan dialect, {{they say}} the jacket “zompa arrèto,” which roughly {{translates}} as “it jumps in the back”. This characteristic allows for the jacket to “slide” gracefully along the body. The vents on the sides are quite deep in Neapolitan jackets – up to 12 inches. The darts in the front go all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down,</b> <b>to</b> help the fabric follow {{the shape of the}} body and create elegant quarters.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} can {{be considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} computer, with mathematician Charles Babbage having designed the world's first computing system as early as the mid-1800s. Alan Turing went on to devise what is essentially the basis for modern computing and Maurice Wilkes later created the first programmable computer. The webcam was also invented at Cambridge University, as a means for scientists to avoid interrupting their research and going all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the laboratory dining room only to be disappointed by an empty coffee pot.|$|E

However, till this date, {{the government has not}} be able to take the tourism market seriously in Pakistan. The country is home to diverse tourist attractions which have not been funded or protected due to the government giving the tourism market a low priority.|$|E
25|$|The {{fate of the}} {{immediate}} environment of the church has been a subject of dispute between city planners since 1813. Scotsman William Hastie proposed clearing the space around {{all sides of the}} church and all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Moskva River: the official commission led by Fyodor Rostopchin and Mikhail Tsitsianov agreed to clear only the space between the church and Lobnoye Mesto. Hastie's plan could have radically transformed the city, but he lost to the opposition, whose plans were finally endorsed by Alexander I in December 1817 (specific decision on clearing the rubble around the church was issued in 1816).|$|E
25|$|Forrest had 12 {{brothers}} and sisters, {{and half of}} them died of typhoid. Isaac and Bedford (twins), Fanny (Forrest's twin), Milly and Mary all died when Forrest was about 11.

25|$|On the South Col, climbers {{enter the}} death zone. Climbers making summit bids {{typically}} can endure {{no more than}} two or three days at this altitude. That's one reason why clear weather and low winds are critical factors in deciding whether to make a summit attempt. If weather does not cooperate within these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Base Camp.|$|R
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Vikings {{took the lead}} with Peterson getting a 73-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Minnesota {{increased}} its lead with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 48-yard field goal. The Bears would reply with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 32-yard field goal. The Vikings would answer with Peterson getting a 35-yard TD run. Chicago would tie the game with Griese completing a 33-yard TD pass to WR Muhsin Muhammad, along with an 81-yard TD pass to Hester. But on the ensuing kickoff, Adrian Peterson sprinted all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Chicago 38-yard line, setting up Ryan Longwell's game-winning 55-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|In 105 BCE, while {{marching to}} Arausio, the Proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul Quintus Servilius Caepio plundered the sanctuaries {{of the town}} of Tolosa, whose {{inhabitants}} had joined the Cimbri, finding over 50,000 15lb. bars of gold and 10,000 15lb. bars of silver. The riches of Tolosa were shipped back to Rome, but only the silver made it: the gold was stolen by a band of marauders, who were believed to have been hired by Caepio himself and to have killed the legion guarding it. The Gold of Tolosa was never found, and was said to have been passed all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the last heir of the Servilii Caepiones, Marcus Junius Brutus.|$|E
25|$|While, in 1893, Literatorul hosted {{fragments}} of Thalassa in its Romanian-language version, the author also launched a daily, Lumina ("The Light"). It {{was also at}} that stage that Alexandru Macedonski associated with Cincinat Pavelescu, the noted epigrammarian, who joined him in editing Literatorul, and with whom he co-authored the 1893 verse tragedy depicting the Biblical hero Saul, and named after him. Although showcased by the National Theater with star actor Constantin Nottara in the title role, it failed to register success with the public. Two years later, the two Literatorul editors made headlines as pioneers of cycling. An enthusiastic promoter of the sport, Macedonski joined fellow poet Constantin Cantilli on a marathon, pedaling from Bucharest {{across the border into}} Austria-Hungary, all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Brașov.|$|E

In 1856 Frémont was nominated as the Republican candidate for President, losing the race to James Buchanan. He later fought as a Union general during the Civil War.|$|R
25|$|Later in the quarter, the Giants {{drove to}} the Eagles 23-yard line. Two false starts and a holding penalty pushed {{them back to the}} 43, but Manning overcame the {{situation}} by completing three passes to Burress; the first went for 18 yards and the second for 14 and a first down, before the third, an 11-yard strike, found Burress in the end zone for his second touchdown of the game that tied the score with 5:04 to play. Philadelphia responded by driving 46 yards in ten plays, including a first down rush by Westbrook, allowing the Eagles to take the clock all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> three seconds before calling on Akers to kick a 38-yard field goal as time expired.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} way of {{recycling}} graphite occurs when synthetic graphite electrodes are either manufactured and pieces are cut off or lathe turnings are discarded, or the electrode (or other) are used all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the electrode holder. A new electrode replaces the old one, but a sizeable {{piece of the}} old electrode remains. This is crushed and sized, and the resulting graphite powder is mostly used to raise the carbon content of molten steel. Graphite-containing refractories are sometimes also recycled, but often not because of their graphite: the largest-volume items, such as carbon-magnesite bricks that contain only 15–25% graphite, usually contain too little graphite. However, some recycled carbon-magnesite brick is {{used as the basis}} for furnace-repair materials, and also crushed carbon-magnesite brick is used in slag conditioners. While crucibles have a high graphite content, the volume of crucibles used and then recycled is very small.|$|E
25|$|Any real {{measuring}} instrument has a limited range over {{which it can}} accurately measure absorbance. An instrument must be calibrated and checked against known standards if the readings are to be trusted. Many instruments will become non-linear (fail to follow the Beer–Lambert law) starting at approximately 2 AU (~1% transmission). It is also difficult to accurately measure very small absorbance values (below 10−4) with commercially available instruments for chemical analysis. In such cases, laser-based absorption techniques can be used, since they have demonstrated detection limits that supersede those obtained by conventional non-laser-based instruments by many orders of magnitude (detections have been demonstrated all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 5 × 10−13). The theoretical best accuracy for most commercially available non-laser-based instruments is in the range near 1 AU. The path length or concentration should then, when possible, be adjusted to achieve readings near this range.|$|E
