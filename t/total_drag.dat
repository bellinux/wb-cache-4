25|$|When {{an engine}} on a multi-engine {{aircraft}} fails, the thrust distribution on the aircraft becomes asymmetrical, {{resulting in a}} yawing moment {{in the direction of}} the failed engine. A sideslip develops, causing the <b>total</b> <b>drag</b> of the aircraft to increase considerably, resulting in a drop in the aircraft's rate of climb. The rudder, and to a certain extent the ailerons via the use of bank angle, are the only aerodynamic controls available to the pilot to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment.|$|E
25|$|A wing {{is a type}} of fin that {{produces}} lift, while moving through air or some other fluid. As such, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as an airfoils. A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio. The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the <b>total</b> <b>drag</b> on the wing. A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.|$|E
25|$|A {{boattail}} {{can greatly}} reduce a vehicle's <b>total</b> <b>drag.</b> Boattails create a teardrop shape {{that will give}} the vehicle a more streamlined profile, reducing the occurrence of drag inducing flow separation. A kammback is a truncated boattail. It is created {{as an extension of}} the rear of the vehicle, moving the rear backward at a slight angle toward the bumper of the car. This can reduce drag as well but a boattail would reduce the vehicles drag more. Nonetheless, for practical and style reasons, a kammback is more commonly seen in racing, high efficiency vehicles, and trucking.|$|E

50|$|Lift-induced drag is a {{component}} of <b>total</b> <b>drag</b> that arises whenever a finite span wing generates lift. At low speeds an aircraft has to generate lift with a higher angle of attack, thereby leading to greater induced drag. This term dominates the low-speed side of the lift versus velocity graph.|$|E
5000|$|Best {{angle of}} climb (BAOC) [...] {{airspeed}} for an airplane is {{the speed at which}} the maximum excess thrust is available. Excess thrust is the difference between the <b>total</b> <b>drag</b> of the aircraft, and the thrust output of the powerplant. For a jet aircraft, this speed is very close to the speed at which the total minimum drag occurs.|$|E
40|$|Induced drag is {{associated}} with the shedding of vorticity along the span of a finite wing, especially its tip region; for most subsonic aircraft configurations, induced drag constitutes about 50 percent of <b>total</b> aircraft <b>drag</b> throughout the flight envelope. NASA and the U. S. aircraft industry have aggressively studied induced-drag reduction methods. The state-of-the-art CTOL commercial aircraft wing is {{as a result of these}} efforts virtually optimal, with a <b>total</b> induced <b>drag</b> lying within a percent of the theoretical minimum.

At the higher Reynolds numbers local skin friction downstream of the devices showed minimal reductions O (10 percent) and <b>total</b> body <b>drag</b> was increased 1 to 3 percent. At lower Reynolds numbers skin-friction reductions as large as 25 percent were measured and <b>total</b> body <b>drag</b> tended toward net reductions.

50|$|A {{significant}} amount of effort throughout the design process was directed towards reducing the Citation X's <b>total</b> <b>drag.</b> The resulting design includes an area-ruled fuselage for efficient transonic flight, and the aforementioned highly swept supercritical wing. The Citation X's wing is slung below the fuselage rather than passing through it. This allows increased volume in the fuselage, a one-piece wing, and simplified wing-fuselage connections.|$|E

50|$|Drag {{coefficient}} (Cd) is {{a commonly}} published rating of a car's aerodynamic smoothness, {{related to the}} shape of the car. Multiplying Cd by the car's frontal area gives an index of <b>total</b> <b>drag.</b> The result is called drag area, and is listed below for several cars.

50|$|Parasitic drag is drag {{that results}} when an object is moved through a fluid medium. In {{the case of}} {{aerodynamic}} drag, the fluid medium is the atmosphere.

50|$|As {{the lift}} {{generated}} by a sail increases, so does lift-induced drag, which together with parasitic drag constitute <b>total</b> <b>drag,</b> which acts in a direction parallel to the incident airstream. This occurs as the angle of attack increases with sail trim or change of course and causes the lift coefficient to increase {{up to the point}} of aerodynamic stall along with the lift-induced drag coefficient. At the onset of stall, lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag. Sails with the apparent wind behind them (especially going downwind) operate in a stalled condition.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} drag {{is related to}} cross section size, the friction drag is related to total skin surface (which is generally higher in tall people), and the wave-making drag decreases with body length because a longer body will generally generate less waves due to a decreasing Froude number. Studies have found that <b>total</b> <b>drag</b> does not increase as swimmer height increases, mostly due to the decrease in wave-making drag.

The configuration featured two-dimensional convergent-divergent nozzles and twin-vertical tails. The investigation was conducted with different empennage locations that included two horizontal and three vertical tail positions. Vertical tail cant angle was varied from - 10 deg to 20 deg for one selected configuration. Tests were conducted at Mach number 0. 60 to 1. 20 and at angles of attack - 3 to 9 deg. Nozzle pressure ratio was varied from jet off to approximately 9, depending upon Mach number. Tail interference effects were present throughout the range of Mach numbers tested and found to be either favorable or adverse, depending upon test condition and model configuration. At a Mach number of 0. 90, adverse interference effects accounted for a significant percentage of <b>total</b> aft-end <b>drag.</b> Interference effects on the nozzle were generally favorable but became adverse as the horizontal tails were moved from a mid to an aft position.
