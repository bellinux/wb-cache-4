50|$|B. polymorphus is a {{parasite}} residing exclusively in host connective tissues. The gonads {{of its first}} intermediate host, Dreissena, is the primary <b>target</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and sporocyst proliferation. As infection intensifies, the sporocyst develops branches through connective tissue passages, emerges from the gonads, and can spread into other body regions. Such secondary sites of infection have been previously reported {{to occur in the}} digestive glands, the gills, the bundles of adductor muscle, and the mantle epithelium lining the interior of the shells. The study found that the digestive glands of infected bivalves appeared to be relatively normal when compared to full bodied, uninfected specimens. Within the sporocyst, the cercariae existed within a wide range of developmental stages, indicating that its development is asynchronous. It was also observed that heavy infection of the parasite led to host castration, which left the entire gonadal space often occupied by the sporocysts. By limiting the infection almost exclusively to the gonads, the parasites have developed an interesting strategy to only use the reproductive energy of their hosts, thereby minimizing the risk of host mortality. Extending the life of a bucephalus infected host is important because this allows the parasite to proliferate continuously from year to year, since infected gonads produce cercariae instead of gametes. The location of the sporocyst (primarily in gonads), its overall shape, irregular branches, and the morphology of its cercariae with a bifurcated tail, distinguish B. polymorphus from other trematode parasites of zebra mussels in histological sections.|$|E

Inhibition of IFN- signaling in oligodendrocytes increased viral load, infection of oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte loss, demy-elination, and axonal damage resulting in increased mortality.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cases of H 1 N 1 {{and other}} {{pulmonary}} infections evolve to acute respiratory failure and death when co-infections or lung injury predominate over the immune response, thus requiring early diagnosis to improve treatment. OBJECTIVE: To perform a detailed histopathological {{analysis of the}} open lung biopsy specimens from five patients with ARDS with confirmed H 1 N 1. METHODS: Lung specimens underwent microbiologic analysis, and examination by optical and electron microscopy. Immunophenotyping was used to characterize macrophages, natural killer, T and B cells, and expression of cytokines and iNOS. RESULTS: The pathological features observed were necrotizing bronchiolitis, diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage and abnormal immune response. Ultrastructural analysis showed viral-like particles in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Viral-like particles can be successfully demonstrated in lung tissue by ultrastructural examination, without confirmation of the virus by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates.

40|$|Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne flavivirus {{that can}} result in a severe neuroinvasive disease with 50 % of {{survivors}} displaying long-term neurological sequelae. Human POWV cases have been documented in Canada, the United States, and Russia. Although the number of reported POWV human cases has increased in the past fifteen years, POWV remains one of the less studied human pathogenic flaviviruses. Ixodes ticks are the vectors for POWV, and the virus is transmitted to a host's skin very early during the tick feeding process. Central to the successful transmission of a tick-borne pathogen are complex interactions between the host immune response and early tick-mediated immunomodulation, all of which initially occur at the skin interface. In our prior work, we examined the cutaneous immune gene expression during the early stages of POWV-infected Ixodes scapularis feeding. The present study serves to further investigate the skin interface by identifying early cell <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> at the POWV-infected tick feeding site.

We have employed Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) to examine the global expression of genes in PRRSV-infected PAMs. Total cellular RNA was prepared from in vitro mock-infected and PRRSV strain VR- 2332 -infected PAMs at 0, 6, 12, 16 and 24 hours after infection, and subjected to SAGE analysis to obtain> 100, 000 tags per time point.

Nuclear run-on analysis of uninfected and infected, cultured human endothelial cells revealed that the rate of TF mRNA transcription is enhanced more than twofold at 3 h following infection, thus coinciding with increased steady-state levels of TF mRNA. TF mRNA remained relatively unstable during infection, with a half-life of 1. 6 h. The eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not block R. rickettsii-induced increase in TF mRNA levels and actually resulted in its superinduction, thus revealing that de novo synthesis of host cell protein was not prerequisite to this transcriptional response. Involvement of the transcription factor NF-κB in R. rickettsii-induced TF expression was demonstrated by using two unrelated inhibitors of NF-κB activation. The antioxidant pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and the proteasome inhibitor N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone blocked expression of TF mRNA and activity during infection.

Since chemokine receptors play crucial roles in monocyte activation and trafficking, we investigated the effects of HCMV on their expression and function. By using endotheliotropic strains of HCMV, we obtained high rates (roughly 50 %) of in vitro-infected monocytes but only restricted viral gene expression. At 24 h after infection, while the chemokine receptors CX 3 CR and CCR 7 were unaffected, CCR 1, CCR 2, CCR 5, and CXCR 4 were downmodulated on the cell surface and retained intracellularly. Structural components of the viral particles, but not viral gene expression or soluble factors released from infected cells, accounted for the changed localization of the receptor molecules and for the block of chemokine-driven migration. HCMV-infected monocytes indeed became unresponsive to inflammatory and homeostatic chemokines, although the basal cell motility and responsiveness to N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe were unaffected or slightly increased. The production of inflammatory mediators responsible for the recruitment of other immune cells was also hampered by HCMV.

Similarly, infected Langerhans cells (LCs) can prime interferon (IFN) �– producing Th 1 CD 4 � T cells, but whether they are required for Th 1 responses is unknown. We explored the antigen-presenting cell requirement during primary L. major infection using a mouse model in which MHC II, I-A b �, expression is restricted to CD 11 b � and CD 8 � � dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, B cells, macrophages, and LCs are all MHC II–negative in these mice. We demonstrate that antigen presentation by these DC subsets is sufficient to control a subcutaneous L. major infection. CD 4 � T cells undergo complete Th 1 differentiation with parasite-specific secretion of IFN�. Macrophages produce inducible nitric oxide synthase, accumulate at infected sites, and control parasite numbers {{in the absence of}} MHC II expression. Therefore, CD 11 b � and CD 8 � � DCs are not only key initiators of the primary response but also provide all the necessary cognate interactions for CD 4 � T cell Th 1 effectors to control this protozoan infection.

40|$|Thymus dysfunction, {{especially}} immune suppression, {{is frequently}} associated with various virus infections. Whether viruses may disturb the thymus function {{and play a}} role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is an open issue. Enteroviruses, especially Coxsackievirus B 4 (CV-B 4), have been largely suggested as potential inducers or aggravating factors of type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) pathogenesis in genetically predisposed individuals. Several pathogenic mechanisms of enterovirus-induced T 1 D have been suggested. One of these mechanisms is the impairment of central self-tolerance due to viral infections. Coxsackievirus-B 4 is able to infect murine thymus in vitro and in vivo and to infect human thymus in vitro. Thymic epithelial cells and thymocytes are <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> with this virus, and several abnormalities, especially disturbance of maturation/differentiation processes, were observed. Altogether, these data suggest that CV-B <b>infection</b> <b>of</b> thymus may be involved in the pathogenesis of T 1 D. Further investigations are needed to explore this hypothesis.

50|$|Aerosolization of {{antibiotics}} is necessary because <b>infections</b> <b>of</b> the lung are especially troublesome, {{which is why}} direct <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>infection</b> is needed. Broad spectrum antibiotics can have detrimental side effects when their action is also taken against necessary non-pathogenic bacteria residing in the human microbiome. Aerosolization is effective in bypassing the microbiome {{that exists in the}} gastrointestinal tract by directing the antibiotic directly to the lungs. This process is undertaken after the production of the antibiotic itself.|$|R
30|$|A {{substantial}} {{proportion of}} fetuses exposed to microorganisms in utero develop FIRS. This {{is associated with}} the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-α, which predisposes for PPROM and premature labor. Fetuses with FIRS have a higher rate of severe neonatal morbidity. Funisitis and chorionic vasculitis, observed on pathological examination of the umbilical cord, are the histopathologic hallmarks of FIRS [65]. Funisitis is associated with endothelial activation, a key mechanism in the development of organ damage [65, 66]. The lung, gastrointestinal tract, and skin are exposed to amniotic fluid during pregnancy and are notorious <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>infection</b> and subsequent inflammation during pregnancy. Besides the fact that antenatal infection and inflammation can predispose to organ damage, such an infection may also have an effect on organ-specific immunity. In the next part, we will summarize what is known about the effects of prenatal inflammatory exposure on skin, lung, and gut-specific immunity.|$|R
