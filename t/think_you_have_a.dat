2500|$|According to a 2006 Newsweek interview, [...] "For Graham, {{politics}} is a secondary to the Gospel.... When Newsweek asked Graham whether ministers—whether they {{think of themselves as}} evangelists, pastors or a bit of both—should spend time engaged with politics, he replied: 'You know, I think in a way that has to be up to the individual as he feels led of the Lord. A lot of things that I commented on years ago would not have been of the Lord, I'm sure, but I think you have some—like communism, or segregation, on which I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> responsibility to speak out.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Lloyd Webber {{chose to}} save Niamh and {{eliminate}} Keisha. Before announcing his decision he said, [...] "First, I'm {{going to say}} this is a complete and utter travesty, neither of you should be in the bottom two, it's completely wrong. I've been put into a situation that I have never wanted to be in. For the first time on a television show, I am angry." [...] And after choosing to eliminate Keisha, he told her, [...] "You were absolutely wonderful. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> huge career ahead of you and all I can say is that I'll do anything I can to help you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come, Nell; {{one would}} <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{personal}} dislike to her. Let her go; she won't trouble you--nor, I reckon, ANYBODY, much longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{right to}} do what you please about it. It's none of the hands' {{business}} if you don't choose to ask them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Isa. Nay, {{if a woman}} cannot do that, I shall <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ill {{opinion of}} my virtue: Not trust your own flesh and blood, Sir Timorous? ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{the initial}} {{interview}} on 30 May 2011, Burke explained on Liveline {{that she had}} [...] "a tape somewhere around but I cant find it, its twelve years old and I don't know {{whether it would be}} viable now". Also, when Burke was asked if she had a tape while being interviewed on [...] on 31 May 2011 by Caitriona Perry, Perry asserted that [...] "despite originally believing that she had a recording of the interview, Helen Lucy Burke is now not so sure". Burke explained, [...] "I don't think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, {{but it turns out that}} it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box". When Caitriona Perry asked [...] "do you <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tape anywhere else", Burke replied [...] "it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in". In the last days of the campaign the tape was released and according to the Irish Independent, Ms. Burke [...] "said yesterday she found the tape recently but only released it in the last days of the campaign for “impact.” She said “it would give people something to think about when they went to the polls.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Anne Shirley," [...] said Marilla {{as soon as}} {{she could}} speak, [...] "if you must borrow trouble, for pity's sake borrow it handier home. I should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> imagination, sure enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'See here, John!' he said, {{holding out}} a letter; and then, with an accent of wrathful anguish, and a terrible frown, he turned on James, exclaiming, 'I would send you to the Tower, Sir, did I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hand in this!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{often felt}} {{inclined}} {{to agree with}} them," [...] said Molly; [...] "and then, now and again, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> heart tucked away somewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} quite {{understand}} the situation, Mrs. Travers. I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> clear idea, either of his simplicity or of his visionary's pride." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-morning," [...] {{said the}} captain, cheerfully {{addressing}} the postmaster. [...] "I am Mr. Bygrave of North Shingles. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{letter in the}} box, addressed to Mr.--?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{seems to}} <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are perfect, {{and she never}} comes here but she asks when you're to be home. I suppose she <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good {{influence}} on that miserable husband of hers. He's going from bad to worse, I guess. Father heard that he is betting on the election. That's what he's doing with your money." ...|$|R
5000|$|Though <b>you</b> may <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> hemorrhoids, <b>a</b> {{diagnosis}} is often {{confirmed by the}} physician after a colonoscopy, or an anoscopy/proctoscopy is performed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> mistake. <b>You</b> are {{possibly}} confusing me {{with somebody}} else; I have not the honour of your acquaintance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{head for}} everything," [...] said Aurelia Fitzloom, {{in a soft}} sentimental whisper; [...] "I am sure we owe all our {{happiness}} to-day to you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I didn't go every day. Moreover I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very {{different}} idea {{in this country}} of what constitutes--well, what constitutes making love. A man commits himself much sooner.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{case against}} me and Mr. Stumpy, and {{you intend to}} drag it into court and make a great fuss over it," [...] he went on.|$|E
40|$|I teach earth {{science to}} {{people who want to}} become K- 6 teachers. I find this lesson a bit {{confusing}} because you are starting with a liquid, the pancake batter. As you know metamorphic rocks start as some other solid rock that changes without melting. Students may <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> igneous process going on since the batter is liquid, the chocolate chips melt, and melting by the addition of heat is another igneous process. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you will}} hear it in time," [...] she assured him. [...] "You will {{probably}} <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> great discovery. In the meantime, farewell." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I understand," [...] said Barbara. [...] "Still, {{there are}} no strangers here, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> man who would attempt {{anything}} of that kind about the mine." ...|$|E

6000|$|Peter nodded. [...] "More than that, Mr. Toad. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{little the}} best of it," [...] he replied. [...] "Now won't {{you tell me how}} you did it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said he <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got <b>a</b> bad temper," [...] {{continued}} his wife. [...] "He thinks, perhaps, it's indigestion, caused by eating cheese for supper always." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Where I {{got this}} fellow," [...] replied the warden, {{reaching}} under the bunk and drawing out {{the body of}} a beaver. [...] "I know you better than to <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hand in this, Pat," [...] he continued, [...] "but"--he hesitated and then continued hurriedly, [...] "I thought perhaps your partner <b>has</b> been doin' <b>a</b> little poachin' unbeknown to you. You know he didn't have the best name ever was when he first came into these parts." ...|$|R
60|$|Robert {{is in good}} spirits, and {{inclined}} to like Paris increasingly. Do <b>you</b> know I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> idea in England that you monopolise comforts, and I, for one, can't admit it. These snug 'apartments' exclude the draughty passages and staircases, which threaten your life every time that you run to your bedroom for a pocket-handkerchief in England. I much prefer the Continental houses to the English ones, both for winter and summer, on this account.|$|R
60|$|Maccario laughed softly. “Now I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little {{explanation}} to make, Don Bernardino, {{and it is}} conceivable that the Señor Harding may not be grateful to you,” he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dear, kind old heart,' I said, 'under the quaintest and crustiest outside such a heart ever wore; you're a truculent old darling: so that's {{the plain}} truth of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{message for}} me, White Man, for {{not long ago}} a certain {{wandering}} witch-doctor who came here told me to expect you and that you had words to say to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Master Davy,' said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking hand, and {{speaking}} in a breathless sort of way. 'What do <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> got <b>a</b> Pa!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, {{we must go}} by averages of course. Shall we say {{two years}}? I should <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> full two years before you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> earned <b>a</b> {{right to}} think of yourself, as well as others. <b>You</b> {{certainly}} <b>have</b> nothing to gain by staying longer in the service." ...|$|R
