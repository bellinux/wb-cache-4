The squadron moved by the 22d, and on the 23d operations began from the new station. By early October, with the American infantry advancing on all points between the Argonne and the Meuse, German aircraft were concentrating all available resources to stop the Air Service from getting information about its rear areas. Enemy aircraft were constantly attacking squadron aircraft with a far higher intensity than what was experienced earlier, and the 91st brought down a number of enemy planes, far out of proportion <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be expected from an observation squadron.|$|E
25|$|Sufis (Islamic mystics) {{played an}} {{important}} role in the spread of Islam in India. They were very successful in spreading Islam, as many aspects of Sufi belief systems and practices had their parallels in Indian philosophical literature, in particular nonviolence and monism. The Sufis' orthodox approach towards Islam made it easier for Hindus to practice. Hazrat Khawaja Muin-ud-din Chishti, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, Nizamuddin Auliya, Shah Jalal, Amir Khusrow, Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari, Shekh Alla-ul-Haq Pandwi, Ashraf Jahangir Semnani, Waris Ali Shah, Ata Hussain Fani Chishti trained Sufis for the propagation of Islam in different parts of India. Once the Islamic empire was established in India, Sufis invariably provided a touch of colour and beauty <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> have otherwise been rather cold and stark reigns. The Sufi movement also attracted followers from the artisan and untouchable communities; they played a crucial role in bridging the distance between Islam and the indigenous traditions. Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent member of the Naqshbandi Sufi advocated the peaceful conversion of Hindus to Islam.|$|E

500|$|It was {{difficult}} finding a {{title for the}} book; [...] "Silent Spring" [...] was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: Silent Spring would be a metaphorical title for the entire book—suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world—rather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong. With Carson's approval, editor Paul Brooks at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, A Fable for Tomorrow, which Carson intended as a gentle introduction <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing, and were {{laying the groundwork for}} promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.|$|E

Keller felt the Full Metal Mayhem bout was a [...] "clustermess of a match," [...] {{but at the same}} time was [...] "entertaining start to finish." [...] As for the World Tag Team Championship match, he said that it felt [...] "anticlimactic" [...] and that having the fans at ringside was more of a [...] "distraction" [...] than a [...] "payoff." [...] Regarding the World X Cup, Keller said the third round bout was a dream match for some with [...] "lots of cool spots from start to finish," [...] but that it had [...] "little context early" [...] and was more just a [...] "bunch of spots." [...] He also said that the [...] "last ten minutes was better without as many people tagging in and out somewhat indiscriminately." [...] As for the final round, Keller commented that [...] "it had some spectacular (and ridiculously dangerous looking) spots," [...] but that it ended up [...] "feeling short for a match of that caliber." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} album cover, {{designed by}} art collective Hipgnosis, shows a Holstein-Friesian cow {{standing in a}} pasture with no text nor any other clue as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be on the record. Some later editions have the title and artist name added to the cover. This concept was the group's reaction to the psychedelic space rock imagery associated with Pink Floyd {{at the time of}} the album's release; the band wanted to explore all sorts of music without being limited to a particular image or style of performance. They thus requested that their new album had [...] "something plain" [...] on the cover, which ended up being the image of a cow. Storm Thorgerson, inspired by Andy Warhol's famous [...] "cow wallpaper", has said that he simply drove out into a rural area near Potters Bar and photographed the first cow he saw. The cow's owner identified her name as [...] "Lulubelle III". More cows appear on the back cover, again with no text or titles, and on the inside gatefold. Also, a pink balloon shaped like a cow udder accompanied the album as part of Capitol's marketing strategy campaign to [...] "break" [...] the band in the US. The liner notes in later CD editions give a recipe for Traditional Bedouin Wedding Feast on a card labelled [...] "Breakfast Tips". Looking back on the artwork, Thorgerson remembered: [...] "I think the cow represents, in terms of the Pink Floyd, part of their humour, which I think is often underestimated or just unwritten about." ...|$|E

2500|$|As yet, the UK has not {{consolidated}} a single statutory {{definition of the}} people to whom employment rights and duties apply. Statute and case law, both domestic and European, use 2 main definitions (employee and worker), and approximately 3 other minor types (jobholder, apprentice, and someone with an employment relation). The EU does have one consolidated definition of a ‘worker’, which is someone who has a contract for work in return for a wage, or an indirect quid pro quo (as in a communal cooperative), and also stands as the more vulnerable party to the contract. This reflects the kernel of classical labour law theory, that an employment contract is one infused with [...] "inequality of bargaining power", and stands as a justification for mandating additional terms <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> otherwise be agreed under a system of total freedom of contract.|$|E
2500|$|... "New materialism" [...] has {{now become}} its own {{specialized}} subfield of knowledge, with courses being offered on the topic at major universities, as well as numerous conferences, edited collections, and monographs devoted to it. Jane Bennett’s book Vibrant Matter (Duke UP, 2010) has been particularly instrumental in bringing theories of monist ontology and vitalism back into a critical theoretical fold dominated by poststructuralist theories of language and discourse. Scholars such as Mel Y. Chen and Zakiyyah Iman Jackson, however, have critiqued this body of new materialist literature for its neglect in considering the materiality of race and gender in particular. Other scholars such as Hélene Vosters have questioned whether there is anything particularly [...] "new" [...] about this so-called [...] "new materialism", as Indigenous and other animist ontologies have attested <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be called the [...] "vibrancy of matter" [...] for centuries.|$|E

2500|$|As a {{director}} of archaeological excavation projects, Sylvanus Morley was well regarded and liked by his colleagues and his Carnegie board employers, his later movement to [...] "lighter duties" [...] notwithstanding.

For some later Maya researchers, [...] "...in spite of seventeen years of research at Chichén Itzá by Carnegie, this world-famous city yet remains an archaeological enigma"; it is comparatively little-understood given the amount of work which had gone into it under Morley's direction.

2500|$|... "Social thriller" [...] (often {{appearing}} in quotes) {{was being used}} {{as early as the}} 1970s to [...] retrospectively describe political neo-noir cinema. An early example comes from cinema writer Georges Sadoul's characterization of El Wahsh ("The Monster"), an Egyptian crime film entered into the 1954 Cannes Film Festival. Sadoul sums up the film as [...] "a social thriller based on an authentic police case about police pursuit of a drug-addicted gangster." [...] Sadoul goes on to describe the film's documentary style and backdrop of life in the Egyptian countryside. Other early uses of the term can be found in depictions of French New Wave films, such as The Nada Gang, Claude Chabrol's 1974 film Inspired by the May 1968 events in France. In their book, French Culture Since 1945, Malcolm and Martin Cook wrote that [...] "Chabrol's career has been almost exclusively devoted <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> be called the 'social thriller'—films using a suspense format often akin to that of Hitchcock to comment on the deviousness and duplicity of French society." ...|$|E
