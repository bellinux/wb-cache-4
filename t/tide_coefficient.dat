Individuals migrate passively with the flood tide current behind the dynamic tide front, and their movements into the water column {{are linked to the}} surrounding luminosity and water turbidity. A numerical model was built from observations gathered on glass eel densities during scientific surveys. It uses the outputs of a hydrodynamic model accounting for the variations in the river flow and <b>tide</b> <b>coefficient.</b> It allows the simulation of the displacement of a particle in the longitudinal axis of the estuary. The variation of the vertical movements through the water column takes into account the cloud cover, the moon phases, the alternation of days and nights and the water turbidity. The results allow displaying the migration speed of groups of glass eels entering the Adour estuary. These simulations are validated by the comparison with in situ observations and the outputs of the behavioral model make possible, on the one hand, to simulate the migration speed of glass eels according to hydrological data and, on the other hand, to define the environmental conditions that stop or slow down their displacement into the estuary...|$|E

40|$|A {{standard}} geodetic GPS {{receiver and}} a conventional Aquatrak tide gauge, collocated at Friday Harbor, Washington, {{are used to}} assess the quality of 10 years of water levels estimated from GPS sea surface reflections. The GPS results are improved by accounting for (tidal) motion of the reflecting sea surface and for signal propagation delay by the troposphere. The RMS error of individual GPS water level estimates is about 12 cm. Lower water levels are measured slightly more accurately than higher water levels. Forming daily mean sea levels reduces the RMS difference with the tide gauge data to approximately 2 cm. For monthly means, the RMS difference is 1. 3 cm. The GPS elevations, of course, can be automatically placed into a well-defined terrestrial reference frame. Ocean <b>tide</b> <b>coefficients,</b> determined from both the GPS and tide gauge data, are in good agreement, with absolute differences below 1 cm for all constituents save K 1 and S 1. The latter constituent is especially anomalous, probably owing to daily temperature-induced errors in the Aquatrak tide gaug...|$|R
40|$|The wind {{velocities}} observed over {{cities on}} the southern coast of Lake Erie during storms are modified, according to recently given meteoro-logical theories, to obtain the wind velocities coexisting over the sur-face of the lake water. On {{the basis of these}} reduced velocities and the associated wind tides of the lake, the coefficient of wind stress of wind action on the water of the lake is determined. Due attention is given {{to the fact that the}} form of the lake affects the relation between the wind stress and the associated wind <b>tide.</b> The <b>coefficient</b> of stress arrived at for the larger wind velocities is in substantial agreement with the values which Neumann determined for the Gulf of Bothnia. The matter of sea roughness is discussed briefly. TREATMENT OF THE OBSERVED WIND VELOCITIES.

40|$|Xynthia was {{a violent}} {{windstorm}} which crossed Western Europe in 2010. Its transit caused {{the death of}} 59 people in Europe. France was the hardest country hit by Xynthia: 47 people were killed, most of them from drowning, and direct losses amounted to more than 2. 5 billion Euros. Strong gusts and waves of several meters of height, associated to high <b>coefficient</b> <b>tides,</b> caused a phenomenon of storm surge in the Atlantic coastal area of France, particularly in the Vend√©e and Charente-Maritime departments. Sea walls, lacking of maintenance and originally built to defend agricultural land, {{were not able to}} protect houses. Around 10, 000 people were forced to evacuate after the inundation of their properties. Essentially, a restrictive construction policy is supposed to be applied to these areas. In actual practice, mayors are sometimes not able to resist the pressure of property developers and, since 1999, about 100, 000 houses have been built in flood prone areas all over France. During the storm, uncontrolled urbanization was involved in the increase of stakes, as demonstrated by the fact that all the 29 victims in the city of la Faute-sur-Mer were living in houses built after 1980. There is also a very clear link between the type of building and mortality due to marine submersion: three-quarters of the victims died in houses without a second floor, where water reached heights over the ceiling elevation. After Xynthia transit, the government decided to destroy 1510 houses in the affected areas (called black zones). Most of the occupants did not agree with this decision, demanding further investigation, and eventually the government had to gradually revoke the policy for the black zones. We affirm that an attentive governance should include a balanced approach to risk protection, combining the reduction of natural hazard with broader measures of land management, to contemporary diminish vulnerability (e. g. by changing housing standards and building physical protections) and exposure (e. g. by zoning policies). Risk management includes a multitude of actors (national government, local authorities, communities) having different spatial scale and roles, and the difficulties relate to agents myopia, moral hazard problems, and conflicting interests. Moreover real estate market does not appropriately consider risk. We conclude that this complexity has to be accurately considered, and actors must be aware of the long term impact of their decisions. This could permit to improve actual risk governance and contemporary maintain the local economic dynamism...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} development, testing, {{and application of}} numerical models for simulating hurricane-induced storm surges and waves in coastal waters, with particular application to storm surges and inundation during Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Dennis (2005) within the northeast Gulf of Mexico. This study also includes {{an assessment of the}} vulnerability of coastal highways and bridges during hurricane event. Recent development in storm surge modeling was briefly reviewed followed by a detailed discussion of the high-resolution, curvilinear-grid coastal storm surge modeling system CH 3 D-SSMS. By dynamically coupling with a local wave model SWAN and a regional surge model ADCIRC, CH 3 D-SSMS is able to simulate wave, storm surge, and inundation during tropical storms driven by wind, atmospheric pressure, radiation stress, and freshwater discharge. For application to Hurricane Ivan (2004) and Hurricane Dennis (2005), a curvilinear grid with grid spacing of 100 m to 1, 000 m was generated for the northeast Gulf of Mexico to resolve the complex shoreline as defined by the combined bathymetry/topography available from NOAA and USGS. NOAA HRD wind, NCEP WNA wind, and analytical Holland wind with land reduction effect are used in the model. CH 3 D-SSMS successfully reproduced both the magnitude and phase of storm surge and wave transport over extensive Northeast Gulf domain for both hurricanes. The extent of flooding is found to be significant around Pensacola Bay during Category four Hurricane Ivan. Wave heights are reduced significantly from open water to coastal bay areas, but they are still sufficient to cause coastal structure damages. Various tests were conducted to investigate the model sensitivity to wind, land dissipation on wind, atmospheric pressure, wave, <b>tide,</b> bottom friction <b>coefficient,</b> open boundary condition, and time step. The results reveal that wind field is the dominant factor affecting storm surge development. Atmospheric pressure, wave-induced radiation stress, bottom friction coefficient, and water level at open boundary also have significant effects on simulated surge level. It is found that the water level at open boundary from shelf wave may contribute up to half of total storm surge at some coastal stations for Hurricane Dennis simulation. Other factors are found to be not very sensitive. The coastal highways risk analysis during storm event, aimed to improve highway and bridge safety and security, is conducted for Hurricane Ivan in Florida and nearby states. The methodology of wave load calculation is described and then applied to the I- 10 Bridge over Escambia Bay during Hurricane Ivan. The results confirmed that the big waves on top of the high surge during Ivan were sufficient to cause the breakdown of bolted connection, overcome of span weight and total damage of the bridge deck. With slightly decreased surge levels, the total wave force would be significantly reduced and result in no threat to the bridge. The risk analysis tests are conducted by varying hurricane parameters of intensity, size, landfall location, speed, and direction of approach for Hurricane Ivan. All these parameters are found to be important. A ranking system for assessing the vulnerability of coastal highways and bridges along the northeast Gulf coasts to storm surge and wave damages in extreme storm events are presented...|$|R
