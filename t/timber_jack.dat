In order to estimate the optimal density for road network in Dalak kheyl forest district (Mazandaran Wood and Paper Industries), we calculated the roading costs and hourly costs of <b>Timber</b> <b>jack</b> 450 C and HSM 904 skidders. The length of skid trails was measured by a steel meter. Also, time study was performed by using chronometer for skidding machines. Then the optimum density for Dalak kheyl forest roads was estimated by minimizing sum of skidding and roading costs. The {{results of this study}} showed that the optimum density of forest roads for <b>Timber</b> <b>jack</b> 450 C and HSM 904 were 2 - 4 m ha- 1 and 3 - 5 m ha- 1, respectively. Furthermore, the optimum road density for both machines was 3 - 5 m ha- 1. These estimated densities were much less than current road density of Dalak kheyl forest, which was 16. 1 m ha- 1. Therefore, the existing road had efficient density for Dalak kheyl forest. Of course, this density was only calculated from skidding and roading costs and it {{may not be enough to}} determine overall optimal density that should be calculated by considering other road duties. Time study revealed that the movement speed of HSM 904 skidder was more than <b>Timber</b> <b>jack</b> 450 C. It took 266 seconds for HSM 904 skidder to skid logs from 100 meter distance, whereas <b>Timber</b> <b>jack</b> 450 C spent 490 seconds for skidding logs in the same distance.

40|$|Information on the productivity, {{costs and}} {{applications}} of the logging system is a key component {{in the evaluation of}} management plans for the rehabilitation and utilization of Caspian forests. Skidding and road construction costs are expensive forest operations. Determining the optimum forest road network density {{is one of the most}} important factors in sustainable forest management. Logging method is an important factor to determine the optimum road network density. In this research, in order to determine the optimum road network density, skidding cost and road construction cost were calculated. Linear programming model was used in order to reduce the skidding costs and to determine the optimal forest road network density. Our aim was to determine the minimum skidding cost for <b>Timber</b> <b>Jack</b> and Clark skidders for different average skidding distance. The results showed that it is less costly if Clark skidder is used for skidding. Then the optimal road network density at this manner was 8 m/ha...|$|E

It is very small and consists of a circular signboard on a pole, a fuel dispenser with a long suspended fuel hose, and two large 'Mobiloil' canisters arranged side to side with two smaller fuel cans placed on top, partly hiding a bucket. The station is situated next to a run-down building with a large, faded bilingual inscription on its side wall. Behind is an empty field with a few two-wheeled carts lined up side to side. Two cars are parked on the roadside next to the station. A man is loading something into the first. A wheel is lying on the pavement next to it, and {{a man with a}} beard dressed in a coat and cap and with a cigarette in his mouth is passing between the car and the station. In the lower left foreground, a day labourer in opanci, carrying a saw and a <b>timber</b> <b>jack</b> on his shoulder, is passing by, while a woman is walking swiftly out of the frame. The house with the inscription seems to be empty. The inscription reads 'Frizer za dame - Coiffeur pour Dames- Ivić' (Ladies’ hairdresser Ivić) ...|$|E

40|$|Primary {{transportation}} is an upper time, expensive and hard labour. The most skidding are with using of rubber wheel of <b>Timber</b> <b>jack</b> 450 C in Iran {{country that has}} devoted 60 % of utilization expenses. In order to, investigate of slope and loading volume effects on time of loaded traveling had used time study for Timberjack 450 C. In one of strip roads in parcel eleven of district two of Langa management plan forest (Kelardasht region in North of Iran) determined 5 and 3 different slopes classes and volumes classes, respectively. Then, time study was performed in slope classes with different loading volume in downward skidding. The first, collection of data have noted in special form and then have converted to uniform unit of m sec - 1. Descriptive statistics for each data set were calculated using the SPSS software. With presupposition that loading volume and slope are effective on the obtained time, these parameters have analyzed. ANOVA and Tukey test were used for loading volume factor. For investigation slope factor had used of Mann Whitney non-parametric test in order to comparison of loaded traveling speed in different slopes. Results of present research had showed that influence of loading volume on the loaded traveling time is insignificant, but loaded traveling speed in different slope classes is significant (in slopes > 30 %) as, speed of skidder machine is decreased with increase of slope variable...|$|E

2500|$|During the Second World War plywood {{had become}} a major {{building}} material for aircraft. After the war, plywood was adapted for building sailing dinghies. Two primary methods of construction were adopted: stitch and glue and <b>timber</b> framed construction. <b>Jack</b> Holt designed many dinghies to be built by home handymen using these construction techniques. The Mirror Dinghy was predominantly built using stitch and glue, while the Enterprise and [...] Heron {{is an example of}} a boat built using plywood on a timber frame.|$|R
2500|$|The Hastings News {{said that}} he was [...] "one of the most {{prominent}} members of the Victorian building trade (in Hastings)", that [...] "all he touched seemed to turn to gold," [...] and that [...] "he was popular with his workforce for being firm but fair". The company's office was in a large sawmill between Station Road and the top of the east side of Middle Street. In October 1864 the Council had to ask Howell to relieve the local nuisance caused by smoke from the sawmill, and in January 1865 the mill suffered from severe subsidence. The Hastings News said that Howell [...] "had the building shored with nearly forty <b>timber</b> beams, <b>jacks</b> and hydraulic presses. The building was forced back ten to eleven inches over a period of three days". The company organised an annual excursion for the employees: for example on 24 July 1869 seventy men were taken on six wagonettes to the Bell Inn at Northiam, leaving {{early in the morning and}} returning at midnight. Howell Senior retired in 1882, and the original company was dissolved, although his son continued in business under the same name.|$|R
5000|$|Joists may join {{to their}} {{supporting}} beams in many ways: joists resting {{on top of}} the supporting beams are said to be [...] "lodged"; dropped in using a butt cog joint (a type of lap joint), half-dovetail butt cog, or a half-dovetail lap joint. Joists may also be tenoned in during the raising with a soffit tenon or a tusk tenon (possibly with a housing). Joists can also be joined by being slipped into mortises after the beams are in place such as a chase mortise (pulley mortise), L-mortise, or [...] "short joist". Also, in some Dutch-American work, ground level joists are placed on a foundation and then a sill placed {{on top of the}} joists such as what <b>timber</b> frame builder <b>Jack</b> Sobon called an [...] "inverted sill" [...] or with a [...] "plank sill".|$|R
5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland Timbers. The Timbers, who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the Timbers, thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well as Chris Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily linesmen Eric Proctor. It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first coming on the previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the Timbers. United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved Timbers striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. Proctor flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was ruled that a second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for Proctor to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to Proctor in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, <b>Timbers</b> captain <b>Jack</b> Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the Timbers conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. A quarter of an hour later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|R
