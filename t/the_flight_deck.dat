5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> {{unlike those}} on Royal Navy carriers, was {{superimposed}} on the ship's hull rather than constructed as a strength deck supporting the carrier's hull structure. A system {{of lights and}} mirrors along <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> assisted pilots in landing on the carrier.|$|E
5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and {{out of the way of}} landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending from the side of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E

5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} electronic instrument displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|E
5|$|By October 1915 Campania had {{exercised}} {{with the}} Grand Fleet seven times, but had only flown off aircraft {{three times as}} the North Sea was often too rough for her seaplanes to use. Her captain recommended that the flying-off deck be lengthened and given a steeper slope to allow gravity to boost the aircraft's acceleration and the ship was accordingly modified at Cammell Laird between November 1915 and early April 1916. The forward funnel was split into two funnels and <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> was extended between them and over the bridge to a length of , so that aircraft from both holds could use <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck.</b> A canvas windscreen was provided to allow the aircraft to unfold their wings out of the wind, and a kite balloon {{and all of its}} supporting equipment were added in the aft hold. Campania now carried seven Short Type 184 torpedo bombers and three or four smaller fighters or scouts; a Type 184 made its first takeoff from <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> on 3 June 1916, also using a wheeled trolley. This success prompted the Admiralty to order the world's first aircraft designed for carrier operations, the Fairey Campania. The ship received the first of these aircraft in late 1917 where they joined smaller Sopwith 1½ Strutter scouts. At various times Campania also carried the Sopwith Baby and Sopwith Pup.|$|E
5|$|From 2003, A320's feature {{liquid crystal}} display (LCD) units in <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> of its A318, A319, A320, and A321 flight decks instead of the {{original}} cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. These include the main displays and the backup artificial horizon, which was an analog display prior to this.|$|E
50|$|The basic Canadarm {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a manipulator arm, a Canadarm display and control panel, including rotational and translational hand controllers at <b>the</b> orbiter aft <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> <b>flight</b> crew station, and a manipulator controller interface unit that interfaces with the orbiter computer. Most of the time, the arm operators see {{what they are doing}} by looking at the Advanced Space Vision System screen next to the controllers.One crew member operates the Canadarm from <b>the</b> aft <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> control station, and a second crew member usually assists with television camera operations. This allows the Canadarm operator to view Canadarm operations through <b>the</b> aft <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> payload and overhead windows and through the closed-circuit television monitors at <b>the</b> aft <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> station.|$|R

5|$|HMS Pioneer and HMS Perseus {{were not}} {{completed}} {{to their original}} design as Colossus-class light aircraft carriers; the success of Unicorn prompted modification of the ships whilst under construction into aircraft maintenance ships without aircraft catapults and deckhouses built on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not {{convinced}} when {{the class was}} being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} firing them to port would have damaged <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck.</b> They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{effective}} anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} U.S. ships, plus evasive maneuvers, the bombs from the first nine Vals missed Enterprise. However, at 16:44, an armor-piercing, delayed-action bomb penetrated <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> near the aft elevator and passed through three decks before detonating below the waterline, killing 35 men and wounding 70 more. Incoming sea water caused Enterprise to develop a slight list, {{but it was not}} a major breach of hull integrity.|$|E
5|$|Crew {{facilities}} {{will include}} a cinema, physical fitness areas and four galleys manned by sixty-seven catering staff. There are four large dining areas, the largest with the capacity to serve 960 meals in one hour. There are eleven medical staff for the eight-bed medical facility, which includes an operating theatre and a dental surgery. There are 1,600 bunks in 470 cabins, including accommodation for a company of 250 Royal Marines with wide assault routes up to <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sydney {{normally}} transported 450 soldiers—the main {{force of}} a Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) battalion—plus equipment and vehicles on each voyage. The soldiers were accommodated in the sailors mess decks, with the sailors displaced to the hangar. Vehicles were secured to <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> while other cargo was packed onto pallets and stored either in the hangar or on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck.</b> Although it was originally intended that Sydney would sail to and from Saigon, the ship's commanding officer {{at the time of}} the first voyage, John Crabb, informed the Naval Board that he would refuse orders to do so, as the Saigon River could easily be mined after Sydney had sailed up. Instead, the port of Vũng Tàu was selected as the destination, with soldiers and equipment transferred to shore by helicopters, landing craft, and barges. During the early voyages, unloading and reloading was a multiple-day process, with the transport moving to deeper waters each night, but improved cargo handling practices, upgrades to Sydney (including the installation of three new cargo cranes and six embarked landing craft during mid-1968 refit), and increased access to US cargo- and troop-carrying helicopters, reduced this to a single day by 1968.|$|E

5|$|After {{commissioning}} {{too late}} {{to participate in the}} First World War, Argus was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from Furious. The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck.</b> Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two Airco DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown {{over the side of the}} carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.|$|E
5|$|Although no flight-deck cruisers {{were ever}} {{built by the}} U.S. Navy, the Soviet Union's , {{developed}} in the 1970s, is remarkably {{similar to that of}} the original flight-deck cruiser design, featuring an angled flight deck aft with anti-ship missile launchers forwards. In addition, during the early 1980s, plans were proposed for the reactivation of the U.S. Navy's Iowa-class battleships that entailed the removal of each ship's aft turret and the installation of a flight deck for operating V/STOL aircraft; in the end a much more modest conversion, lacking <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck,</b> was carried out.|$|E
5|$|Eagles refit was {{completed}} on 9January 1942 {{and she was}} working up {{for the next five}} weeks. She joined the convoy WS16 en route to Gibraltar on 16February and reached it a week later. 813 and 824 Squadrons had rejoined the ship with their Swordfish and they were supplemented by four Hawker Sea Hurricane 1B fighters from a detachment of 804 Squadron and the Fighter Flight of 813 Squadron. Because their wings could not fold, they could not use either lift and remained on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> at all times. The ship reached Gibraltar on 23February and was assigned to Force H.|$|E

5|$|For {{self-defence}} against enemy warships, Eagle {{had nine}} BL Mk XVII 6-inch guns, three at the stern and six along {{both sides of}} the ship. The ship carried 200 rounds per gun. Two of her five QF Mk V 4-inch AA guns were positioned on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> in front of the island while a third was behind the island. The remaining two guns were mounted on top of the island, one between the two funnels, and each gun was provided with 150 rounds.|$|E
5|$|Kaga {{entered the}} {{shipyard}} on 15 December 1938, where her arrester gear {{was replaced by}} a Type 3 system and her bridge was modernized. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>deck</b> and hangar areas were enlarged, increasing the carrier's aircraft capacity. The ship was completely overhauled from 15 November 1939 to 15 November 1940 before returning to active service. In the meantime, a new generation of aircraft had entered service and Kaga embarked 12 Mitsubishi A5M fighters, 24 Aichi D1A dive bombers and 36 Yokosuka B4Y torpedo bombers. Another 18 aircraft were carried in crates as spares.|$|E
