5|$|Eduard Anatolyevich Streltsov {{was born}} in Perovo, an eastern {{district}} of Moscow, on 21 July 1937, the son of Anatoly Streltsov, a front-line soldier and intelligence officer, and Sofia Frolovna. Anatoly {{did not return to}} the family following the Second World War, instead choosing to settle alone in Kiev; Sofia therefore raised her son on her own, working at the Fraser Cutting Instruments Factory to support Eduard and herself. As a result, Streltsov had a modest upbringing, <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>of</b> which were playing football and following his favoured team, Spartak Moscow.|$|E

A three-way dance was next, with Tajiri facing Little Guido Maritato and Super Crazy. Tajiri was accompanied {{to the ring}} by The Sinister Minister and Mikey Whipwreck, and Guido was accompanied by his fellow F.B.I. members.

Guido was the first eliminated when Whipwreck delivered a Whipper Snapper while the referee was distracted. Tajiri picked up the three count to eliminate Guido.

5|$|As a {{freshman}} at Michigan, he scored 21 points, including 12 goals, in 33 games. That season he missed eight games due to a leg injury. As a sophomore during the 2008–09 season, Caporusso was one of ten finalists for the Hobey Baker Award. During the season, he scored 49 points in 41 games. He was also named to the All-Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) first-team and AHCA/Reebok Division I Ice Hockey All-American first-team along with team mate Aaron Palushaj. In addition, he was selected to the CCHA All-Conference tournament team. One of <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>of</b> the season occurred when he scored the first three goals {{of the game in}} the first period (the first two within 24 seconds of each other) for the natural hat trick against Michigan Tech on December 27, 2008. During {{the first half of the}} season, he led the nation in goals scored. He played a different scoring role during the final nine regular season games, as the team went 8–1 and he scored two goals and posted 14 assists. Caporusso was named the team MVP at the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts was wildly successful, {{shipping}} {{more than}} four million copies worldwide; Shimomura's music was frequently cited as one of <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>of</b> the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time. The soundtrack has led to two albums of piano arrangements. Kingdom Hearts was the last soundtrack that she worked on at Square. After the release of Kingdom Hearts in 2002, Shimomura left Square for maternity leave, and began work as a freelancer in 2003. She has built on the work she did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven Kingdom Hearts games and Nintendo's Mario & Luigi series. She has also worked on many other projects, such as Heroes of Mana and various arranged albums. In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall. She performed songs from games such as Kingdom Hearts, Live a Live, and Street Fighter II. During the Beware the Forest's Mushrooms performance from Super Mario RPG, Shimomura was joined onstage by fellow game composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who played the Irish bouzouki. She most recently composed and produced {{the majority of the}} score for Final Fantasy XV, which she began writing for in 2006, a decade before the game was released.|$|E
5|$|On their {{donation}} to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions {{as a symbol of}} current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast. In 1897 {{it was one of the}} 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created National Gallery of British Art (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works. The Tate Gallery considered Hope one of <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>of</b> their collection and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.|$|E

5|$|The {{coronation}} of GeorgeVI in 1937 {{was broadcast}} on radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), {{and parts of}} the service were filmed and shown in cinemas. The state procession was shown live on the new BBC Television Service, the first major outside broadcast. At ElizabethII's coronation in 1953, most of the proceedings inside the abbey were also televised by the BBC. Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>of</b> the coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament. The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.|$|E
5|$|The {{year after}} the Olympics, Dix began {{the season with a}} world-leading time of 10.00seconds in Tallahassee in April. He also set a world-leading relay time of 37.92seconds with Travis Padgett, Shawn Crawford and Darvis Patton at the Penn Relays. However, he failed to {{maintain}} this strong form through the rest of 2009. Coach Teddy Long planned to improve Dix's start and acceleration in his races, but the two parted company in April. He placed third behind Michael Rodgers and Asafa Powell at the Prefontaine Classic but, unusually, this proved to one of <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>of</b> a low-profile year for Dix. He competed at the US Championships, but injuries forced him out of both the 100m and 200m races and he did not qualify for the World Championships. Furthermore, he entered a legal battle with his management company, regarding whether they merited the 20% portion of his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contract with Nike. The dispute with his agent Kimberly Holland was resolved in July: although the terms were undisclosed, Dix left Holland's Icon Management and decided to be his own agent. With his father as his coach, a legal battle and no major races to prepare for, Dix ran only a handful of local meetings in the rest of 2009.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{appointed}} team captain for the 1992–93 season. He had a dominant season, winning the only European club trophy {{of his career}} after helping Juventus to the UEFA Cup final, in which he scored twice and assisted another goal over both legs, defeating Borussia Dortmund 6–1 on aggregate. En route to the final, Baggio scored two goals in the 2–1 home victory against Paris Saint-Germain, in {{the first leg of}} the semi-final, and he went on to score the only goal in the return leg. Juventus also reached the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, losing on away goals to local rivals and winners Torino. Juventus finished fourth in Serie A that season, although they managed a 3–1 away win against the Serie A champions Milan, with Baggio scoring a memorable individual goal while also setting-up Andreas Möller's first goal of the match. One of <b>the</b> <b>highlights</b> <b>of</b> the season involved Baggio scoring four goals in open play against Udinese in a 5–0 Juventus home win. Baggio was once again runner-up for the Serie A capocannoniere title with 21 goals and 6 assists. He scored a personal best 30 goals in all club competitions that season, in addition to five goals with the Italy national team. During the 1993 calendar year, Baggio managed a personal record 39 goals across all competitions, scoring 23 goals in Serie A, 3 in the Coppa Italia, 8 goals in European competitions and 5 goals for Italy, helping his national side qualify for the World Cup. Baggio's performances throughout the year earned him both the European Footballer of the Year, with 142 points from a possible 150, and the FIFA World Player of the Year awards. He was also awarded the Onze d'Or, and the World Soccer Player of the Year Award.|$|E
