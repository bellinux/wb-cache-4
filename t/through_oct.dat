Also in 2010, Guy {{was a member of the}} cast of the Alabama Shakespeare Festival and the Alliance Theatre Company co-production of Pearl Cleage’s The Nacirema Society Requests the Honor of Your Presence at a Celebration of Their First One-Hundred Years. The production ran Sept. 24 <b>through</b> <b>Oct.</b> 3 at the Festival in Montgomery, Alabama, before moving to Atlanta’s Alliance Theatre for performances Oct. 20 thru Nov. 14. In early 2011, Guy directed George C. Wolfe's The Colored Museum for True Colors, and in June 2011, Ms. Guy costarred with Kenny Leon in their production of Sam Shepard's play Fool For Love at The Balzer Theater at Herren’s in Atlanta, Georgia. In August 2010, Guy had joined the True Colors Theatre Company in an off stage role as the company's Producing Director. In announcing the hire, True Colors said Guy's full-time position would be both administrative and artistic, and both local and national. Guy continues to contribute to the company on stage as well.|$|E
25|$|By 13 September, the battalion, {{continuing}} {{to support the}} infantry regiments, had closed up to the Moselle River near Thionville. On this date, a gun from the 2nd platoon, C Company, located 200 yards west of Basse Parth, fired ten rounds into Germany, targeting the church steeple in Perl. These were the first rounds fired by the 90th into Germany, first rounds fired by the XX Corps into Germany and it {{is believed to have}} been the first fire to fall into Germany from the Third Army. During the remainder of Sept. and <b>through</b> <b>Oct.,</b> the battalion continued to support the infantry regiments as they closed on Metz, France. The 95th Infantry Division began to relieve the 90th on 1 Nov. and effective 2 Nov., the 607th was attached to the 95th ID. Attacks toward Metz continued. The first main effort began with the crossing of the Moselle River south of Uckange by the 1st Bn of the 377th IR, the 2nd Bn pushing south from Maizieres-les-Metz and the advance to the southeast and east by the 378th and 379th Infantry Regiments. That same day, bazooka teams of the 607th crossed the Moselle to support the 1st Bn of the 377th. During the week of 12–19 Nov., the battalion re-equipped with the self-propelled M36 tank destroyer, armed with a 90mm gun, and returned to combat just in time for the final attack on the city. Lt. Col. Harald S. Sundt, battalion commander, received the Oak Leaf Cluster to the Silver Star for his success in directing the Battalion in artillery and anti-tank support of the 95th Division from 8 to 20 November during the attack on Metz. The 95th, including the 607th and other attached units, received a commendation letter from General George S. Patton for their part in the battle at Metz. On 23 November, the battalion moved along the Moselle River to the vicinity of Ars-Laquenexy (six miles southeast of Metz).|$|E

5000|$|Some {{aspects of}} Anne Ford's life {{are typical of}} talented and gifted women in the {{traditional}} class society of 18th-century England. She gained more education than most as she had a knowledge of five foreign languages and played several fretted string instruments, including the lute-like English guitar and the [...] viola da gamba. This gave {{her a chance to}} perform with others giving Sunday concerts at her house. Her father, Thomas Ford, refused to allow her to perform publicly. She also was a singer with a beautiful voice by her early twenties, but her earliest attempts to appear in public venues were unsuccessful; her father {{went so far as to}} have her arrested twice to prevent her escaping his control. Eventually she made a successful escape, and held her first public subscription concert on 18 March 1760. She performed a series of subsequent concerts, including daily performances from 24 <b>Oct.</b> <b>through</b> 30 <b>Oct.</b> of that year, though her playing on the [...] "masculine" [...] viol da gamba, comparable to a modern cello, was somehow considered a point of controversy.|$|R
40|$|The oblique {{circular}} torus (OCT) and {{its main}} geometric properties are introduced. Intrinsic vector calculation is utilized to mathematically describe the OCT. The coordinate-free approach leads to the algebraic equation of an OCT in a privileged Cartesian reference frame. The OCTequation is used to confirm a theorem of Euclidean geometry. In a broad category of <b>OCT,</b> <b>through</b> any point five circles can be drawn on the surface, namely the parallel of latitude and four circular generatrices whose planes pass <b>through</b> the <b>OCT</b> center of symmetry. In the special case of a right circular torus, the Villarceau theorem is verified. Next, consider the four RRS open chains whose S spherical-joint centers move on the same OCT and their possible in-parallel assemblies in single-loop RRRS chains. From a category of the foregoing RRRS chains, a new derivation of the amazing Bennett 4 R linkage is proposed. Two kinds of Bennett linkages are further verified and each kind contains two enantiomorphic or symmetric linkages. Four types of Bennett linkages associated with one OCT are established by uniquely specifying the link twist as an acute value. Two cases of special type, rectangular and equilateral configurations, are also confirmed...|$|R

Because of the inavailability (from IT at NASA ARC) of sufficient supercomputer time in fiscal 1998 to complete the computational goals of {{the second year of}} the original proposal (estimated to be at least 400 Cray C- 90 CPU hours), those goals have been appropriately amended, and a new proposal has been submitted to LaRC as a follow-on to NAG 1 - 1802. The current report documents the activities and accomplishments on NAG 1 - 1802 during the one-year period from 5 <b>Oct.,</b> 1996, <b>through</b> 4 <b>Oct.,</b> 1997. NASA Grant NAG 1 - 1802, and its predecessor, NAG 1 - 1772, have been directed toward adapting the numerical tool of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) to aeroacoustic applications, with particular focus on noise suppression in subsonic round jets. In LES, the filtered Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically on a relatively coarse computational grid. Residual stresses, generated by scales of motion too small to be resolved on the coarse grid, are modeled. Although most LES incorporate spatial filtering, time-domain filtering affords certain conceptual and computational advantages, particularly for aeroacoustic applications. Consequently, this work has focused on the development of SubGrid-Scale (SGS) models that incorporate time- domain filters. The author is unaware of any previous attempt at purely time-filtered LES; however, Aldama and Dakhoul and Bedford have considered approaches that combine both spatial and temporal filtering. In our view, filtering in both space and time is redundant, because removal of high frequencies effects the removal of small spatial scales and vice versa...|$|R
