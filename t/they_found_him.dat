5|$|Within the United States armed forces, {{according}} to an unscientific survey, the president was strongly supported in the 2004 presidential elections. While 73percent of military personnel {{said that they would}} vote for Bush, 18percent preferred his Democratic rival, John Kerry. According to Peter Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the U.S. military, members of the armed services supported Bush because <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> more likely than Kerry to complete the War in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Regular Democrats {{were forced}} to call for {{annexation}} of Texas in their platform, {{but there was a}} bitter battle for the presidential nomination. Ballot after ballot, Van Buren failed to win the necessary super-majority of Democratic votes, and slowly fell in the rankings. It was not until the ninth ballot that the Democrats turned their sights to James K. Polk, a less prominent candidate who supported annexation. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> to be perfectly suited for their platform, and he was nominated with two-thirds of the vote. Tyler considered his work vindicated, and implied in an acceptance letter that annexation was his true priority rather than election.|$|E
25|$|The next day, 30 August, police {{attended}} Brogden's electorate {{office at}} around 10.30 pm, after concerns {{were raised by}} members of his family. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> apparently unconscious in a back room, having slit his wrists, apparently in a drug- and alcohol-induced stupor.|$|E

25|$|On December 10, 2007, Evolution had an in-ring reunion as {{faces on}} the Raw 15th Anniversary special episode. After Batista, Flair, and Triple H, who turned face himself in summer 2006 when he reunited with Shawn Michaels to reform D-Generation X, {{made their way}} to the ring, Orton (who was still a heel) played footage of himself being {{attacked}} and kicked out of the group and said that he hadn't forgiven them for turning on him in 2004 and didn't trust them, to which Triple H responded that <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> annoying, so he partnered with Rated RKO member Edge and Umaga. Evolution won the match.|$|E
25|$|On 30 December 1971, Communist forces {{attacked}} Sala Phou Khoun, {{a strategic}} intersection in the Royalist rear; the counter for this would become Operation Maharat. The next day, the first Communist 130mm shells fell on Long Tieng. They {{blew up the}} main ammo dump, including its RLAF facilities. Vang Pao unexpectedly left his headquarters at the vital guerrilla base. His CIA advisers followed him to a smoky hut in Ban Song Sai, 21 kilometers to the southwest. There <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> ill, depressed, weeping, and cursing the lack of air support. He returned to Long Tieng with them. They took him to hospital on 4 January, to be admitted for treatment of viral pneumonia.|$|E

25|$|The {{son of a}} Roman patrician called John, Gregory was {{apparently}} an energetic but mild churchman, renowned for his learning. Consecrated a priest during the pontificate of Pope Paschal I, {{at the time of}} Pope Valentine’s death in 827, Gregory was the Cardinal priest of the Basilica of St Mark in Rome. Like his predecessor, Gregory was nominated by the nobility, and the electors unanimously agreed that he was the most worthy to become the Bishop of Rome. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> at the Basilica of Saints Cosmas and Damian where, despite his protestations, he was taken and installed at the Lateran Palace, after which he was enthroned as Pope-elect sometime in October 827. Gregory’s elevation to the papal see is believed to represent a continuation of the attempts to control the local political situation in Rome which had begun during Pope Eugene II’s pontificate.|$|E
25|$|Milan Drajicevic, {{the coach}} of the UBC Thunderbirds, {{happened}} to be at the practice when Cloutier was injured, and he suggested the Canucks use Levesque, UBC's second backup. Because of amateur call-up rules, the Canucks could not recruit the T-Birds' top two goaltenders, Kevin Swanson and Robert Filc. At the time Levesque was in one of the many UBC libraries studying for a geography exam he had the next morning. His friends and teammates scoured the campus, and when <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him,</b> he assumed he was the victim of a prank. He was not convinced otherwise until he {{received a phone call from}} Jon Wall, Manager of Scouting and Player Information for the Canucks. Once he realized the situation was real, he quickly received a one-time exemption from Canadian Interuniversity Sport rules to play in the NHL, and drove to General Motors Place to take a spot on the bench.|$|E
25|$|Candidate Reviews: Despite {{her having}} the weakest {{track record of}} the final four and her unwillingness to admit ever being wrong about anything, the interviewers {{unanimously}} considered Saira {{to be the most}} impressive of the candidates, giving her much praise for her prior accomplishments and salesmanship, and even feeling that her abrasiveness could be a strength in the right circumstances. The interviewers noted that while James was, on paper, the strongest of the four candidates, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> unconvincing in the interviews and questioned whether his heart was in the process. Meanwhile, Tim was commended for his passion, determination and business knowledge, but the interviewers considered him to be naive and were concerned that stepping up to run one of Sir Alan's businesses would be a step too far, while Paul was deemed the weakest of the candidates, mostly due to his short temper and background in businesses that had very little relation to anything Sir Alan did.|$|E
60|$|But {{here and}} there, among rich and poor, {{there are those}} whose heart and flesh--whose {{conscience}} and whose intellect--cry out for the living God, and will know no peace till <b>they</b> have <b>found</b> <b>Him.</b>|$|R

25|$|On Earth, Eben and Martha Kent find Kal-El in the {{spacecraft}} and pull him from {{it before it}} explodes. The Kents decide to raise him as their own and name him Clark. Clark is shown learning about his abilities as he grows up, displaying great strength and speed, x-ray vision, super hearing and super durability. Once Clark is an adult, Eben explains how he and Martha found him and that Clark {{has a responsibility to}} use his powers wisely and justly in the interest of truth, tolerance and justice. They agree that the world needs him and that he must leave their farm and go where he is needed. Clark states that he will pursue a job that will keep him close to world events, so he can be aware of emergencies immediately. Martha gives Clark a uniform made from the blankets <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> in and he decides to take on the secret identity Superman. The Kents die shortly after this conversation and Clark moves to Metropolis.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to ride in}} Canada, Kelly {{rode the}} 1976 Tour of Britain {{and then went to}} Metz, in France, after a London enthusiast, Johnny Morris, had {{arranged}} an invitation. The club offered him £25 a week, free accommodation and four francs a kilometre for every race he won. Kelly won 18 of the 25 races he started in France and won the amateur Giro di Lombardia in Italy. That impressed two French team managers, Jean de Gribaldy and Cyrille Guimard. De Gribaldy went to Ireland unannounced to discuss a contract with the Flandria professional team. He didn't know where Kelly lived and wasn't sure he would recognise him. He took with him another cyclist, to point out Kelly and translate the conversation. Kelly was out driving a tractor and de Gribaldy set out again in the taxi that had brought him from Dublin, hoping to find Kelly as he drove home. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> and went to Kelly's stepbrother's house. De Gribaldy offered £4,000 a year plus bonuses. A week later Kelly asked for £6,000 and got it. He signed for de Gribaldy with misgivings about going back on his promise to return to Metz, where the club had offered him better terms than before.|$|E
500|$|The High Court {{said that}} the trial judge {{did not seem to}} be aware that he had the {{authority}} to adjourn the trial. Another factor which complicated the case was that although the jury found Dietrich guilty of importing the heroin in the condoms, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> not guilty of owning the heroin which had been hidden in a plastic bag. For the High Court, this uncertainty meant that it was possible that Dietrich could also have been acquitted of the other charges, if he had been legally represented: ...|$|E

500|$|Early in her career, Heyer {{experimented with}} other {{literary}} genres, {{resulting in the}} release of four serious contemporary novels between 1923 and 1930, {{all of which were}} less successful than her historical novels of the time, and were later suppressed by the author. With the help of her husband George Ronald Rougier, who made plot suggestions, Heyer also delved into works of contemporary detective fiction such as Footsteps in the Dark (1932) and <b>They</b> <b>Found</b> <b>Him</b> Dead (1937). In total she published 12 in the genre between 1932 and 1953, when her final detective novel Detection Unlimited appeared.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 216 BC Hannibal took the {{initiative}} and seized the large supply depot at Cannae, in the Apulian plain, placing himself between the Romans and their crucial source of supply. Hannibal recently harvested his crops so he had a well-fed army ready for action. As Polybius noted, the capture of Cannae [...] "caused great commotion in the Roman army; for {{it was not only}} the loss of the place and the stores in it that distressed them, but the fact that it commanded the surrounding district". The consuls, resolving to confront Hannibal, marched southward in search of him. After two days' march, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> on the left bank of the Aufidus River, and encamped six miles (10km) away.|$|E
500|$|On November 27, 1956, he {{fled from}} Budapest to Austria with {{his future wife}} Enid, his sister, brother-in-law, {{and a few others}} after the Soviets invaded the city. He had no prior {{intention}} to leave Hungary until he learned from his mother that the Hungarian Secret Police were looking for him. Racz said if <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "That would have meant the end of my dreams to become a doctor. Perhaps I would have ended up in prison. Not that I had done anything but many other people ended up in prison following 1956 without committing any crime." [...] He arrived in the Austrian town of Eisenstadt where buses were waiting to take refugees to their new homes. Racz chose the bus to England, and he along with his family and other members of his group were transported to a military base in the Midlands.|$|E

500|$|... "Chatterbox" [...] {{was written}} and sung by Thunders, whom Willis felt [...] "uses {{his voice as}} a wailing instrument" [...] {{in a manner similar}} to rock singer Robert Plant. The song was Thunders's first time singing lead and {{featured}} vocals Weisbard and Marks said were delivered in a quavering but proud New York accent. His lyrics described the narrator's growing frustration over a crossed-wire phone connection with a female subject. On [...] "Human Being", an ode to self-respect and personal liberty, Thunders introduced his guitar playing with a roughly performed variation on Bill Doggett's 1956 song [...] "Honky Tonk". Johansen addressed critics of the band in the song, telling them if <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> objectionable they should instead find themselves [...] "a saint", [...] "a boy who's gonna be what I ain't", and a [...] "plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint who's gonna sit through the madness and always act so quaint".|$|E
500|$|Kelly died in Toronto, Canada, {{following}} an epileptic seizure, on April 12, 1971. He had traveled there from New York {{to play in}} a club with drummer George Reed and vocalist Herb Marshall. Kelly had a longstanding epilepsy problem, and had to monitor his condition carefully. An account of his death was given by his friend, Cobb: [...] "Wynton called his girlfriend in New York and said, 'You know, I don't feel good.' She said, 'Why don't you go downstairs to the bar and if something happens somebody could tend to you.' We don't know if he did that, because when <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> he was in the room." [...] Kelly was found in his room in the Westminster Hotel on Jarvis Street by Marshall. He was reported to have had almost no money {{at the time of his}} death. A memorial concert was held on June 28 in New York and featured numerous well-known musicians of the period.|$|E
500|$|After the First World War, Crawford {{returned}} {{to live in}} England, and was demobilised from the New Zealand Army in April 1919. Looking for work, he wrote to Surrey offering to play for them if <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> some employment in turn, but the committee, while writing {{that they would be}} pleased if he played for the county again, could not [...] "see [...] way to find him employment". Crawford may have been contemplating playing professional cricket—unheard of for a former Public School cricketer—but instead found work at Repton, his old school. It is unclear what his position at Repton was at this time; he seems to have had no official cricketing role and it is possible he worked as a teacher simply to maintain his amateur status. In any case, Crawford only remained at Repton {{until the end of the}} academic year; his short stay may have been the result of poor results by the cricket team. However, Burns suggests: [...] "Another indication that the school was not entirely happy to be associated with the Surrey rebel, whose baggage also included an indifferent war record, was that when the Old Boys cricket team, the Repton Pilgrims, was formed in 1921, Crawford was alone among the school's former distinguished players not to be made a member. He was not invited to join the club until 1952." ...|$|E
