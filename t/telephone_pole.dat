5|$|Cormier {{was known}} for his {{physical}} strength and intense exercise regimen. He was known to bench press 450 pounds with each, and he was once recorded as bench pressing 527 pounds. During one photo session, Cormier lifted a <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> from the ground and carried it around while posing for pictures. According to one story, he once got upset with a horse that refused to cooperate and knocked it down with one punch.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{he is the}} {{lieutenant}} of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing at them with a chaingun. Nate knocks a <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell El Dorado {{for a lot of}} money that Sully owes him (who they took with them when Nate thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of El Dorado, and try to keep Nate away from it.|$|E
5|$|Hambleton {{assigned}} {{himself as}} navigator on the older EB-66C, which was configured to gather signals intelligence. The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's {{mission was to}} troll for missiles, let them lock on to their aircraft, and then execute a SAM break, a violent turn and dive designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 {{was the size of}} a <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within about , but their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not everyone agreed they were present that far south.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E

25|$|Having {{narrowly}} escaped ambush by FBI {{agents and}} {{other law enforcement}} agencies several times after the Kansas City Massacre, Floyd had a stroke of bad luck. On October 18, 1934, he and Richetti left Buffalo, New York, and their vehicle slid into a <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> in heavy fog. No one was injured, but the car was disabled. Fearing they would be recognized, Floyd and Richetti sent two female companions to get a tow truck; they planned to have the women accompany the tow truck driver into a town and have the vehicle repaired, while the two men waited by the roadside.|$|E
25|$|A {{rigorous}} {{training program}} was effected. A mockup of the wiretap site {{was set up}} for practice maneuvers; a tree was stripped limbless and a cross spar supplied to imitate the targeted <b>telephone</b> <b>pole.</b> The route {{to and from the}} site was memorized with the aid of overhead photography. The pilots practiced flying nap of the earth, including flights between the banks of stream beds, until they dropped in on the mockup. The two Lao commandos chosen to set the wiretap practiced exiting the 500P and climbing the mock phone pole to staple the tap in place. The pilots practiced setting communications relays that would return the wiretap's signal to CIA listeners.|$|E

50|$|Wired <b>telephone</b> <b>poles</b> {{eventually}} {{were put}} in place in Alaska, however they were not too reliable. One of the problems was that heavy snow and ice typical in Alaska, would cause the <b>telephone</b> <b>poles</b> to fall over, breaking the connections. During the winter there might be six feet of frozen snow that could topple poles. Laying cable underwater would solve part of that problem, and would also help the military with ship to shore communications.|$|R
25|$|North-west of {{the station}} {{building}} is a steel-framed pedestrian overbridge and a luggage lift, both replacements for the original items, which are not of cultural heritage significance. North-west of the luggage lift is a 2005 stone cairn memorial to {{the building of the}} Kuranda Range Railway. A series of large garden beds continue along the platform to the north-west. An old steel <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> is located near the overbridge, on the town side. The former station master's residence is located north-west {{of the station}} platform, {{on the west side of}} the line. It is a timber building, clad in chamferboard with enclosed front and side verandahs and a hipped metal roof. A railway turntable is located further north-west.|$|E
25|$|The {{clearing}} of {{the wreck}} and {{reconstruction of the}} bridge was itself the cause of several injuries. A dredge, several cranes, and a pile-driver were brought on site {{to shore up the}} bridge and assist with the removal of debris and wreckage. Two men were hurt on August 24 by debris and cranes attempting to lift the locomotive from the water. Two days later, a man was killed when a <b>telephone</b> <b>pole</b> on the bridge toppled over onto him. The same day, the pile-driver toppled over into the river as well. Another worker was injured on August 27 after being hit by a boom. At least one wrongful-death lawsuit was filed. A temporary single-track span was erected on August 28, and traffic over the bridge resumed shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Hebard {{made her}} way west in 1882 to Cheyenne, eight years before Wyoming became a state in 1890. Hebard arrived at the future capital city {{in the company of}} her mother and brothers; Fred, Lockwood, and her sister, Alice. She became part of the social scene with other young people at the newly {{constructed}} Cheyenne Club, where cattle barons, often wealthy Europeans, held sway over Cheyenne. Yet general violence and roughness were still common. Rowdy cowhands wearing guns in the saloons and prostitutes openly plying their trade in brothels made for a sometimes raucous downtown. Citizens were known to hand out their own form of retribution, however, if things got out of hand. For example, in 1883 a crowd lynched an accused murderer, leaving him hanging from a Cheyenne <b>telephone</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E

25|$|Swainson's hawks hunt using various methods. Many still-hunt, {{watching}} for prey activity from a perch {{such as a}} tree, bush, pylon, <b>telephone</b> <b>pole,</b> hummock or other high object. Others hunt by soaring over open ground with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally courses low over the ground like a northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) or hovers like a rough-legged hawk (B. lagopus) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight. It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day. During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with scattered trees, a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the broad-winged hawk (B. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.|$|E

Meanwhile, Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) enlists Michael (Steve Carell) to report on the success of a small family-owned local paper {{competitor}} named Prince Paper, which works in an area where Dunder Mifflin has never successfully acquired clients. Michael brings Dwight along on his field work to help gather information. Michael visits business owner Roger Prince (Dan Desmond) posing as a potential customer named [...] "Michael Scarn", while Dwight enters and pretends to request a job. The kind and overly trusting Roger Prince gives Michael the company's customer list to use as a reference, and Michael and Dwight leave triumphantly.|$|E
