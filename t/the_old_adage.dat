It was the perfect example of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>adage</b> 'less is more' [...] the Emperor doesn't say very much. But when he finally appears, it's {{at a point in}} the saga when everyone's waiting to see him. It's the Emperor, the arch villain of all time, and when he says there's a great {{disturbance}} in the Force, I mean, that's enough oomph!" [...] Years later, during production of Revenge of the Sith, Lucas decided to shoot new footage for The Empire Strikes Back to create continuity between the prequels and original trilogy. Thus, in the 2004 DVD release of The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition, the original version of the Emperor was replaced by McDiarmid, and the dialogue between the Emperor and Darth Vader was revised.|$|E

You can go into the green zone if they let you, but DO NOT go into the red zone.'" [...] He said that they [...] "were {{absolutely}} sure we would never get past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>adage</b> that if you want to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E
2500|$|The hobby of {{collecting}} includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and maintaining whatever items {{are of interest}} to the individual collector. Collections can differ {{in a wide variety of}} respects, most obviously in the nature and scope of the objects contained, but also in purpose, presentation, and so forth. The scope {{of collecting}} is unlimited, as expressed in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>adage,</b> [...] "If something exists, somebody somewhere collects them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the atrium}} {{of the oldest}} {{building}} of the university there are three sets of doors. The central doors, which are larger than the others, have two lions {{to either side of}} them. There is a superstition within the university that students who pass in-between the two lions via the central doors risk not being able to graduate. This derives from <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>adage</b> [...] "Chi passa tra i Leoni non si laurea alla Bocconi." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{the weapons}} were {{transferred}} to the motor vehicles; each batch was counted and its destination noted by counting clerks. Due to the volume of weapons, temporary arms-dumps {{had been set up}} in the surrounding districts so that the vehicles could return as quickly as possible to receive another load. The Belfast Evening Telegraph remarked that all present [...] "put their backs into it" [...] and that it [...] "illustrated <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>adage,</b> 'One Volunteer is worth three pressed men'" [...] and they [...] "toiled like galley slaves". The local population of Larne were noted as having lined the streets exchanging salutes and running makeshift canteens to supply the workers with refreshments throughout the night.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "boat" [...] {{refers to}} small craft {{limited in their}} use by size and usually not capable of making lengthy {{independent}} voyages at sea. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> navy <b>adage</b> to differentiate between ships and boats is that boats are capable of being carried by ships. (Submarines by this rule are ships rather than boats, but are customarily referred to as boats reflecting their previous smaller size.) ...|$|R
6000|$|There is a Pal-ul-donian proverb setting forth a truth {{similar to}} that {{contained}} in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Scotch <b>adage</b> that [...] "The best laid schemes o' mice and men gang aft a-gley." [...] Freely translated it might read, [...] "He who follows the right trail sometimes reaches the wrong destination," [...] and such apparently was the fate that lay {{in the footsteps of}} the great chieftain of the north and his godlike ally.|$|R

[...] Tempting {{as it would be}} to follow the Duke through his labyrinthine misunderstandings of the ordinary terminology of philosophy and to comment on the curious unintelligibility which hangs about his frequent outpourings of fervid language, limits of space oblige me to restrict myself to those points, the discussion of which may help to enlighten the public in respect of matters of more importance than the competence of my Mentor for the task which he has undertaken.|$|R
50|$|The Exhibition Hall {{is located}} {{next to the}} tomb.The first section is about food and drink in Han as it seems because most of what {{was found in the}} Han tomb is related to food. The display of this section begins with <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Chinese <b>adage,</b> 'food is the first {{necessity}} of the people'. There is a map depicting food distribution, a pictogram of rice distribution and a table of the major food groups. There are also three replicas of figurines. Two of the figurines are cooks, and another one is a farmer.|$|R

" Another variant suggests a wise movejs to "buy when you hear the sound of the cannon, sell when you hear the sound of the church bells.

6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>adage</b> that, [...] "truth is strange, {{stranger}} than fiction," [...] was never more forcibly verified {{than in the}} growth and career of this wonderful city.

6000|$|It {{should be}} mentioned, that, in the morning, before embarking S----- and the {{children}} on board the steamer, I saw a fragment of a rainbow among the clouds, and remembered <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>adage</b> bidding [...] "sailors take warning." [...] In the afternoon, as J----- and I were railing from Southampton, we saw another fragmentary rainbow, which, by the same adage, should be the [...] "sailor's delight."

It would have literally been impossible for Jim to have devoted the time and effort that he has to an organization such as the Caballeros without the encouragement, understanding and support of his good wife.|$|R
40|$|Racism is {{embedded}} {{deep in the}} foundations of the Australian society. The roots have spread like feral weeds uninhibited throughout the country easily recognisable in many aspects of social life. It is an institutional problem planted within the history of colonisation, continually nurtured, that still flourishes visibly today. It can be identified and has been highlighted in the media over the past twenty years involving Aboriginal players in both major Australian football codes the National Rugby League and the Australian Football League. More recent reporting on racial incidents in these codes provides clear evidence that racism thrives and is embodied in players, coaching staff, administrative staff and spectators. Racism particularly in these Australian sporting codes negates <b>the</b> age <b>old</b> <b>adage</b> of a level playing field for every footballer...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Short-term {{exercise}} in growing rodents provided lifelong benefits to bone structure, strength, and fatigue resistance. Consequently, exercise when young {{may reduce the}} risk for fractures later in life, and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> exercise <b>adage</b> of “use {{it or lose it}} ” may not be entirely applicable to the skeleton. Introduction: The growing skeleton is most responsive to exercise, but low-trauma fractures predominantly occur in adults. This disparity has raised the question of whether exercised-induced skeletal changes during growth persist into adulthood where they may have antifracture benefits. This study investigated whether brief exercise during growth results in lifelong changes in bone quantity, structure, quality, and mechanical prop-erties...|$|R
60|$|Even then I did {{not tell}} him that I was a married man; for often in the Banda Orientál I did not quite seem {{to know how to}} mix my truth and lies, and so {{preferred}} to hold my tongue.

The open man, with no secrets from the world, often enough escapes disasters which overtake your very discreet person, who acts on <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>adage</b> that speech was given to us to conceal our thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|How then, dismissing, as I do, {{these three}} causes, am I {{to account for}} attacks, the long {{continuance}} and inveteracy of which it would require all three to explain? The solution seems to be this,--I was in habits of intimacy with Mr. Wordsworth and Mr. Southey! This, however, transfers, rather than removes the difficulty. Be it, that, by an unconscionable extension of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>adage,</b> noscitur a socio, my literary friends are never under the water-fall of criticism, but I must be wet through with the spray; yet how came the torrent to descend upon them? ...|$|E
60|$|Now the {{complications}} {{had ceased to}} exist; they threatened her happiness no more.

Whatever his failings or shortcomings, Morris was her joy, the human being in whose company she delighted; without whom, indeed, her life would be flat, stale, and unprofitable. The stronger then was her determination {{that he should not}} slip back into his former courses; those courses which in the end had always brought about estrangement from herself.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{conditions}} are always changing somewhat, a sailor must keep evaluating which tack, port or starboard {{is actually the}} most favorable. So with these concepts in mind, when the desired destination is exactly to windward, the most efficient strategy is given by <b>the</b> <b>old</b> racing <b>adage</b> to [...] "Tack on a header." [...] This is true because if before the wind changed both tacks were exactly equal - neither one was more favorable, then since a header on one tack is automatically a lift on the other, the opposite tack has just become the more favorable one and the helmsman should tack and change course for the most efficient passage.|$|R
500|$|As well as {{eating the}} meat of the kakapo, Māori would use kakapo skins with the {{feathers}} still attached or individually weave in kakapo feathers with flax fibre to create cloaks and capes. Each one required up to 11,000 feathers to make. Not only were these garments considered very beautiful, they also kept the wearer very warm. They were highly valued, and the few still in existence today are considered taonga (treasures) – indeed, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Māori <b>adage</b> [...] "You have a kākāpō cape and you still complain of the cold" [...] was used to describe someone who is never satisfied. Kakapo feathers were also used to decorate the heads of taiaha, but were removed before use in combat.|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{celebration of}} the Easter Vigil as it shapes a {{theology}} of creation and asks whether it is liberating, life giving, for women and the earth. The exploration is firmly rooted in <b>the</b> centuries <b>old</b> <b>adage</b> lex orandi, lex credendi, lex vivendi. There is a dynamic relationship between praying, believing and living; to worship is to do theology and shape living. The Easter Vigil with its unique elements of Light, Word, Baptism and Eucharist is a privileged place for this exploration and offers breadth to the exploration through its temporal and cosmic dimensions, proclamation of the Word and celebration of initiation. There are two points of departure for this work: liturgical theology and ecofeminism. Aidan Kavanagh's approach to liturgical theology [...] -in particular his attention to experience, his conviction that the church's prayer founds believing, his identification of two movements of theology (theologia prima and theologia secundo) [...] -supports this study.
