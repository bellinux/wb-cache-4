5|$|Brown {{also said}} he wanted to have doctors' {{surgeries}} open at the weekends, and GPs on call in the evenings. Doctors were given the right of opting out of out-of-hours care in 2007, under a controversial pay deal, signed by then-Health Secretary John Reid, which awarded them a 22 percent pay rise in 2006. Brown also stated in the manifesto that the NHS was his <b>top</b> <b>priority.</b>|$|E

5|$|At Hanford, <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> was {{initially}} {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been given}} <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> by the Air Force, {{the first flight}} test of the Bold Orion missile was {{conducted}} on May 26, 1958, from a Boeing B-47 Stratojet carrier aircraft, which launched the Bold Orion vehicle {{at the apex of}} a high-speed, high-angle climb. The zoom climb tactic, combined with the thrust from the rocket motor of the missile itself, allowed the missile to achieve its maximum range, or, alternatively, to reach space.|$|E

5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Second Avenue Subway was {{supposed}} to be the flagship project of the Program for Action. In a 1964 report, it was given <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> on a list of projects to be completed. Prior attempts to build the line had failed, and the city wished to have a Second Avenue subway line to alleviate overcrowding on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. Twenty-two blocks of tunnel were ultimately constructed, excluding seven blocks in the East Village that were prepared for tunneling operations, but never excavated.|$|E
5|$|The UNPROFOR {{operations}} {{staff in}} Sector West developed several defensive plans, assigning <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> {{to the plan}} codenamed Operation Backstop. It envisaged an active defence against the HV, assuming that the attack's main axis would be the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. CANBAT 1 (supported by General Zabala) thought the HV would attack Sector West to control the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway, and the UN would not object to such a move. Any Croatian attack in the area was likely to employ substantially larger forces than those earmarked for Operation Backstop.|$|E

5|$|The alleged {{death of}} Moreno González was {{considered}} one of the most significant government victories since the start of the drug war in 2006. La Familia Michoacana was the focus of the government because their stronghold, Michoacán state, is approximately four hours away from the country's capital, Mexico City. In addition, Michoacán is the homestate of former President Felipe Calderón, who made it a <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> to pacify it.|$|E
5|$|Yumemi is very {{adamant about}} {{protecting}} humans and is happiest {{when she is}} helping those she serves. When she is unable to help someone, she gets terribly worried that she is incapable of offering assistance and must instead indirectly help a customer by directing {{him or her to}} someone who can. Protecting humans is her <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> and will even ignore previous orders to make sure no human is harmed when in her care.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not have enough engineers to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 <b>top</b> <b>priority.</b> Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E

5|$|Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1938, and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), and later director of OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare. Bush was a well-known policymaker and public intellectual during World War II, when he was in effect the first presidential science advisor. As head of NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project, and ensured that it received <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> from the highest levels of government. In Science, The Endless Frontier, his 1945 report to the President of the United States, Bush called for an expansion of government support for science, and he pressed for the creation of the National Science Foundation.|$|E
5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924–1928), the Jezreel Valley was the <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> of the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF {{wanted to}} settle the valley in order to {{establish}} a significant Jewish agricultural community in the arable valley, and to create a contiguous bloc of Jewish settlements in the valley, connecting Haifa with the already existing bloc of Jewish settlements between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of land from Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} the valley. On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E
5|$|For the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Kefalas {{was named}} to seats on the House Appropriations Committee, the House Finance Committee, and the House Health and Human Services Committee. Kefalas has named health care reform as his <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> and plans on introducing legislation to create a single-payer universal {{health care system in}} Colorado during the 2009 session. The bill was introduced as a proposal to create a 23-member commission to make recommendations as to how to implement a single-payer system, and was reported favorably out of a House committee. However, Kefalas was one vote short of the 33 necessary to pass the legislation out of the house, and in April, asked that the legislation be killed.|$|E

5|$|In 332BC, Alexander the Great conquered Egypt {{with little}} {{resistance}} from the Persians and was welcomed by the Egyptians as a deliverer. The administration established by Alexander's successors, the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom, {{was based on an}} Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria. The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a seat of learning and culture, centered at the famous Library of Alexandria. The Lighthouse of Alexandria lit the way for the many ships that kept trade flowing through the city—as the Ptolemies made commerce and revenue-generating enterprises, such as papyrus manufacturing, their <b>top</b> <b>priority.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jones' <b>top</b> <b>priority</b> as {{governor}} was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), {{former head}} of Project Alice {{and the head of}} the North American Umbrella facility, {{operated}} in Nevada, considers Alice's recapture to be a <b>top</b> <b>priority,</b> since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the worldwide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alice's recapture until they are informed of her location.|$|E
