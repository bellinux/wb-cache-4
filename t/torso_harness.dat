40|$|Reflex {{responses}} {{that depend on}} human otolith organ sensitivity were measured before, during and after a 10 day space flight. Otolith-spinal reflexes were elicited by means of sudden, unexpected falls. In weightlessness, "falls" were achieved using elastic cords running from a <b>torso</b> <b>harness</b> to the floor. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from gastrocnemius-soleus. The EMG response occurring in the first 100 - 120 ms of a fall, considered to be predominantly otolith-spinal in origin, decreased in amplitude immediately upon entering weightlessness, and continued to decline throughout the flight, especially {{during the first two}} mission days. The response returned to normal before the first post-flight testing session. The results suggest that information coming from the otolith organs is gradually ignored by the nervous system during prolonged space flight, although the possibility that otolith-spinal reflexes are decreased independent of other otolith output pathways cannot be ruled out...|$|E

40|$|Research {{is being}} {{undertaken}} by Martin Baker Aircraft Company Ltd (MBA) and QinetiQ Ltd, {{on behalf of}} the Ministry of Defence, to develop concepts for practical, integrated ejection seat restraint systems. A 2 -stage programme of work has been defined to achieve this goal; comparison of the current in service harnesses, leading to the development of future restraint designs. This paper presents a sample of the results from the first phase of this research programme. It highlights areas where problems occurred and how they were overcome, the harness assessments that have been undertaken and it details the harness tensioning procedure that had to be developed to enable consistent strapping-in of the test manikins. The aim of {{the first phase of the}} programme is to identify and understand the biodynamic interactions of current in-service restraint systems in order to identify any issues that need addressing in future restraint system design. The QinetiQ decelerator track was used to produce 2 idealised ejection phases and a crash scenario. Four restraint types were assessed, the PCU- 56 /P (family), PCU 15 /P (family), which are <b>torso</b> <b>harnesses</b> and the Generation 1 and 4 integrated or combined harnesses. The restraint systems were mounted on a strengthened ejection seat structure, which enabled over 77 runs to be carried out at various seat attitudes including + 11 Gz,- 17. 5 Gxy and- 26. 5 Gxyz. Hybrid III manikin sensor outputs and tracked motion points were collated for each of these runs in order to determine the effect of the harness restraint...|$|R

The Melter's first melting beam could affect iron, while a later version could affect almost any substance. The melting effect {{did not appear to}} involve heat, but when used on a human being, the beam inflicts burns as opposed to truly melting. The Melter uses several of these devices, including hand-held pistol versions and a device worn on his <b>torso</b> in a <b>harness.</b> Horgan possesses extensive knowledge of weapons and munitions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ten {{participants}} without {{physical impairment}} walked with 0 kg, 11. 5 kg, and 23. 0 kg of added weight equally distributed about the <b>torso</b> in a <b>harness.</b> At each weight level, the participants walked at slow, normal, and fast self-selected walking speeds. We examined the roll-over characteristics by determining the ankle-foot and knee-ankle-foot roll-over shapes. These shapes, {{which are the}} effective rockers created by the respective lower-limb systems between heel contact and opposite heel contact of walking, are found if one transforms the center of pressure of ground reaction force into body coor-dinate systems. The roll-over shapes of the ankle-foot and knee-ankle-foot systems did not change appreciably with added weight {{at any of the}} three walking speeds. The invari-ance of these biologic systems to added weight should be con-sidered when prostheses and orthoses are designed that intend to replace and augment their function in walking...|$|R
40|$|For years, {{the human}} back has puzzled {{researchers}} with the complex behaviors it presents. Principally, the internal forces produced by back muscles {{have not been}} determined accurately. Two different approaches have historically been taken to predict muscle forces. The first relies on electromyography (EMG), while the second attempts to predict muscle responses using mathematical models. Three such predictive models are compared here. The models are Sum of Cubed Intensities, Artificial Neural Networks, and Distributed Moment Histogram. These three models were adapted to run using recently published descriptions of the lower back anatomy. To evaluate their effectiveness, the models were compared {{in terms of their}} fit to a muscle activation database including 14 different muscles. The database was collected as part of this experiment, and included 8 participants (4 male and 4 female) with similar height and weight. The participants resisted loads applied to their <b>torso</b> via a <b>harness.</b> Results showed the models performed poorly (average R 2 ’s in the 0. 40 ’s), indicating that further improvements are needed in our current low back muscle activation modeling techniques. Considerable discrepancies were found between internal moments (at L 3 /L 4) determined empirically and measured with a force plate, indicating that the maximum muscle stress selected and/or th...|$|R
40|$|In the {{rehabilitation}} of the upper-extremity amputee, structural replacement by prosthetic arm and hand is an obvious requirement, and it poses a comparatively easy task; functional replacement by remote control and by sub-stitute mechanical apparatus is more elusive and hence infinitely harder. For the purposes of functional utility, remaining movements of upper arm, shoulder, and <b>torso</b> must be <b>harnessed,</b> and use must be made {{of a variety of}} mechanical devices which amplify remaining resources by alternators, springs, locks, and switching arrangements. The facility of con-trol attained through this apparatus is the key to its ultimate value. The future of upper-extremity prosthetics depends upon an ever-increasing understanding of the mechanics of the human body by all who minister to the amputee—prosthetist, surgeon, and therapist alike. It must always be stressed that the final goal is an amputee who can function. Too often {{there is a tendency to}} put undue faith in the marvels of mechanism alone, when in fact it is the man-machine combination that determines performance. It is in this broad frame of reference that the biomechanical basis of upper-extremity con-trol must be approached. PROSTHETICS ANTHROPOMETRY SURFACE LANDMARKS If successful control is to be obtained, the various components of the prosthesis must be positioned with a good degree of accuracy. To do so requires reference points on the body, of which the most satisfactory are certain bony landmarks. Most of these skeletal prominences protrude to such an extent that location is easily possible by eye. Others require palpation, and this method should be used to verify observation in every case. The bones most concerned in upper-extremity anthropometry are the clavicle, the scapula, the humerus, the ulna, and the seventh cervical vertebra. Surface indications of protuberances, angles, or other features of these bones constitute the landmarks, the locations and definitions being given in Fig...|$|R
40|$|Poulakakis, IoannisA {{series of}} quadrupedal robots with {{different}} morphologies {{has been developed}} in the past forty years to explore the enhanced mobility such platforms may offer. The majority of these robots incorporate rigid, non-deformable torsos, a feature that distinguishes them from {{their counterparts in the}} animal world, which owe much of their remarkable locomotion abilities to their flexible bodies. Biological research indicates that torso flexibility may contribute to increased running speed, reduced energy cost and improved gait stability. This thesis proposes a modeling hierarchy that incorporates biological observations within a series of models with increasing complexity, and develops systematic feedback control algorithms for highly dynamic quadrupedal running motions that <b>harness</b> <b>torso</b> flexibility and compliant legs. On a macroscopic level, reduced-order models, or “templates”, can capture the dominant features of an observed locomotion behavior without delving into the fine details of a robot’s (or animal’s) structure and morphology. Templates provide unified, platform-independent descriptions of the desired locomotion task, and they have proved to be indispensable in designing legged robots and in synthesizing controllers for stabilizing highly-agile locomotion behaviors. One representative example is the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), which, despite its very simple structure, captures the evolution of kinetic and potential energy associated with running motions, and has informed controller design of many legged robots. However, because of its simple lumped point-mass structure, the SLIP and its immediate extensions cannot describe some of the common quadrupedal gaits that involve pronounced torso oscillations, such as bounding and galloping. Motivated by the capability as well as the limitations of SLIP-type templates, a number of reduced-order quadrupedal models that incorporate non-point-mass torsos has been proposed in the relevant literature to investigate quadrupedal running. However, partly because of the need to describe the torso morphology of the corresponding hardware platforms, and partly because of the need to simplify running dynamics, most of these quadrupedal templates only consider non-deformable, rigid torsos. Although, a few studies with preliminary results on running with torso compliance {{can be found in the}} relevant literature, studies on the conditions for generating periodic locomotion behaviors are rather limited while the stability properties of these motions are not carefully examined. As a result, feedback controller design in the presence of torso compliance has not been carefully investigated. Beyond stability and control design, the energetic cost of transport of quadrupedal running and, in particular, the contribution of torso flexibility to running efficiency, has not received adequate attention. This thesis aims at proposing a modeling and control hierarchy that enables the systematic evaluation of the role of torso compliance in quadrupedal running. The proposed templates have different modeling complexities and actuation schemes, and can be used to facilitate the investigation of a number of key issues in quadrupedal running, such as motion generation, gait stability, feedback design, gait transitions and energy efficiency. Through careful analysis of the models, a series of useful conclusions can be drawn; these conclusions pave the way toward synthesizing feedback control laws for legged robots with torso and leg compliance, and provide insight into designing robotic platforms that harness elastic elements to realize high-performance, reliable and natural-like quadrupedal running motions.
