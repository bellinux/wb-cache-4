5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, George hired Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin as an {{official}} librarian {{to look after the}} collection and the library contains his many catalogues entitled Aedes Althorpianæ, documenting the books of the library. The collection became so enormous that the massive library became inadequate to hold the contents, and books began being stored along the long picture gallery on the first floor above it. By the time of George John's death in 1834, he had amassed one of the largest private collections in Europe of some 110,000 volumes. Alcoves were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> library during the Holland restoration, creating extra room for the growing collection.|$|E

5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

Single-acting ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings. The Green engined aircraft had a single rudder mounted underneath the tailplane, while Grace's E.N.V. engined example had an additional rudder mounted above it. The undercarriage was simpler than Farman's design, and consisted {{of a pair of}} wheels mounted on an axle attached to the skids: supplementary tailskids were attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail booms.|$|E
25|$|HDPE {{is defined}} by a density of greater or equal to 0.941nbsp&g/cm3. HDPE has a low degree of branching. The mostly linear {{molecules}} pack together well, so intermolecular forces are stronger than in highly branched polymers. HDPE can be produced by chromium/silica catalysts, Ziegler-Natta catalysts or metallocene catalysts; by choosing catalysts and reaction conditions, {{the small amount of}} branching that does occur can be controlled. These catalysts prefer the formation of free radicals at the ends of the growing polyethylene molecules. They cause new ethylene monomers to add <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecules, rather than along the middle, causing the growth of a linear chain.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} design the stair cores were moved near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} to give views out {{on both the}} north and south façades. These, in conjunction with double-height galleries added to the top floor created a vertical rhythm to the façade. The number of recessed storeys was reduced to just one on the ground floor which gave the impression that the whole building was supported on the expressed columns. Verticality was further emphasised with the proportions of the windows which were slender and divided by precast concrete mullions. The stair towers have been compared with those of Charles Rennie Mackintosh at the western end of the Glasgow School of Art.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{instead of}} a grille, the Taurus had a front panel to adopt a grille-less 'bottom breather' nose, first pioneered by the Citroën DS in the 1950s. The Taurus' doors flowed up into the roof, and were {{designed}} to make the interior airtight, as well as having the door handles and windows flush {{with the rest of}} the car. The bumpers on the Taurus were designed to also be incorporated {{with the rest of the}} car's design, being flush with the rest of the body. The wheels were also pushed out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frame, and were flush with the fender, instead of being recessed into the fender. This not only improved the car's aerodynamics, it improved handling as well.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, most railroads {{took the}} cue from circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even {{up to six}} {{automobiles}} onto one flat car left {{a large amount of}} space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flatcar, foldaway bridges were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flatcar decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.|$|E
