5|$|At this time, Disney also {{encouraged}} {{his staff to}} see a variety of films. These ranged from the mainstream, such as MGM's Romeo and Juliet (1936)— to which Disney made direct reference in a story meeting pertaining to the scene in which Snow White lies in her glass coffin— to the more obscure, including European silent cinema. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{as well as the}} two Disney films to follow it, were also influenced by such German expressionist films as Nosferatu (1922) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919), both of which were recommended by Disney <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff.</b> This influence is particularly evident in the scenes of Snow White fleeing through the forest and the Queen's transformation into the Witch. The latter scene was also inspired by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), to which Disney made specific reference in story meetings.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, Casey became Chief Engineer at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ), Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). He faced {{enormous}} engineering challenges. Most of New Guinea {{consisted of}} mountains and jungle, {{with very few}} airstrips, ports or roads. All of these had to be developed to support operations. To provide additional expertise in construction, Casey had Leif Sverdrup assigned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff</b> as chief of the Construction Section, with the rank of colonel. As U.S. Army engineers were few, Casey worked closely with his Australian Army counterpart at General Sir Thomas Blamey's Allied Land Forces headquarters, Major General Clive Steele. Construction activities in Australia were also undertaken by civilians of the Allied Works Council. Casey attempted to coordinate {{the activities of the}} various agencies. He had to fend off attempts by the U.S. Army Air Forces to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions. The Royal Australian Air Force organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was Casey able to control their activities.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression, Sampson worked to control {{government}} costs, but endorsed highway progression. A severe drought in 1930 left 86 of Kentucky's counties applying for federal aid. As unemployment in the eastern coal fields climbed to 40 percent, the United Mine Workers made their first inroads in the region. In 1931, mine owners began firing workers who joined the union. Many of these workers gathered in Evarts, Kentucky. The local sheriff added 26 deputies <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>staff,</b> helping enforce the blacklisting of these miners and discourage further organization. Union leaders petitioned Sampson to remove the sheriff and the county judge from office. Violent squabbles between striking union miners and local authorities began as early as mid-April 1931. On May 5, 1931, three guards and a miner were killed in a shootout that became known as the Battle of Evarts. Two days later, Sampson called in the National Guard to disarm both the mine guards and the union miners. All of the union's leaders were arrested, and the strike ultimately failed.|$|E
