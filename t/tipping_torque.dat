Background: The {{aim of this study}} was to provide clinical indications for the correct management of appliances in space closure treatment of patients with agenesis of the upper lateral incisors.

40|$|Introduction: While using preadjusted {{edgewise}} mechanics, tooth positioning {{relies on}} the accuracy of bracket prescription for correct expression of <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> when using full-size archwire, thus making accuracy of bracket prescription vital in its overall performance. This study aimed to investigate the precision offered in bracket prescription: slot dimensions, <b>tip,</b> and <b>torque</b> values. Materials and Methods: MBT prescriptions of upper left central incisor brackets manufactured by six different commercial houses were evaluated to assess the aforementioned accuracy of bracket slot dimensions as well as <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> values. Rapid-I Precision Measuring System was used to accurately determine slot dimensions as well as <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> values. Results: Results obtained in a descending order of accuracy were as follows: American Orthodontics, Ortho Organizers, 3 M Unitek, Forestadent, Modern Orthodontics and JJ Orthodontics. The obtained results were evaluated statistically using one-way ANOVA test. P< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Conclusion: This study helps us to note the accuracy level of the inherent prescription values offered in various commercial houses and the likely effect the same may have on our expectation of a prescription finish while using attachments from any of them...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to provide an updated version of Andrews’ seminal study by {{exploiting}} 3 D software to analyse the <b>tip,</b> <b>torque</b> and in-out values of two groups of different racial and ethnic background. Methods: The analysis was conducted on one Caucasian group (30 individuals) and one of African origin (29). All subjects were adult, in normal occlusion and had no previous history of orthodontic treatment. Rhinoceros™ 3 D modelling software was used to identify anatomical reference points, planes and axes and to make the appropriate measurements. Results: Compared to Andrews’ measurements, we found more positive coronal tip values in both African and Caucasian subjects, while the torque values we measured tended to be less negative in the posterior sectors than those reported by Andrews. We measured greater tip values in the lower jaw of Caucasian with respect to African subjects, particularly in the middle sectors. Conclusions: Race and ethnicity have a strong influence on values of <b>tip,</b> <b>torque</b> and in-out. This is translated as a more positive tip in Caucasian subjects and a more positive torque in those of African descent (greater proclination of the incisors). Finally, with respect to the values reported by Andrews, we found a tendency to more positive mean tip (except for at the upper second molars and lower incisors) and less negative torque in the posterior sectors...|$|R

50|$|A {{systematic}} review done by Ehsani et al. in 2009, stated that self-ligating brackets produce lower friction when coupled with small round archwires {{in the absence}} of <b>tipping</b> and/or <b>torque</b> in an ideally aligned arch. However, sufficient evidence was not found to claim that with large rectangular wires, in the presence of <b>tipping</b> and/or <b>torque</b> and in arches with considerable malocclusion, self-ligating brackets produce lower friction compared with conventional brackets. Other studies also agree that round wires produce less friction than the rectangular wires. They also stated that most of the evaluated studies agreed that friction of both self-ligated and conventional brackets increased as the archwire size increased. However, a study done by Pizzoni et al. stated that self-ligating brackets had a markedly lower friction than conventional brackets at all angulations.|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the ideal standard for the mesio-distal angulation (tip) and bucco-lingual inclination (torque) for each tooth (crown and root) in three-dimensional space utilizing CBCT. After determining a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 76 “near normal” cases were chosen and measured. To determine the reliability of our methodology we had 10 cases digitized by Dr. Tong and Dr. Kwon at two different time points and 10 cases digitized by Dr. Tong and Dr. Sakai at one time point and Dr. Kwon at another time point. The inter/intra-examiner correlation coefficients were 0. 919 for the average of all the mean values for tip and 0. 957 for the average of all the mean values for torque. We tested for symmetry of each case by comparing the left side to the right side using a paired T-Test. From our data the upper canine tip, the upper central torque and the lower 2 nd premolar torque are the only values that fall below the p value (0. 00357). After determining that there is near perfect symmetry we took an average of the left and right side to come up with one value for the ideal <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> for every tooth. In addition, we also were able to compare the differences in the <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> between male (n= 22) and females (n= 54) and between various ethnicities. While all genders and ethnicities follow the same trend there were a few teeth that had statistically significant differences in the <b>tip</b> or <b>torque.</b> Lastly, we also calculated the interdental tip (180 o – (upper tip + lower <b>tip))</b> and <b>torque</b> (180 o – (upper torque + lower torque)). All the interdental tip angles fell within a 10 degree range of each other while the interdental torque angles increased from the central incisors all the way to the 2 nd molars, reaching close to 180 degrees...|$|R
30|$|Although in {{the past}} many {{researchers}} have addressed the various methods of treatment used in lateral incisor agenesis [6]-[9],[21], the literature published to date contains no study using digital setup software to evaluate the optimal parameters for space closure.

The idea was to exploit digital setup technology to calculate such parameters in patients with lateral incisor agenesis treated by means of space closure, calculating the optimal <b>tip,</b> <b>torque</b> and in-out for each tooth in both arches, as well as the amount of selective grinding to be performed on the palatal surface of the canine after extrusion, the inter-premolar and inter-molar distances of the treated arches - controlling the change in arch shape after setup - and, finally, the amount of canine extrusion and premolar intrusion necessary to create an optimal gingival line.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to develop and validate a novel analysis protocol to measure linear and angular measurements of <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> of each tooth in the dental arches of virtual study models. Methods: Maxillary and mandibular dental casts of 25 subjects with a full permanent dentition were scanned using a three-dimensional model scanner. Sixty points per arch were digitized on each model, five points on each tooth. A custom analysis to measure linear distances and angles of <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> was developed using a new reference plane passing as a best-fit among all of the lingual gingival points, with the intermolar lingual distance set as the reference X-axis. The linear distances measured included buccal, lingual, and centroid transverse widths at the level of canines, premolars, and molars as well as arch depth and arch perimeter. Results: There was no systematic error associated with the methodology used. Intraclass correlation coefficient values were higher than 0. 70 on every measure. The average random error in the maxilla was 1. 5 ° ± 0. 4 ° for torque, 1. 8 ° ± 0. 5 ° for tip, and 0. 4 ± 0. 2 mm for linear measurements. The average random error in the mandible was 1. 2 ° ± 0. 3 ° for torque, 2. 0 ° ± 0. 8 ° for tip, and 0. 1 ± 0. 1 mm for the linear measurements. Conclusions: A custom digital analysis protocol to measure traditional linear measurements as well as <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> angulation on virtual dental casts was presented.

40|$|Customizing {{bracket base}} for <b>tip,</b> <b>torque,</b> and {{thickness}} followed by indirect bonding {{is a necessity}} for precision-sensitive lingual orthodontics. In fact, introduction of various innovations in laboratory techniques has taken a major space {{in the history of}} rise of lingual orthodontics. Use of specialized expensive devices, application of digital technology (Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing), and use of wire-bending robots have introduced the concept of lingual orthodontic laboratories. Outsourcing to the other laboratories for customization can have its own demerits such as transportation time, potential communication gap in treatment prescription, progressive bonding/debonding problems, and cost factor. The advantage of customization by resin core indirect bonding technique on a manual setup is that the operator does not require any special devices and can be very well done by himself without any laboratory dependency. In this article, step-by-step lingual laboratory procedures in one′s own clinical setup are illustrated and thus referred as lingual orthodontic on your own.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} amount of {{expressed}} frictional resistance between orthodontic self-ligating brackets and conventionally ligated brackets in vitro {{as reported in the}} literature. Methods: Several electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched without limits. In vitro studies that addressed friction of self-ligating brackets compared with conventionally ligated brackets were selected and reviewed. In addition, a search was performed by going through the reference lists of the selected articles to identify any paper that could have been missed by the electronic searches. Results: A total of 70 papers from the electronic database searches and 3 papers from the secondary search were initially obtained.

40|$|How one {{orthodontist}} {{ended his}} search for optimal bracket position Accurate bracket positioning {{has long been a}} goal for orthodontists. The quest for optimal bracketing began after the arrival of the straightwire appliance and continues as orthodontists seek more efficient mechanics that use less wire bending. With the arrival of fully preadjusted appliances, the need for precise bracket positioning has been further driven by the specific <b>tip,</b> <b>torque,</b> and in-out information found in brackets that are individualized for each tooth. If we are able to place brackets in the correct position for each tooth, we are then able {{to take full advantage of}} our preadjusted brackets by filling the slot to express the inherent positioning in all three planes. We know that labial surfaces of teeth are fairly consistent in shape. 1 However, the individual variability of tooth anatomy presents challenges when we directly bond brackets. Manually estimating placement on each tooth is time-consuming, and it can be difficult to determine where a bracket should be placed on the tooth to achieve the optimal result. The pressure of chairtime when bonding is intensified by the added requirement of increased accuracy. These demands result in increased tim...|$|R
30|$|The ideal {{built-in}} <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> {{values of}} the straight wire appliance {{reduce the need for}} wire bending and hence reduce chair time. The vertical position of the bracket on the tooth surface can alter the torque exerted on the tooth. This {{is a result of the}} altered surface curvature observed at each vertical position. To further clarify the role of vertical bracket positioning on the applied torque and the resultant stresses in the periodontal ligament (PDL), we designed a mandibular first premolar using finite element modeling.|$|R
30|$|Angle {{introduced}} the edgewise {{system based on}} a 3 -dimensional tooth control obtained by engaging a rectangular wire into a bracket with a rectangular slot [1]. Andrews, {{taking advantage of the}} control offered by the edgewise system, advocated the use of the straight wire appliance (SWA) [2]. The mainstay of the SWA is the omission of tedious archwire bending by using tooth-specific brackets incorporating key attributes governing the final tooth position [3],[4]. Considering that SWA brackets contain the necessary information for the desired tooth position (i.e., <b>tip,</b> <b>torque,</b> height, and rotation) [5], the only variables are tooth morphology and the position of the bracket {{on the surface of the}} tooth. While acknowledging the numerous benefits of the SWA, years of clinical practice and experience have shown that the need for archwire bending is yet to be completely eliminated [6],[7]. Errors in bracket placement will lead to discrepancies in the final tooth positions [8]. Vertical bracket positioning and its effect on torque and incisor inclination have been the subject of several studies [9]–[12]. As much as 10 ° variation in torque has been observed when bracket placement differed by 1  mm [12]. Even if bracket attachment is performed perfectly, the variation in tooth morphology would render any prescription insufficient in obtaining ideal tooth positions [8].|$|R

Materials and Methods: The post-treatment models of 30 patients treated with Invisalign were digitally superimposed on corresponding ClinCheck models using best-fit surface-based registration. Differences between the two models for each tooth were measured in six dimensions: the mesial-distal, buccal-lingual, and occlusal-gingival directions, {{as well as for}} <b>tip,</b> <b>torque,</b> and rotation. Differences were tested for statistical significance with P < 0. 05 considered statistically significant. Differences larger than 0. 5 mm for linear measurements and 2 degrees for angular measurements were considered clinically relevant. Results: Maxillary second molars had statistically significantly more buccal crown torque than predicted in the ClinCheck models. This was the only difference that was also clinically relevant. Anterior teeth were positioned more occlusally than predicted, rotation of rounded teeth was incomplete, and movement of posterior teeth in all dimensions was not fully achieved; although these differences were statistically significant, they were not large enough to be clinically relevant.

30|$|That being said, {{measurement}} of the angulation and inclination of the roots relies on 3 D imaging, which has only been available in recent years following the development of such diagnostic tool technology.

30|$|When {{comparing}} the values we measured in our Italian sample with {{those reported by}} Andrews, {{it became clear that}} on the whole, their teeth had a more positive tip (i.e. a greater mesiodistal angulation). Similarly, torque values were larger on the whole in our sample. Hence, the results of this part of the study also agree with the literature, showing that individuals of the same race have different <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> values, depending on their ethnic background. Indeed, a similar picture was seen in two different Japanese [2] and Indian [4] samples, as well as Andrews’ North American Caucasians.|$|R
30|$|In {{spite of}} the many {{advances}} in orthodontics since Andrews’ proposed his pre-programmed appliance, the majority of devices on the market still feature prescriptions based on his measurements.

In reality, there is a strong correlation between the <b>tip</b> and <b>torque</b> and the tooth root position, as there are variations in coronal morphology, incongruencies between the inclination of the roots and the crown, and a disproportion between the height of the crown and the length of the root of the same tooth [7].|$|R
