40|$|Motorcycle shock {{absorbers}} exhibit a non-linear behaviour characterized by hysteresis in the force–velocity diagram. The presence of hysteresis {{is the main}} obstacle {{in the identification of}} parameters and the development of computationally efficient shock absorber models. Gas compression, oil compressibility, mechanical compliance of chambers, and oil inertia are the most important causes of hysteresis. This paper deals with experimental research carried out on a <b>twin-tube</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> equipped with pressure gauges in the chambers. A physical model is developed to explain the behaviour of the shock absorber from the measured pressures. The relevance of the various non-linear phenomena is discussed. The friction, hydraulic, and compliance parameters are identified from the measurements. The mathematical model fitted with the identified parameters is able to predict with accuracy the force generated by the shock absorber...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle {{vibration}} {{problem has}} been always an important area of research due to its negative effect on passenger comfort and vehicle safety. This problem can be solved partially by designing a good suspension system capable of maintaining an acceptable level of comfort and ensuring the vehicle safety on irregular roads. However, the conventional vehicle suspension dissipates the mechanical vibration {{energy in the form}} of heat which would waste a considerable amount of energy. Regenerative shock absorber can capture the previously dissipated vibration energy and convert it to usable electrical energy for charging a battery or powering on-board electronic devices. Moreover, it can achieve both the better ride comfort and improved road handling performance at the same time when certain control is applied. To achieve this objective, the oscillatory motion of the suspension system is employed to drive power generator. However, the frequent bidirectional oscillation of the generator can cause a large impact force. This further leads to deteriorated energy harvesting performance, moving parts fatigue, and even system failure. In addition, the bidirectional oscillating motion will produce an irregular AC voltage. In order to charge batteries or power vehicle electronics, the voltage needs to be commutated with an electrical rectifier, in which the forward voltage of diodes unavoidably reduces the circuit's efficiency. As such, this thesis presents a study of an Electro-Hydrostatic Shock Absorber (EHSA) which can integrate the vibration damping and energy generation. The presented device consists of a modified <b>twin-tube</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> with two check valves working as a hydraulic rectifier by which the bidirectional motion across the damper is converted to an asymmetric unidirectional rotation to drive the generator. The device has an advantage of having less number of check valves than the other counterpart devices which in turn would increase the overall efficiency of the system. Following the system description, mathematical and numerical models have been developed to examine the response behavior of the regenerative shock absorber. Unlike the mathematical model in which some of the system dynamics were neglected, the numerical model took into consideration all the linear and non-linear elements of the presented device. For this purpose, Matlab's Simscape Toolbox has been used as an environment for multi-domain physical system. The study is about the analysis of the performance of the electro-hydrostatic shock absorbers for automotive applications. The objective is to evaluate the fuel saving allowed by such solution. The study is performed by numerical analysis at different level of accuracy in two different configurations: with motion rectifier and without motion rectifier. The study evidences that both solutions have a promising potential of energy recuperation with a slight advantage of that with motion rectifier. The results have shown that the developed regenerative shock absorber is capable of capturing a maximum of 24 W average power with a maximum conversion efficiency of 42 % if the vehicle is going over a C-class road and when the load resistance is tuned to 2. 6 Ohm. In case of using the device without motion rectifier, the average power is reduced to 22 W with conversion efficiency of 38...|$|E
40|$|With the {{new advancements}} in the {{vibration}} control strategies and controllable actuator manufacturing, the semi-active actuators (dampers) are {{finding their way}} as {{an essential part of}} vibration isolators, particularly in vehicle suspension systems. This is attributed to the fact that in a semi-active system, the damping coefficients can be adjusted to improve ride comfort and road handling performances. The currently available semi-active damper technologies can be divided into two main groups. The first uses controllable electromagnetic valves. The second uses magnetorheological (MR) fluid to control the damping characteristics of the system. Leading automotive companies such as General Motors and Volvo have started to use semi-active actuators in the suspension systems of high-end automobiles, such as the Cadillac Seville and Corvette, to improve the handling and ride performance in the vehicle. But much more research and development is needed in design, fabrication, and control of semi-active suspension systems and many challenges must be overcome in this area. Particularly in the area of heavy vehicle systems, such as light armored vehicles, little related research has been done, and there exists no commercially available controllable damper suitable for the relatively high force and large displacement requirements of such application. As the first response to these requirements, this thesis describes the design and modeling of an in-house semi-active <b>twin-tube</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> with an internal variable solenoid-actuated valve. A full-scale semi-active damper prototype is developed and the shock absorber is tested to produce the required forcing range. The test results are compared with results of the developed mathematical model. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the semi-active suspension controlled systems and evaluate the performance of those systems, using perturbation techniques this thesis provides a detailed nonlinear analysis of the semi-active systems and establishes the issue of nonlinearity in on-off semi-active controlled systems. Despite different semi-active control methods and the type of actuators used in a semi-active controlled system, one important practical aspect of all hydro-mechanical computer controlled systems is the response-time. The longest response-time is usually introduced by the actuator –in this case, controllable actuator – in the system. This study investigates the effect of response-time in a semi-active controlled suspension system using semi-active dampers. Numerical simulations and analytical techniques are deployed to investigate the issue. The performance of the system due to the response-time is then analyzed and discussed. Since the introduction of the semi-active control strategy, the challenge was to develop methods to effectively use the capabilities of semi-active devices. In this thesis, two semi-active control strategies are proposed. The first controller to be proposed is a new hybrid semi-active control strategy based on the conventional Rakheja-Sankar (R-S) semi-active control to provide better ride-handling quality for vehicle suspension systems as well as industrial vibration isolators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new strategy, the analytical method of averaging and the numerical analysis method are deployed. In addition, a one-degree-of-freedom test bed equipped with a semi-active magnetorheological (MR) damper is developed. The tests are performed using the MATLAB XPC-target to guarantee the real-time implementation of the control algorithm. The second controller is an intelligent fuzzy logic controller system to optimize the suspension performance. The results from this intelligent system are compared with those of several renowned suspension control methods such as Skyhook. It is shown that the proposed controller can enhance concurrently the vehicle handling and ride comfort, while consuming less energy than existing control methodologies. The key goal of this thesis is to employ the existing knowledge of the semi-active systems together with the new ideas to develop a semi-active suspension system. At the same time, development of an experimental simulation system for real-time control of an experimental test bed is considered. To achieve its goals and objectives, this research study combines and utilizes the numerical simulations and analytical methods, as well as lab-based experimental works. The challenge in this research study is to identify practical and industrial problems and develop proper solutions to those problems using viable scientific approaches...|$|E

500|$|In Japan, {{the launch}} of Lexus was {{complicated}} by Toyota's existing four domestic dealership networks {{at the time of}} its introduction. The Toyota Crown and Toyota Century were exclusive to Toyota Store locations. During the LS 400's development, local dealers' requests for a Japanese domestic market version had grown, and a right-hand-drive Toyota Celsior-badged version was introduced shortly after the LS 400's U.S. debut, and introduced 9 October 1989 and only available at Toyopet Store locations. The Celsior, named after the Latin word for [...] "supreme", was largely identical to the LS. Models came in either basic [...] "A", upgraded suspension [...] "B", or fully equipped [...] "C" [...] trim specifications. The Crown and the Crown Majesta, which appeared later in 1991, were only available at Toyota Store locations which carried Japan-only Toyota luxury models, like the Century. The Celsior introduced two world firsts: high-performance <b>twin-tube</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> and an air suspension combined with an upgraded version of Toyota's semi-active dampers Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension, called Piezo TEMS.

40|$|In this paper, {{dynamic loads}} {{acting on a}} <b>twin-tube</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> are derived out both in wheel and axle planes by modeling mechanically car rear suspensions, and internal and external forces that yield lateral surface damage and wear-out of the piston rod for the absorber are analyzed according to bench and real road test measures. From viewpoint of vehicle system dynamics and experiment, such key factors as road unevenness, very high car speed and severe shock induced vibrations are investigated, by which stochastic bending moments and dramatically increasing shock loading are introduced directly to the piston rod. From viewpoint of the whole car assembly, on the other hand, due to hardly perfectly placements of the piston rods in their positions between the car suspension and body, unacceptable manufacturing quality of the body may cause additional dynamic forces on the piston rod.

5000|$|Variously {{known as}} a [...] "gas cell two-tube" [...] or similarly-named design, this {{variation}} represented a significant advancement over the basic twin-tube form. Its overall structure {{is very similar to}} the twin-tube, but a low-pressure charge of nitrogen gas is added to the reserve tube. The result of this alteration is a dramatic reduction in [...] "foaming" [...] or [...] "aeration", the undesirable outcome of a twin-tube overheating and failing which presents as foaming hydraulic fluid dripping out of the assembly. <b>Twin-tube</b> gas charged <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> represent the vast majority of original modern vehicle suspensions installations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} design {{alternative to}} the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s. As its name implies, the mono-tube shock, {{which is also a}} gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format, consists of only one tube, the pressure tube, though it has two pistons. These pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or floating piston, and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness. The two pistons also completely separate the shock's fluid and gas components. The mono-tube <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes, making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for <b>twin-tube</b> <b>shocks.</b> However, unlike the <b>twin-tubes,</b> the mono-tube <b>shock</b> can be mounted either way— it does not have any directionality. [...] It also does not have a compression valve, whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston, and although it contains nitrogen gas, the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure (260-360 p.s.i. or so) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle's weight, something which no other <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> is designed to do.|$|R
5000|$|Often {{abbreviated}} {{simply as}} [...] "PSD", this design is another {{evolution of the}} <b>twin-tube</b> <b>shock.</b> In a PSD <b>shock</b> <b>absorber,</b> which still consists of two nested tubes and still contains nitrogen gas, a set of grooves {{has been added to}} the pressure tube. These grooves allow the piston to move relatively freely in the middle range of travel (i.e., the most common street or highway use, called by engineers the [...] "comfort zone") and to move with significantly less freedom in response to shifts to more irregular surfaces when upward and downward movement of the piston starts to occur with greater intensity (i.e., on bumpy sections of roads— the stiffening gives the driver greater control of movement over the vehicle so its range {{on either side of the}} comfort zone is called the [...] "control zone"). This advance allowed car designers to make a <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> tailored to specific makes and models of vehicles and to take into account a given vehicle's size and weight, its maneuverability, its horsepower, etc. in creating a correspondingly effective shock.|$|R
