40|$|In the Bureaucracy of the Goryeo dynasty, {{there were}} two types of {{governmental}} positions : regular and concurrent. The former had a fixed quota and rank, while that of the latter was rather flexible. An official who was appointed to a concurrent position sometimes enjoyed the preferential treatment <b>of</b> "standing at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> original rank" in court ceremonies. He was permitted to stand at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> his court rank, not the rank of the concurrent position, but that of the regular position he originally had (because a concurrent position had no fixed rank originally). Concurrent positions had no fixed rank, but {{in the list of}} the official positions of the Goryeo dynasty, some concurrent positions that enjoyed the preferential treatment <b>of</b> "standing at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> original rank" are described as if they had a fixed rank and quota. The present writer has an assumption that the rank and quota described in Baekgwanji (the Treatise on Government Positions) of Goryeosa (the History of the Goryeo Dynasty) were that of the latter period, and that the concurrent positions, which enabled officials that held them to enjoy the preferential treatment <b>of</b> "standing at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> original rank" in the former period, were changed into regular positions, so they had come to have a fixed rank and quota in the latter period of the Goryeo dynasty. The attached tables prepared by the present writer to show the conditions of these concurrent positions (which enjoyed the preferential treatment <b>of</b> "standing at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one's</b> original rank" in the former period) will demonstrate the errors of Baekgwanji. Hence, the present writer believes that the information on the bureaucratic systems described in Baekgwanji should be carefully reexamined...|$|R

Bruce was not interested he was <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with the portfolio, {{as well as being}} very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of Treasurer was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to Walter Massy-Greene. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence. Although he had only been in parliament for three years, his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business wing of the party, who had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union has also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.|$|E
5|$|Several parasites {{have been}} {{isolated}} from the hartebeest. These parasites regularly alternate between hartebeest and gazelles or wildebeest. Hartebeest can be infected with theileriosis due to Rhipicephalus evertsi and Theileria species. South of the Sahara, common parasites include Loewioestrus variolosus, Gedoelstia cristata and G. hassleri. The latter two species can cause serious diseases such as encephalitis. However, parasites are not always harmful – 252 larvae were found in <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> Zambian individual without any pathogenicity. Nematodes, cestodes, paramphistomes; and the roundworm Setaria labiatopapillosa have also been {{isolated from the}} hartebeest.

25|$|An {{example of}} the play with the {{illusion}} of space in the painting {{can be seen in}} the young man at the top of the ladder holding the nails withdrawn from Christ's body. Campbell points out that this servant behind the cross appears to have caught his sleeve in the wooden tracery depicted at the top of the painting. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the bloody nails that he holds is in front of the fictional wooden picture frame, though the point of the other nail is behind the tracery. Campbell argues that, in order to prevent these spatial distortion from becoming too obvious, Rogier took pains to conceal the principal pictorial junctions in the picture. For example, the ladder is in an impossible perspective: its top is behind the cross while its foot appears to be in front of the cross. To conceal the points at which the Cross and the ladder meet the landscape, Rogier has greatly lengthened the Virgin's left leg, so that her left foot and mantle cover the base of the Cross and one upright of the ladder.|$|E
25|$|While {{there was}} a great deal of {{variation}} in the form that Inca bureaucracy and government took at the provincial level, the basic form of organization was decimal. In this system of organization, taxpayers—male heads of household of a certain age range—were organized into corvée labor units (which often doubled as military units) that formed the muscle of the state as part of mit'a service. Each level of jurisdiction above one hundred tax-payers was headed by a kuraka, while those heading smaller units were kamayuq, a lower, non-hereditary status. However, while kuraka status was hereditary, one's actual position within the hierarchy (which was typically served for life) was subject to change based upon the privileges of those above them in the hierarchy; a pachaka kuraka (see below) could be appointed to their position by a waranqa kuraka. Furthermore, it has been suggested that one kuraka in each decimal level also served as <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the nine groups at a lower level, so that one pachaka kuraka might also be a waranqa kuraka, in effect directly responsible for one unit of 100 tax-payers and less directly responsible for nine other such units.|$|E
25|$|The Roman {{conquest of}} Egypt {{put it on}} a {{collision}} course with the Sudanic powers of the southern regions. In 20 BC, Kushites under their ruler Teriteqas, invaded Egypt with some 30,000 troops. Kushite forces were mostly infantry and their armament consisted of bows about 4 cubits long, shields of rawhide, and clubs, hatchets, pikes and swords. The Kushites penetrated as far south as the Aswan area, defeating three Roman cohorts, conquering Syene, Elephantine and Philae, capturing thousands of Egyptians, and overthrowing bronze statutes of Augustus recently erected there. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of these Augustian statutes was carried off to Meroe as a trophy, and buried under a temple threshold of the Candace Amanirenas, to commemorate the Kushite victory, and symbolically tread on her enemies. A year later, Rome dispatched troops under Publius Petronius to confront the Kushites, with the Romans repulsing a poorly armed Meroitic force at Pselchis. Strabo reports that Petronius continued to advance- taking Premnis and then the Kushite city of Napata. Petronius deemed the roadless country beyond unsuitable ir too difficult for further operations. He pulled back to Premnis, strengthening its fortifications, and leaving a garrison in place. These setbacks did not settle hostilities however for a Kushite resurgence occurred just three years later under the queen or Candace Amanirenas, with strong reinforcements of African troops from further south. Kushite pressure now once more advanced on Premnis. The Romans countered this initiative by sending more troops to reinforce the city.|$|E
