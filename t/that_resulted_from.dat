We define learning as ontogenetic adaptation—that is, as changes {{in the behavior of}} an organism <b>that</b> <b>result</b> <b>from</b> regularities in the environment of the organism.

5|$|The {{extensive}} {{environmental damage}} <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> {{usage of the}} herbicide prompted the United Nations to pass Resolution 31/72 and ratify the Environmental Modification Convention.

5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E

5|$|In Grenada, the island's {{governor}} {{issued an}} emergency order against the hoarding {{of food in}} the aftermath of Janet, due to the food and water shortage <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> Janet. A United States destroyer and a British frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to Grenada, and ships departing from Jamaica and Trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies. The British government later announced that it would send £50,000 (US$155,000) in relief to the Grenadines. The Crown Agents and Red Cross delivered relief supplies to Barbados and the Grenadines, which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generators.|$|E

5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, {{commonly}} referred to as the August Coup, was prompted by the slow disintegration of the Soviet Union <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> Gorbachev's reform policy and Yeltsin's drive towards an independent Russia. The New Union Treaty being prepared called for further decentralisation of power to the republics, which weakened the government's already tenuous hold on the economy. Pavlov received a draft of the New Union Treaty on 12 August at a Security Council meeting and managed to get it published in the Moscow News on 14 August.|$|E

5|$|The loss of ecclesiastical {{patronage}} <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> the Reformation {{created a}} crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One {{result of this}} was the flourishing of Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings and walls. Other forms of domestic decoration included tapestries and stone and wood carving. In {{the first half of}} the eighteenth century there was an increasing professionalisation and organisation of art. Large numbers of artists took the grand tour to Italy. The Academy of St. Luke was founded as a society for artists in 1729. It included among its members Allan Ramsay, who emerged as one of the most important British artists of the era.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately the Gallipoli {{campaign}} was a disastrous failure. It did not achieve {{any of the}} objectives that had been given as a justification for it, and due to the inexperience of high commanders and mismanagement there were an unacceptably high number of casualties amongst the participating troops, not only from {{as a result of}} combat, but also due to widespread disease <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> poor sanitation and hygiene in the front lines and a breakdown in the casualty clearance and resupply and logistics systems. It has been estimated that {{over the course of the}} campaign there were 26,111 Australian casualties with 8,141 killed. Other Allied casualties—killed and wounded—included: 7,571 New Zealanders, 120,000 British and 27,000 French.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the bad {{conditions}} and high casualties amongst the Anzac troops {{resulted in a}} reasonably prevalent view in Australia that these had been due to the incompetence of British officers commanding the Australian troops and their disregard for the casualties <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> poorly planned or ill-conceived attacks. Whether these claims are valid or not, {{there can be little}} doubt that the entire campaign was poorly conducted, and as a result there were many military lessons learnt that were to be applied in later campaigns. Despite this, for Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign has come to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity. Today, the date of the initial landings, 25 April, is a public holiday known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations, and indeed in Turkey, to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original Anzacs, and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war.|$|E

5|$|Forster wrote well-polished German prose, {{which was}} not only scientifically {{accurate}} and objective, but also exciting and easy to read.

He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book {{is one of the most}} important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.|$|E
5|$|In September 1936, Bill's brother, the Catholic priest Reverend Denny, and his sister, Mary Catherine Denny, were {{involved}} in a vehicle accident in which Mary received fatal injuries. Reverend Denny suffered from an illness <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> the accident which contributed to his death in June 1941. Denny wrote a further autobiographical book, A Digger at Home and Abroad, which was published in 1941. He continued to practice law until his death, despite difficulties associated with rheumatoid arthritis. He died on 2 May 1946 of a heart attack which developed at his home on Osmond Terrace, Norwood, after he returned from his office in Adelaide. He was survived by his wife, one son and three daughters. He was accorded a state funeral, and was buried at West Terrace Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In the 17thcentury Civil Wars, townspeople of Poulton {{fought on}} both sides, {{although}} more {{men from the}} Fylde were {{on the side of}} the Royalists. No battles occurred in or close to Poulton but the area was affected with the rest of the county by the widespread poverty <b>that</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>from</b> the wars. In 1643 interest was stirred in the parish when a large Spanish vessel dropped anchor off the coast at Rossall. The ship made no movement for several days but fired its guns occasionally. Locals initially feared an invasion, but eventually realised that the crew was in distress and had been signalling for help. The vessel was carrying ammunition for the Parliamentarian forces and the crew had become sick and feeble. The ship was brought by Royalists into the mouth of the River Wyre and the Earl of Derby marched from across the River Ribble. He ordered the ship to be burnt and the Spanish crew to be set free.|$|E
