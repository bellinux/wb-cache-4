25|$|Certain themes appear {{repeatedly}} in {{depictions of the}} journey. Ra overcomes numerous obstacles in his course, representative of the effort necessary to maintain maat. The greatest challenge is the opposition of Apep, a serpent god who represents the destructive aspect of disorder, and who threatens to destroy the sun god and plunge creation into chaos. In many of the texts, Ra overcomes these obstacles {{with the assistance of}} other deities who travel with him; <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> various powers that are necessary to uphold Ra's authority. In his passage Ra also brings light to the Duat, enlivening the blessed dead who dwell there. In contrast, his enemies—people who have undermined maat—are tormented and thrown into dark pits or lakes of fire.|$|E
25|$|The pronominal suffixes are /-en/ for the first- and second-person {{singular}}, /-e/ for {{the third}} singular in marû TA and /-Ø/ in ḫamṭu TA, /-enden/ for the first plural, /-enzen/ for the second plural, /-ene/ {{for the third}} plural in marû and /-eš/ in ḫamṭu (the initial vowel {{in all of the}} above suffixes can be assimilated to the root). The general principle for pronominal agreement in conjugation is that in ḫamṭu TA, the transitive subject is expressed by the prefix, and the direct object by the suffix, and in the marû TA it is the other way round; as for the intransitive subject, it is expressed, in both TAs, by the suffixes and is thus treated like the object in ḫamṭu and like the subject in marû (except that its third person is expressed, not only in ḫamṭu but also in marû, by the suffixes used for the object in the ḫamṭu TA). A major exception from this generalization are the plural forms – in them, not only the prefix (as in the singular), but also the suffix expresses the transitive subject. Additionally, the prefixes of the plural are identical to those of the singular – /-?-/ or /-e-/, /-e-/, /-n-/, /-b-/ – as opposed to the -me-, -re-?, -ne- that are presumed for non-pre-stem position – and some scholars believe that the prefixes of the 1st and second person are /-en-/ rather than /-e-/ when <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the object. Before the pronominal suffixes, a suffix /-e(d)-/ with a future or related modal meaning can be inserted, accounting for occurrences of -e in the third-person singular marû of intransitive forms; because of its meaning, it can also be said to signal marû in these forms.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional logic {{generally}} {{means the}} textbook tradition {{that begins with}} Antoine Arnauld's and Pierre Nicole's Logic, or the Art of Thinking, {{better known as the}} Port-Royal Logic. Published in 1662, it was the most influential work on logic after Aristotle until the nineteenth century. The book presents a loosely Cartesian doctrine (that the proposition is a combining of ideas rather than terms, for example) within a framework that is broadly derived from Aristotelian and medieval term logic. Between 1664 and 1700, there were eight editions, and the book had considerable influence after that. [...] The Port-Royal introduces the concepts of extension and intension. The account of propositions that Locke gives in the Essay is essentially that of the Port-Royal: [...] "Verbal propositions, which are words, [...] the signs of our ideas, put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences. So that proposition consists in the putting together or separating these signs, according as the things which <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> agree or disagree." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1995, the channel's name officially {{changed to}} the A Network, to reflect its declining focus on arts and entertainment. By 1996, the network had branded itself as simply A, and {{was using the}} slogans [...] "Time Well Spent" [...] and [...] "Escape the Ordinary." [...] "The word 'arts,' in regard to television, has {{associations}} such as 'sometimes elitist,' 'sometimes boring,' 'sometimes overly refined' and 'doesn't translate well to TV,'" [...] Whitney Goit, {{executive vice president for}} sales and marketing, stated. [...] "Even the arts patron often finds arts on TV not as satisfying as it should be ... And the word 'entertainment' is too vague. Therefore, much like ESPN uses its letters rather than what <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> – Entertainment Sports (Programming) Network – we decided to go to just A" [...] Of the network's tagline, Goit said, [...] "Intellectually, 'Time well spent' defines a comparison between those who view a lot of television as a wasteland, and their acknowledgment that there are good things on TV and that they'd like to watch more thought-provoking TV." ...|$|E
2500|$|Criticism of Sămănătorist traditionalism and its {{presence}} in various contexts was also voiced in later years. In one such case, historian Mihai Sorin Rădulescu argued that such tendencies had {{made their way into}} Romanian museology: [...] "the Museum of the Romanian Peasant [...] and the Village Museum both show Romanians in accordance with Semănătorist tradition". In a 2007 article critical of Romania's educational policy, textbook author Dumitriţa Stoica described as an anachronism the presence of topics on Sămănătorism within the standard baccalaureate examination, noting that such subjects had already been stripped from the regular curriculum. In his 2008 book Iluziile literaturii române ("Illusions in Romanian Literature"), literary historian and theorist Eugen Negrici linked the perpetuation of neo-Sămănătorist guidelines with another nationalist current, Protochronism, discussing them as equally negative phenomena: [...] "Even though I feel no pleasure, I must admit that the ideological-literary movements of a Sămănătorist and Protochronist type appear to be durable, being strictly motivated by the ways in which Romanian society has evolved. <b>They</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> both the protective impulse and the compensatory one [...] At the first sign of a major peril, we shall be hearing the magmatic rumble of myths rising up again from the deep".|$|E

2500|$|As {{with other}} social movements, {{there is also}} {{conflict}} within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education. There is debate over what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersexed people, and others share common interests and a need to work together. [...] Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities. Roffee and Waling (2016) discovered that LGBTIQ people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours from other people within the LGBTIQ community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails [...] "LGBTIQ". For example, transgender people found that {{other members of the}} community were not understanding to their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this can cause health risks. [...] Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of the bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though most of these people would say that <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> <b>for</b> the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBTIQ community.|$|E
