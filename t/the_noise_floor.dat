40|$|Abstract. Since {{recently}} {{almost all}} housing built in Korean have shared walls and floor, diverse problems are unavoidable including <b>noise</b> between <b>floor</b> arising from <b>noise</b> and vibration. Many {{efforts have been}} made by the Korean government, but the number of complaints related with <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> between <b>floors</b> has been gradually increasing. Therefore, through the field measurements by house type, the current state of noise was understood. To do this, <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> between <b>floors</b> was measured in an apartment household and a multiplex house to perform a comparative analysis. As the result, the differences in <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> between <b>the</b> two house types were clarified. The findings of this research are expected to contribute to reduction of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> between <b>floors</b> in an apartment building in the future...|$|R
5000|$|As {{discussed}} in the operation section, the resolution bandwidth filter or RBW filter is the bandpass filter in the IF path. It's the bandwidth of the RF chain before the detector (power measurement device). [...] It determines <b>the</b> RF <b>noise</b> <b>floor</b> and how close two signals can be and still be resolved by the analyzer into two separate peaks. [...] Adjusting the bandwidth of this filter allows for the discrimination of signals with closely spaced frequency components, while also changing <b>the</b> measured <b>noise</b> <b>floor.</b> Decreasing <b>the</b> bandwidth of an RBW filter decreases <b>the</b> measured <b>noise</b> <b>floor</b> and vice versa. This is due to higher RBW filters passing more frequency components through to the envelope detector than lower bandwidth RBW filters, therefore a higher RBW causes a higher measured <b>noise</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
2500|$|When pulse {{compression}} {{is carried out}} in digital signal processing, after the incoming signals are digitised by A/D converters, {{it is important that}} level of <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>floor</b> is correctly set. [...] <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> <b>floor</b> at the A/D must be high enough to ensure that the noise is adequately characterised. [...] If the noise level is too low, Nyquist [...] will not be satisfied, and any embedded chirp will not be recovered correctly. [...] On the other hand, setting the noise level unnecessarily high will reduce the dynamic range capability of the system.|$|E

2500|$|Sensitivity {{indicates}} {{how well}} the microphone converts acoustic pressure to output voltage. A high sensitivity microphone creates more voltage and so needs less amplification at the mixer or recording device. [...] This is a practical concern but is not directly {{an indication of the}} microphone's quality, and in fact the term sensitivity is something of a misnomer, [...] "transduction gain" [...] being perhaps more meaningful, (or just [...] "output level") because true sensitivity is generally set by <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> <b>floor,</b> and too much [...] "sensitivity" [...] in terms of output level compromises the clipping level. There are two common measures. The (preferred) international standard is made in millivolts per pascal at 1kHz. A higher value indicates greater sensitivity. The older American method is referred to a 1V/Pa standard and measured in plain decibels, resulting in a negative value. Again, a higher value indicates greater sensitivity, so −60 dB is more sensitive than −70dB.|$|E

40|$|Extremely {{high data}} rate {{communication}} can potentially be achieved by combining high-order modulations and wide bandwidths at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies. However, it has been challenging to practically implement this combination, even if the SNR of the system appears to be sufficiently high. An explanation from a recent theoretical study is that the practical data rates in mm-wave systems are limited by the local oscillator (LO) white phase noise. In this letter, we present an experimental investigation on whether <b>the</b> white <b>noise</b> <b>floor</b> of frequency multiplied LO sources is a major noise contribution to wideband signals.
