40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{the development and}} introduction of a program to produce the <b>travel</b> <b>order</b> reports. The reasons for making this application are mainly in lack of transparency over travel costs and various information on the <b>travel</b> <b>order.</b> Also the new program requires much less {{time and effort to}} create the <b>travel</b> <b>order.</b> In the introductory chapter I started with the description of the problem domain, which I have been working with through this thesis. With this program I acquired greater control (inspection) of travel costs and sorting those, depending on various factors. Moreover, in the introductory section I presented the purpose of the application and within this I explained the objectives and additional features covered by the new program. In the following chapters I presented the methodology IE (information engineering) and guidelines that this methodology offers. In the subsequent chapters I described how I have reviewed existing methods of work and examine it in order to obtain an indicative picture of the problem, and gradually I describe the different phases of program development. After consulting with the leadership of groups I began to plan a new program and new features that were necessary for better and more transparent report of the journey. To make this program I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and SQL Server 2005 and for the creation final report I used Crystal Reports. In the last chapter I described the testing and installing the program...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of travel agency in Malang {{is viewed as}} strategic business because it could replace the personal vehicle for heading toward Juanda Airport in Surabaya since Malang itself didn’t have any international standard airport so the member of the society who wants to get in or out from Malang using aeroplane should go to Juanda Airport in Surabaya. This would cause the competition among travel services in Malang become more compet itive by the emerging of new travel agencies. In case the Kirana Travel Agency would maintain its existence, {{they need to make}} efforts to improve its service quality. Therefore, it require an experiment to found out what kind of service attributes that wanted by the customer and how does the gap between the perception and consumer expectancy toward the ongoing service quality. One of the planning method that can be use to translate the need of the consumer into action plan for the company is QFD. This step would be use as evaluation tool and planning on service quality improvement. To sharpened identification of the service quality attributes then the QFD approach integrated with Servqual approach. During the Servqual review, it is found eight service attributes that need to be fixed which is: information accuracy given by the employees, the precise time on pick-up, good reaction of the employees in handling consumer complaints, the availability of health and safety facility (First aid box, fire extinguisher, etc), <b>travel</b> <b>order</b> confirmation, driver that should consistently being polite toward the consumer, easy access to be called and gain information from the operator and travel prices.
