In some species <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> consists of small woody objects such as bark flakes and seed husks, while in others it includes the moss, grass, hair and feathers typical of passerine birds.|$|E
5|$|Head: The head {{should be}} broad with {{slightly}} pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. <b>The</b> <b>lining</b> {{around the eyes}} should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and set slightly above the eyes.|$|E
5|$|The lungs possess several {{characteristics}} which {{protect against}} infection. The lung tract is lined by epithelia with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry mucus. This mucociliary clearance {{is an important}} defence system against air-borne infection. The dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air {{are caught in the}} mucosal surface of respiratory passages and are moved up towards the pharynx by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia. <b>The</b> <b>lining</b> of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidates. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of the lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system such as T-cells and B-cells.|$|E

5|$|The one {{exception}} to black was No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn which in 1946 was painted in a blue-grey colour. This represented the proposed post-war livery and <b>the</b> <b>lining,</b> painted {{on one side}} of the locomotive only, comprised a pale straw yellow line along the running plate with yellow and black edging to cab and tender. Lettering and numerals used a sans-serif font.|$|E
5|$|The railway was {{constructed}} by the South Eastern Railway in the early 1850s across the difficult terrain of the High Weald. Supervision of {{the building of the}} line was lax, enabling contractors to skimp on <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of the tunnels. These deficiencies showed up after the railway had opened. Rectifications led to a restricted loading gauge along the line, requiring the use of dedicated rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|Bissell {{was arrested}} in 1981 in Bloomington, Indiana, and charged with public intoxication, disorderly conduct and pushing a policeman. He was given a 30-day jail sentence, however a plea bargain was made whereby the judge ordered him to arrange to give a {{performance}} at Indiana University with the proceeds {{to be given to}} charity. Bissell was also given a $100 fine. After being fired by the ABT (along with Gelsey Kirkland), they were re-hired and celebrated by doing a stash of cocaine they had smuggled in <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of a ballet slipper.|$|E
5000|$|Let ABC be {{any given}} triangle. Let O be the {{circumcenter}} and K be the symmedian point of triangle ABC.

5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (<b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In Swedish, however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively plain language, using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples {{include the use of}} Swedish blå and grön for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the Swedish words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a tincture on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in Swedish heraldry. Vair is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal horn of the lateral ventricle, and occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly from the tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.|$|E
50|$|However, several <b>lines</b> lack <b>the</b> system, {{including}} <b>the</b> Arendal <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Flåm <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Meråker <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Nordland <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Rauma <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Røros <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Østfold <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> {{northern part}} of <b>the</b> Gjøvik <b>Line,</b> and several tunnels along <b>the</b> Bergen <b>Line</b> and <b>the</b> Sørlandet <b>Line.</b> <b>The</b> Åsta accident in 2000 spurred the need to give {{all parts of the}} railway coverage with train radio.

50|$|On 17 September 1864, {{construction}} {{began on}} <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> {{starting point of}} <b>the</b> new <b>line</b> was Neumark station and initially <b>the</b> <b>line</b> ran along <b>the</b> tracks of the Saxon-Bavarian Railway. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> branched off from <b>the</b> main <b>line</b> to <b>the</b> newly built Brunn station {{in order to continue}} through the Aubach valley to Greiz-Aubachtal station, which was the end of <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> was built fairly quickly, so that <b>the</b> <b>line</b> was completed in October 1865.

5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} of pituitary apoplexy {{are related to}} the increased pressure in and around the pituitary gland. The most common symptom, in over 95% of cases, is a sudden-onset headache located behind the eyes or around the temples. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Occasionally, the presence of blood leads to irritation of <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of the brain, which may cause neck rigidity and intolerance to bright light, as well as a decreased level of consciousness. This occurs in 24% of cases.|$|E
5|$|The lophophore and mantle are {{the only}} {{surfaces}} that absorb oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide. Oxygen seems to be distributed by the fluid of the coelom, which is circulated through the mantle and driven either by contractions of <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of the coelom or by beating of its cilia. In some species oxygen is partly carried by the respiratory pigment hemerythrin, which is transported in coelomocyte cells.The maximum oxygen consumption of brachiopods is low, and their minimum requirement is not measurable.|$|E
5|$|The {{passengers}} were Casis Said Atalah, a Palestinian {{returning home to}} Chile from a visit to his dying mother; Jack Gooderham and Harald Pagh, businessmen; Peter Young, an agent for Dunlop; Paul Simpson, a British civil servant; and Marta Limpert, a Chilean resident of German origin who had been stranded in Germany during the war along with her husband. Atalah {{is said to have}} had a diamond with him (stitched into <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of his suit), Limpert was bringing her dead husband's ashes with her, and Simpson was functioning as a King's Messenger with diplomatic documents destined for the British embassy in Santiago.|$|E

5000|$|On October 1, 1943, {{under the}} order of the government, Hanshin Kyūkō and Keihan Electric Railway were merged, and renamed Keihanshin Kyūkō Railway Company (referred to as [...] "Keihanshin", 京阪神). <b>The</b> merged <b>lines</b> {{included}} <b>the</b> Keihan Main <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Uji <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Shinkeihan <b>Line</b> (present-day Kyoto Main <b>Line),</b> <b>the</b> Senriyama <b>Line</b> (present-day Senri <b>Line),</b> <b>the</b> Jūsō <b>Line</b> (part of Kyoto Main <b>Line),</b> <b>the</b> Arashiyama <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Keishin <b>Line</b> and <b>the</b> Ishiyama Sakamoto <b>Line.</b> <b>The</b> Katano <b>Line</b> was also added in 1945.|$|R
5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when {{estrogen}} causes <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of estradiol, and estrogen. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
50|$|The {{three groups}} of <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>the</b> Kobe <b>Lines,</b> <b>the</b> Takarazuka <b>Lines</b> and <b>the</b> Kyoto <b>Lines,</b> can be further grouped into two, <b>the</b> Kobe-Takarazuka <b>Lines</b> and <b>the</b> Kyoto <b>Lines</b> from a {{historical}} reason.

5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in black with LMS-style lining. <b>The</b> <b>lining</b> comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be {{referred}} to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in <b>the</b> <b>lining</b> of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the pituitary gland, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E
