5|$|In 1994, {{in order}} to meet an urgent need to {{increase}} the number of aircraft able <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> targets for laser-guided bombs, 10 GR1As and two T2As were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively. TIALD equipped Jaguar GR1Bs were deployed to Italy in August to take part in Operation Deliberate Force against Bosnian Serb forces, being used <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> targets for RAF Harriers. During the Bosnian operations, a Jaguar of 41 Squadron carried out the first RAF bombing raid in Europe since the end of the Second World War fifty years before.|$|E

5|$|The H0- prefix is an anomaly: the 0 {{indicates}} a very small, rural village, but H is used <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> Montreal, the second-largest city in Canada. As such, the H0- prefix is almost completely empty. H0M, {{assigned to the}} international Akwesasne tribal reserve on the Canada-US border, is the only other H0- postal code in active use.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Wilma was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone in the Atlantic basin on record, with an atmospheric pressure of 882hPa (mbar, 26.05inHg). Wilma's destructive journey began in {{the second week of}} October 2005. A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the Caribbean Sea and gradually organized to the southeast of Jamaica. By late on October 15, the system was sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> it as Tropical Depression Twenty-Four.|$|E

5|$|In September 2002 the St. Simons African-American Heritage Coalition {{organized}} a two-day commemoration with events related to Igbo {{history and a}} procession to the site. The 75 attendees came from other states, as well as Nigeria, and Belize and Haiti, where similar resistance had taken place. They gathered <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> the site as holy ground and give the souls rest. The account of the Igbo {{is now part of}} the curriculum for coastal Georgia schools.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} as great a farce of yesterday's {{election}} <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> it otherwise than a fraud. It {{was one of the}} worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid no attention to any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward to another and voted early and often.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E

In 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank sought <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> the {{building}} as a Seattle city landmark, but were unable to gain approval from the City of Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board. A second attempt at the city landmark nomination, led by Martin Selig Real Estate, began in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{used more}} than one launch vehicle for space missions, NASA used spacecraft-launch vehicle {{combination}} series numbers: AS-10x for Saturn I, AS-20x for Saturn IB, and AS-50x for Saturn V (compare Mercury-Redstone 3, Mercury-Atlas 6) <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> and plan all missions, rather than numbering them sequentially as in Project Gemini. This was changed by the time manned flights began.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1960s and {{following}} the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began {{to move away from}} downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|Aligned ZnO {{nanowires}} on pre-seeded silicon, glass, and {{gallium nitride}} substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles {{and the use}} of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and nanosphere lithography <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> nucleation sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye-sensitized solar cells and field emission devices.|$|E

5|$|Before the vote, {{there were}} {{calls for the}} bills to be {{separated}} at the Diet. Waseda University professor Norihiro Kato stated that Kimigayo is a separate issue {{more complex than the}} Hinomaru flag. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> only the Hinomaru as the national flag by the DPJ and other parties during the vote of the bill were rejected by the Diet. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 22, 1999, by a 403 to 86 vote. The legislation was sent to the House of Councilors on July 28 and was passed on August 9. It was enacted into law on August 13.|$|E
5|$|Business U.S. Highway 8 (Bus. US8) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, was {{a locally}} {{maintained}} business loop highway routing through the {{central business district}} of the city. The route was designated when US8 was shifted to a bypass of downtown in the 1990s. The former routing of US8 through the area {{was turned over to}} the city and county for maintenance. The local authorities erected signs along this route <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> it as a business loop of the main highway south of town. The signs along the road were scheduled to be removed on July 1, 2005, when the business loop was to be redesignated CTH-P.|$|E
5|$|Dragons of Despair is {{the first}} in a series of 16 Dragonlance adventures {{published}} by TSR, Inc. (TSR) between 1984 and 1988. It is the start of the first major story arc in the Dragonlance series of Dungeons & Dragons (D) role-playing game modules, a series of ready-to-play adventures for use by Dungeon Masters in the game. This series provides a game version of the original Dragonlance storyline later told in the Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy of novels. This module corresponds to the events told in the first half of the novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. Its module code is DL1, which is used <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> it as the first part of the Dragonlance adventure series.|$|E
