The research took advantage of a situation where academics in the author’s university were given some latitude on how they wanted to arrange their renovated offices. Interviews with colleagues revealed that the way they had (or had not) arranged, decorated and furbished their offices offered a rich source of data about their sense of place, purpose, practice and identity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel concept of acclimatized container to increase people comfort {{in case of}} temporary housing. It {{is based on the}} ZEBRA concept (Zero Energy Building Renewable Addicted) concept studied by Università of Modena e Reggio Emilia. The original concept developed for industrial building has been extended to mobile metallic housing systems such as the containers transported by trucks which are used for troops and military command during field operations. This system does not require any external source of energy. It requires only the presence of a water well or drilling a hole to place inside a closed loop exchanger which is used to stabilize temperature of internal water which is used as a dynamic thermal barrier which maintains in the wellness conditions inside the mobile housing equipment. Energetic costs of this system are related only to the very reduced energy necessary for water pumping operations. It could be easily produced, together with necessary energy for light and instrumentation by a photovoltaic ceiling. The absence of fenestrations will be obviated by optic-fiber-based external light capturing and distributing, together with air ventilation system. This paper presents the energetic balance of this military field and building concept which can be used also to reduce the surplus of naval container in the harbors of all the occidental countries due to the necessity of the cargo ships to navigate with a high load. By these reasons the presented Zebra concept can be not only a zero energy consumption solution but also a very inexpensive solution for any temporary residential exigency such as <b>temporary</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> and military camps.

500|$|As Wipha {{approached}} the Chinese coastline, threatening {{the city of}} Shanghai, {{one of the largest}} evacuations in the country's history took place. Local media warned that Wipha [...] "may be the most destructive typhoon in a decade." [...] More than 2million people evacuated from coastal areas, 1.79million of whom were in Zhejiang Province, the largest relocation of residents in the history of Zhejiang. Following the issuance of a Super Typhoon Warning, Shanghai officials evacuated 291,000 people from old buildings, <b>temporary</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites,</b> and those who live near the coast. About 20,000 soldiers were sent to assist in the evacuation and reinforce flood barriers. A parade which was scheduled to take place in Shanghai was cancelled due to the warnings. About 365 workers were evacuated from the Pinghu oil rig located in the East China Sea. Zoos caged animals and increased staff numbers to prevent escape and contain any fires which may be sparked by downed power lines. More than 39,000 people were evacuated from Jiangsu Province, mainly along the coast. Numerous cities cancelled schools and closed business for the day of and following the typhoon. The typhoon also caused FIFA to reschedule four matches in the Women's World Cup. Nearly 40,000 vessels were recalled to port throughout China. About 250,000 people were also evacuated from Fujian Province with an additional 1.41million text messages were also sent out to residents in the province. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) commenced [...] "level one" [...] emergency plan, the highest state of emergency. The Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief commenced a [...] "level two" [...] flood control emergency plan and sent four teams to the provinces which were anticipated to be impacted by Wipha. About 50,000 factories in Zhejiang were shut down until Wipha passed. The large-scale evacuations resulted in a lower loss of life from the typhoon.|$|R

40|$|Prefabrication {{has evolved}} in depth and breadth from its beginnings, {{bringing}} {{many of the}} advantages of industrialisation to construction, while solving {{some of the problems that}} arose in the early years. Today prefabrication, compared to traditional construction methods, and concrete as a material, feature a number of beneficial characteristics. Precast elements are factory made products. The only way to industrialise the construction industry is to shift work from <b>temporary</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> to modern permanent facilities. Factory production entails rational and efficient manufacturing processes, skilled workers, systematisation of repetitive tasks, and lower labour costs per m² as a result of automated production. Factory products are process-based and lean manufacturing principles are deployed. Automation is gradually being implemented in factories and is already in place in areas such as the preparation of reinforcing steel, mould assembly, concrete casting, and surface finishing on architectural concrete. And other stages in the process are sure to follow. As prefabrication makes optimal use of materials, its potential for savings is much greater than in cast-in-situ construction. Structural performance and durability are also enhanced through design, modern manufacturing equipment and carefully planned working procedures. The environmental burden of prefabrication is mainly the burden caused by the raw materials of concrete (especially production of cement and steel). The environmental burden caused by raw materials is approximately three times larger than that caused by the production process of the elements, as indicated by the examples of environmental product declarations. Also thermal inertia of heavy materials is well known for both in warm and cold climates. Most people have experienced the comfort of coming into a comparatively cool stone building on a hot day in a warm climate. In precast structures several systems have been developed using this characteristic. As there is a Fib Bulletin under preparation in Commission 6 Prefabrication, by the Task Group 6. 3 Sustainability, in which both authors are members, the conclusions of this document will be presented including a proposal for an evaluation model that can be applied to precast structures.

Actual site circumstances, including the location of a temporary facility relative to the location of the workers as well as workers' needs, travel, and service time are taken into account. The objective is to identify the best location on site for temporary facilities on a project-by-project basis. When real-time data becomes available as construction progresses, it can be incorporated in the model to generate even more realistic output. Tool-room location is used as an illustration.

Three SightPlan strategies are applied to two case studies of power plant construction (the Intermountain Power Project and the American 1 project). An early-commitment strategy models the way human experts conduct site layout and produces a layout solution that satisfies all constraints. A temporal strategy tests and validates the early-commitment strategy and extends it by explicitly representing and reasoning about objects over time. This allows the global site layout to be animated as a sequence of layouts over discret...|$|R
