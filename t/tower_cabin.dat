50|$|The <b>Tower</b> of <b>Cabin</b> is {{an unusual}} spinoff of the fantasy {{role-playing}} video game series called Xak by the Japanese developer MicroCabin. The <b>Tower</b> of <b>Cabin</b> was released just before MicroCabin decided to discontinue the development of Xak III for MSX. The <b>Tower</b> of <b>Cabin</b> was also ported to the NEC PC9801. In this game, the player plays as a new MicroCabin employee as they wander the MicroCabin headquarters building in Japan with a goal {{to work with the}} various lead programmers and developers in making the company more successful. This is very similar to the Japanese game known as Segagaga (Dreamcast) in which the player runs the entire Sega company as the president of Sega Corporation. This game featured many characters from the Xak series such as Latok, Fray and Pixie. There were two unlockable mini-games in The Tower of Cabin: a short fighting game between Pixie and Fray and a text adventure called Crusader that took place within the Xak universe.|$|R

50|$|Margarita Lookout, {{also known}} as Santa Margarita Lookout, is a lookout point in the Santa Margarita Mountains, {{part of the larger}} Santa Ana Mountains in San Diego County, California. The {{original}} fire lookout tower, built in 1935 by the CCC, was later replaced by a new lookout <b>tower</b> and <b>cabin</b> in 1965. In 1986, the <b>tower</b> and <b>cabin</b> were both burned in a wildfire. In 1988, the burnt tower was destroyed in a collision with a Marine Corps CH-46E helicopter. The lookout tower was badly damaged as a result and was promptly removed. Only a concrete foundation remains today, however the site is still accessible via trail (Margarita Road/Truck Trail). The lookout is approximately one mile north of Margarita Peak, and is located in the Cleveland National Forest.|$|R

50|$|On May 1, 2005, eleven {{people were}} left {{stranded}} {{for nearly three}} hours after a free fall ride malfunctioned. Reports indicate that the floorless, four-sided passenger cabin jerked as it ascended the <b>tower.</b> The <b>cabin,</b> guided by cables, normally drops {{to the bottom of}} the 120-foot-tall tower and comes to a stop, however when it reached the halfway point on its ascent, it made loud screeching noises and came to a sudden halt. It took firefighters nearly three hours to rescue the riders, who were locked in their seats about 30 feet above the ground.|$|R
50|$|Built {{starting}} in 1925 and operating until the 1970s, the site {{served as a}} United States Forest Service fire lookout. The district includes three contributing buildings and two contributing structures. The site contains a 1925 crows nest, a 1933 lookout <b>tower,</b> a 1933 <b>cabin</b> and garage, and an outhouse {{that may have been}} contemporaneous.|$|R
25|$|In 1919, the Conservation Commission, {{which the}} FFGC had become, {{found that there}} was still a large area of the {{southern}} Catskills, in Sullivan and Ulster counties, poorly served by the existing towers. Red Hill was chosen as the site for a new tower (supposedly after political pressure forced the state to reconsider Sullivan County's Denman Mountain to the south), and early in 1920 a forest ranger brought the disassembled tower up to the summit via horse-drawn wagon. A state crew cut a road through the Dibble farm up from nearby Red Hill Road, strung the telephone line along it, and put up the <b>tower</b> and <b>cabin</b> later that year.|$|R
50|$|Access is gained {{into the}} tower via a narrow {{door at the}} base. A spiral {{staircase}} ascends {{the interior of the}} <b>tower</b> to the <b>cabin.</b> The cabin is clad with weatherboard. Doors open onto each of the three projecting walkways. A set of three windows open from each of the other five sides. The interior is furnished with a lavatory and wash basin.|$|R
2500|$|Hunter's {{summit is}} a large {{clearing}} dominated by the fire <b>tower</b> and observer's <b>cabin.</b> [...] The former may once again be climbed although the cab at the top is locked save for days when volunteer interpreters go up to help; the latter is locked but may eventually {{be turned into a}} small museum as has already happened with nearby Overlook Mountain and Balsam Lake Mountain.|$|R
25|$|Within a few years, the {{campaign}} had gotten all five remaining Catskill fire towers {{listed on the}} Forest Fire Lookout Association's Historic Lookout Register and later the NRHP. State grants matched by money raised through local efforts such as bake sales, dances, fundraising drives, raffling of a quilt and T-shirt sales raised enough money to begin restoring the <b>tower</b> and <b>cabin</b> in 1998. Volunteers from the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference extended the path from the tower to the spring into a trail that would remain within state land down the mountain's never-logged northwestern slope to a new trailhead, avoiding the closed road. When all these efforts were complete, in 2000, the Red Hill tower became {{the first of the}} restored Catskill fire towers to be reopened to the public.|$|R
50|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} the {{mountain}} had been greatly expanded, {{with a second}} gondola added in the Lionshead area, which also included a residences and shops {{at the base of}} the slopes. On 26 March 1976, disaster struck the gondola when carrying cable snagged on a support <b>tower</b> and two <b>cabins</b> derailed, killing four people and injuring eight. The gondola was closed for the remainder of the season. Soon after the original gondola in Vail Village was replaced with a double chairlift.|$|R
50|$|The Kananaskis Rotary Club {{dedicated}} {{a memorial}} on 17 October 1997 {{on the site}} of a Second World War prisoner of war camp. The memorial is dedicated to the guards, veterans from the First World War that were too old to fight in the Second World War, who were responsible for guarding, communications, railway, ammo depots and the Prisoner of War camps. Pictures and information on the Prisoner of War camp are located in the original watch <b>tower</b> and Colonel's <b>cabin.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sterling Mountain Fire Observation <b>Tower</b> and Observer's <b>Cabin</b> is a {{historic}} fire observation station located on Sterling Mountain in Sterling Forest State Park at Greenwood Lake in Orange County, New York. The station includes a 60 ft, steel-frame lookout tower erected in 1922 and an observer's cabin built about 1934. The tower is a prefabricated structure built by the Aermotor Corporation and provided a front line of defense in preserving the Ramapo Mountains from the hazards of forest fires. The observer's cabin is of light frame construction, sheathed with board and batten siding stained brown.|$|R

50|$|It {{is noted}} that Demonreach is hostile to intruders, human or otherwise, and sits atop {{a source of}} great and {{powerful}} magic, the spirit operating as protector of the island. The spirit is exceptionally hostile to the Gatekeeper, who will not even set foot upon the island due to a previous altercation. There is a pathway to the Nevernever that opens up on the island, but Harry doesn't know the way yet. The spirit is also extremely hostile towards the presence of the Skinwalker and bars it from approaching the <b>tower</b> and the <b>cabin</b> on the hill. Writings from Ebenezar hint that Demonreach may play a powerful role in Harry's future.|$|R

5000|$|Land at New Yarmouth {{was first}} granted to Loyalist John Hall in 1785 and later granted to Alexander and John Grant in 1819, {{although}} {{neither of these}} families appear to have settled at New Yarmouth. By 1873, the Copps and Brown families had settled in the community. The expansion of lumbering in the Cape Chignecto area in the late 1800s brought more families to the area. By 1904, the community had 10 homes and a school located around {{the intersection of the}} New Yarmouth Road and Eatonville Road. The Wasson family became important landowners in New Yarmouth in this period, contracting out timber lands, running lumber camps for mills and providing horse teams. However a collapse in timber prices in the early 1920s caused many mills to close and logging operations around New Yarmouth declined. The school house closed and was moved to nearby Advocate where it was converted to a dwelling. By they early 1950s isolation and opportunities elsewhere led the last few families to leave, a similar fate also shared by nearby Eatonville as part of a postwar abandonment of isolated farming and forestry communities in Cumberland County. The land was used for blueberry harvesting and pulp wood harvesting by the Minas Basin Pulp and Paper company and later Scott Paper. Minas Basin Pulp and Paper built a fire look out tower at New Yarmouth in the 1940s. The Royal Canadian Air Force proposed building a combined radar and fire tower at New Yarmouth in 1960 to fill a gap in the Pine Tree Line radar system but the post was never built. The fire tower was later taken over the Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources and was staffed for many years by Lloyd E. Bennett of Advocate until his retirement in 1999. [...] The fire <b>tower</b> and <b>cabin</b> remained staffed seasonally by the Department of Natural Resources until 2012. However the fire tower was closed in 2013 by the Department of Natural Resources as part of a province-wide move to replace fire towers by air patrols and citizen reporting and demolished in June 2015.|$|R
