5|$|After Bardulf's death, a {{legal case}} was brought against Bardulf's {{chaplain}} and constable, alleging that Bardulf had allowed his two servants {{to hear a}} case <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> heard by the justice. The litigants charged that the two servants had wrongly decided the case, and after hearing the allegations, the royal justices at Westminster agreed and restored the disputed property to the litigants.|$|E
5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her escape, and investigation showed that a door <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her escape and then killed her.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May 1910, Edward VII died. Mary's husband {{ascended the}} throne as King George V, {{and she became}} queen consort. When her husband asked her to drop one of her two {{official}} names, Victoria Mary, she chose to be called Mary, preferring {{not to take the}} name of her husband's grandmother, Queen Victoria. Queen Mary was crowned with the King on 22 June 1911 at Westminster Abbey. Later in the year, the new King and Queen travelled to India for the Delhi Durbar held on 12 December 1911, and toured the sub-continent as Emperor and Empress of India, returning to Britain in February. The beginning of Mary's period as consort brought her into conflict with her mother-in-law, Queen Alexandra. Although the two were on friendly terms, Alexandra could be stubborn; she demanded precedence over Mary at the funeral of Edward VII, was slow in leaving Buckingham Palace, and kept some of the royal jewels <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> passed to the new Queen.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{decision-making}} strategy in civil law reflects an {{allocation of risk}} of error which is equivalent between plaintiffs and respondents, between errors based on accepting <b>that</b> which <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rejected and those based on rejecting <b>that</b> which <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accepted. Similarly, there is equivalency between an overly stingy assessment and an overly generous assessment.|$|R
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E

The journal Drug Invention Today accepted an obviously bogus paper made up by Bohannon <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rejected by any good peer review system. Instead, Drug Invention Today was among many open access journals that accepted the fake paper for publication. As of 2014, this journal had been transferred to a different publisher.|$|E

25|$|Michael Herzfeld, an anthropologist, {{argued that}} the idea of women losing their {{chastity}} derived from those who wished to explain a woman's new role within society. The idea of women expanding their roles outside of the home in society went against the ideas and morals that were upheld centuries before. In order to defend this morality, many highlighted the customs of the past as something <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> continuously practiced and enforced even in a new modern era.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to build the}} first stage of the East West Link was criticised as a misuse of public funds <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spent on public transport. Fristacky said the project would deprive Melbourne of billions of dollars that were needed for the construction of the Melbourne airport railway, Doncaster railway line, Rowville line, Melbourne Metro and the Mernda rail extension. Public Transport Users Association president Tony Morton said the project would not solve Melbourne traffic problems and that the 2013 state Budget should have focused on badly needed rail upgrades.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the average}} age of the Bethlehem {{workforce}} was increasing, and the ratio of retirees to workers was rising, meaning that the value created by each worker had to cover a greater portion of pension costs than before. Former top manager Eugene Grace had failed to adequately invest in the company's pension plans during the 1950s. When the company was at its peak, the pension payments <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made were not. As a result, the company encountered difficulty when it faced rising pension costs and diminishing profits.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this ruling, Overland had been denied the {{opportunity}} to cross-examine Mark Safarik, the last prosecution witness and an FBI expert on burglaries, who had testified that the crime scene suggested a staged burglary, as opposed to a real one that had been interrupted in progress. Since the prosecution had told the court at a sidebar prior to Safarik's testimony that they intended to limit their questioning to supporting this theory, Perry similarly limited the defense on cross. However, Tickle argued, since Safarik's own report had considered the other burglary, testimony about <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> allowed.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, a {{continuance}} may {{be granted}} {{in a criminal}} case if there is good reason documents pertinent to the case could not be produced at the time of trial. For example, a continuance should be granted for failure to produce a transcript of testimony given at a previous trial. In general, it is reversible error to proceed with a criminal trial {{in the absence of a}} previous trial transcript, when such contains pertinent information <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> considered in the new trial. In these cases, a continuance is the usual remedy. The trial judge or magistrate is the one who issues the continuance.|$|E

Before that, they had been playing 14 successive ODIs, with their last series being a 2–2 draw in India. Sri Lanka were touring New Zealand immediately before this series, completing a tour <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> played in 2004–05 but was postponed because of the Asian tsunami; they lost three ODIs and won only one. Their last ODI series before that was a 1–6 loss in India.

25|$|On December 26, 1860, {{six days}} after South Carolina seceded from the Union, U.S. Army Major Robert Anderson {{abandoned}} the indefensible Fort Moultrie, spiking its large guns, burning its gun carriages, and taking its smaller cannon with him to be trained on the city. He secretly relocated companies E and H (127 men, 13 of them musicians) of the 1st U.S. Artillery to Fort Sumter on his own initiative, without orders from his superiors. He thought that providing a stronger defense would delay an attack by South Carolina militia. The fort was not yet complete {{at the time and}} fewer than half of the cannons <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> available were in place, due to military downsizing by President James Buchanan.|$|E
25|$|The {{consequences}} {{of reducing the}} costs of production of the 8th edition can be seen today in surviving sets. With only 402 plates, this edition has the fewest since the second edition, and far fewer woodcuts within the text pages were used than in the 7th edition. The maps are all reprinted from the 7th edition, even the ones <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> updated. In the first few volumes, a sheet of onion-skin paper faces each plate, but after volume 6, they were eliminated. To save money, the end pages and covers were not marbled, as this was an expensive process. Finally, the end pages contain advertisements for other products sold by A & C. Black, such as atlases and travel guides, and advertisements encouraging subscribers to continue their enrollments.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet {{had also}} {{emphasised}} speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, cordite {{could not be}} supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions. This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices. Furthermore, the doctrine of {{a high rate of}} fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.|$|E
