25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and <b>turn</b> <b>indicator,</b> and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E
50|$|IMO say's that {{a maximum}} allowed {{deviation}} from the real situation shown by the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> is 0.5 degrees. The rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> has to keep this accuracy until a speed of 30 knots is reached.|$|E
50|$|If a ship is {{equipped}} with an AIS system and a rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator,</b> then the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> must {{be connected to the}} AIS to send the rate of turn to other vessels. This makes it easier for other vessels to interpret the manoeuvre of the ship.|$|E
50|$|Instruments, {{either the}} <b>turn</b> and slip <b>indicator</b> or the <b>turn</b> coordinator, have the {{standard}} rate or half standard rate turn clearly marked. Slower aircraft {{are equipped with}} 2-minute <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> while faster aircraft are often equipped with 4-minute <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> {{have been}} {{integrated}} into the headlamp housing and the tail lamp cluster features a segmented stop and brake light section with the <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> built into a single unit that wraps around the brake light’s bottom side. Also LEDs have been used replacing the conventional bulbs. The split hand grips for the pillion rider serves in providing a different look.|$|R

5000|$|Turn Signal Indicators.Not all {{motorcycles}} have <b>turn</b> signal <b>indicators,</b> or [...] "blinkers." [...] Off road cycles do not. Prior to the 1970s, most motorcycles, even roadsters, {{were not}} fitted with <b>turn</b> signal <b>indicators.</b> All road bikes are now factory fitted with <b>turn</b> signals <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Autumn/Fall of 1978 {{the larger}} {{headlights}} and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> were also {{applied to the}} remaining Kadett Cs.|$|R
25|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirement}} of amber rear <b>turn</b> <b>indicators,</b> the tail light lens assembly for the Australian models included an amber lens.|$|R

25|$|The Z8 used neon {{exterior}} lighting, {{the tail}} lights and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> are powered by neon tubes that offer quicker activation than standard lightbulbs {{and are expected}} to last {{for the life of the}} vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} of {{the rate of the}} <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> is based on a gyroscope with an availability of turning in just one direction. When the ship is steering a straight course, the gyroscope will point in a straight direction and the pointer will point to the zero on the display. When the vessel makes a turn to port, the gyroscope will turn to port side due to inertia and this will be pointed on the display of the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator.</b> The same can be said for the starboard side.|$|E
50|$|The {{requirements}} for the display of the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> are that the zero {{has to be on}} top, the indicator has to go to the left when ship is turning to port side, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|In the US, {{trailer lights}} {{usually have a}} shared light for brake and turn indicators. If such a trailer is to be {{connected}} to a car with separate lamps for <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> and brake a Trailer light converter is needed.|$|E
5000|$|... 1978 brought slight {{cosmetic}} changes: the grille was black; the rear-facing hood vents {{replaced the}} sideways vents; and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> were {{mounted in the}} bumper instead of in the grille. The CVCC engine was now rated at 60 hp (45 kW).|$|R
50|$|Externally {{the car is}} {{very similar}} to the 1500 with {{differences}} including: amber or white (depending on market) front <b>turn</b> <b>indicators</b> shared with white parking lamps, separate stop/tail and turn lamps in the rear, and 1600 badging on the boot and the cowl.|$|R
50|$|The TVS calls {{their design}} {{approach}} for Flame as Deltaedge. This {{is inspired by}} the delta wing of fighter jets and features design cues with a triangular theme, like the arrow shaped headlight. The <b>turn</b> <b>indicators,</b> named Trafficators by TVS is integrated to the fuel tank scoops.|$|R
50|$|The Savvy, {{along with}} other in house {{designed}} Protons such as the Gen-2, Persona, Satria Neo, Waja, Waja Chancellor, and second generation Saga, feature <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> switches placed at the left hand side, unlike models introduced earlier, such as the first generation Saga, Wira and Perdana.|$|E
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> is a {{gyroscopic}} {{instrument that}} {{works on the}} principle of precession. The gyro is mounted in a gimbal. The gyro's rotational axis is in-line with the lateral (pitch) axis of the aircraft, while the gimbal has limited freedom around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|The GZ {{series is}} based {{primarily}} on the GN series, and features air-cooled SOHC single-cylinder engines with chain drive.

30|$|In <b>turn,</b> <b>indicators</b> of {{disability}} insurance generosity explain 75 % of the cross-national variation. We conclude {{that it is}} not health but the country-specific design of early retirement and labor market insitutions, and especially disability insurance rules, which explain the observed cross-country variation in the receipt {{of disability}} benefits.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, a {{radio-controlled}} tractor {{was introduced}} in the all new radio controlled 'SIKU Control' line, which added play value in addition to the regular SIKU Farmer Series vehicles. These have working acceleration, steering, headlights and <b>turn</b> <b>indicators.</b> Other models have since been added to the Control line.|$|R
50|$|The {{scale of}} the rate of <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> has to be linear {{with a minimum of}} 30 degrees per minute, an {{interval}} of 1° from zero to thirty and every 10 degrees have to be marked by a number. The indication for every 5° and 10° has to be longer than the rest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>turn</b> <b>indicator</b> stalk or {{turn signal}} lever is the control lever which {{operates}} the turn signal or indicator {{lights on the}} front, sides and rear of the vehicle. It is usually operated by lifting or lowering the lever, the direction being commensurate with the clockwise or anticlockwise direction in which the steering wheel {{is about to be}} turned.|$|E
50|$|All {{featured}} air-cooled SOHC single-cylinder engines with {{chain drive}} and {{were designed to}} be easy to ride by beginners.
