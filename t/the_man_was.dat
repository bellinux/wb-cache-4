5|$|On 18 December 2006, Suffolk Constabulary {{reported}} that they had arrested a 37-year-old man on suspicion of murdering all five women. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> arrested at 07.20 at a house in Trimley St. Martin near Felixstowe, Suffolk. The detention of the suspect was extended by magistrates by a further period of 24 hours, to the maximum of 96 hours allowed under English law.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, a Lebanese man was {{detained}} by Cyprus police on possible charges relating to terrorism laws for planning attacks against Israeli tourists. According to security officials, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted {{about the man}} due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} Cyprus, and planned to blow up a plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, a 21-year-old {{man from}} Virginia, whose {{computer}} coincidentally did contain pornographic photographs of underaged girls {{with whom he}} had conducted sexualized communications, turned himself in to police after receiving and being deceived by ransomware purporting to be an FBI message accusing him of possessing child pornography.

5|$|In New Orleans, Desha {{assumed the}} name John Parker. Meeting an Ohio native named Thomas Early, he learned <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{carrying}} {{a substantial amount}} of money and {{was on his way to}} Texas to purchase some horses and mules. Desha joined Early, traveling with him on a schooner dubbed the Rights of Man across the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay. In April 1828, Desha and Early disembarked at Rightors Point (now Morgan's Point, Texas), and from there, they traveled to San Felipe de Austin, arriving in early May. After a brief stay, the two set out on horseback toward San Antonio. By the time Desha reached Gonzales, he was traveling alone.|$|E
5|$|In late May, Derrick {{discovered}} a German {{posing as a}} British tank officer and reported him to company headquarters; <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> immediately arrested as a spy. Following a period of heavy fighting in June, the 2/48th Battalion was placed in reserve {{for a few days}} the following month. Promoted to platoon sergeant in September, Derrick—along {{with the rest of his}} battalion—was withdrawn from Tobruk and returned to Palestine aboard HMS Kingston on 22 October. Disembarking at Tel Aviv, they were given three days' leave in the city, before returning for training.|$|E
5|$|On 29 December 2000, British Airways Flight 2069 was {{en route}} from London to Nairobi when a mentally-ill {{passenger}} entered the cockpit and grabbed the controls. As the pilots struggled to remove the intruder, the Boeing 747-400 stalled twice and banked to 94 degrees. Several people on board were injured by the violent manoeuvres, which briefly caused the aircraft to descend at 30,000ft per minute. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> finally restrained {{with the help of}} several passengers, and the co-pilot regained control of the aircraft.

5|$|The U.S. {{official}} had {{stated that}} by 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al-Qaeda courier with the kunya Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (sometimes {{referred to as}} Sheikh Abu Ahmed from Kuwait). One of those claims came from Mohammed al-Qahtani, a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003. At some point during this period, al-Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{who was part of}} the inner circle of al-Qaeda.

5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a hat that they found in a nearby gutter. The police took moulds of the footprints and endeavored to trace the hat, but with no success. However, during routine questioning of local residents, police learned that earlier in {{the afternoon of the}} murder, a man had been seen sitting with a heavily-pregnant young woman on a bench at one end of South Cliff Avenue; the man had also been seen wandering the street while the young woman sat on the bench alone, leading police to suspect that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> assessing the lay of the land.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Arms and <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> not {{immediately}} replicated. Candida, which presented {{a young woman}} making a conventional romantic choice for unconventional reasons, received a single performance in South Shields in 1895; in 1897 a playlet about Napoleon called The Man of Destiny had a single staging at Croydon. In the 1890s Shaw's plays were better known in print than on the West End stage; his biggest success of the decade was in New York in 1897, when Richard Mansfield's production of the historical melodrama The Devil's Disciple earned the author more than £2,000 in royalties.|$|E

5|$|The team {{is called}} {{to the home of}} a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn that not only did someone call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> found alive by the emergency response team well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a heart transplant. During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used to prolong the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research into life restoration.|$|E
5|$|Throughout all this, Lody's {{demeanour}} {{was relatively}} calm {{after the initial}} shock. Cheeseman observed that Lody only appeared uneasy when his notebook was being examined; the inspector later commented that Lody was not the usual class of man he was accustomed to dealing with, but {{admitted that he had}} never met a man under precisely similar circumstances. Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> German.|$|E
5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E

5|$|Before Christmas' escape attempt, Hightower {{delivers}} Lena's {{child in}} the cabin where Brown and Christmas had been staying before the murder, and Byron arranges for Brown/Burch {{to come and see}} her. Brown deserts Lena once again, but Byron follows him and challenges him to a fight. Brown beats the braver, smaller Bunch, then skilfully hops a moving train and disappears. At the end of the story, an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting that the woman had a child and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> not the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Besides his {{collected}} music criticism, Shaw {{has left}} a varied musical legacy, {{not all of it}} of his choosing. Despite his dislike of having his work adapted for the musical theatre ("my plays set themselves to a verbal music of their own") two of his plays were turned into musical comedies: Arms and <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> the basis of The Chocolate Soldier in 1908, with music by Oscar Straus, and Pygmalion was adapted in 1956 as My Fair Lady with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. Although he had a high regard for Elgar, Shaw turned down the composer's request for an opera libretto, but played a major part in persuading the BBC to commission Elgar's Third Symphony, and was the dedicatee of The Severn Suite (1930).|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E

5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large for the space, and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E
5|$|Field {{punishment}} (FP) {{had replaced}} flogging (abolished {{at home in}} 1868 and on active service in 1881, although still used in military prisons until 1907). FP No.1 (in which <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> shackled to fixed object, e.g. a large wheel) was awarded to 60,210 cases, equivalent to one man in 50 (although in practice there were many repeat offenders). FP No.1 could be very unpleasant depending on the weather, was abhorred by some as barbaric, and in some units was ritualised (e.g. by locking {{a man in a}} shed and throwing the handcuffs in with him); there were also cases of Australian troops releasing British troops whom they found tied up, although in other units it was regarded as a necessary sanction for serious offences. FP No.2 meant that a man was shackled but not fixed in place.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, sailors on the USS America (CV-66) {{spent about}} 1,700hours to assist Guantánamo Bay in recovery. The sole {{survivor}} of the sinking boat carrying Cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{held responsible for the}} 44boat deaths and was quickly executed. The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the Straits of Florida. In the United States, the price for lettuce and tomatoes rose due to Inez's crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California. The country's military sent helicopters and planes to join the Mexican Air Force, as well as trucks by land, to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas. In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal. Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.|$|E
