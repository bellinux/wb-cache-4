The addressing of routers and terminals used an own system with an address of 16bits; It would be the equivalent to the well-known IP (Internet Protocol) version 4 (IPv4), still in use in today’s Internet which uses addresses of 32 bits. It is necessary to bear in mind that by year 1978 the IPv4 protocol did not exist yet since the IPv4 version used in Internet did not appear until year 1981, and in fact, did not reach the large public until much later.|$|R

40|$|En este artículo se argumenta que la preocupación por la cuestión social a comienzos del siglo XX, no fue privativa de los católicos, sino que atravesó a toda la clase política, y que, por lo tanto, lo específico del socialcristianismo como propuesta política, no es la sensibilidad social sino la opción por el corporativismo. Se sostiene que el corporativismo socialcristiano, se puede remontar tan atrás como el ultramontanismo conservador; que se fortalece con las encíclicas papales Rerum Novarumy Quadragessimo Anno, que su presencia se puede seguir en intelectuales y políticos católicos desde los años 30 hasta {{incluso los}} años 60; y que se puede apreciar su impronta en las "Bases de la Institucionalidad" capítulo inicial que enmarca a la Constitución de 1980. Por último, se propone que este recorrido histórico puede ser útil para reflexionar sobre la relación Iglesia y política. In this article the author argües that {{concern about the}} social {{question}} {{at the beginning of}} the 20 th century was not exclusively a concern for Catholics, but spread throughout the entire political class. Therefore, the author further asserts that the specific thing about Social Christianity as a political proposal isn't its social sensitivity but, rather, its option for corporativism. Social Christian corporativism, it is proposed, can trace its origins as far back as conservative ultramontanism, which was backed by the papal encyclicals Rerum Novarum and Quadragessimo Anno. Its presence continued to be perceived in Catholic intellectuals and politicians from the 1930 s through to the 1960 s. Its impact can be appreciated in the first chapter that <b>trames</b> the 1980 (Chilean) Constitution, Bases de la Institucional/dad ("Foundations of Institutionality").

40|$|Treadmill {{training}} with partial body weight support is a promising new therapy in gait rehabilitation of hemiparetic subjects. As a task-specific training it enables the repetitive practice of complex gait cycles {{at a very}} early stage. Initially two or even three therapists assist the movement so that the subjects train gait not only repeti-tively but also in a correct manner. Several controlled studies have documented its effectiveness in gait rehabilitation of acute and chronic stroke patients and have shown that hemiparetic patients walked in a more dynamic, symmetric, and less spastic fash-ion on the treadmill with body weight support as compared with ground-level walk-ing. Nevertheless, to meet the criteria of evidence-based medicine, further compara-tive studies will be needed, supplemented by research in basic neurophysiology to explain its effects and technology to alleviate the strenuous effort of therapists during the training. Possible solutions are functional electrical stimulation (FES) in combi-nation with treadmill training and a mechanized gait trainer. Treadmill <b>traming</b> with partial body weight support (BWS) is a promising new therapy in gait rehabilitation of hemiparetic patients (1) following first reports in the treatment of paraparetic subjects (2 - 5). This task-specific training (6) enables hemiparetic subjects to practice complex gait cycles repetitively, un-like conventional treatment m which tone-inhibiting maneuvers and gait preparatory tasks during sittmg and standing dommate. Patients wear a modified parachute harness to sub-stitute for deficient equilibrium reflexes and the moving belt enforces complex stepping movements. A proportion of their body weight is supported by the harness, so that the subjects can carry their remaming body weight ade-quately, (i. e., without knee collapse and/or excessive knee flexion during the smgle stance period of the affected lower limb) (1).

40|$|The New South Wales Department of Education and <b>Traming</b> (DET) is a {{large and}} complex {{education}} authority employing some 50, 000 teachers in school education and {{is responsible for the}} education of approximately 750, 000 students of school age. This investigation examined the role of teachers in educational policy-making and supported the contention that primary and secondary school teachers, as a large professional group within the New South Wales DET, did not have a significant role in educational policy decision-making. It was also established that little research effort had been directed towards the definition and analysis of the proper role of these teachers in the policy process. The enquiry emphasised methodological and theoretical issues {{in the development of the}} research tools necessary to imdertake this investigation. These tools were then applied throughout the investigation stage of the research and in proposing appropriate solutions to the problems identified. The methodology developed and applied synthesised aspects of literature review methods (Cooper, 1988; Bruce, 1994; Hehnericks et al, 1991) and interdisciplinary research methods (Klein, 1990; Bechtell, 1986) in order to construct a methodology suitable for application to the research questions. Other aspects of policy research and policy studies (Majchrzak, 1984; Ham and Hill, 1984; Fasano, 1993) also guide the development and application of the methodology. Focus group methodology was applied in order to test the theoretical findings against the expressed opinions of teachers. The results of this study support the contention that school teachers should establish a more prominent role in policy decision-making in public education in NSW. In addition, the research suggested a solution in the form of a policy curriculum developed to improve teacher knowledge of the policy process and enhance access by teachers to policy-making. The significance of this enquiry is in making a contribution to the field of policy studies through the development of methodology and in the analysis of the social problem posed by the lack of teacher involvement in policy decision-making in public school education in NSW...|$|R
40|$|The trinity of cost scales that reward activity, fear {{of being}} sued for {{negligence}} and an adversary based litigation process drive lawyers to leave no stone unturned in litigation {{at a cost to}} the parties that is beyond their ability to pay and which often overwhehns the amount of the actual dispute. 2 ̆ 2 Every system contains a percentage of errors; and if by slightly increasing the percentage of error we can substantially reduce the percentage of cost it is only the idealist who will revolt. 2 ̆ 2 The idealists have reason to be cautious. A cheap efficient system may contain the seeds of a different set of problems. The German experience suggests that too great an efficiency coupled with certain and ftill cost recovery can lead to excessive litigation. This may not increase access to justice by the needy but rather may fiirther empower the powerful. This causes a substantial expense to the community both in publicly funded judicial expenses which are much higher per capita than is the norm in Europe and in legal resources generally. The United States of America has moved towards judicial case management and the promotion of alternatives to adjudication but there remains a strong thread in the literature of that country in defence of the adversary trial process. The judicial process as we know it is best at dispute resolution by trial. It is open, has safeguards and is perceived by litigants as carefiil, unbiased and dignified. It generates a body of decided cases to guide future disputants. It is said that its procedures express our value structure and once engaged it ensures that society 2 ̆ 7 s interests are protected in any resolution of the dispute. If litigants are forced to resolve disputes by methods outside that process (mediation and other alternative dispute resolution- 2 ̆ 7 ADR 2 ̆ 7) that involves a dilution of the protection that the trial process offers and calls into question the very need to have the judiciary.

40|$|The {{forest is}} not a space natural as we thought of {{it for a long}} time. By using all the {{services}} which offers him the forest, the man influences the dynamics of the forest spaces. Our objective is to analyse, in the long time, the relations between landscapes and societies, to reveal the weight of the silvicultural inheritances in the contemporary sylvo-systems, to identify the breaks and the continuities of the landscape which marked out the forest history of the Avesnois, to end what we know today. This research was led within the framework of a Cifre contract participating in the Plan Forest Regional – the objectif of which is to double the surface afforested on the whole territory- and in the Regional Plan of Ecological Coherence Green and blue Wefts. This Cifre contract in Human sciences and more particularly in History being rare, it was necessary to build an approach in the crossroads of the fundamental approach and the applied approach. Because not only {{it was a question of}} analyzing the modalities of the human actions and their impacts on the forest spaces but it was more particularly necessary to answer a demand of the actors of the current forest world, conditioning certain scientific problems. The main part in the understanding of the interactions between the man and its environnement, the crossing of the spatiotemporal scales establishes the heart of this research. The taking into consideration of the importance of the crossings of the scales of analyse, implying a crossing of sources of varied nature, led to a reflection on tools and methods to use to answer the initial questionings. While composing with the limits of the sources which he studies, the historian offers a backward movement on the spatiotemporal processes which made the forest landscape of today. This distance is necessary to bring to a successful conclusion the current environmental policies : to protect a landscape, its biodiversity, it is inevitable to resort to the past. La forêt n’est pas un espace naturel comme nous l’avons longtemps pensé. En utilisant l’ensemble des services que lui offre la forêt, l’homme influence la dynamique des espaces forestiers. L’objectif de cette thèse, s’inscrivant dans le champ de l’histoire de l’environnement, est d’analyser, dans le temps long, les interrelations entre paysages et sociétés riveraines, d’identifier les ruptures et continuités paysagères qui ont jalonné l’histoire forestière de l’Avesnois pour aboutir à ce que nous connaissons aujourd’hui. Cette recherche a été menée dans le cadre d’un contrat Cifre participant au Plan Forêt Régional - dont l’objectif est de doubler la superficie boisée sur l’ensemble du territoire d’ici une vingtaine d’années- et au Schéma Régional de Cohérence Ecologique <b>Trames</b> Vertes et Bleues. Ce dispositif en Sciences humaines et plus particulièrement en Histoire étant rare, il a fallu construire une démarche au carrefour de la démarche fondamentale et la démarche appliquée. Car non seulement il s’agissait d’analyser les modalités des actions humaines et leurs impacts sur les espaces forestiers mais il fallait plus particulièrement répondre à une demande des acteurs du monde forestier actuel conditionnant ainsi certaines problématiques scientifiques. Essentiel à la compréhension des interactions entre l’homme et son milieu, l’emboîtement des échelles spatio-temporelles constitue le cœur de cette recherche. La prise en considération de l’importance des emboîtements des échelles d’analyses, impliquant un croisement de sources de nature variée, ont conduit à une réflexion sur les outils et les méthodes à employer pour répondre aux questionnements initiaux. Tout en composant avec les limites des sources qu’il étudie, l’historien offre un recul sur les processus spatio-temporels qui ont fabriqué le paysage forestier d’aujourd’hui. Cette distanciation est nécessaire pour mener à bien les politiques environnementales actuelles : préserver un paysage, sa biodiversité doit nécessairement interroger le temps...|$|R
