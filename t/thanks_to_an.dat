40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Bayesian technique aimed at classifying signals without prior training (clustering). The approach consists of modelling the observed signals, known {{only through a}} finite set of samples corrupted by noise, as Gaussian processes.

In order to estimate the number of clusters, we assume a priori a countably infinite number of clusters, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Dirichlet process model over the Gaussian processes parameters.
