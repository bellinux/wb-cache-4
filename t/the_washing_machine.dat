5|$|In Goodland, Florida, {{during a}} fierce hurricane, Sara Shipley and her son, Evan, desperately try to flip <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> but {{fail to do}} so as tentacles ensnare them. After {{receiving}} a call, FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive {{at the home of}} retired FBI agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin), the first to look into the X-Files. He tells them about the Shipley family and how Sara Shipley called him in a panic after her husband was attacked by something in the bathroom with tentacles. Scully is dubious about this but believes that something has indeed happened to the Shipley family during this hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine,</b> Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and it turns out to be just enough to cover the damage to <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

25|$|After Kenneth Martin {{failed to}} report to his job at an {{electric}} company on December 9, 1958, the family was officially reported missing. Police investigated their residence for any signs of foul play. The house had been left undisturbed; a load of laundry was still in <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine,</b> and dishes from the previous day were left on a drying rack in the kitchen; {{there was also a}} substantial amount of money in the Martins' bank accounts.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the house, {{there are}} {{numerous}} love quotes written by Oscar Wilde, William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In {{the dining room and}} kitchen, the furniture are in bright red and yellow colors, and logs stacked against each other fill up a wall. The walkway to the Head of Household room evokes a giant library. The Head of Household room is an exotic island oasis. The headboard is made from a surfboard, there are Hula girl table lamps, rattan carpet and Polynesian knickknacks. The boat bedroom features shelves and chests designed to resemble small rowboats with rowboat shaped beds. Two large beds made of actual unfinished tree branches with pink bedspreads fill another room. The living room features a giant green semi-circular sofa, and a stone wall fireplace. A red colored room connected directly to the living room by a short hallway, with no doors, has a pair of pullout couches rather than actual beds. New this season is a Spa room complete with a massage table, two-person sauna and lounge. The spa room would be featured in numerous subsequent seasons. Outside, there is a hot tub and pool, a billiards table and lounge area. The lounge area features a fire pit and heated lamps. Along with work-out equipment, there are lawn chairs to lay out in the sun. The outside also includes <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> and clothes dryer, both of which are covered overhead.|$|E

It reduces the system cost, area, power consumption and also reduces the assembly and testing costs. It avoids the effects of components no longer being available. It gives design flexibility which helps in speed optimizations. ASIC requires fewer component hence reduces service/maintenance costs. It is more reliable...|$|R

500|$|The cast {{considered}} the episode {{a turning point}} for the show. As a method actor, Richards insisted on dumping a real bag of cement into <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> used on set, so that the proper physical reactions to such a heavy object would be present. Richards stated that at that point, [...] "rather than talking funny, I wanted to do funny". During the first take of the scene, Richards fell through a door, and it had to be filmed again. [...] "The Revenge" [...] is also the first episode in which the George and Elaine characters collaborate. Louis-Dreyfus later stated that she and Alexander immediately had [...] "some sort of shorthand with one another comedically, and [...] really relished that." ...|$|E
500|$|Adding to Sinclair's problems, {{production}} of the C5 had to be halted for three weeks after numerous customers reported that the plastic moulding attached to the gearbox was impairing {{the performance of their}} vehicles. 100 Hoover workers were shifted from the C5 production line to work on replacing the faulty mouldings on returned vehicles. Barrie Wills admitted that Sinclair was also taking the opportunity to [...] "adjust stocks" [...] {{in the light of the}} C5's poor sales. When production resumed a month later it was at only 10% of the previous level, with 90 of the workers being transferred back to <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine</b> production lines. Only 100 C5s were now being produced a week, down from the original 1,000. Over 3,000 unsold C5s were piled up in storage at the Hoover factory, with additional unsold stock in 500 retail outlets nationwide.|$|E
500|$|Paramedics {{responding}} to the emergency call [...] "found the three residents’ calm behavior unusual; none was screaming or even helping direct the paramedics." [...] According to Ward's attorney, detectives who interrogated the three housemates {{on the night of}} the murder informed them that they were the main suspects in the case, and asked many sexually charged, accusatory questions. Three days after the murder, the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit of the D.C. police were called in, but unit head Sgt. Brett Parson declined to discuss the unit's involvement. Within two weeks of the murder, police publicly alleged that the crime scene had been tampered with. Investigators spent more than three weeks examining the townhouse in detail, [...] "removing flooring, pieces of walls, a chunk of staircase, <b>the</b> <b>washing</b> <b>machine,</b> even sink traps." [...] Allegations that the area around Wone's body had been cleaned were revealed in an affidavit in support of a search warrant for homeowner Joseph Price's offices at the D.C. law firm of Arent Fox.|$|E
