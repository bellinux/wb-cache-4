It has two planets that are around 12 and 13.5 times as massive as the Earth with periods of just under 12 and 34 days respectively.|$|E

25|$|Curiously, Stirling has {{set this}} novel in 1998 placing us firmly within {{the realms of}} {{alternative}} history. The reason {{for the use of}} this device is not clear, as it doesn't really impact upon the progress of the narrative. Perhaps the author sought after a sense of immediacy garnered by making the events take place in our past rather <b>than</b> <b>our</b> future. Perhaps he sought to avoid the work being viewed as a prediction of things to come – an obvious trap for many speculative works.|$|E

25|$|In All-Star Superman, {{an entire}} race of Bizarros appear, who are spawned {{wholesale}} from a cube-shaped planet which originally {{belongs in the}} Underverse, an alternative universe on a different gravitonic plane <b>than</b> <b>our</b> own. Originally opaque, shapeless beings, they take on skewed characteristics of people they encounter. This planet also produced {{what might be the}} ultimate Bizarro - Zibarro, a sort of Bizarro Bizarro who is, by normal standards, sane - and therefore feared and reviled by his own people, as he is more closely related to Superman than he is to Bizzaro.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May 2016, {{researchers}} at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) {{announced that they}} had found various scenarios that allow the exoplanet to be habitable. They tested several simulations based on Kepler-62f having an atmosphere that ranges in thickness from the same as Earth’s {{all the way up}} to 12 times thicker <b>than</b> <b>our</b> planet’s, various concentrations of carbon dioxide in its atmosphere, ranging from the same amount as is in the Earth’s atmosphere up to 2,500 times that level and several different possible configurations for its orbital path.|$|E
25|$|Only about 50° of {{the martian}} phase curve can be {{observed}} from Earth because it orbits farther from the Sun <b>than</b> <b>our</b> planet. There is an opposition surge but it is less pronounced than that of Mercury. The rotation of bright and dark surface markings across its disk and variability of its atmospheric state (including its dust storms) superimpose variations on the phase curve. R. Schmude obtained many of the Mars brightness measurements used in a comprehensive phase curve analysis performed by A. Mallama.|$|E

25|$|Wisdom teeth become {{impacted}} {{when there}} is not enough room in the jaws to allow for all of the teeth to erupt into the mouth. Because the wisdom teeth are the last to erupt, due to insufficient room in the jaws to accommodate more teeth, the wisdom teeth become stuck in the jaws, i.e., impacted. There is a genetic predisposition to tooth impaction. Genetics plays an important, albeit unpredictable role in dictating jaw and tooth size and tooth eruption potential of the teeth. Some also believe that there is an evolutionary decrease in jaw size due to softer modern diets that are more refined and less coarse <b>than</b> <b>our</b> ancestors'.|$|E
25|$|Three {{widespread}} {{units are}} recognized within the Victoria quadrangle. These are, from oldest to youngest, intercrater plains material, intermediate plains material, and smooth plains material. In addition, central peak, floor, rim, and ejecta materials {{related to the}} numerous craters and basins larger than about 20km in diameter are mapped. The simplicity of the stratigraphic scheme is {{at least in part}} due to deficiencies in the data base; the history of plains formation almost certainly is more complex <b>than</b> <b>our</b> threefold division indicates, but {{we were not able to}} define consistent criteria of albedo, texture, and cratering for more than three plains units because of the highly variable quality of available pictures.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered {{the lives of our}} sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority <b>than</b> <b>our</b> national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step toward}} achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail.
