It was novel for its time, delivering up to 240 speech channels and 4 E1/T1 <b>trunk</b> <b>interfaces</b> on a single card {{at a time when the}} standard was 24 to 30 channels.

50|$|The {{signaling}} unit and trunk circuit communicate their status over the E and M leads, {{using a combination}} of Battery and Earth (also known as Ground). The Battery signal used in the standard is nominally −48VDC. All E&M installations require that the +ve terminal of the Battery is connected to a shared reliable Earth. The maximum distance between the Signaling Unit and the <b>Trunk</b> <b>interface</b> is determined by the resistance of the wire, but will normally be less than 100m for adequate noise immunity.|$|R
50|$|Used {{to build}} call center {{equipment}} using regular PCs, MVIP provides a second communications bus within the computer that can multiplex up to 256 full-duplex voice channels from one voice card to another. Digital voice, fax and video is bussed over a ribbon cable connected {{at the top}} of each ISA or PCI card. MVIP products make a PC perform like a small-scale PBX. The protocol accommodated for a variety of expansion boards, including <b>trunk</b> <b>interfaces</b> (usually T1 or ISDN), voice processing boards equipment speech recognition or fax processing. Each board could optionally provide a switch that could interconnect voice channels on the bus, allowing for a flexible routing of calls within the MVIP bus.|$|R

So an optical method was developed in this study to measure strain in lumbar belt and <b>trunk</b> <b>interface</b> and to derive a pressure estimation. Optical method consisted of coupling fringe projection and digital image correlation (DIC). Measurement has been carried out on the right side of a manikin wearing a lumbar belt. Average strain is 0. 2 and average pressure is 1 kPa. Continuation of this study will be comparison of strain and pressure in different areas of lumbar belt (left side, front and back) and comparison of different lumbar belts. Results will be used in a finite elements model to determine lumbar belt impact in intern body. In long term, this kind of study will be done on human...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Human {{operation}} of continuum “continuousbackbone” manipulators remains difficult, because {{of both the}} complex kinematics of these manipulators {{and the need to}} coordinate their many degrees of freedom. We present a novel synergy-based approach for operator interfaces, by introducing a series of octopus-arm inspired grasp-synergies. These graspsynergies automatically coordinate the degrees of freedom of the continuum manipulator, allowing an operator to perform kinematically complex grasping motions through simple and intuitive joystick inputs. This effectively reduces the complexity of operation and allows the operator to devote more of his attention to higher-level concerns (e. g. goal, environment). We demonstrate the grasp-synergies interface design in both simulation and hardware using the nine degree of freedom Octarm continuum manipulator.

Upon receipt of a release message from the calling ISC, the releasing end DCME shall initiate the release of the unrestricted 64 kbit/s forward connection, and the opposite end DCME shall automatically initiate the release of the unrestricted 64 kbit/s return connection. Upon completion of this process, a positive release acknowledgement message shall be returned to the releasing ISC. Failure to complete the release shall be reported to the releasing ISC using the out-of-service message and the DCME shall put the trunk in a blocked condition. After manual or automatic removal of any failure condition, the DCME shall put the trunk in an idle condition and send a back-in-service message to the ISC. A calling end DCME shall detect a release initiated by the opposite end (non-controlling) ISC by the reception of a disconnect message in the control channel. This abnormal release shall be recognized as a dual seizure situation being resolved between the ISCs. The detecting DCME shall first complete the release normally and immediately attempt to re-establish the released 64 kbit/s unrestricted duplex connection between the DCMEs. 4. 10 Trunk channel idle noise level detection and injection The DCME transmit unit shall measure the trunk channel idle noise level and forward this information to the corresponding DCME receive unit, which shall insert the appropriate idle level noise within the receive output speech channel during silent intervals following disconection of the bearer channel.
