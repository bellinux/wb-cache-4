500|$|When we now {{heard many}} {{disputes}} about the inheritance, I brought King Æthelwulf's will to our assembly at Langandene, {{and it was}} read before all the councillors of the West Saxons. When it had been read, I urged them all for love of me– and gave them my pledge that I would never bear a grudge against {{any one of them}} because they declared what was right– that none of them would hesitate, either for love or fear of me, to expound the common law, lest any man should say that I had treated my young kinsmen wrongfully, the older or the younger. And <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> pronounced what was right, and said that they could not conceive any juster title, nor could they find one in the will. [...] "Now everything has come into your possession, and you may bequeath it or give it into the hand of kinsman or stranger, whichever you prefer." ...|$|E
500|$|Like {{the whole}} town, the school Christmas pageant is {{stripped}} of all symbols of Christmas, {{and the children}} instead present a minimalist song and dance created by composer Philip Glass. The parents, astounded by how awful the pageant has turned out, begin blaming one another for destroying Christmas and a fight breaks out. When Chef finds out where Kyle is, he reveals to the children that Mr. Hankey does actually exist. When all the children start believing, Mr. Hankey finally reveals himself to everyone and scolds them for losing sight {{of the good things}} of Christmas and focusing on the bad. The townspeople release Kyle from the asylum and apologize, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> sing Christmas songs and watch Mr. Hankey fly away with Santa Claus. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle feel that something is still missing. [...] "THE END" [...] then appears, and Kenny is excited and relieved that he has survived the entire episode without getting killed in spite of being involved in dangerous and life-threatening situations throughout.|$|E
500|$|... "Goodbye, Toby" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta. Lieberstein is also the actor who plays Toby Flenderson. It took Lieberstein and Celotta {{four or five days}} to write this episode. Writer Anthony Farrell said that the idea for Dunder Mifflin Infinity to fail was {{inspired}} by the days that he was an administrative assistant for Countrywide Home Loans. Farrell recalled watching the company try new online initiatives and seeing them all be unsuccessful. The talking head interview wherein Michael compares Holly to a baker came after what the writers call [...] "blitzes", in which all the writers write a talking head on a specific topic, such as [...] "Michael's feelings to Holly". <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> read all of them out loud and see which one gets the biggest reaction. The YouTube video of Ryan being arrested was set on a private account. After [...] "Goodbye, Toby" [...] aired, the video was released to the public. When writing the story for the episode, the show originally planned on having Dwight put a badger in Holly's car, but after finding out that it was difficult to get a badger, it was switched to a raccoon. The script also called for the raccoon to attack Meredith, but that was decided against for safety reasons. During one of the takes wherein Michael is singing his parody songs, Carell grabbed a guitar and played an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo, but that scene was cut because it did not match Michael's character. After filming, the editors had about 72 minutes of material that they needed to cut down into 40 minutes.|$|E

500|$|In {{a parody}} of Bram Stoker's Dracula, after a news story about several vampire attacks, Lisa begins to suspect that Mr. Burns is a vampire, {{but the rest of}} the family dismisses her concerns. The family is invited to Mr. Burns' castle in Pennsylvania, where Bart and Lisa {{discover}} a secret staircase descending to an eerie basement filled with coffins. As they investigate, vampires emerge from the coffins and encircle them. Lisa escapes, but Bart activates the [...] "Super Fun Happy Slide", causing him to be captured and get bitten by Mr. Burns. Bart returns to the table with Mr. Burns, who tells him to take a seat. Bart is very pale and is behaving oddly, but these factors get little attention by the family. Later that night, Lisa is awakened by a now undead Bart and his vampire friends. When Bart is about to bite Lisa, Homer and Marge interrupt and discover that Bart is a vampire. Lisa claims that the only way to restore him is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns. The family returns to Mr. Burns' mansion, where Homer drives a stake through Mr. Burns' heart. Unfortunately, despite Mr. Burns' death, Bart still remains a vampire. To make things worse, Lisa discovers that everyone in the Simpson family except for herself is a vampire, and that the true head vampire is inexplicably Marge, not Mr. Burns. With this revelation, the whole entire family swoops in on Lisa, only to stop and wish everyone a happy Halloween. <b>Then,</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> harmonize [...] "Hark the Herald Angels Sing", parodying A Charlie Brown Christmas.|$|E
2500|$|A similar problem faces {{honeybee}} swarms. They {{have to find}} a new home, and {{the many}} scouts and wider participants have to reach consensus about which of perhaps several candidate homes to fly to. And <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> have to fly there, with their queen. The bees approach works reliably, but when researchers are so unkind as to offer two hives, equally attractive by all the criteria bees apply, catastrophe ensues, the swarm breaks up, and all the bees die.|$|E

At the concert, the Baudelaire orphans decide that {{they will go to}} Vice Principal Nero's office the next day to drop hints about Genghis, but they are thwarted by [...] "Coach Genghis", as he is present in the office.|$|E

2500|$|On August 1, 1943, Litvyak did {{not come}} back to her base at Krasnyy Luch. It was her fourth sortie of the day, escorting a flight of Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmoviks. As the Soviets were {{returning}} to base near Orel, a pair of Bf 109 fighters dived on Litvyak while she was attacking {{a large group of}} German bombers. Soviet pilot Ivan Borisenko recalled: “Lily just didn’t see the Messerschmitt 109s flying cover for the German bombers. A pair of them dived on her and when she did see them she turned to meet them. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> disappeared behind a cloud.” Borisenko, involved in the dogfight, saw her a last time, through a gap in the clouds, her Yak-1 pouring smoke and pursued by as many as eight Bf 109s.|$|E
2500|$|... "We started class, {{and in the}} Groundlings curriculum, one of {{the first}} {{exercises}} you do is the cliched 'trust' game. I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony {{consisted of two}} parts. The Orthodox service took place first and was performed by the Metropolitans of St Petersburg, Moscow, and Kiev in the Imperial Chapel. Grand Dukes Vladimir, Alexis, and Sergei and the groom's brother Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, relieved each other taking turns holding the golden crowns {{over the head of}} the bride and groom. Maria wore a glittering coronet and a mantle of crimson velvet trimmed with ermine and a sprig of myrtle, specially sent by Queen Victoria. Alfred wore the uniform of the Royal Navy. The Tsar looked pale throughout the entire ceremony and said afterwards: [...] "It is for her happiness, but the light of my life has gone out." [...] After this, the bride and groom each drank thrice from a goblet of wine. The service concluded with the couple joining hands under the priest’s stole. <b>Then</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> proceeded to the Alexander Hall, where Arthur Stanley, Dean of Westminster, made Prince Alfred and Maria Alexandrovna man and wife according to the rites of the Church of England.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was built}} all of timber, with the piles being driven {{straight}} into the sea bed; it was [...] "considered {{at the time the}} best specimen of pile-driving", and described as a [...] "pier and breakwater". There was curved stone balustrading at the entrance, taken from old London Bridge which was demolished in 1831. [...] A sail trolley vehicle running on tracks, powered by sail and foot and nicknamed Neptune's Car, ran the length of the pier from 13 June 1833, carrying passengers and baggage. When wind was inadequate as commonly happened, pier employees physically pushed the trolley. The pier's length was defined by the one-fathom draught of the paddle steamers and the shallow two-fathom depth of the sea even three quarters of a mile offshore at high tide. It was followed in 1861 by the railway station, and thus began the town's growth into a holiday resort. However, because the wooden piles were never protected by copper sheathing they suffered from shipworm. By 1850, many piles had been replaced with iron ones, or with wooden ones [...] "prepared by Mr Payne's process" [...] against shipworm, but as a whole they showed irreversible deterioration from 1860 onwards. Pier dues were considered expensive at 1s 6d. Subsequently, the first Herne Bay Pier Company failed due to competition between paddle steamers and the new railway which was opened on 13 July 1861, because previously most visitors arrived by steamer, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> arrived by rail. The first pier was taken down in 1870 to 1871, long after the paddle steamers stopped coming in 1862.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{explained}} {{the process by}} which one was found to be a rebellious elder within the meaning of [...] Three courts of law sat in Jerusalem: one {{at the entrance to the}} Temple Mount, a second at the door of the Temple Court, and the third, the Great Sanhedrin, in the Hall of Hewn Stones in the Temple Court. The dissenting elder and the other members of the local court with whom the elder disputed went to the court at the entrance to the Temple Mount, and the elder stated what the elder and the elder's colleagues expounded. If the first court had heard a ruling on the matter, then the court stated it. If not, the litigants and the judges went to the second court, at the entrance of the Temple Court, and the elder once again declared what the elder and the elder's colleagues expounded. If this second court had heard a ruling on the matter, then this court stated it. If not, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> proceeded to the Great Sanhedrin at the Hall of Hewn Stones, which issued instruction to all Israel, for [...] said that [...] "they shall declare to you from that place that the Lord shall choose," [...] meaning the Temple. If the elder then returned to the elder's town and issued a decision contrary to what the Great Sanhedrin had instructed, then the elder was guilty of acting [...] "presumptuously" [...] within the meaning of [...] But if one of the elder's disciples issued a decision opposed to the Great Sanhedrin, the disciple was exempt from judgment, for the very stringency that kept the disciple from having yet been ordained served as a source of leniency to prevent the disciple from being found to be a rebellious elder..
