50|$|A {{central office}} might only have {{physical}} plant resources to handle ca. 8% of allocated telephone numbers, based on historical call traffic averages. A choke exchange has trunk facilities to other exchanges designed {{in a manner}} that high call volume is handled through the choke connection rather than overwhelming the rest of the local telephone network. Other local exchanges have a limited number of direct trunks (junctions) to the choke exchange, which may only serve one or more customers, such as a radio station contest line, which may experience many simultaneous calls. But instead of calls being overflowed to main or tandem routes shared with other calls, the unsuccessful callers receive a reorder tone from their local or tandem exchange. If the calls were overflowed to the <b>tandem</b> <b>route,</b> the caller would receive a busy tone from the exchange serving the radio station, and the sudden peak would disrupt calls between other customers.|$|E

5000|$|By the mid-1920s, {{a revised}} manual system where [...] "local" [...] toll {{operators}} connected <b>tandem</b> <b>routes</b> (a process formally called Combined Line and Recording) {{as needed to}} complete telephone calls, reduced the process {{to an average of}} two minutes, but still meant that some complex routing might interconnect as many as sixteen points. As long distance services grew in the Contiguous Continental US (48 states) and Canada, the amount of overhead equipment and people required to determine and establish Rates and Routes became excessive. As technology improved, network design included consideration of more automated and defined procedures. Thus, beginning with a switch installed in Philadelphia PA in 1943, AT&T began to automate the system, and establish a new switch hierarchy, which lasted until the breakup of AT&T in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{major highway}} is U.S. Route 192 running in <b>tandem</b> with U.S. <b>Route</b> 441 east and west. This six-lane road is intersected by avenues running north and south. Many have names of US states in no {{particular}} order.|$|R
50|$|Race {{records are}} {{maintained}} in several categories, {{and do not}} distinguish between times set during the official annual race, or in individual time trials set at any time. Categories include male, female and <b>tandem.</b> As the <b>route</b> changes fairly frequently, the overall length and difficulty can vary, meaning records from one year cannot be exactly compared.|$|R
5000|$|These {{extensions}} {{transformed a}} cross-shaped network, centred on Homme de Fer, into a lattice shape, with two lines running in <b>tandem</b> along key <b>routes</b> {{in the city}} centre. This enabled more transfers and more direct links between stations, along with greater frequency in the city centre. [...] This scheme is unique in France, but similar to systems in Switzerland and Germany.|$|R
50|$|As the {{translation}} facility incorporated {{was similar to}} the register in common control systems, the Director system incorporates two features of the Panel system, which was introduced in large American cities, and which were required regardless of the type of exchange system for these large areas which would have a mixture of manual and automatic exchanges for some years. Customer stations were assigned seven-digit numbers, with the first three digits spelling out the local exchange name; this expedited call handling particularly to and from manual exchanges. Direct or <b>tandem</b> junction <b>routes</b> to other exchanges could be allocated as required, with routing independent of the telephone number and able to be altered at any time to cater for traffic growth or the introduction of new local or tandem exchanges.|$|R
40|$|Podophyllotoxin {{derivatives}} like etoposide 7 a, etophos 7 b, and teniposide 7 c {{are used}} clinically as potent chemotherapeutic agents {{for a variety}} of tumors including small cell lung carcinoma, testicular cancer, and malignant lymphoma. These compounds derived from a series of modifications which converted podophyllotoxin la from an entity that interacted with tubulin and blocks mitosis to one that induced a block in late S or early G 2 by interacting with topoisomerase II. Synthetic studies on podophyllotoxin derivatives can be divided in four general approaches (the oxo-ester route, the dihydroxy acid <b>route,</b> the <b>tandem</b> conjugate addition <b>route</b> and the Diels-Alder route). Albeit a number of synthetic sequences afforded products with excellent enantiopurities, the low overall yields still disqualify synthesis as an alternative for naturally produced materials. An alternative route based on the enzyme-catalyzed cyclization of synthetic intermediates to analogues of the podophyllotoxin family is being explored. Synthetic dibenzylbutanolides, which were revealed by biosynthetic studies to be the precursors of aryltetralin lignans, have been treated with enzymes derived from cell cultures of Podophyllum peltatum, Catharanthus roseus, Nicotiana sylvestris and Cassia didymobotrya. The ciclyzation process afforded however compounds with a different stereochemistry in the C ring. The obtainment of a novel compound with a benzylidenebenzylbutirolactone structure still leaves considerable scope for exploring biotransformations in order to obtain podophyllotoxin analogues via a combination of synthetic chemistry and biotechnological methods...|$|R
