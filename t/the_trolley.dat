5|$|There was a {{transfer}} from the Coney Island Terminal to the Norton's Point Trolley to Sea Gate, via an elevated footbridge across Stillwell Avenue to the elevated trolley station. In 1948, <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> was discontinued because it duplicated another trolley along a similar route (namely the McDonald Avenue Line). <b>The</b> <b>trolley</b> ramp spanning Stillwell Avenue and West 15th Street was torn down around this time.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} became {{increasingly}} congested further {{means of transportation}} were sought, eventually leading to horse-drawn trolleys. These, in turn, were replaced by electric trolleys that traveled down the main streets of downtown Newark, including Broad Street, and up Market Street near the courthouse <b>The</b> <b>trolley</b> cars {{did not last long}} as the personal motor vehicle quickly gained popularity and slowly made <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> system seem like a burden.|$|E

5|$|Winnipeg has had {{public transit}} since 1882, {{starting}} with horse-drawn streetcars. They {{were replaced by}} electric trolley cars. <b>The</b> <b>trolley</b> cars ran from 1892 to 1955, supplemented by motor buses after 1918, and electric trolleybuses from 1938 to 1970. Winnipeg Transit now runs diesel buses on its routes.|$|E
5|$|The cheese {{course was}} {{served by a}} Maître d'hôtel on a trolley. White's rules {{dictated}} that after lunch, the cheese was reviewed {{to ensure that a}} sufficient serving was left to present for the dinner seatings. One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn {{against the wall of the}} kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall for the rest of the service.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Galveston Island <b>Trolley</b> is a {{heritage}} streetcar in Galveston, Texas, United States. As of late 2006, the total network length was 6.8 miles (10.9 km) with 22 stations. <b>The</b> Galveston Island <b>Trolley</b> is operated by Island Transit. Operation {{has been suspended}} since September 2008 due to heavy damage from Hurricane Ike. Subsequently the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Transit Authority have agreed to fund repairs. [...] In January 2017 a contract was approved to restore three of <b>the</b> <b>trolleys</b> {{at a cost of}} $3.8M. <b>The</b> <b>trolleys</b> are expected to be completed in 2018.|$|R
5|$|The {{scientist}} Tolley {{aimed to}} establish the manpower needed to haul the vessels over the isthmus ridge. Assuming that a trireme soaked with water weighed 38 tons including its trolley, and that a man can exert a force of 300N {{over an extended period}} of time, the pulling teams—depending on the slope and the surface of the cart track—must have numbered between 112 and 142 people, with a combined exertion of force of 33 to 42kN, or around 3.8 tons weight. Bringing <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> up to speed may have required as many as 180 men. Assuming a speed of 2km per hour over an estimated length of 6kilometres, the transfer from sea to sea would have taken three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|The stage {{show at the}} semi-final {{included}} Dustin in his trolley, {{wearing a}} silver suit. <b>The</b> <b>trolley</b> was dressed in green, white and gold, with the girls wearing gold dresses, green gloves and head-dresses in green, white and gold. Two of the male backing dancers wore large green, white and gold wings and danced around the stage, while the third back-up dancer wore a gold jump suit. The stage involved rippling effects of black and white, as well as waves of orange, white and green through the LCD screens on the stage. Despite {{being one of the}} favourites to win the contest outright, Dustin only managed to receive 22 points, placing 15th of the 19 countries competing and failing to reach the final.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the city}} and Amtrak {{attempted}} to fund a second renovation with a private partner, but plans fell through. In 1991, Amtrak constructed a rectangular concrete and glass station building {{on the north side}} of the tracks, in front of the passenger tunnel. Access from the south was blocked off. In 1999, the original station building was renovated at a cost of $7 million for use as commercial space. The front parking lot was expanded on a slope to the west; it covered much of the ground level (similar to the station before 1915). The mechanical building and the covered ramp to <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> station were removed. A strip mall was built just to the east, with balustrades and archways referencing the historic station. The passageway from the subway station, long closed, was likely buried at this time. The 1901-built station building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1999.|$|E

50|$|Every {{year during}} the week leading up to Labor Day weekend, {{volunteer}} operators and conductors regularly operate <b>the</b> <b>trolleys</b> to ferry campground dwellers and rail enthusiasts around the 2.5 mile campground loop. The Log Village {{at the south end}} of the loop provides the tourist a view of 19th century life on the Iowa prairie. Camper's use <b>the</b> <b>trolley's</b> to commute to the main fairgrounds to visit daily attractions.|$|R
50|$|This {{station is}} {{the only one in the}} system with a bus {{transfer}} station within fare control. When the rail service to Canarsie Pier along Rockaway Parkway was discontinued, riders were entitled to a free transfer to <b>the</b> replacement <b>trolleys.</b> Rather than issue paper transfers so riders could exit to the street for <b>the</b> <b>trolleys,</b> a loop was built next to the station with a boarding platform. When <b>the</b> <b>trolleys</b> were discontinued in April 1949, the B42 bus replaced them. South of here, there are still trolley poles remaining, with street lighting using some of them.|$|R
5|$|The {{prosecution}} realized {{early on}} that issues relating to time would be {{an essential part of}} its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.|$|E

25|$|Historically, Nashua was a hub for <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> {{system in}} New Hampshire. Trolleys {{could be taken}} south to Boston, as well as north into Manchester and to {{locations}} as far east as Hampton, New Hampshire. <b>The</b> <b>trolley</b> also connected {{different areas of the}} city, with the Nashua line ending at the city dance hall. <b>The</b> <b>trolley</b> system decreased in popularity in the 20th century, finally closing in 1932.|$|E
25|$|Other {{tourist-oriented}} heritage trolley {{systems that}} have closed recently are <b>the</b> Charlotte <b>Trolley</b> (1996–2010), <b>the</b> Portland Vintage <b>Trolley</b> (1991–2014), and <b>the</b> Old Pueblo <b>Trolley</b> (1993–2011) in Tucson, Arizona.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> {{suburban}} <b>trolley</b> lines use Kawasaki-built vehicles similar to, but larger than, <b>the</b> Subway-Surface <b>trolleys.</b> They use {{a slightly}} wider Pennsylvania trolley gauge, 5' 2-1/2". Notably, they are double ended, unlike <b>the</b> Subway-Surface <b>trolleys,</b> as <b>the</b> suburban lines lack any loops {{to turn the}} vehicles on their suburban-bound termini.|$|R

25|$|The crane {{is driven}} by an {{operator}} who sits in a cabin suspended from <b>the</b> <b>trolley.</b> <b>The</b> <b>trolley</b> runs along rails located on the top or sides of the boom and girder. The operator runs <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> over the ship to lift the cargo, usually containers. Once the spreader locks onto the container, the container is lifted, moved over the dock, and placed on a truck chassis (trailer) {{to be taken to}} the storage yard. The crane also lifts containers from chassis on the dock to load them onto the ship.|$|E
25|$|A {{trolley pole}} is a tapered {{cylindrical}} pole of wood or metal placed {{in contact with}} an overhead wire to provide electricity to <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> car. <b>The</b> <b>trolley</b> pole sits atop a sprung base {{on the roof of}} <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> vehicle, the springs maintaining the tension to keep <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> wheel or shoe in contact with the wire. Occasionally, a Canadian named John Joseph Wright is credited with inventing <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> pole when an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario, was built in 1883. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, there is no hard evidence to prove it. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent. Official credit for the invention of the electric trolley pole has gone to an American, Frank J. Sprague, who devised his working system in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888. Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this 12-mile system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888.|$|E
25|$|The inflexibility of <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> {{bus system}} {{and a desire to}} {{standardise}} on diesel buses led to the decision to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>trolley</b> buses in the 1950s. The short working to Shirley was discontinued on 16 July 1951 with the remaining services to Marshland Road via Richmond closing on 31 May 1956 and to North Beach on 8 November 1956.|$|E

50|$|The MRT uses {{aperture}} synthesis {{to simulate}} a 1 km by 1 km filled array. Data is collected as <b>the</b> <b>trolleys</b> in <b>the</b> North-South arm move southward from the array centre. Observations are repeated 62 times until <b>the</b> <b>trolleys</b> reach <b>the</b> southern end the arm. The 1-D data {{for each day}} is added {{so as to make}} a 2-D map of the sky. Unlike most radio telescopes, the MRT can 'see' very extended sources. Also, the non-co-planarity of the East-West arm have led to new imaging techniques used in cleaning the raw data.|$|R
50|$|In {{its early}} years, the neighbourhood's {{transportation}} was served predominantly by the northern {{section of the}} Toronto Transportation Commission's Yonge streetcar line. When the Yonge subway opened to Eglinton in 1954, the TTC replaced this service with trolley buses on Yonge Street and Mount Pleasant Road, both terminating at the Eglinton station. <b>The</b> <b>trolleys</b> left Yonge when the subway was extended further north in 1973, although a less frequent local bus service remained; <b>the</b> <b>trolleys</b> on Mount Pleasant lasted until 1991, when they too were replaced with regular buses.|$|R
