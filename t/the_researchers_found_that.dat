5|$|A study {{conducted}} at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D. Power 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and Tesla retail stores. <b>The</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.|$|E

The study {{was based on the}} premise that the images of African Americans on television sitcoms are one dimensional and comedic. A content analysis approach was used to analyze various television sitcoms. Definitions were used to determine what type of image existed using the foundation provided by Donald Bogle and Stewart Hall. <b>The</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> although many of the African-American-themed sitcoms investigated represented traditional stereotypical images, there were mediated messages in these sitcoms, which offered a new and different perspective on African Americans. This suggests that African-American images on black-themed sitcoms are moving forward. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> sitcoms depicting African-American life from a comedic point-of-view seem to be more acceptable in popular culture than those which depict life from a dramatic and/or realistic point-of-view...|$|R

5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. <b>The</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover {{increases}} to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and <b>the</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from statistical models built to study whether or not these range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in land cover. <b>The</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the post relationship effects of African American males who were verbally abused by their African American fathers. The participants, n 200, were randomly selected, and via survey, identified a sexual preference as either heterosexual or homosexual. The participant’s ages range between 15 and 64. The study {{was based on}} the premise that African American males who were verbally abused by their African American fathers were likely to demonstrate aggressive, hostile and violent behavior in academics, homes, and intimate relationships. A statistical and correlation analysis approach was used to analyze data gathered from the 200 African American male participants. <b>The</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there were significant relationships between African American males and verbal abuse in academics, homes, and intimate relationships. <b>The</b> <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> homosexuals were more likely to respond aggressively and violently in instances were verbal abuse occurred.

5|$|In 1989, Emily B. Griffin {{found that}} Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs {{had a good}} sense of smell (olfaction), based on the study of cranial endocasts that showed large {{olfactory}} bulbs in the brain. In 2014, Jason M. Bourke and colleagues found that Stegoceras would have needed cartilaginous nasal turbinates {{in the front of the}} nasal passages for airflow to reach the olfactory region. Evidence for the presence of this structure is a bony ridge to which it could have attached. The size of the olfactory region also indicates that Stegoceras had a keen sense of smell. <b>The</b> <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the dinosaur could have had either a scroll-shaped turbinate (like in a turkey) or a branched one (as in an ostrich) as both could have directed air to the olfactory region. The blood vessel system in the passages also suggest that the turbinates served to cool down warm arterial blood from the body that was heading to the brain. The skull of S. validum specimen UALVP 2 was suited for a study of this kind due to its exceptional preservation; it has ossified soft tissue in the nasal cavity, which would otherwise be cartilaginous and therefore not preserved through mineralization.|$|E
