5|$|On the ground, two {{different}} Tech players were predicted to share time running the ball. Senior running back Cedric Humes was predicted {{to get the}} bulk of the carries in the game, but redshirt freshman Branden Ore was also predicted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> plays at times. Humes rushed the ball 140times for 639yards and ten touchdowns during the regular season. Ore, meanwhile, ran the ball for 591yards and six touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{also met}} Stuart Cornfeld during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was {{interested}} in producing Ronnie Rocket; Cornfeld was working for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket was unlikely to find sufficient financing to be produced, Lynch asked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> already-written scripts to work from for his next film instead. Cornfeld found four scripts he felt Lynch would be interested in, but on hearing {{the name of the}} first, the director decided his next project would be The Elephant Man.|$|E
5|$|The site reopened to {{the public}} on 1 July 2010. As well as {{presenting}} {{a history of the}} V-weapons and of the site, the museum enables visitors <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the tunnels and a mock-up of the HDP gun. The tunnels also house memorials to Joseph Kennedy, the other bomber crew members killed during raids on the site, and the forced labourers who lost their lives during construction. In 2011, the museum had about 11,000 visitors, of whom 53% were French, 18% Belgian and 16% British.|$|E

5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>Some</b> Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} district is the extension on the southeast, to the boundary of the city's Eighth Ward in 1870. Between Adams and Ferry streets, three blocks would be added, with the new boundary following {{the west side of}} St. Mary's Avenue, excluding a newer house at the northwest corner of the Washington Avenue intersection, and then rear property lines to Kennedy Lane and Hill Street just south of Adams. Two-story rowhouses predominate in this area, many built as worker housing during the 19th century, some as early as the Federal period. Some have intact storefronts. It also has the only significant industrial building in the proposed expanded district, the former Lusco Paper Works on the northwest corner of Fifth and Liberty streets. The area has begun <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> restoration efforts, such as some Greek Revival rowhouses on Liberty Street near Fourth, which will benefit from state tax credits should the area be added to the district.|$|E

5|$|The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The ghost {{shows him}} scenes {{involving}} {{the death of}} a disliked man. The man's funeral will only be attended by local businessmen if lunch is provided. His charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker steal some of his possessions and sell them to a fence. When Scrooge asks the ghost to show anyone who feels any emotion over the man's death, the ghost can only show him the pleasure of a poor couple in debt to the man, rejoicing that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. After Scrooge asks <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the passing of Tiny Tim. The ghost then shows Scrooge the man's neglected grave, whose tombstone bears Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to the ghost that he will change his ways to avoid this outcome.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally a pro-market {{economy and}} pro-EU centre-right party, the NCP were the largest {{party in the}} {{parliament}} {{for the first time}} in its history, though losing seats since the 2007 election. Although leading in the opinion polls for several years, it started <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> loss of support after the rise of the True Finns. Despite being founded as a primarily conservative party, an analysis on the party's programmes made by an NCP-affiliated think tank concluded that in the 2000s the liberal wing had gained the upper hand and had started to change the party's political ideology. At the party conference in 2010, the NCP delegates voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. The party's supporters are also generally very supportive of market economy, nuclear power and Finland's admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{long history}} of work {{attempting}} to build ontologies for a variety of task domains, e.g., an ontology for liquids, the lumped element model widely used in representing electronic circuits (e.g.,), as well as ontologies for time, belief, and even programming itself.

The war-torn city began <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> positive development as many expatriate Afghans returned to the country.

25|$|It is {{not unusual}} in Somers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> (introduced) koalas and the suburb {{is well known for}} its Koala Walk. The {{distinctive}} growl of Koalas can often be heard in the town. Travellers are advised to take care, as koalas frequently cross local roads, and show little road sense. Occasionally echidnas have been seen in the area around The Promenade. Bushy-tail and ring- tail Possums are commonplace, and can often be seen soon after nightfall, scurrying along powerlines and thus silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the trial, Adams resigned from the National Health Service and was convicted in Lewes Crown Court on 26 July 1957, on eight counts of forging prescriptions, four counts of making false statements on cremation forms, and three offences under the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1951 and fined £2,400 plus costs of £457. His licence to prescribe dangerous drugs was revoked on 4 September and on 27 November he was struck off the Medical Register by the GMC. Adams continued <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of his more loyal patients, and prescribed over-the-counter medicine to them.|$|E

25|$|Day/night cricket, {{also known}} as Floodlit cricket is a cricket match that is played either totally, or more usually partially, under {{floodlights}} in the evening. The first regular cricket to be played under floodlights occurred during World Series Cricket, unsanctioned by the International Cricket Council, attracting large crowds <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> of the world's best players compete in Australia and the West Indies. In 1979, when the ICC and World Series Cricket came to an understanding, the first floodlit One Day International was played, also in Australia. Floodlit cricket has since been played around the world, although England was slow to take it up due to their climate.|$|E
25|$|Facilities {{improved}} during Soviet times. Education {{and public}} health especially began <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>some</b> major changes. In 1913, Nakhchivan only had two hospitals {{with a total of}} 20 beds. The region was plagued by widespread diseases including trachoma and typhus. Malaria, which mostly came from the adjoining Aras River, brought serious harm to the region. At any one time, between 70% and 85% of Nakhchivan's population was infected with malaria, and in the region of Norashen (present-day Sharur) almost 100% were struck with the disease. This situation improved dramatically under Soviet rule. Malaria was sharply reduced and trachoma, typhus, and relapsing fever were completely eliminated.|$|E
25|$|In early 2002 a NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was {{deployed}} in Kabul {{and from there}} they began taking over {{other parts of the}} country.

Its population has grown from about 500,000 in 2001 to over 3 million by 2007. Many foreign embassies re-opened, especially the biggest U.S. Embassy. Afghan government institutions were also re-developed and modernized. Since 2008 the newly trained Afghan National Police (ANP) and the Afghan National Army (ANA) are in charge of security in the area, while NATO also has a heavy presence but are not patrolling the streets anymore.|$|E
