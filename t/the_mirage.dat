5|$|In 1985 <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIS fleet, nearing 20 {{years of}} {{operational}} service, began a major upgrade program {{to improve the}} capabilities of the aircraft. The interceptors were retro-fitted with canards manufactured by Israeli Aircraft Industries on the air intakes to improve maneuverability and stability at landing speeds, new avionics and countermeasures, and redesignated <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIS C.70.|$|E
5|$|Roget and Yerchael {{join forces}} with Belgar, the Oracle of Shadows from the holy city of Wendel, who discovers that Anise is hoping to use the dark energy from the mirrors to turn herself into a goddess. Roget and his allies journey to <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> Castle to confront Anise, only for her to finish pulling the dark energy from the mirrors before they can stop her. The dark energy kills Inath and <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> Bishop, and Anise {{combines}} her form with a possessed Peddan general to create the Goddess of Doom. The allied forces fight and defeat the Goddess, ending the threat from Pedda, and return to their home countries.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{acquired}} a single Mirage for testing, as a preface to production under license of 100Dassault Mirage IIIS interceptors, with strengthened wings, airframe, and undercarriage. Avionics would differ as well, with the Thomson-CSF Cyrano II radar {{replaced by the}} Hughes Electronics TARAN-18system, to provide <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIS compatibility with the AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missile. <b>The</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIS {{was intended to be}} operated as an interceptor, ground attack, and reconnaissance aircraft, using wing pods for the photographic mission.|$|E

50|$|Starting from 17 January 2013, {{three of}} <b>the</b> <b>Mirages</b> were {{relocated}} in Bamako, Mali, preceded by <b>the</b> two simpler <b>Mirage</b> F.1CR which started operating from Bamako few days before.|$|R
5|$|However the {{competition}} was reopened in 1990 {{to allow for a}} reconsideration of a European fighter, <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> 2000-5. In June 1991 the choice of the Hornet was reconfirmed, and the political struggle to have its purchase approved by referendum began. In the meantime, the Soviet Union was dissolved, and with its dissolution the Cold War ended.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian industry would participate in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
5|$|The new, larger {{aircraft}} design soon emerged, which was initially designated as P.1150/3 {{prior to being}} redesignated as the P.1154. In January 1962, HSA submitted the P.1154 design to NATO via the Ministry of Aviation. NBMR.3 also attracted ten other contenders, among which was P.1154's principal competitor, the Dassault Mirage IIIV. This design employed a separate lift/thrust engine concept whereby eight Rolls-Royce engines would provide lift during vertical flight alongside a single turbofan for thrust during horizontal flight. <b>The</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIV was supported by British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), and also had the favour of {{several members of the}} Air Staff. In May 1962, the P.1154 emerged as the winner in the competition for the NBMR.3 over <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIV.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Swiss Air Force {{acquired}} 20 British Aerospace Hawk Mk.66s {{to provide}} an interim solution to its jet training requirements, but these were retired in 2003 and sold to Finland. <b>The</b> <b>Mirages</b> ended their service {{in the second half}} of the 1990s, with <b>the</b> last <b>Mirage</b> fighter retired in 1999 and <b>the</b> final <b>Mirage</b> reconnaissance jet in December 2003.|$|R

5|$|They soon {{learn that}} the king of Pedda and Roget's {{childhood}} friend, Inath, has been driven mad and is launching Operation Psi {{with the aim of}} taking over the world. Roget and Yerchael journey to the other nations in order to help stop the Peddan army. They join forces with the rulers and warriors of several countries, including the defeated Amazons of Laurent, the rebels of Nevarla, which has allied itself with Pedda, and the warriors of Valsena and Altena. As they fight the Peddan army, they discover that Inath is installing Black Mirrors in the conquered kingdoms, which are corrupting those around them. Roget and Yurchael are joined in their quest by the elemental spirits, which are concerned about the mirrors. After confronting Roget's twin brother, <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> Bishop, they discover that Inath and <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> Bishop have been corrupted by the ancient witch Anise, who is planting the mirrors in order to summon a dark energy for her own power.|$|E
5|$|From {{the outset}} the Jaguar was {{equipped}} with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability was quite low.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, the United Arab Emirates {{evaluated}} the Su-27M, but later acquired <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> 2000 {{due to the}} country's close relationship with France. In 2015, its officials entered into negotiations with their Russian counterparts about the possible contract for the modernized Su-35. In February 2017, the country signed a preliminary agreement {{for the purchase of}} a number of Su-35s, later reported to be 24, and also signed an agreement with Rostec, Russia's state-owned corporation responsible for the development of advanced industrial products, to develop a fifth-generation aircraft based on the MiG-29.|$|E
50|$|Over the {{demilitarized zone}} on the Israeli {{side of the border}} with Syria, a total of 6 MiGs were shot down <b>the</b> first day <b>Mirages</b> fought <b>the</b> MiGs. In the Six-Day War, apart from 12 <b>Mirages</b> (4 in <b>the</b> air and 8 on the ground) left behind to guard Israel from Arab bombers, all <b>the</b> <b>Mirages</b> were fitted with bombs and sent to attack the Arab air bases. However, <b>the</b> <b>Mirage's</b> {{performance}} as a bomber was modest. During <b>the</b> following days <b>Mirages</b> performed as fighters, and {{out of a total of}} 58 Arab aircraft shot down in air combat during the war, 48 were accounted for by Mirages.|$|R
50|$|While with 253 Squadron, <b>the</b> <b>Mirages</b> had {{received}} blue rudders with two white chevrons {{separated by a}} black band. At {{the end of their}} tenure with the squadron some aircraft were seen with the top chevron changed to red. When <b>the</b> <b>Mirages</b> joined 254 Squadron, not only were the different rudders maintained, but both were applied to the Kfirs as well. The different markings may have been an attempt at disinformation, meant to mislead uninformed observers.|$|R
50|$|Rising {{tensions}} in the Middle East led French President Charles de Gaulle to embargo <b>the</b> Israeli <b>Mirage</b> 5s on 3 June 1967. <b>The</b> <b>Mirages</b> continued to roll off the production line, {{even though they were}} embargoed, and by 1968 the batch was complete and the Israelis had provided final payments.|$|R
5|$|On 31March 1986, No.79 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Base Butterworth as a {{temporary}} measure to cover part of the period while the RAAF's three fighter squadrons were transitioning from MirageIIIs to F/A-18 Hornets. The squadron inherited all of No.3 Squadron's twelve MirageIII fighters {{and most of its}} personnel; the remainder of No.3 Squadron returned to Australia to be re-equipped with Hornets. As well as <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIs, the squadron operated a single DHC-4 Caribou transport that was also based at Butterworth.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{collaborative}} efforts between Britain and France had been complicated – the AFVG programme ended in cancellation, and controversy surrounded {{the development of}} the supersonic airliner Concorde. Whilst the technical collaboration between BAC and Breguet went well, when Dassault took over Breguet in 1971 it encouraged acceptance of its own designs, such as the Super Étendard naval attack aircraft and <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> F1, for which it would receive more profit, over the Anglo-French Jaguar.|$|E
5|$|However, {{another major}} reason for rising costs was {{the need to develop}} a {{separate}} variant for the photo-reconnaissance mission when the underwing pods caused too great a performance penalty. The differences between the IIIS and the IIIRS (as the reconnaissance version was designated) resulted in only 36Mirage IIIS fighters and 18IIIRS reconnaissance aircraft actually built by the Federal Aircraft Factory at Emmen. Twelve were allocated to a reconnaissance squadron, three to a training group and the rest to two fighter squadrons. It was found that such a small number was insufficient to provide the multi-role capacity deemed essential for the new doctrine. <b>The</b> <b>Mirage</b> IIIS went into service in 1967, and the IIIRS in 1969.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Dassault <b>Mirage</b> 4000 (sometimes named <b>the</b> Super <b>Mirage</b> 4000) was a French {{prototype}} jet fighter aircraft {{developed by}} Dassault-Breguet from their Mirage 2000.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} in service in 8 {{different}} air forces, powering <b>the</b> whole <b>Mirage</b> 2000 family of airplanes, including <b>the</b> latest <b>Mirage</b> 2000-5 and 2000-9 multirole fighters.|$|R
5|$|In 1972, {{with the}} option of nuclear weapons {{discarded}} {{and the likelihood of}} operations beyond the Swiss border severely restricted, the Federal Military Department (EMD) decided that the next generation of aircraft acquired by the Swiss Air Force would be for close air support. While resurrection of the P-16 was discussed in the Swiss press (FFA had continued theoretical development the aircraft at its own expense, with its final variant, the AR-7, to be equipped with a Rolls-Royce RB168-25 engine), the choice narrowed to the Milan (a joint Swiss-French prototype variant of <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> III) and the American A-7G Corsair II, each of which had strong advocates within the Swiss Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team {{to add more}} details to the character designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right analog stick. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Other {{significant}} events {{include the}} , inclusive {{of a variety}} of films at the Wenatchee Valley College and Omak Theater, the Okanogan County Fair, an annual carnival at the County Fairgrounds and the Omak Western and Native Art Show, a Native American carnival. In an attempt to increase tourism, the City of Omak operates a Main Street Historical Tour in the central business district. A local recreational complex comprises a Native American wooden sculpture area. Two functional movie theaters, the single screen Omak Theater, built in 1928, and <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> Theater with three screens, built in 2004, service the city. A drive-in theater, with a capacity of 250 automobiles, was proposed in 1948, but never built.|$|E

50|$|At the 2015 LA Auto Show, Mitsubishi previewed <b>the</b> <b>Mirage's</b> 2017 facelift. <b>The</b> {{car will}} receive a new front end design, {{projector}} headlights with LED daytime running lights, and LED taillights. The facelift results in a drag coefficient of 0.27cd. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Mirage's</b> suspension will be improved with better shock absorbers, revised spring rates, and uprated brakes (discs on front, drums on rear). The interior will also see numerous aesthetic changes from the steering wheel to the HVAC system and a new optional touchscreen infotainment system using Apple's CarPlay interface and a 300W Rockford Fosgate audio setup.|$|R
50|$|The SNECMA M53 is an {{afterburning}} {{turbofan engine}} developed for <b>the</b> Dassault <b>Mirage</b> 2000 fighter by Snecma. The engine is in service with different air forces, including <b>the</b> latest <b>Mirage</b> 2000-5 and 2000-9 multirole fighters.|$|R
5|$|Taking {{place in}} modern-day Tokyo and {{featuring}} real-life locations such as Shibuya and Harajuku, the game centers around evil beings known as Mirages {{who seek to}} harvest an energy known as Performa from humans and are responsible for several disappearances. The story follows a group of teenagers who become allied with friendly Mirages, based on characters from the Fire Emblem series, and merge with them to become Mirage Masters. Under the guise of the Fortuna Entertainment talent agency, <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> Masters fight to protect innocent people from the Mirages and find out who is behind the attacks.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} {{expressed an}} interest in the Iroquois engine for an enlarged version of the Dassault Mirage IV bomber, <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> IVB. This was one of several engines being considered, including the Olympus, with an order for 300 Iroquois being considered. Acting on media speculation that the Iroquois engine program was also in jeopardy of being cancelled, the French government chose to end negotiations in October 1958 and opted for an upgraded version of the indigenous Snecma Atar, instead. There was never an explanation for this decision offered by the French government, even after Avro tried to offer the Iroquois as a private venture.|$|E
5|$|The Gripen C/D was a {{contender}} for 48 multirole fighters for the Polish Air Force started in 2001. On 27 December 2002, the Polish Defence Minister announced the F-16C/D Block 50/52+'s selection. According to Stephen Larrabee, the selection was {{heavily influenced by}} Lockheed Martin's lucrative offset agreement (totaling $3.5 billion and 170% offset against Gripen International's €3.2 billion with 146% offset) and by a political emphasis on Poland's strategic relationship with the US and NATO. Both Gripen International and Dassault Aviation (who offered <b>the</b> <b>Mirage</b> 2000-5 Mk 2) described the decision as political. According to a former Polish military defence vice-minister, the JAS 39 offer was better and included research participation proposals.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mirages</b> {{were bought}} from France in 1984, while the MiG-29s arrived via a {{disastrous}} 1995 deal with Belarus. Fortunately, Peru patched {{things up with}} Russia, and RAC MiG agreed to provide service and support.|$|R
