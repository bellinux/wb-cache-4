5|$|His {{impact was}} {{not only on the}} world of education, but also on Argentine {{political}} and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the time they were not widely accepted. He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine people could not recognize at the time with <b>the</b> <b>soaring</b> standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.|$|E
5|$|In Mt. Pleasant, M-20 runs {{near the}} campus of Central Michigan University {{crossing}} the Chippewa River, and the trunkline joins Bus. US127 along the Mission Street business area to Pickard Road. The highway turns east on Pickard and passes under the US127 freeway near <b>the</b> <b>Soaring</b> Eagle Casino. From Mt. Pleasant to Midland, M-20 is designed as a four–lane highway with a continuous center turn lane passing through rural forest land. M-20 picks up inclusion on the NHS from this point east.|$|E

5|$|In a competition, {{using the}} engine ends <b>the</b> <b>soaring</b> flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, {{as they do}} not need a safety margin for {{starting}} the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E
