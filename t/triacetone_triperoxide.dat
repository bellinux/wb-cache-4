25|$|Acetone {{peroxide}} is {{an organic}} peroxide and a primary high explosive. It {{is produced by}} the oxidation of acetone to yield a mixture of linear monomer and cyclic dimer, trimer, and tetramer forms. The trimer is known as <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> (TATP) or tri-cyclic acetone peroxide (TCAP). Acetone peroxide {{takes the form of}} a white crystalline powder with a distinctive bleach-like odor and can explode if subjected to heat, friction, or shock. As a non-nitrogenous explosive, TATP has historically been more difficult to detect, and it has been used as an explosive in several terrorist attacks since 2001.|$|E

50|$|An entropic {{explosion}} is {{an explosion}} in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing {{a large amount of}} heat. The chemical decomposition of <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> (TATP) is an example of an entropic explosion. It is not a thermochemically highly favored event because little energy generated in chemical bond formation in reaction products, but rather involves an entropy burst, which is the result of formation of one ozone and three acetone gas phase molecules from every molecule of TATP in the solid state.|$|E

50|$|Many organic {{peroxides}} can initiate explosive polymerization in materials with unsaturated chemical bonds, and specifically <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> (TATP) and hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) are powerful explosives. TATP is an inexpensive compound and {{is relatively easy}} to make. Whereas most other potent explosives, such as trinitrotoluene (TNT) or RDX (the major component of C4 mixtures), contain nitrogen, which {{is relatively easy to}} trace by sniffing techniques, TATP is nitrogen free and therefore is very difficult to detect by conventional screening methods. For this reason, it is an explosive favored by terrorists. TATP and HMTD were used in several executed or planned terrorist acts of the early 2000s, most notably in the 2001 shoe bomb plot and the 2005 London Underground bombings. Several detection devices have been designed since those events. One, for example, releases a chemical mixture which changes color when interacting with traces of TATP.|$|E
50|$|Abdulmutallab {{spent about}} 20 {{minutes in the}} toilet as the flight {{approached}} Detroit, and then covered himself with a blanket after returning to his seat. Other passengers then heard popping noises, smelled a foul odour, and some saw Abdulmutallab's trouser leg and {{the wall of the}} plane on fire. Fellow passenger Jasper Schuringa, a Dutch film director, jumped on Abdulmutallab and subdued him as flight attendants used fire extinguishers to douse the flames. Abdulmutallab was taken {{toward the front of the}} aircraft cabin, was seen to have lost his trousers due to the fire, and had burns on his legs. When asked by a flight attendant what he had in his pocket, he replied: “Explosive device.” The device consisted of a six-inch (15-cm) packet which was sewn into his underwear containing the explosive powder PETN, which became a plastic explosive when mixed with the high explosive <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> (TATP) (the same two explosives that were used by Richard Reid in 2001), and a syringe containing liquid acid. Abdulmutallab created the explosive by mixing PETN with TATP and other ingredients.|$|E
50|$|The detectives {{eventually}} arrest Kaspers, but {{not before}} Birgit purchases large quantities of the raw materials {{needed to make a}} <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> bomb. A call soon comes in that she has taken hostages in the Continental Bankcorp building and is threatening to blow it up unless Kaspers is put on a plane to Cuba. Nichols takes Kaspers into the lobby and gets him to admit to Birgit that his love for his daughter is more important to him than the radical ideology he has been trying to put into place. As Birgit begins to realize this, though, an FBI sniper outside the building gets a clear shot and kills her, knocking her backwards into Nichols' arms so that the tilt switch around her neck does not set off the bomb. As the hostages are freed and Kaspers and the body are taken away, Nichols muses to Eames that relationships such as the one between Kaspers and Birgit - or between himself and his own father - are the reason he never had any children.|$|E
50|$|The {{substance}} that the suspect tried to detonate {{was more than}} 80 g of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), a crystalline powder that is often the active ingredient of plastic explosives, the high explosive <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> (TATP), and other ingredients. PETN {{is among the most}} powerful of explosives, and chemically resembles nitroglycerin. The powder was analyzed by the FBI at Quantico, and an FBI affidavit filed in the Eastern District of Michigan reflected preliminary findings that the device contained PETN. The authorities also found the remains of the syringe. The suspect apparently carried the PETN onto the plane in a 6 in-long soft plastic container, possibly a condom, attached to his underwear. Much of the container was lost in the fire. ABC News cited a government test indicating that 50 g of PETN can blow a hole in the side of an airliner, and posted photos of the remains of Abdulmutallab's underwear and explosive packet.In a public test conducted by the BBC, the test plane's fuselage remained intact, indicating that the bomb would not have destroyed the aircraft, though it did show window damage that would likely have led to cabin depressurization. This test was undertaken at ground level, with zero pressure differential between the cabin and the surrounding environment. This was claimed to have no effect on the overall result of the test, which aimed to simulate the explosion at 10000 ft. It was not demonstrated what would happen at a typical cruising altitude of between 31000 ft and 39000 ft, where the pressure differential would have caused the fuselage to be under a far greater stress than at ground level.|$|E

A backscattered laser beam reflected from the lidar target (hard target, person, aerosols, clouds, buildings) is detected because a cloud of <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> {{in front of the}} lidar target and between the lidar target and the differential-absorption lidar system produces a differential-absorption signal having characteristics that identify the <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide.</b> In a second embodiment, a <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> cloud that is absorbing optical radiation from its ambient environment and which is attached to a hard target is detected from a location remote from the <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> explosive by detecting an optical radiation absorption signature characterized by <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> absorption lines...|$|E

Although not without limitations, these first-generation fluorescent probes can provide a visual response to ca. 100 nmol of TATP. In addition, the success of this assay suggests the potential for broader application of aryl sulfoxides in fluorescent chemosensing...|$|E
40|$|Thermal runaway {{reactions}} {{were involved in}} the Bhopal disaster of 1984, in which methyl isocyanate was vented from a storage tank of the liquid, and occur in liquid peroxide explosions, yet to date there have been few investigations into the mechanism of thermal runaway in such liquid thermoreactive systems. Consequently protocols for storing thermally unstable liquids and deactivating liquid bombs may be suboptimal. In this work the hydrolysis of methyl isocyanate and the thermal decomposition of <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> were simulated using a gradientless, continuous-flow reactor paradigm. This approximation enabled stability analyses on the steady state solutions of the dynamical mass and enthalpy equations. The results indicate that thermal runaway in both systems is due to the onset of a large amplitude, hard thermal oscillation initiated at a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. This type of thermal misbehaviour cannot be predicted using classical ignition theory, and may be typical of liquid thermoreactive systems. The mechanism of oscillatory thermal instability on the nanoscale is elucidated. Comment: This article was commissioned as a chapter for a forthcoming book "Nanotechnology Research and The Millenium Development Goals", editor Thomas Faunce, to be published by Pan Stanford. It is based on a previous article (see arXiv: 1007. 1487 v 1) but includes new analyis of the thermal stability of <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> and discussion of the nanoscale origins of oscillatory thermal instabilit...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Multiphoton laser wave-mixing {{spectroscopy}} {{is presented}} as a sensitive and specific optical detection technique for liquid and gas phase analytes. Compared to other detection methods, wave-mixing offers numerous advantages including small laser probes, high spatial resolution, excellent sensitivity, and specificity that allows for the identification of analytes. The signal generated is a coherent laser-like beam, thus it can be spatially and optically modulated to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the system. The laser wave-mixing signal exhibits a quadratic dependence on analyte absorptivity, thus small changes in concentration result in large changes in signal intensity. Furthermore, laser wave-mixing has a cubic dependence on laser power, allowing for the use of low power laser systems. Laser wave-mixing is shown to be a sensitive detection technique that is adapted for detection beyond normal lab scale distances. The simple two-beam forward scattering arrangement is used to detect molecular bromine gas in a sealed 10 cm gas cell. Bromine is detected at distances from 0. 25 to 6 meters while maintaining sensitivity in the parts per billion range. This proof of concept work has applications in environmental and medical applications that require real time detection of gaseous analytes. The detection of explosives in the visible range is an important technique for forensic, defense, and security applications. This work shows that laser wave-mixing {{can be applied to the}} colorimetric detection of both trinitrotoluene and <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide.</b> Trinitrotoluene is detected with parts per trillion sensitivity using a 514 nm Argon ion laser and <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> is detected in the parts per billion range using a 405 nm solid state diode laser system. Laser wave-mixing is then adapted to use mid-infrared quantum cascade lasers for the detection of explosives and explosives precursors. Quantum cascade lasers are powerful, compact, lasers that feature wavelength and power tunability. This laser system offers sensitivity and specificity in detection of dinitrotoluene, <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide,</b> and acetone as native species in the gas and liquid phase. The wavelength tunability of quantum cascade lasers allows for the identification of these molecules in the fingerprint mid-IR region with parts per billion detection sensitivitie...|$|E

The formation of [2 TATP+Li+LiX]+ (X = Br, Cl) sandwich complexes was also observed. Collision cross-sections for the lithium-containing complexes of TATP were measured by travelling wave ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry, and compared well with computationally determined structures.

Both analytes greatly reduce the light {{made during the}} annihilation mechanism yielding ppb level detection. The quenching mechanism for TATP {{is thought to be}} EEC ′ during reduction which reduces the light by oxidizing the Ru(bpy) 3 + before it can react with Ru(bpy) 33 + with a rate constant estimate of 4. 8 × 104 M− 1 s− 1.

The technique is gaining widespread interest as a method for detecting hidden explosives due to its sensitivity and ease of use. In this letter, we present a computationally efficient classification scheme for accurate standoff identification of several common explosives using visible-range Raman spectroscopy. Using real measurements, we evaluate and modify a recent correlation-based approach to classify Raman spectra from various harmful and commonplace substances.

All of these explosives belong {{to a group of}} improvised explosives. The possibility of desensitization of these explosives by the addition of other substances was studied. Sensitivity curves were obtained for the solid organic peroxides with various liquid contents. The sensitivity decreases significantly with only a small quantity of liquid − up to about 20 % of the liquid. Further increase in the liquid content has a negligible further impact on the sensitivity to friction. Water and WD- 40 oil were compared as desensitizating agents...|$|E

Monitoring the emitted visible or infrared radiation by photodiodes {{and the change}} in pressure by a transducer in a closed system offers a low cost and mobile explosive identification device.

The presence of the nitroaromatic HEM 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene (2, 4 -DNT) and the cyclic organic peroxide <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> (TATP) in air was detected by chemometrics-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy. Several infrared experimental setups were tested using traditional heated sources (globar), modulated and nonmodulated FT-IR, and quantum cascade laser- (QCL-) based dispersive IR spectroscopy. The data obtained from the gas phase absorption experiments in the midinfrared (MIR) region were used for building the chemometrics models. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to generate pattern recognition schemes for trace amounts of explosives in air.

The present {{work was}} {{finalised}} to develop chemiluminescent assays more sensitive {{and easy to}} use than the analytical methods currently in use to detect traces of TNT (2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene), TATP (<b>Triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide)</b> and HMTD (Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine). For TNT detection we developed an indirect competitive ELISA with chemiluminescent end-point (CL-ELISA) and a Lateral Flow ImmunoAssay (LFIA) for on-site analysis, based both on monoclonal antibody commercially available and conjugates specifically synthesized. For the peroxide-based explosives TATP and HMTD we developed an indirect assay which measures, by luminol emission, the H 2 O 2 released by these compounds. Both methods showed good sensitivity and reproducibility, with detection limit, LOD, and IC 50 values in the ng mL- 1 range, CV values lower than 10 %.

40|$|The temperature-dependent sensing {{properties}} of metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensors (MOX), based on SnO 2 and WO 3, to measure <b>triacetone</b> <b>triperoxide</b> (TATP), diacetone diperoxid (DADP), and di-tert-butyl-peroxide (DTBP) and acetone are described. Conductivity measurements {{in the range}} from 100 to 400 °C operating temperature show two different reaction pathways on the surface for WO 3 sensors. At temperatures below 150 °C organic peroxides react as an oxidizer which leads to an increase in the sensor resistance. Above 200 °C they react as a reducing agent that leads to a decrease of the sensor resistance. This effect is caused by two different, peroxide dependent reaction paths. The unique behavior of WO 3 -based sensors can be used for selectivity enhancements in temperature cycle operation mode. With this method gas concentrations down to a few ppb are detectable...|$|E

Addition of strong acids to TATP can cause an explosive reaction while reaction with dilute acid reduces the decomposition rate so drastically that gentle destruction of TATP is impractical. However, combined use of dilute acid with slightly solvated TATP made gentle destruction of TATP feasible. Variables including acid type, concentration, solvent and ratios thereof have been explored, along with kinetics, {{in an attempt to}} provide a field-safe technique for gently destroying this homemade primary explosive. The preferred method is moistening TATP with an alcoholic solution (aqueous methanol, ethanol or i-propanol) followed by addition of 36 wt % hydrochloric acid.
