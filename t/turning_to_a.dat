5|$|Hurricane Kenneth was {{the strongest}} and longest-tracked {{hurricane}} of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season. The eleventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the season, Kenneth developed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the southwest of Mexico on September 14. It quickly attained peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) on September 18, before weakening due to increased wind shear and <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> southwest drift. After weakening to tropical storm status, Kenneth attained a steady west-northwest motion and encountered favorable enough conditions for it to gain power and attain hurricane status on September 25. The cyclone again weakened as its motion halted, and on September 30 Kenneth dissipated a short distance off the Big Island of Hawaii. The remnants of Kenneth produced {{one of the highest}} rainfall totals in Hawaii, reaching up to 12inches (305mm) on Oahu. The rainfall caused flooding, though no major damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kristy in 2006 was a {{relatively}} long-lived tropical cyclone in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It developed on August30 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status, reaching peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). Subsequently, Kristy weakened from cooler waters and increased wind shear from Hurricane John to its northeast. Steering currents weakened, and <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> southerly drift, it weakened to a tropical depression by September2. The next day it briefly regained tropical storm status, only to again deteriorate to depression status. After turning to the west, Kristy encountered marginally favorable conditions and attained tropical storm status for a third time, though unfavorable conditions caused it to dissipate on September9. The storm never affected land, although initially {{there was a slight}} threat to Clarion Island. Within the National Hurricane Center area of warning responsibility east of 140°W, Hurricane Kristy was the longest-lasting tropical cyclone of the season.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Barbara was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall during the 2007 Pacific hurricane season. The second storm of the season, Barbara developed from a small low pressure area on May 29 about 235miles (380km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The system drifted southward before <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> steadily eastward motion, and quickly intensified into a tropical storm. Increased wind shear weakened Barbara, though it re-organized to attain peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) before moving ashore {{just west of the}} border of Mexico and Guatemala. It rapidly weakened over land, and on June 2 the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on the storm. Despite expectations that the storm would attain hurricane status, Barbara moved ashore as a small, weak tropical storm. It produced locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds, and in most locations damage was minor. However, in southern Mexico, the rainfall destroyed large areas of cropland, with crop damage totaling 200million pesos (2007MXN, $55million 2007USD). In El Salvador, four people were killed by storm-induced floods.|$|E

25|$|L. glyciosmus is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} agaric, which typically has a convex cap measuring between 2 and 5.5 centimetres, with a small central depression developing with age. Sometimes there is a central pimple, and the cap is typically coloured a greyish lilac, sometimes varying to a pale buff. It is thin fleshed, with an incurved margin in younger specimens. The stem measures between 25 and 65 millimetres in height, with a width between 4 and 12 millimetres. The cylindrical stem is typically widest at the bottom becoming narrower towards the top, or sometimes club shaped. The stem is concolorous with the cap, but sometimes is a little paler or with a yellowish hue. The stem is particularly soft and easily broken, and can become hollow. The flesh is buff. The gills are decurrent and crowded, and vary in colour from a pale yellowish to a pale flesh, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> greyish lilac with age. The milk is white with an initially mild, later hot and acrid taste. The mushroom has a strong smell of coconuts.|$|E

Her father, Carlo De Vito, is an Italian-born house painter and {{contractor}} and her mother, Maria, is a partner in the family business. De Vito's grandfather was an Italian tenor who sang Neapolitan folk songs and opera. In 2006, De Vito's younger brother, Modesto (born ca 1980), joined his parents' firm as a painter, their younger sister is Sarina (born ca 1985). De Vito entered various talent contests while in primary school – at the age of nine she won a competition. She cited Whitney Houston, Shirley Bassey, Tina Turner and Karen Carpenter as being major influences on her personal style. She attended Murdoch University, and graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree – major in finance and banking. <b>Turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> career in entertainment, De Vito made contact with talent agents who enabled her to travel to Nashville, Tennessee in 2001 to record a demo tape and discuss a recording deal but was turned down {{because of a lack of}} an Australian fan base. During 2003 De Vito worked as an office administrator in a Perth publicity and conference business.|$|E

500|$|Przevalski's {{nuthatch}} (Sitta przewalskii), originally {{given the}} nomen nudum Sitta eckloni, is a bird {{species in the}} Sittidae family, collectively known as nuthatches. Long regarded as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch (Sitta leucopsis), it nevertheless differs significantly in morphology and vocalizations. Both S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been regarded as {{closely related to the}} North American white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis). It is a medium-sized nuthatch, measuring about [...] in length. Its upper body is a dark gray-blue or slate color, becoming dark blue-black at the crown. The cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rich cinnamon on the underparts that intensifies in color {{on the sides of the}} breast. Vocalizations consist of alternating series of ascending whistles and short notes.|$|E
500|$|Stede Bonnet (1688 – 10December 1718) was {{an early}} {{eighteenth-century}} Barbadian pirate, sometimes called [...] "The Gentleman Pirate" [...] {{because he was a}} moderately wealthy landowner before <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> life of crime. Bonnet was born into a wealthy English family on the island of Barbados, and inherited the family estate after his father's death in 1694. In 1709, he married Mary Allamby, and engaged in some level of militia service. Because of marital problems, and despite his lack of sailing experience, Bonnet decided he should turn to piracy in the summer of 1717. He bought a sailing vessel, named it Revenge, and travelled with his paid crew along the Eastern Seaboard of what is now the United States, capturing other vessels and burning other Barbadian ships.|$|E
500|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity {{for less than}} 12hours, Juliette began to weaken due to an eyewall replacement cycle. After turning to the west-northwest, the winds of the hurricane dropped to [...] by September 22, and the eyewall expanded to about 80miles (130km) in diameter. The eyewall contracted to about 40miles (65km), {{and as a result}} Juliette re-strengthened to attain winds of 105mph (170km/h). An eastward moving trough of low pressure turned the hurricane to the north-northeast into an area of cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear. Juliette quickly weakened to a tropical storm late on September 24. The eastward moving trough moved past the storm, resulting in the motion of Juliette <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> southeast drift. The convection waned and disappeared on September 25, and on September 26 Juliette dissipated while located 450miles (730km) west of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
