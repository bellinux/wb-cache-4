25|$|Menard {{returned}} to the 27 for 2014, with the car running schemes more oriented towards the associate sponsors of MENARDS featured on <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Six races prior to the Chase for the Sprint Cup at Indy in July, Menard was involved in an incident with part-time driver Juan Pablo Montoya, sending Menard into the turn 3 wall and relegating him to a 34th-place finish. The incident upset both driver and crew, who felt Montoya had cost them {{a spot in the}} Chase (Menard was dropped to 16th in points). After the fall Richmond race, Menard remained winless and ranked 20th in points, losing out on a spot in the new chase format.|$|E

On the night of Sunday, March 3, 1946, Sammy Fuller and Linda Mae Jenkins park on a lovers' lane. Soon, <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> opens and closes and {{a man with a}} bag over his head with holes cut out for his eyes is seen holding wires he had yanked from the engine. While Sammy tries starting the car, the man breaks his window and pulls him out, cutting him on the broken glass. The man then gets inside the car with Linda.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DeLorean had grooves {{running down}} both sides. It included a gas flap to simplify fuel filling. The gas flap was built {{so that the}} trunk could {{be added to the}} total cargo area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DeLorean. These cars typically had a locking gas cap to prevent siphoning. In August 1981, <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> flap was removed from <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cars (although <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> creases stayed). This style was retained well into 1982. Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> locking gas caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no gas flap, but with locking gas caps). The final styling for <b>the</b> <b>hood</b> included <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> a DeLorean name badge and <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination <b>of</b> gas flap <b>hoods</b> has a simple if unglamorous explanation—Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the gas flap design.|$|R
