5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>herb</b> and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise {{would be unable to}} access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal <b>the</b> <b>herb</b> and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.|$|E
5|$|Ephedrine: Ephedrine, {{known as}} ma huang in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine, originally as an extract of <b>the</b> <b>herb</b> Ephedra sinica, {{has been documented}} in China since the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as an antiasthmatic and stimulant. The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, when the American pharmaceutical company Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. Ephedrine exports between China and the West grew from 4 tonnes to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928.|$|E
5|$|Karadžić also {{mentions}} another Serbian {{method to}} obtain the raskovnik. He recorded a story {{from the town of}} Zemun about a merchant who desired to find <b>the</b> <b>herb.</b> The merchant locked an old woman into leg irons and let her wander in a field during the night; if the irons unlocked by themselves at a certain place, that would be a place where the raskovnik grows.|$|E

5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to <b>the</b> <b>herb</b> by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E

Later, Dian Cecht's son, Miach, replaced the silver arm with an arm of flesh and blood, and Dian Cecht killed him out of professional envy. Miach's sister, Airmed, mourned over her brother's grave. As her tears fell, all <b>the</b> healing <b>herbs</b> of <b>the</b> world grew from the grave. Airmed arranged and catalogued <b>the</b> <b>herbs,</b> but then Dian Cécht again reacted with anger and jealousy and scattered <b>the</b> <b>herbs,</b> destroying his daughter's {{work as well as}} his son's.

Ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.|$|E
5|$|Cottage gardens, {{which emerged}} in Elizabethan times, {{appear to have}} {{originated}} as a local source for herbs and fruits. One theory is that they arose out of the Black Death of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens. According to the late 19th-century legend of origin, these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, {{to provide them with}} food and herbs, with flowers planted in for decoration. Helen Leach analysed the historical origins of the romanticised cottage garden, subjecting the garden style to rigorous historical analysis, along with the ornamental potager and <b>the</b> <b>herb</b> garden. She concluded that their origins were less in workingmen's gardens in the 19th century and more in the leisured classes' discovery of simple hardy plants, in part through the writings of John Claudius Loudon. Loudon helped to design the estate at Great Tew, Oxfordshire, where farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden—about an acre—where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} on selected local herbs such as ulam raja (Cosmos caudatus), kesum (Polygonum minus), selom (Oenanthe javanica), pegaga (Centella asiatica) and curry leaves (Murraya koenigii) to investigate their antioxidative activities. The water extracts of <b>the</b> <b>herbs</b> were analysed for total phenolic content, reducing antioxidant power, ferric thiocyanate (FTC) and the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test was also accried out. Polygonum minus showed the highest total phenolic content and reducing power among <b>the</b> <b>herbs.</b> Increasing <b>the</b> concentration of the extracts resulted in increased Fe 3 + reducing antioxidant power for all <b>the</b> <b>herbs.</b> FTC and TBA tests on the extracts during seven days of storage showed that all <b>the</b> <b>herbs</b> extracts had <b>the</b> ability to reduce oxidation compared to the control (P 0. 05) from Polygonum minus and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHT) a synthetic antioxidant. Correlation analysis showed positive correlations between amount of total phenolic content and reducing power (r = 0. 75) and antioxidative activities (r = 0. 58) in linoleic acid emulsion system...|$|R

In this research, the antioxidant activity of extract from three selected Malaysian <b>herbs</b> was investigated. <b>The</b> <b>herbs</b> were Euodia redlevi (Tenggek Burung), Cosmos caudatus (Ulam Raja) and Premma cordiflora (Bebuas). Besides, the Vitamin C content in <b>the</b> <b>herbs</b> was also determined. <b>The</b> <b>herbs</b> were collected from Tanjung Sedili (Kota Tinggi, Johor) and Kuantan (Pahang). <b>The</b> <b>herbs</b> were extracted using sonication extraction method at different interval of times (30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes) and at different concentrations of solvent (50 %, 70 % and 90 % of ethanol). After the extraction, the extracts were analyzed for total phenolic content using Folin-Ciocalteu’s reagent and antioxidant activity using DPPH assay. The results show that <b>the</b> three <b>herbs</b> exhibited significant value of ascorbic acid content. The highest amount of ascorbic acid was obtained in Cosmos caudatus in 60 minutes of extraction using 70 % of ethanol. As for Premma cordiflora and Euodia redlevi, the highest amount of ascorbic acid were obtained in 90 minutes of extraction using 90 % of ethanol. <b>The</b> <b>herbs</b> extracts of <b>the</b> said parameters were analyzed again for their ascorbic acid or vitamin C content using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that Cosmos caudatus has the highest vitamin C content, followed by Premma cordiflora and finally Euodia redlevi.
