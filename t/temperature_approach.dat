50|$|As {{compared}} to {{shell and tube}} heat exchangers, the <b>temperature</b> <b>approach</b> in a plate heat exchangers may be as low as 1 °C whereas shell and tube heat exchangers require an approach of 5 °C or more. For {{the same amount of}} heat exchanged, the size of the plate heat exchanger is smaller, because of the large heat transfer area afforded by the plates (the large area through which heat can travel). Increase and reduction of the heat transfer area is simple in a plate heat-exchanger, through the addition or removal of plates from the stack.|$|E

30|$|The {{number of}} {{implantation}} defects remaining after the Mn implantation {{can be easily}} controlled by the implantation temperature. Implantation of Mn ions at higher temperatures enables a higher dynamic annealing of defects during the implantation, as the recombination rate of the ion impact-related vacancy-interstitial pairs is thermally activated [8].

30|$|The {{synthesis}} of gold nanoparticles using citrate reduction {{process has been}} revisited. A simplified room <b>temperature</b> <b>approach</b> to standard Turkevich synthesis is employed to obtain fairly monodisperse gold nanoparticles. The role of initial pH alongside the concentration ratio of reactants is explored for the size control of Au nanoparticles. The particle size distribution has been investigated using UV-vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope (TEM). At optimal pH of 5, gold nanoparticles obtained are highly monodisperse and spherical in shape and have narrower size distribution (sharp surface plasmon at 520  nm). For other pH conditions, particles are non-uniform and polydisperse, showing a red-shift in plasmon peak due to aggregation and large particle size distribution. The room <b>temperature</b> <b>approach</b> results in highly stable “colloidal” suspension of gold nanoparticles. The stability test through absorption spectroscopy indicates no sign of aggregation for a month. The rate of reduction of auric ionic species by citrate ions is determined via UV absorbance studies. The size of nanoparticles under various conditions is thus predicted using a theoretical model that incorporates nucleation, growth, and aggregation processes. The faster rate of reduction yields better size distribution for optimized pH and reactant concentrations. The model involves solving population balance equation for continuously evolving particle size distribution by discretization techniques. The particle sizes estimated from the simulations (13 to 25  nm) {{are close to the}} experimental ones (10 to 32  nm) and corroborate the similarity of reaction processes at 300 and 373  K (classical Turkevich reaction). Thus, substitution of experimentally measured rate of disappearance of auric ionic species into theoretical model enables us to capture the unusual experimental observations.|$|E
