50|$|All waterjets {{follow the}} same {{principle}} of using high pressure water focused into a beam by a nozzle. Most machines accomplish this by first running the water through a high pressure pump. There {{are two types of}} pumps used to create this high pressure; an intensifier pump and a direct drive or crankshaft pump. A direct drive pump works much like a car engine, forcing water through high <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> using plungers attached to a crankshaft. An intensifier pump creates pressure by using hydraulic oil to move a piston forcing the water through a tiny hole. The water then travels along the high <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> to the nozzle of the waterjet. In the nozzle, the water is focused into a thin beam by a jewel orifice. This beam of water is ejected from the nozzle, cutting through the material by spraying it with the jet of high-speed water. The process is the same for abrasive waterjets until the water reaches the nozzle. Here abrasives such as garnet and aluminium oxide, are fed into the nozzle via an abrasive inlet. The abrasive then mixes with the water in a mixing tube and is forced out the end at high pressure.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} work was undertaken {{to extend the}} work of previous researchers and to clarify the influence of both environmental and metallurgical conditions on the corrosion/hydriding behaviour of Zr- 2. 5 Nb nuclear reactor <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> material. The service performance of the pressure tube {{is known to be}} influenced among other things by its metallurgical history and the LiOH content in the aqueous medium. In this study, the in-reactor corrosion/hydriding behavior of <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> material in solutions of different LiOH concentrations (O(deionized water), 1. 2, 4. 8, 10, 25, and 50 g/l) was simulated using stainless steel autoclaves at a temperature of 300 ∘C and ∼ 9. 0 MPa pressure. Four metallurgical conditions were investigated, namely: as currently fabricated (cold-worked 2 ̆ 6 stress relieved), and as-fabricated plus a secondary heat treatment for 24 hours at a temperature of 400, 500, or 560 ∘C. The testing method was an interrupted one and was carried out for exposure times of approximately 200, 500, 2000, and 5000 hours. The degree of corrosion (loss-in-metal-thickness) was determined using metallographic techniques. The amount of hydriding was determined using chemical analysis. Optical microscopy was used to characterize the hydride morphology and distribution. It is shown that for all metallurgical conditions, the presence of LiOH in the aqueous medium causes a 2 ̆ 2 breakaway 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 breakdown 2 ̆ 2 of the initial corrosion/hydriding process (protective kinetics) to occur at an early stage, and linear post-transition stage to occur. In general, an increase in the secondary heat treatment temperature causes a decrease corrosion and hydriding rates, in the post-transitional stage. A heat treatment for 24 hours at 560 ∘C gives the highest corrosion/hydriding resistance, and is therefore recommended for <b>pressure</b> <b>tubing</b> fabricated by the current route. Metallographic studies of hydride morphology and distribution show that the hydride (plates) in the as-received material remain predominantly in the circumferential orientation. Some of the hydride (plates) in the heat-treated material are oriented in a direction at ∼ 45 degrees to both circumferential and radial directions, while the remaining plates remain circumferentially oriented.

40|$|Abstract. The tubing, {{as a key}} {{ingredient}} in the well development, worked always under very complex stress and corrosion conditions, {{the failure of the}} tubing could cause huge losses.

The results showed that the failure of the tubing was belong to hydrogen sulfide stress corrosion cracking. The tubing material could not pass the SSC test, it was inappropriate to use in well contained high hydrogen sulfide. Background During the killing well operation at YuanBa NO. 29 well in northeastern SiChuan basin, the <b>tubing</b> <b>pressure</b> dropped sharply from 29. 4 MPa to 0 MPa, and the tubing was found fractured when removed from the well.

40|$|Gas lift {{is used in}} {{oil wells}} to {{maintain}} the production by injecting gas into the tubing. The dynamics of the system often causes pressure variations and a fluctuating flow rate. Others have proposed design concepts for stable gas lift systems. However, measurements have been superficial and sparse and it has {{made it difficult to}} enable satisfactory verification of the concepts. This thesis is based on flow rate, pressure and temperature data from a well at the Heidrun field in the Norwegian Sea. The measurements have been logged at a sufficient frequency to capture the most relevant dynamics. The well considered has periods where it produces evenly with a stochastic variation around 7 % and then it might suddenly change to oscillations with over 90 % deviation in the flow rate. The wavelength of the oscillations are 7 − 10 min. Such shifts seams to occur without preceding disturbances, and it only affects the <b>tubing</b> <b>pressure</b> and flow rate, not the annular variables. This means, that casing heading is not the reason behind the oscillating behaviour. A gas lift model has been implemented in Matlab to predict static changes in several variables, like phase fraction and pressure. Pressure predicted by this model compared to the measurement at Heidrun coincide with a maximum deviation of 2. 3 %. A dynamical model based on an inflow correlation to simulate the well pressure was developed. The predictions was not consistent with the oscillations observed from the measurements, because the inflow correlation did not compare with the measured data. The pressure response analysis did not show any sign of instabilities. However, an unstable well with oscillations was observed. The likely reason for the inconsistency is the casing heading assumption in the model. The large pressure drop across the downhole injection valve makes gas inflow insensitive to tubing variations, this decoupling prevents casing heading...|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the reasons for low production rate in a producing well of a supergiant gas condensate reservoir. An integrated strategy was proposed and employed for production optimization and troubleshooting the well problem. In this strategy, nodal analysis approach was used for investigation of well performance. IPR and TPR curves were plotted through reservoir and well simulation. Effects of simplifying reservoir rock and fluid model on IPR curves were assessed due to difficulties and the high amount of time consumed when extracting IPR curves from compositional simulation of 28 -layer model. It was found that oversimplification of a multilayer reservoir into a single layer leads to a non-realistic IPR model which may result in an operating point different from that observed in a gas well. Also, different pressure distributions caused a significant difference between the estimated well production rates from single-layer and 28 -layer model. This difference increased by decreasing reservoir pressure. The 4 -layer model had high accuracy compared to real reservoir model and showed pressure distribution approximately similar to the 28 -layer model. Five different <b>tubing</b> <b>pressure</b> drop models were examined using the rational elicited PSP data from reservoir model for selecting the optimal model. Among these correlations, the Gary’s model was found as the optimum pressure drop model for computing TPR curves. Nodal analysis accuracy in prediction of well operating point was confirmed through its good agreement with the results gained from running base constructed reservoir and well models. Results of nodal analysis for real inclined well indicated that a striking difference exists between calculated and actual production rate. Sensitivity analysis conducted on two uncertain parameters including skin factor and drainage radius indicated that skin factor of investigated well is 11.67 for drainage radius of 10, 000 ft. Therefore, the problem of low well production rate was attributed to this high skin factor as a result of formation damage skin near wellbore. Also, results indicated that maximum 73 % increment in gas production of the well can be achieved by reduction of this skin factor.|$|E

30|$|This section {{emphasizes}} on optimizing {{the values of}} production and injection parameters of the optimum scenario by improving the oil recovery factor and maximum sweep for the reservoir. Tubing wellhead pressure (THP) and bottom-hole pressure (BHP) are used to control the drawdown of reservoir. BHP corresponds, where operator has installed control valves (subsurface), otherwise well head pressure (WHP) {{is used as a}} control mode. BHP is denoted by pwf (flowing bottom-hole pressure) or pws (shut in pressure). According to Darcy law the lesser the BHP, the higher the drawdown and the more will be the oil recovery. The same principle is applied to THP as well, however, if the THP decreases and BHP increases, this indicates liquid load up in the well. Therefore, in the scenarios 4, these two controlling factors are optimized. Table  3 and Table  4 provide details on injection well control parameters. It can be seen that the well control parameter (I) is controlled by the <b>tubing</b> head <b>pressure</b> (THP) and well control (GI) is controlled by the reservoirs rate.|$|R
