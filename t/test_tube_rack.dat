40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to test mutant strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for a {{variation}} in eyespot location and size. The technique of phototaxis {{was used to determine}} if mutant strains have an altered ability of light reception. Cells from 96 -well plates were transferred into the respective tubes filled with 2. 2 mL of M medium. One row of tubes was placed in a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> <b>rack</b> and two racks were placed in each phototaxis box. After twenty minutes in each box, where the only amount of light being let in is from a tiny slit directed on the sample, the tubes were removed and then checked for completion of phototaxis. After noting whether the samples completed phototaxis or not, the phototaxis-negative cells were regrown for further observation and ultimately a PCR screen for the mutant gene sequences. Out of roughly 5, 000 mutant samples screened using phototaxis, twelve samples were phototaxis-negative and only four of the twelve samples were phototaxis-negative the second trial. Further experimentation would include the observation of the eyespots under a microscope, culturing these samples, harvesting the DNA via electroporation, and screening the samples using PCR...|$|E

40|$|Radiopacity is a {{critical}} property of materials that are used {{for a range of}} radiological applications, including the development of phantom devices that emulate the radiodensity of native tissues and the production of protective equipment for personnel handling radioactive materials. Three-dimensional (3 D) printing is a fabrication platform that is well suited to creating complex anatomical replicas or custom labware to accomplish these radiological purposes. We created and tested multiple ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) filaments infused with varied concentrations of bismuth (1. 2 – 2. 7 g/cm 3), a radiopaque metal that is compatible with plastic infusion, to address the poor gamma radiation attenuation of many mainstream 3 D printing materials. X-ray computed tomography (CT) experiments of these filaments indicated that a density of 1. 2 g/cm 3 of bismuth-infused ABS emulates bone radiopacity during X-ray CT imaging on preclinical and clinical scanners. ABS-bismuth filaments along with ABS were 3 D printed to create an embedded human nasocranial anatomical phantom that mimicked radiological properties of native bone and soft tissue. Increasing the bismuth content in the filaments to 2. 7 g/cm 3 created a stable material that could attenuate 50 % of 99 mTechnetium gamma emission when printed with a 2. 0 mm wall thickness. A shielded <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> <b>rack</b> was printed to attenuate source radiation as a protective measure for lab personnel. We demonstrated the utility of novel filaments to serve multiple radiological purposes, including the creation of anthropomorphic phantoms and safety labware, by tuning the level of radiation attenuation through material customization...|$|E
40|$|As {{a part of}} {{activities}} to improve the skills of technical staff members through exchange with staff in other disciplines, mechanical engineering staff members were assigned to a Chemistry and Materials Science Experiment Course (qualitative analysis) offered to first year students of the Department of Chemistry and Materials Science. Asking the mechanical engineering staff members to perform assignments as efficiently as experienced chemical engineering staff without any preparatory measures would have been unreasonable, {{in addition to the}} fact that the assignment already put mental pressure on both the group dispatching the mechanical engineering staff and the group receiving them and caused feelings of uneasiness in both groups. To dispel the uneasiness, various efforts were repeatedly made; for example, teaching staff members elucidated and explained in detail to the mechanical engineering staff members about the four themes of the experiment course, which they would work on over the course of a semester, and the mechanical engineering staff members conducted preparatory experiments with the teaching and chemical engineering staff members. By its nature, the experiment course required its participants to conduct extensive observations. It was felt that there were many experiment phenomena which could be noticed only after they had been explained. These included cases where, for example, observation was very difficult because barely visible precipitate formed in the solution inside a test tube, but became transparent when the test tube was shaken, or where after the precipitate had dissolved, it transformed into crystalline precipitate when it was recrystallized. Furthermore, the mechanical engineering staff members were taught that in some cases, it was very important to observe different deposits and compare them with each other. During the regular experiment classes, the staff members are very busy carrying out their duties, such as preparing chemical reagents, receiving reports, and monitoring and managing students’ safety and the progress of their experiments. Test tube racks for small test tubes used for the department’s student experiment classes were blackened, and some 3 mm long sections between test tube holes were corroded and had disappeared due to more than 30 years of aging deterioration and degradation by chemicals and other materials. However, the experiment staff members could not afford to take the time to solve the test tube racks’ problems due to being so busy and under budgetary constraints. The test tube racks were not commercially available goods, but hand-made products created by a craftsman. Therefore, even if a decision to replace them with new ones was made, arranging for the replacements would be problematic. According to the results of the preparatory experiments conducted by the staff members, it was hard to detect a minute amount of precipitate as well as to observe the colors, crystallization and other precipitate characteristics with the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> <b>rack</b> because the rack’s upper plate creates a shade while the blackened bottom plate reduces reflectivity, leading to an insufficient amount of light reaching the test tubes inserted in the rack. While the wooden test tube racks were hand-made by a craftsman, the authors proposed new designs from the point of view of the mechanical engineering staff, using stainless steel, acrylic and other plates to produce prototypes, and a laser beam machining tool to finely process acrylic plates to mass produce new rack units to be used in class. In this report, the authors describe their activities to design and manufacture new acrylic test tube racks, and use them for an experiment class. Furthermore, the authors report that the acrylic test tube racks contributed to improving test tube observation results as expected and that this technical staff exchange between different disciplines was successful...|$|E

40|$|Traditional and {{innovative}} laboratory procedures {{are used for}} biomarker discovery studies and for the appraisal of biomolecular markers correlated to possible determinants of clinical outcome. This objective is easily achievable in our Institution thanks to {{the availability of a}} Multidisciplinary InterInstitutional BioBank (BioBIM) fully equipped for the automation of sampling, processing, storage and tracking of biological samples and completely integrated with the diagnostic section through an informatics platform connecting the laboratory informatics with a pre-analytical robotic system. Biological samples and <b>tube</b> <b>racks</b> are identified by a linear bar code and then the <b>tube</b> <b>rack</b> is scanned on a 2 D reader, since each tube is assigned a unique 2 D identifier.

40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm for designing the equilibrium base-pairing properties of a <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> of interacting nucleic acid strands. A target <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> is specified {{as a set}} of desired “on-target” complexes, each with a target secondary structure and target concentration, and a set of undesired “off-target” complexes, each with vanishing target concentration. Sequence design is performed by optimizing the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect, corresponding to the concentration of incorrectly paired nucleotides at equilibrium evaluated over the ensemble of the <b>test</b> <b>tube.</b> To reduce the computational cost of accepting or rejecting mutations to a random initial sequence, the structural ensemble of each on-target complex is hierarchically decomposed into a tree of conditional subensembles, yielding a forest of decomposition trees. Candidate sequences are evaluated efficiently at the leaf level of the decomposition forest by estimating the <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect from conditional physical properties calculated over the leaf subensembles. As optimized subsequences are merged toward the root level of the forest, any emergent defects are eliminated via ensemble redecomposition and sequence reoptimization. After successfully merging subsequences to the root level, the exact <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect is calculated for the first time, explicitly checking for the effect of the previously neglected off-target complexes. Any off-target complexes that form at appreciable concentration are hierarchically decomposed, added to the decomposition forest, and actively destabilized during subsequent forest reoptimization. For target <b>test</b> <b>tubes</b> representative of design challenges in the molecular programming and synthetic biology communities, our <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> design algorithm typically succeeds in achieving a normalized <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> ensemble defect ≤ 1 % at a design cost within an order of magnitude of the cost of <b>test</b> <b>tube</b> analysis...|$|R
