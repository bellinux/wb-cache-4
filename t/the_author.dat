5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where <b>the</b> <b>author</b> {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E

5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of a copyrighted work, {{as well as the}} economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of a work, known as the right of paternity, the right to object to derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the right}} to be {{identified}} has been asserted, it applies for the duration of copyright, but only for works created after 1 August 1989. If the right is then infringed, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> or director has legal recourse. For {{the right to}} be infringed, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> must show that they have not been properly identified, that this was in circumstances where the work should have been attributed, and that none of the exceptions or defences apply. In regards to the lack of proper identification, for identification to be acceptable the name of <b>the</b> <b>author</b> must appear in each copy of the work in a prominent fashion, under Section 77(7) of the 1988 Act; where it is not appropriate for the author's name to appear on each copy, it must appear in a fashion that brings their identity to the attention of any person using or acquiring a copy of the work. If the work is a building, the name must be visible to people entering or approaching it. If <b>the</b> <b>author</b> specifies a pseudonym or some other form of identification when asserting the right of attribution, that form of identification should be adopted.|$|E
