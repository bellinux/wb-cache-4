50|$|The ATK/Raytheon ROV is {{a similar}} system, but has a 1500 m <b>tether</b> <b>cable,</b> and also carries cable cutters for dealing with {{tethered}} or moored mines, and explosive charges to detonate the mines.|$|E
50|$|By {{tracking}} two positions, it {{is possible}} to independently track two different objects, or the position and orientation of a single object, such as a sword or baseball bat. The Gametrak includes special fingerless gloves, each with a fastener along the outside edge for attaching a <b>tether</b> <b>cable,</b> allowing the system to track both of a user's hands.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, new {{tethered}} aerial robots including roaming tethered aerial robots (RTARs) for {{radioactive material}} sampling and stationary tethered aerial robots (STARs) for environment monitoring are proposed to meet extremely-long-endurance missions {{of nuclear power}} plants. The flight of the proposed tethered aerial robots may last {{for a few days}} or even a few months as long as the <b>tethered</b> <b>cable</b> provides continuous power. A high voltage AC or DC power system was newly adopted to reduce the mass of the <b>tethered</b> <b>cable.</b> The RTAR uses a <b>tethered</b> <b>cable</b> spooled from the aerial robot and an aerial tension control system. The aerial tension control system provides the appropriate tension to the <b>tethered</b> <b>cable,</b> which is accordingly laid down on the ground as the RTAR roams. The STAR includes a <b>tethered</b> <b>cable</b> spooled from the ground and a ground tension control system, which enables the STAR to reach high altitudes. Prototypes of the RTAR and STAR were designed and successfully demonstrated in outdoor environments, where the load power, power type, operating frequency, and flight attitude of the RTAR and STAR were: 180  W, AC 100  kHz, and 20  m; and 300  W, AC or DC 100  kHz, and 80  m, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Eventually some 2,000 barrage {{balloons}} were deployed, in {{the hope}} that V-1s would be destroyed when they struck the balloons' <b>tethering</b> <b>cables.</b> The leading edges of the V-1's wings were fitted with cable cutters, and fewer than 300 V-1s are known to have been brought down by barrage balloons.|$|R
50|$|In 1928 Asbóth {{followed}} up the earlier experimental work on vertical take-off aircraft, carried out during World War I by Petróczy, Kármán and Zurovec. The original prototypes carried {{a car for}} an observer and allowed rapid vertical flight using <b>tethering</b> <b>cables</b> to hold them in position and aid stability.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, at Edwards Air Force Base, Brooks was {{the first}} to fly an {{experimental}} device attached to an HC-130H called the Fulton surface-to-air recovery system. This demonstrated the effectiveness of recovering personnel on the ground if they could launch a helium filled balloon. The balloon <b>tether</b> <b>cable</b> was snatched by the V-shaped apparatus which was mounted on the nose of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Operators {{launch the}} {{aerostat}} {{from a large}} circular launch pad containing a mooring fixed or mobile system. The mooring systems contain a large winch with 25000 ft of <b>tether</b> <b>cable.</b> Operational availability is generally limited only by the weather (60 percent standard) and routine maintenance downtime. The aerostats are stable in winds below 65 kn. Aerostat and equipment availability averages more than 98 percent system-wide.|$|E
50|$|The Twind Technology concept uses {{a pair of}} captive {{balloons}} at {{an altitude}} of 800 meters. The tether cables transmit force to a rotating platform on the ground. Each balloon has a sail connected to it. The two balloons move alternately, the balloon with the sail open moves downwind and draws the other balloon upwind, and then the motion reverses. The <b>tether</b> <b>cable</b> can be used to turn the shaft of a generator to produce electrical energy or perform other works (grinding, sawing, pumping).|$|E

5000|$|A lunar space {{elevator}} or lunar spacelift is {{a proposed}} transportation system for moving a mechanical climbing vehicle {{up and down}} a ribbon-shaped <b>tethered</b> <b>cable</b> that is set between the surface of the Moon [...] "at the bottom" [...] and a docking port suspended tens of thousands of kilometers above in space at the top.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>tethered</b> <b>cables</b> {{relay data}} and provide power. [...] As threats are detected, {{information}} {{is sent to}} anti-missile and other fire-control systems including Patriot, Standard Missile 6, AIM-120 AMRAAM, and the Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System. [...] Its relatively low-power usage and over-the-horizon capability makes it less expensive to operate than existing fixed-wing systems and provides significantly greater range than ground-based systems.|$|R
50|$|During the Atlantic U-boat {{campaign}} of World War I, kite balloons would be deployed by a destroyer escorting {{a convoy of}} merchant ships. A basket suspended below the kite balloon held a pilot who watched for U-boats and notified the destroyer of his observations by telephone via the insulated core of the kite balloon <b>tether</b> <b>cable.</b> The elevated balloon pilot had a clearer view of a submerged U-boat than was available from shipboard locations; and the kite balloon pilot could notify the ship of the U-boat's evasive maneuvers during a depth charge attack.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system used}} two, later three, hydrogen-filled {{balloons}} positioned above each other along a common tether {{to support a}} 9 metre ft, resin-bonded, terylene spherical radome inflated by a built-in fan to a pressure of 980 pascals (10 cm H2O). Each balloon generated [...] of lift, and the [...] radome was carried to an altitude of [...] Electrical power and control signals were provided to the gyroscopically stabilised radar system mounted inside the radome via the <b>tether</b> <b>cable,</b> and the radar-plot-video signal generated by it was transmitted to the ground using a microwave radio link.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tether</b> <b>cable</b> {{catapult}} {{system is}} a system where two or more long conducting tethers are held rigidly in a straight line, attached to a heavy mass. Power {{is applied to the}} tethers and is picked up by a vehicle that has linear magnet motors on it, which it uses to push itself {{along the length of the}} cable. Near the end of the cable the vehicle releases a payload and slows and stops itself and the payload carries on at very high velocity. The calculated maximum speed for this system is extremely high, more than 30 times the speed of sound in the cable; and velocities of more than 30 km/s seem to be possible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{materials}} {{will be used}} {{to manufacture}} the ribbon-shaped, <b>tethered</b> <b>cable</b> which will connect from the [...] or [...] balance points {{to the surface of the}} moon. The climbing vehicles which will travel the length of these cables in a finished elevator system will not move very fast, thus simplifying some of the challenges of transferring cargo and maintaining structural integrity of the system.However, any small objects suspended in space for extended periods of time, like the <b>tethered</b> <b>cables</b> would be, are vulnerable to damage by micrometeoroids, so one possible method of improving their survivability would be to design a [...] "multi-ribbon" [...] system instead of just a single-tethered cable. Such a system would have interconnections at regular intervals, so that if one section of ribbon is damaged, parallel sections could carry the load until robotic vehicles could arrive to replace the severed ribbon. The interconnections would be spaced about 100 km apart, which is small enough to allow a robotic climber to carry the mass of the replacement 100 km of ribbon.|$|R

50|$|Three {{interesting}} {{aspects of}} Rocket Ball are {{the presence of}} referees, <b>tether</b> <b>cables,</b> and the shortened cable duration. Referees are jockeys which tend to run around the arena after you on foot. They never mount a rocket but will sometimes try to kick you or another jockey around the field. They can be treated {{exactly the same as}} other jockeys. <b>Tether</b> <b>cables</b> connect all jockeys, including the player, to their rockets. In this way, if a jockey falls off of his sled, or are cabled off, they will remain attached to their sled by a short cable until {{a certain amount of time}} passes. This allows a jockey to land nearby their rocket, even if they were to be cabled by an opponent. Shorter cable durations are also used, which shortens the amount of time a cable may be attached to a jockey or ball to only a few seconds. This increases the complexity of the game, generally forcing the player to make shots at a net, rather than towing in the ball, as well as making it harder to disable the opponent. The rules of Rocket War still apply in Rocket Ball: taking out your opponents can sometimes be a good strategy to gain some breathing room while trying to catch up in goals. Completing a match is dependent on the amount of goals you have versus your rivals. Winning on a stolen sled will also unlock it in this mode.|$|R
5000|$|Two prototypes {{were built}} and {{extensively}} tested at RAE Cardington, Bedfordshire {{and on a}} mountain site at Drum, Wales between May 1958 and mid-1960. There is still some evidence remaining on the Drum site in the Carneddau, which include the levelled hardcore area with access from the main track, two concrete foundation blocks, together with several metal pegs, which must {{have been used as}} anchor points to tether the units. The major problems were with high winds, particularly with hydrogen loss through the fabric then used for balloon construction and the maximum windspeed for safe handling on the ground of only [...] Other issues were the life of the <b>tether</b> <b>cable,</b> the vulnerability to lightning strikes and the system's poor mobility.|$|E
50|$|Most ROVs {{are linked}} to a host ship by a {{neutrally}} buoyant tether or a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-class ROVs, a separate assembly mounted {{on top of the}} ROV. The purpose of the TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there are underwater currents is minimized. The umbilical cable is an armored cable that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS relays the signals and power for the ROV down the <b>tether</b> <b>cable.</b> Once at the ROV, the power is distributed between the electrical components.|$|E
50|$|The QUBE remote was a book-size {{box with}} 18 buttons {{on it that}} sent signals across a long <b>tether</b> <b>cable</b> to a box with no display, but {{otherwise}} similar in size and function to modern cable set-top boxes. The remote had feet for tabletop use, but could be hand-held (probably two hands) and passed around the room, which was significant since many TVs at the time had no remotes for changing channels. The buttons were split up on the remote, with ten buttons numbered 1 - 10 down the left-hand side, five larger buttons down the right hand side, each with a corresponding red LED indicator, and three buttons {{across the bottom of}} the remote. The three big buttons across the bottom chose which category of channel the viewer would watch: pay-per-view, broadcast, or community broadcasting. The ten buttons down the left accessed each of the ten channels in that category.|$|E
5000|$|Tall metal smokestacks {{or other}} tubular {{structures}} such as antenna masts or <b>tethered</b> <b>cables</b> can be fitted with an external corkscrew fin (a strake) to deliberately introduce turbulence, so the load is less variable and resonant load frequencies have negligible amplitudes. The effectiveness of helical strakes for reducing vortex induced vibration was discovered in 1957 by Christopher Scruton and D. E. J. Walshe at the National Physics Laboratory in Great Britain. They are therefore often described as Scruton strakes. For maximum effectiveness each fin or strake should have a height of about 10 percent of the cylinder diameter and a pitch for each fin of approximately 5 times the cylinder diameter.|$|R
2500|$|The PKZ-1 was {{designed}} by Karman and Žurovec, and built by MAG in Budapest under Karman's direction. It had four radiating arms with a 3.9 m four-bladed rotor or propeller on top of each, geared in pairs such that each pair spun in the opposite direction. The rotors were driven from a single Austro-Daimler electric motor located centrally, beneath the observer's cockpit. The 195kg motor produced [...] at 6,000 rpm, limited by the heat resistance of the insulation around the windings – in other respects it was capable of producing [...] to A ground-based generator fed direct current (DC) through the <b>tethering</b> <b>cables</b> to the motor.

50|$|A 1960s {{proposal}} has a 3100 mi-long near-vacuum tube with vactrains, a theoretical type of maglev train, which could travel at {{speeds up to}} 5000 mph. At this speed, the travel-time between New York City and London would be less than one hour. Another modern variation, intended to reduce costs, is a submerged floating tunnel about 160 ft below the ocean surface, {{in order to avoid}} ships, bad weather, and the high pressure associated with a much deeper tunnel near the sea bed. It would consist of 54,000 prefabricated sections held in place by 100,000 <b>tethering</b> <b>cables.</b> Each section would consist of a layer of foam sandwiched between concentric steel tubes, and the tunnel would also have reduced air pressure.|$|R
50|$|A {{remotely}} operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is a tethered underwater mobile device. This meaning {{is different from}} remote control vehicles operating on land or in the air. ROVs are unoccupied, highly maneuverable, and operated by a crew aboard a vessel. They are common in deep water industries such as offshore hydrocarbon extraction. They are linked to a host ship by a neutrally buoyant tether or, often when working in rough conditions or in deeper water, a load-carrying umbilical cable is used along with a tether management system (TMS). The TMS is either a garage-like device which contains the ROV during lowering through the splash zone or, on larger work-class ROVs, a separate assembly which sits {{on top of the}} ROV. The purpose of the TMS is to lengthen and shorten the tether so the effect of cable drag where there are underwater currents is minimized. The umbilical cable is an armored cable that contains a group of electrical conductors and fiber optics that carry electric power, video, and data signals between the operator and the TMS. Where used, the TMS then relays the signals and power for the ROV down the <b>tether</b> <b>cable.</b> Once at the ROV, the electric power is distributed between the components of the ROV. However, in high-power applications, most of the electric power drives a high-power electric motor which drives a hydraulic pump. The pump is then used for propulsion and to power equipment such as torque tools and manipulator arms where electric motors would be too difficult to implement subsea. Most ROVs are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle’s capabilities. These may include sonars, magnetometers, a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, water temperature, water density, sound velocity, light penetration, and temperature.|$|E

40|$|Mobile micro-robots {{are needed}} for micro positioning, {{manipulation}} or manufacturing small components, or sensing in chemical and biological environments. The design of mobile micro-robots poses challenges in terms of fabrication, actuation and sensing.

Furthermore, the energy source for locomotion has either to be carried onboard (which by itself poses additional miniaturization challenges) or be remotely located so that the energy is transferred through <b>tethered</b> <b>cables</b> or wirelessly.

The main advantage of this architecture is that it allows energy supply over the link, which leads to {{a significant increase in the}} overall operational endurance of the system while preserving good manipulability in terms of reachable task space. Physical connection may also allow the exchange of forces enhancing the ability to perform maneuvers otherwise impossible for the single platform. The physical constraints arising from the linkage can also be used to enhance the safety of the overall system by reducing the task space of a given unit in order to prevent undesired collisions with obstacles or humans. Additionally, the cable might even provide a high speed and reliable communication channel between units...|$|R
