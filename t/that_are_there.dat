25|$|In 1996, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was {{the first}} single-celled, {{eukaryotic}} organism to have its entire genome sequenced. This sequencing helped confirm the nearly century of work by mycologists and enologists in identifying different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that are used in}} beer, bread and winemaking. Today there are several hundred different strains of S. cerevisiae identified. Not all of the strains are suitable for winemaking and even among the strains <b>that</b> <b>are,</b> <b>there</b> is debate among winemakers and scientists about the actual magnitude of differences between the various strains and their potential impact on the wine. Even among strains that have demonstrated distinctive difference when compared among young wines, these differences seem to fade and become less distinctive as the wines age.|$|E
25|$|New {{digital signal}} {{processing}} functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management, Loudness Equalization and Speaker Fill have been introduced. Speaker Fill mixes 2-channel content to use all available speakers {{in a manner similar}} to Creative's CMSS. Bass Management can be used to redirect the subwoofer signal to the main speakers. If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers. Whether you have a multi-channel or stereo sound system in your home theater or living room, Windows Vista also includes the ability to calibrate your speakers for your room. By placing a microphone where you plan to sit and then running a wizard that measures the room response, Windows Vista can automatically set the levels, delay and frequency balance for each channel accordingly for this position. For PCs equipped with stereo headphones, Vista adds the ability to have surround sound using a new feature called Headphone Virtualization, which uses technology based upon a Head-related transfer function.|$|E

500|$|Horsefield {{learned to}} read during a single year's {{attendance}} at school when he was six, after which {{he went to work}} for a gingham weaver. His education continued with twice-weekly evening tuition in writing and arithmetic until he was around 15 years old. James Cash, a journalist, amateur botanist and the first chairman of the Manchester Cryptogamic Society, says Horsefield received some education for a short time when he started work: the weaver for whom he served charged two shillings (10p) per calendar quarter to instruct his young employees in reading. This instruction took the form of the employees reading out lessons to him while they worked at their handlooms. An avid reader, his interest in botany was piqued when he obtained a copy of Nicholas Culpeper's 1653 book, The Complete Herbal, of which he said, [...] "The wonderful properties <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> ascribed to plants excited in me a strong desire to get acquainted with the plants themselves." [...] Thereafter he attended working-men's botanical societies and meetings in public houses, thus meeting a broad church of people with interests not only in the science of botany but also in floriculture, herbalism and horticulture.|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, praising Katy for being a hard working music act and [...] "seeming more likeable here than she did on her debut", though he noted that her flaws were [...] "amplified" [...] during the performance. Sahar from Blogcritics was more positive about the set, writing that although Perry was not the [...] "best singer out there", she made up for it [...] "in catchiness and..... adorableness". The contributor was more negative of the acoustic version of [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] {{and the fact that}} MTV cut out parts from the video recording: [...] "What I'd like to have seen is for MTV to make Katy Perry enter into an unscripted dialog with the fans <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>there,</b> film the whole thing and put that on a DVD – then you will really have something unplugged. For how can you truly know an artist if we don't see such interactions?" [...] Becky Bain from website Idolator favored Perry's live voice and her natural presentation, though she was ambivalent towards the decision of giving the songs an acoustic treatment. She {{went on to say that}} the MTV Unplugged versions of Perry's songs were not able to substitute the [...] "glossy originals". Simon Vozick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly gave the live album a D, opining that [...] "the stripped-down treatment of MTV Unplugged does Perry's yowling voice no favors", and that [...] " [...] songs just aren't solid enough to stand on their own without loads of glossy production". Catherine Lewis of The Washington Post praised Perry's [...] "translate her more rambunctious numbers into an acoustic format" [...] and wrote album was [...] "definitely a step in a good — and unexpected — direction".|$|E
