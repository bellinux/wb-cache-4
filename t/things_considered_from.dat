40|$|Organisations {{wishing to}} engage in {{industrial}} collaborative networks will typically seek some guarantees concerning the reliability of their prospective partners before committing to cooperation. Evaluating reliability can encompass several aspects, {{but one of the}} most crucial <b>things</b> to <b>consider</b> <b>from</b> a cooperation perspective is whether the software systems that support the business processes of some collaborator actually behave as expected. For organisations that rely on a service-oriented computing infrastructure, this amounts to checking whether the functionality of the respective services is conformant to a given behavioural specification. Today’s state of the art lacks standardised methods for creating behavioural specifications of Web services, and also lacks tools for automating the process of behavioural conformance checking through testing. This paper presents a concrete method for creating formal specifications of Web service behaviour and utilising them within service registries for automated testing of service implementations in order to verify and certify their conformance...|$|R

Reliability {{and validity of the}} scale were adequate. Using as sample of 232 university students, the second study further examined the psychometric properties of the scale and compared them with a previous zhong-yong scale developed by Chiu. The new scale had better psychometric properties than the old one...|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} a facility for telemedicine, {{there are several}} <b>things</b> to <b>consider</b> <b>from</b> a human factors point of view, {{as well as from}} a practicality point of view. Although the future practice of telemedicine is likely {{to be more of a}} mobile-based practice and centered more in the home than it is now, it is still very important to consider ways to optimize the design of clinic-based telemedicine facilities. This is true on both ends of a consultation—where the patient is and where the consultant is. On the patient side, the first thing to realize is that most telemedicine clinics are not going to be newly designed and built. In all likelihood they will be existing rooms converted to telemedicine clinic rooms. Quite often the former room will not even have been used for clinical purposes, but may have simply been a storage area cleared out for telemedicine use. Therefore, design is often a challenge but there are a few basic principles that can be followed to create a workable clinical space. This paper will review some of the basic human factors principles to take into account when {{designing a}} working telemedicine environment...|$|R
