60|$|When {{the train}} {{pulled out of}} the station into the clearer light, she turned her face from him toward the forward window, and <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> which her half-averted profile gave him, had a kind of piteous droop which smote him to keener regret. Once it lifted in an upward curve, and a gay light came into the corner of her eye; then the mouth drooped again, and the light went out.|$|E
60|$|The {{new arrival}} {{stopped and looked}} out over the footlights, not in the pained manner of the man in the bowler hat, but with the sort of genial indulgence of one who has come to a {{juvenile}} party to amuse the children. She was a square, wholesome, good-humoured looking girl with a serious face, the gravity of which was contradicted by the faint smile that seemed to lurk about <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> She was certainly not pretty, and Sally, watching her with keen interest, was surprised that Fillmore had had the sense to disregard surface homeliness and recognize her charm. Deep down in Fillmore, Sally decided, there must lurk an unsuspected vein of intelligence.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} subtlest of smiles flickered at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|Her eyebrows were gently raised, <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth quivered, {{her eyes}} fell.|$|R

60|$|On that eventful Thursday week Mrs. Darling {{was in the}} night-nursery {{awaiting}} George's return home: a very sad-eyed woman. Now {{that we look at}} her {{closely and}} remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone now just because she has lost her babes, I find I won't be able to say nasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy children she couldn't help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep. <b>The</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> where one looks first, is almost withered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there. Some like Peter best and some like Wendy best, but I like her best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that they are on the way. Let's.|$|E
60|$|Naturally my mind worried {{itself with}} this puzzle of a being with two {{distinct}} expressions, one strange to me, the other familiar, {{and it went}} on worrying me all that day until I could stand it no longer, and {{to get rid of}} the matter, I set up the theory (which didn't quite convince me) that the momentary expression I had seen was like an expression in some one I had known in the far past. But after dismissing the subject in that way, the subconscious mind was still no doubt working at it, for two days later it all at once flashed into my mind that my mysterious young lady was no other than the little Lillian I had known so well eight years before! She was ten years old when I first knew her, and I was quite intimately acquainted with her for a little over a year, and greatly admired her for her beauty and charm, especially when she smiled and that dimple flew about <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> like a twilight moth vaguely fluttering at the rim of a red flower. But alas! her charm was waning: she was surrounded by relations who adored her, and was intensely self-conscious, so that when after a year her people moved to a new district, I was not sorry to break the connection, and to forget all about her.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} said that except for one lapse his life had been austere, but this is not to assert that he had no {{capacity}} for passion. The contrary was the case. That flame which had been so jealously guarded smouldered deep within him--a smothered fire with but little air to feed on. The moment his spirit was touched by the spirit of this woman, it had flared up. She was the incarnation of all that he desired. Her hair, her eyes, her form; the tiny tuck or dimple at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> just where a child places its finger; her way of moving, a sort of unconscious swaying or yielding to the air; the tone in her voice, which seemed to come not so much from happiness of her own as from an innate wish to make others happy; and that natural, if not robust, intelligence, which belongs to the very sympathetic, and is rarely found in women of great ambitions or enthusiasms--all these things had twined themselves round his heart. He not only dreamed of her, and wanted her; he believed in her. She filled his thoughts as one who could never do wrong; as one who, though a wife would remain a mistress, and though a mistress, would always be the companion of his spirit.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with a little twitch at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|Eleanor {{said nothing}} further on the subject, but <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth rearranged themselves.|$|R

6000|$|Courtier {{thought of}} Miltoun and his mistress. By what a strange fate had those two been thrown together; {{to what end}} was their love coming? The seeds of grief were already sown, what flowers of darkness, or of tumult would come up? He saw her again as a little, grave, {{considering}} child, with her soft eyes, set wide apart under the dark arched brows, and the little tuck at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> that used to come when he teased her. And to that gentle creature who would sooner die than force anyone to anything, had been given this queer lover; this aristocrat by birth and nature, with the dried fervent soul, whose every fibre had been bred and trained in and {{to the service of}} Authority; this rejecter of the Unity of Life; this worshipper of an old God! A God that stood, whip in hand, driving men to obedience. A God that even now Courtier could conjure up staring at him from the walls of his nursery. The God his own father had believed in. A God of the Old Testament, knowing neither sympathy nor understanding. Strange that He should be alive still; that there should still be thousands who worshipped Him. Yet, not so very strange, if, as they said, man made God in his own image! Here indeed was a curious mating of what the philosophers would call the will to Love, and the will to Power! ...|$|E
6000|$|The Hôtel du Paradis at Cannes {{is a very}} {{pleasant}} and well managed place, where I succeeded in making myself perfectly at home. I gave my full name to the concierge boldly. [...] "Thank Heaven," [...] I thought, [...] "Aikin-Payne will sound to her just as good a label to one's back as Howard or Cholmondely. She won't see the absurdity of the combination." [...] She was a fat Vaudoise Swiss by origin, and she took it without moving a muscle. But she answered me in very tolerable English--me, who thought my Parisian accent unimpeachable! [...] "Vary well, sirr, your lettares shall be sent to your apartments." [...] I saw there was the faintest twinkle of a smile about <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and I felt that even she, a mere foreigner, a Swiss concierge, perceived at once the incongruity of the two surnames. Incongruity! that's the worst of it! Would that they were incongruous! But it's their fatal and obvious congruity with one another that makes their juxtaposition so ridiculous. Call a man Payne, and I venture to say, though I was to the manner born, and it's me that says it as oughtn't to say it, you couldn't find a neater or more respectable surname in all England: call him plain Aikin, and though that perhaps is less aristocratic, it's redeemed by all the associations of childhood with the earliest literature we imbibed through the innocuous pages of [...] "Evenings at Home:" [...] but join the two together, {{in the order of}} alphabetical precedence, and you get an Aikin-Payne, which is a thing to make a sensitive man, compelled to bear it for a lifetime, turn permanently red like a boiled lobster. My uncle must have done it on purpose, in order to inflict a deadly blow on what he would doubtless have called my confounded self-conceit! ...|$|E

5000|$|Mel Corkum: An unintelligent, obese, pig-ugly {{girl with}} a pug nose, no cheekbones, a double chin, straight, greasy hair, a zit near <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and pale, pink-rimmed eyes set too close. Appears {{confident}} but secretly has low self-esteem; cheerful mom died in a snowstorm; does the heavy-duty jobs in the Shrikes; lives in Long Bight.|$|E
5000|$|Comics {{journalist}} Jonathan Miller described Jean DeWolff as [...] "a secondary {{character that}} could facilitate {{a sense of}} continuity Marvel Team-Up, someone who knew only the costumed side of Peter's personality, and yet had a genuine relationship with him. Hard-edged and no-nonsense, DeWolff usually made her entrance in her vintage roadster, cigarette dangling from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> a modern, post-feminist take on the classic tough-guy heroes of Dashiell Hammett and Mickey Spillane." ...|$|E
5000|$|Smoking began {{losing its}} {{attractiveness}} as the 20th century progressed, and art followed this trend. Artists mocked the cigarette industry for using highly sexualized {{images of women}} in advertising. Mel Ramos created artwork depicting naked women on cigars. Tom Wesselmann exploited the clichés of sex and cigarettes by painting an exposed breast behind an ashtray. Present day artists acknowledge smoking as a health risk, but some want to fight modern, taboo perceptions of tobacco instead of demonizing smoking. Sarah Lucas’s photo titled [...] "Fighting Fire with Fire" [...] shows herself with a cigarette in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> This one picture sums up {{the evolution of the}} relationship between woman, smoking, and art. According to Benno Tempel, this photo shows that “at times when society tries to create taboos, art can break through them”.|$|E

5000|$|Ida is {{partially}} a [...] "road movie" [...] {{in which the}} relationship of its two main characters, Anna/Ida (Agata Trzebuchowska) and Wanda (Agata Kulesza), develops as they journey into Poland's hinterlands and into their shared history. Both actresses have received favorable reviews for their performances from several critics. Peter Bradshaw wrote in The Guardian that [...] "Agata Trzebuchowska is tremendously mysterious as a 17-year-old novitiate in a remote convent: she has the impassivity and inscrutability of youth." [...] Riva Reardon writes, [...] "In her debut role, the actress masterfully negotiates the film’s challenging subtlety, offering glimpses into her character with only a slight movement of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> or by simply shifting her uncanny black eyes." [...] David Denby writes that [...] "Wanda tells her of her past in brief fragments, and Kulesza does more with those fragments—adding a gesture, a pause—than anyone since Greta Garbo, who always implied much more than she said." [...] Dana Stevens writes that [...] "As played, stupendously, by the veteran Polish TV, stage, and film actress Agata Kulesza, Wanda is a vortex of a character, as fascinating {{to spend time with}} as she is bottomlessly sad." ...|$|E
5000|$|Once at Hugo's, Katie {{settles into}} the life of the bourgeoisie but is soon troubled at having to go spying on some of Amsterdam's less {{affluent}} shop owners to see who Hugo should refuse credit to. After being exposed in a coffee shop, and as a result, hot chocolate is thrown in her face, Katie tells Hugo she will not do his dirty work anymore. Very soon Hugo informs Katie that he intends to marry his fiancee and Katie must leave, stressing that their relationship was just a bit of fun that went too far. Katie, with nowhere to go, runs out onto the street and joins in a socialist march. The police arrive to break it up, opening fire on the marchers. During the confusion, Katie is reunited with George and Andre who are also present. Andre is shot in the arm and collapses, hitting his head. George takes them to a carriage waiting nearby and Andre and Katie board it, taking them to Andre's country mansion. Katie stays with him and, when he awakes, it becomes apparent that romance will blossom between the two. They discuss the subject of money, Katie telling Andre that [...] "money turns people into bastards." [...] When Andre's headwound begins to bleed, Katie informs Andre that the best cure is to suck the blood. [...] "That's better," [...] she says, a sliver of blood running from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> The picture freezes and a roller-caption appears informing us that the film is based on true events from Nell Doff's life and that [...] "her indomitable spirit lives on in this film." ...|$|E
50|$|The story {{features}} a poet {{who seems to}} be growing mad and nearing insanity. He has lost his inspiration for poetry until, that is, he discovers the hothouse. He talks of a naked girl and a drunken nurseryman who both haunt his mind. He wonders how a person who tends to green plants and spend his days {{in a room full of}} life be such a drunk. Plants are peaceful and not intended to be cared for by people so dark and clumsy. The nurseryman haunts the madman. The man wants nothing more than to enter into the hothouse and be safe from the cold. Not only is the hothouse bounded by ice, with no way to get in, but the mans heart has also grown cold with no way to fill in the hole in his chest. All the man wants is to feel wanted. For days the nurseryman would not let him in. From outside the man can see wonderful colors filling up the hothouse. Contrary to the outside, all frozen and cold and colorless. The man tries to get the nurseryman to let him in but he never does. The man becomes very enraged and feels very unwanted. suddenly, he sees a figure fall from the top of the biology lab that rose above the hothouse. The figure smashed right through the frozen glass of the hothouse. The pressure from the smash magically opened the door, so naturally the man waiting outside walked in. The man walked over the figure and saw a naked girl. She had long black hair and just a bit of blood coming from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> The man wondered why she had jumped, if she have been pushed, and why was she naked. Next thing he knew the nurseryman latched onto her and began rolling and tumbling over the naked girl. Then both of the bodies lay there almost as one and seemingly dead. The madman sits next to them and takes out the nurseryman's heart. Then the bodies are taken out and the madman returns to wherever he came from.|$|E
