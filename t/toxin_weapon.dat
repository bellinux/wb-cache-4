In 1977, the structure of VFDF was determined as a secondary, bicyclic amine alkaloid, and it was renamed anatoxin-a. Structurally, it is similar to cocaine. There is continued interest in anatoxin-a because of the dangers it presents to recreational and drinking waters, {{and because it is}} a particularly useful molecule for investigating acetylcholine receptors in the nervous system.

50|$|Toxic {{effects from}} anatoxin-a {{progress}} very rapidly because it acts {{directly on the}} nerve cells (neurons) as a neurotoxin. The progressive symptoms of anatoxin-a exposure are loss of coordination, twitching, convulsions and rapid death by respiratory paralysis. The nerve tissues which communicate with muscles contain a receptor called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Stimulation of these receptors causes a muscular contraction. The anatoxin-a molecule is shaped so it fits this receptor, {{and in this way}} it mimics the natural neurotransmitter normally used by the receptor, acetylcholine. Once it has triggered a contraction, anatoxin-a does not allow the neurons to return to their resting state, because it is not degraded by cholinesterase which normally performs this function. As a result, the muscle cells contract permanently, the communication between the brain and the muscles is disrupted and breathing stops.The toxin was called the Very Fast Death Factor because it induced tremors, paralysis and death within a few minutes when injected into the body cavity of mice.

40|$|Throughout history {{humanity}} {{has faced}} widespread {{suffering and death}} from the proliferation and use of various types of weapons. In an attempt to alleviate the threat to people and states from the global spread of these weapons, {{the international community has}} met in arms control negotiations countless times to restrain, reduce, or ban various weapons systems. In 1972, in recognition of the threat biological and <b>toxin</b> <b>weapons</b> posed humanity, the international community met in Geneva to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and <b>Toxin</b> <b>Weapons</b> and on Their Destruction. However, this agreement has proven unable to prevent member states from possessing biological and <b>toxin</b> <b>weapons.</b> Serious inadequacies of the Convention include the ambiguous nature of the text of the Convention, the allowance of biological and toxin agents for research for defensive purposes, a lack of verification provisions and a lack of provisions in the text to regulate advances in the biotechnology field. This thesis analyses the weaknesses of the Convention that have led to its inability to eliminate biological and <b>toxin</b> <b>weapons.</b> It offers suggestions on how to strengthen the Convention with the ultimate objective of creating an international norm against the possession and use of biological and <b>toxin</b> <b>weapons</b> that will halt both member and rogue states from pursuing biological and <b>toxin</b> <b>weapons</b> capabilities.

Biološki i toksinski ratni agensi ukljuèuju sve patogene mikroorganizme kao što su virusi, rikecije, bakterije, gljivice i protozoe, prirodne, izmijenjene ili sintetizirane (genetičkim inženjerstvom ili drugim biotehnološkim postupcima) i njihove toksine ako su namijenjeni za nemiroljubive svrhe. Obrana od većine bioloških ratnih agensa je slaba i ograničena. Uskladištene količine cjepiva, seruma i antibiotika su relativno male za mnoge zarazne bolesti a količina antidota protiv toksina je ekstremno ograničena.

The use of {{biological}} agents and toxins in warfare and terrorism {{has a long}} history. Human, animal and plant pathogens and toxins can cause disease {{and can be used}} as a threat to humans, animals and staple crops. The same is true for biological agents. Although the use {{of biological}} agents and toxins in military conflicts has been a concern of military communities for many years, several recent events have increased the awareness of terrorist use of these weapons against civilian population. A Mass Casualty Biological (<b>Toxin)</b> <b>Weapon</b> (MCBTW) is any biological and <b>toxin</b> <b>weapon</b> capable of causing death or disease on a large scale, such that the military or civilian infrastructure of the state or organization being attacked is overwhelmed. A militarily significant (or terrorist) weapon is any weapon capable of affecting, directly or indirectly, that is, physically or psychologically, the outcome of a military operation. Although many biological agents such as toxins and bioregulators can be used to cause diseases, there are only a few that can truly threaten civilian populations on a large scale. Bioregulators or modulators are biochemical compounds, such as peptides, that occur naturally in organisms. They are a new class of weapons that can damage nervous system, alter moods, trigger psychological changes and kill. The potential military or terrorist use of bioregulators is similar to that of toxins. Some of these compounds are several hundred times more potent than traditional chemical warfare agents. Important features and military advantages of new bioregulators are novel sites of toxic action; rapid and specific effects; penetration of protective filters and equipment, and militarily effective physical incapacitation. This overview of biological agents and toxins is largely intended to help healthcare providers on all levels to make decisions in protecting general population from these agents...|$|E
40|$|Biological weapons {{achieve their}} {{intended}} target effects through the infectivity of disease-causing infectious agents. The {{ability to use}} biological agents in warfare is prohibited by the Biological and <b>Toxin</b> <b>Weapon</b> Convention. Bioterrorism {{is defined as the}} deliberate release of viruses, bacteria or other agents used to cause illness or death in people, but also in animals or plants. It is aimed at creating casualties, terror, societal disruption, or economic loss, inspired by ideological, religious or political beliefs. The success of bioterroristic attempts is defined by the measure of societal disruption and panic, and not necessarily by the sheer number of casualties. Thus, making only a few individuals ill by the use of crude methods may be sufficient, as long as it creates the impact that is aimed for. The assessment of bioterrorism threats and motives have been described before. Biocrime implies the use of a biological agent to kill or make ill a single individual or small group of individuals, motivated by revenge or the desire for monetary gain by extortion, rather than by political, ideological, religious or other beliefs. The likelihood of a successful bioterrorist attack is not very large, given the technical difficulties and constraints. However, even if the number of casualties is likely to be limited, the impact of a bioterrorist attack can still be high. Measures aimed at enhancing diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities and capacities alongside training and education will improve the ability of society to combat 'regular' infectious diseases outbreaks, as well as mitigating the effects of bioterrorist attack...|$|E
40|$|<b>Toxin</b> <b>weapon</b> research, development, {{production}} and the ban on its uses {{is an integral part}} of international law, with particular attention paid to the protection against these weapons. In spite of this, hazards associated with toxins cannot be completely excluded. Some of these hazards are also pointed out in the present review. The article deals with the characteristics and properties of natural toxins and synthetic analogs potentially constituting the basis of toxin weapons. It briefly describes the history of military research and the use of toxins from distant history up to the present age. With respect to effective disarmament conventions, it mentions certain contemporary concepts of possible toxin applications for military purposes and the protection of public order (suppression of riots); it also briefly refers to the question of terrorism. In addition, it deals with certain traditional as well as modern technologies of the research, synthesis, and use of toxins, which can affect the continuing development of toxin weapons. These are, for example, cases of new toxins from natural sources, their chemical synthesis, production of synthetic analogs, the possibility of using methods of genetic engineering and modern biotechnologies or the possible applications of nanotechnology and certain pharmaceutical methods for the effective transfer of toxins into the organism. The authors evaluate the military importance of toxins based on their comparison with traditional chemical warfare agents. They appeal to the ethics of the scientific work as a principal condition for the prevention of toxin abuse in wars, military conflicts, as well as in non-military attacks...|$|E
