5|$|A letter {{describing}} the original performance {{shows that the}} parts of Titania and Oberon were played by children of eight or nine. Presumably other fairies were also played by children; this affects our perspective on <b>the</b> <b>staging.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to a 10 August 2009 press release, <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> {{area was}} at Birch Cove Park in Halifax. 669 from 68 {{countries}} competed at the championships {{with an estimated}} 100,000 spectators.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> {{itself was}} {{equipped}} with <b>the</b> most modern <b>stage</b> machinery then in use. The deck of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> had double-floors. Four spiral staircases surrounded <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> leading to four fly galleries. Scenery was raised and lowered by hydraulic rams under <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Nobody--on <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> we mean--ever {{has enough}} of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> child. Nobody ever tells <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> child to [...] "shut up" [...] or to [...] "get out of this." [...] Nobody ever clumps <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> child over <b>the</b> head.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> {{was shaped}} like a big flower and {{consisted}} of several elevators throughout <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> floor. Above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> were six large contractible pieces that could come {{together to create a}} large ball over <b>the</b> entire <b>stage.</b> Above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> in <b>the</b> centre, a large projector screen faced all sides of the area playing both live footage as well as video backdrops.

5|$|Dickens was not {{the first}} author to {{celebrate}} the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that had been lost in the modern world.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern Finland was <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> area for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern Finland was still under {{the responsibility of the}} Finnish Army. The goal of the Finnish forces was, at first, to recapture Finnish Karelia at Lake Ladoga as well as the Karelian Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Vyborg.|$|E
25|$|Spore is a {{game that}} is {{separated}} into stages, each stage presenting {{a different type of}} experience with different goals to achieve. <b>The</b> five <b>stages</b> are <b>the</b> Cell <b>Stage,</b> <b>the</b> Creature <b>Stage,</b> <b>the</b> Tribal <b>Stage,</b> <b>the</b> Civilization <b>Stage,</b> and <b>the</b> Space <b>Stage.</b> Once <b>the</b> primary objective is completed, the player has the option to advance to <b>the</b> next <b>stage,</b> or to continue playing <b>the</b> current <b>stage.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{culture in}} Jämtland {{has been marked}} by <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> in human development; <b>the</b> hunting-gathering <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> {{semi-nomadic}} herding <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> fully agricultural <b>stage</b> and <b>the</b> modern technological <b>stage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> {{itself was}} a diamond form, {{with a number of}} singing and playing {{positions}} that would allow band members to rotate around. Two drum kits were typically setup on opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> with <b>the</b> ability to lower the kits down below <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> or raise it to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> itself, as well as move the kits around to different positions on <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Some selected fans were located in a pit inside <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> area dubbed <b>the</b> [...] "Snakepit" [...] by the band.|$|R
5|$|In 1941, Chen {{arrived in}} Chongqing, China's wartime capital, where {{he joined the}} China Film Studio and the Central Cinematography Studio run by the Nationalist government. However, he mainly worked in theatre, {{directing}} plays written by Wu Zuguang, Xia Yan, and Chen Baichen. His most impressive wartime contribution was <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of Qu Yuan, a famous 1942 play by Guo Moruo. In 1942, he also published Rules of Cinema, which is considered the first comprehensive Chinese book on film theory.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{could not}} rely on his limited funds to make a {{successful}} entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy. After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium, Octavian demanded {{a portion of the}} funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against Parthia in the Middle East. This amounted to 700 million sesterces stored at Brundisium, <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> ground in Italy for military operations in the east.|$|E
5|$|Olds, whose B-17s were {{deployed}} to Olmsted Field in Harrisburg, {{was given the}} assignment of locating the Rex as far at sea as possible, and assigned Major Vincent J. Meloy, the commanding officer of the 20th Bomb Squadron, to act as nominal head of the Black Force. Olds selected three aircraft from the 49th Bomb Squadron for the mission. On the afternoon of 11 May 1937, Olds and his crews flew from Olmsted to <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> base at Mitchel Field on Long Island.|$|E
5000|$|Amelogenesis is {{considered}} to have three <b>stages.</b> [...] <b>The</b> first <b>stage</b> is known as <b>the</b> inductive <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> second is <b>the</b> secretory <b>stage,</b> and <b>the</b> third <b>stage</b> is known as <b>the</b> maturation <b>stage.</b> During <b>the</b> inductive <b>stage,</b> ameloblast differentiation from IEE is initiated. Proteins and an organic matrix form a partially mineralized enamel in <b>the</b> secretory <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> maturation <b>stage</b> completes enamel mineralization.|$|R

5|$|Several Indian {{corporates}} such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), GVK Group and State Bank of Hyderabad provided sponsorships worth INR 10 {{million each}} towards <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of several {{events of the}} inaugural Games. Several other corporates such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Videocon and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) {{also contributed to the}} Games. Also, Florida-based IMG Academy assisted in the conduct of the Games.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is commonly divided {{into the following}} stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. <b>The</b> <b>staging</b> of tooth {{development is}} an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth. This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.|$|E
5|$|By May, Harrison {{had agreed}} {{distribution}} terms with A Records {{and was therefore}} able to formally launch Dark Horse Records, although he would remain contracted to Apple as a solo artist, like the other Beatles, until January 1976. After announcing <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of the Music Festival from India in September 1974, Harrison also confirmed {{that he planned to}} tour North America, together with Ravi Shankar's ensemble, during November and December. Despite his stated aversion to performing live, Harrison would be the first of his former bandmates to undertake a tour of Beatle-hungry America; the expectations that this created, together with his role as a hands-on record company boss, meant that the pressure on Harrison was immense.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> {{travelled}} through <b>the</b> {{departments of}} Meurthe-et-Moselle and Vosges. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> had {{most of the}} route as undulating, with a mild climb. Towards <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> entered low mountains.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} week of the 2008 Tour de France, <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> were mostly flat. As {{traditionally}} in the Tour de France, this resulted in small breakaways of cyclists, and the sprinters' teams trying to get them back. In <b>the</b> first <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> sprinters won, with Thor Hushovd winning <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> but in <b>the</b> second <b>stage,</b> four cyclists managed to stay away. <b>The</b> fourth <b>stage</b> was a time trial, won by Stefan Schumacher, who took over the lead. In <b>the</b> fifth <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> sprinters won the battle and Mark Cavendish won <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> rises about 3 ft {{above the}} floor, with 6 ft wide wings on either side. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> is 17 ft by 30 ft. A low wall {{separates}} the orchestra pit from the seating. Doors {{at the rear}} of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> lead to dressing rooms. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> edge is equipped with footlights, while <b>the</b> original painted <b>stage</b> backdrop remains operable.|$|R
5|$|By mid 1916, the {{situation}} was becoming increasingly pressing for the German army. With the appointment of Erich Ludendorff to commander of the General Staff, the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL), in August 1916, the German administration began actively considering the idea of forcibly deporting Belgian workers to Germany to resolve the problem. The policy, encouraged by {{the high levels of}} unemployment in occupied Belgium, marked a wider turn towards more oppressive rule by the German administration. The deportation begun in October 1916 and lasted until March 1917. In all, as many as 120,000 workers had been deported to Germany {{by the end of the}} war. Of these, around 2,500 died from the poor conditions in which the workers were held. In addition, in <b>the</b> <b>Staging</b> Zone, around 62,000 workers were conscripted as forced labour on local military projects in poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|Concerts and boxing matches {{eventually}} {{took their}} toll on the pitch. In 2008, late post-concert pitch renovation, combined with an early start to the football season, led to the pitch not being ready for the first home fixture, causing the club to play its UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium and a moratorium to be imposed on <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of non-football events at Eastlands. In May 2010, the club invested in a new pitch and summer concerts resumed in 2011 when Take That played eight nights, with ticket sales totalling approximately 400,000.|$|E
5|$|Film of {{the concert}} was {{produced}} for television broadcast and the home video market. It was produced by James Signorelli, and directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg, a specialist in music documentaries who had worked on The Beatles' film Let It Be, and executive produced by Lorne Michaels, who had recently departed the NBC-TV comedy/variety series Saturday Night Live. Simon himself financed the US$750,000 cost of <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> and the video recording. It is unknown how much HBO paid for the television and video rights of the recording; US$1 million according to some sources, over US$3 million according to others. The film includes the two songs that had not appeared on the album, and with an 87-minute duration, is 12 minutes longer than the album.|$|E
50|$|If normal cubes or {{advantage}} cubes {{fall off}} the end of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> without being cleared, the number of fallen cubes will be calculated on the block scale (i.e. a counter is increased by 1). Every time the number of fallen cubes exceed that of the block scale, a row of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is lost (thereby reducing the number of rows the cubes have to travel to fall off). This number is equal to the width of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> minus one. On <b>the</b> first <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is 4 cubes wide, so the limit is 3; on <b>the</b> final <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> limit is 6 because <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is 7 cubes wide. If a normal or advantage cube falls {{off the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> that set is not considered perfect (see below).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> is {{of timber}} boards. Over <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is a {{proscenium}} decorated with timber mouldings. Above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> is a timber catwalk, from {{which can be}} seen the substantial timber king-post roof trusses.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Stage</b> Band has won {{the first}} place provincially as the best middle school jazz band.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of François les bas-bleus, Messager received, and accepted, {{simultaneous}} invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an operetta for the Folies-Dramatiques. The operetta, La fauvette du temple, first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, {{and he was able}} to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891. The ballet, Les deux pigeons, which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but <b>the</b> <b>staging,</b> which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police authorities, and the production was temporarily shelved.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels was {{involved}} in planning <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started {{having an affair with}} the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938. A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors. A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year. Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{new owner}} of Swakeleys, CES Properties (Ickenham), {{received}} planning permission from Hillingdon Council to convert the house back into a single large residence, including 23 en-suite bedrooms, a party pavilion and a stable. CES Properties placed restrictions on <b>the</b> <b>staging</b> of the Ickenham Festival that year, leading to the festival's organising committee relocating its planned gala day and evening events to the nearby Vyners School. The festival had previously used {{the grounds of the}} house as a focal point for events. CES Properties placed the house up for sale in February 2015 for £45 million.|$|E
