In 1805, Sollom lock on the Rufford branch was abandoned, and a new <b>tide</b> <b>lock</b> was built further downstream at Tarleton. In order to build the extension, the river was diverted into a new channel further to the east, and the old channel was re-used by the canal.

The Port of London consists of all the tidal portion of the River Thames from Margate on the south coast, Clacton-on-Sea on the north, through to Teddington- a total of around 95 miles (150 km). Up until the 1980s the Port of London Authority Dockmasters were responsible for five large enclosed dock systems and miles of quayside isolated from the <b>tides</b> by <b>locks.</b> These systems were London and St Catherine's Docks, Surrey Commercial Docks, West India and Millwall Docks, Royal Docks, and Tilbury Docks.

A saw mill and an iron works had been built between the timber yard and the canal by 1916, and a large building marked Corporation Depot occupied the west bank to the end of the truncated canal in 1951. By 1896, a sewage works had been built on the narrow strip of land between the basin and the railway tracks to the east, consisting of cooling ponds and a pumping station. This was the Western Pumping Station, completed by 1875, and the final part of the main drainage system for London. Four high-pressure condensing beam-engines, housed in a building 71 ft tall, developing [...] raised sewage by 18 ft from a low level sewer, to pump it to the Abbey Mills station at Barking.

Two pairs of gates pointing to the west, allowing the lock to be used when the level of the water in the Waterworks River was lower than that in the City Mill River, and a third pair pointing to the east, which prevented high tide levels in the Waterworks River forcing the gates open, and the City Mill River draining as the <b>tide</b> fell.

40|$|International audienceTerrestrial {{planets in}} the classic "habitable zone" (Kasting et al. 1993) of stars may be {{influenced}} by tides. Tidal evolution is poorly constrained and multiple acceptable models exist which, although qualitatively similar, predict different rates of evolution. Using different models, we examine how tides may modify several key properties of planets in the habitable zone: semi-major axis, eccentricity, obliquity and rotation rate. <b>Tides</b> can <b>lock</b> the rotation rate and erode the obliquity (to 0 or 180 degrees) in 103 - 1010 years, depending on the stellar mass and eccentricity. Some tidal models even predict significant obliquity evolution for planets in the habitable zones of solar-mass stars. This evolution dissipates energy in the planet's interior (at the expense of the orbit) and leads to "tidal heating. " In extreme cases of high eccentricity and very low mass stars, the heating may initiate a runaway greenhouse, and/or total evaporation of potential surface water, eliminating any hope of habitability. After the spin properties have equilibrated, the planet is said to be "tidally locked" and further evolution primarily changes the orbital angular momentum. For exoplanets, tides tend to reduce eccentricities and semi-major axes, and can also change the rotation period, eventually reaching synchroneity with the orbit when both eccentricity and obliquity reach zero. Orbital circularization requires millions to trillions of years, depending on the planet's initial conditions and the tidal model assumed. Tidal heating also occurs during circularization and planets may pass through a "super-Io" phase prior to reaching internal heating rates similar to the modern day Earth. Tides clearly have the potential to impact habitability and may lead to planets with evolutionary paths markedly different from the Earth. These issues are presented and discussed for the simple case of one planet orbiting one star...|$|R

It is assumed that a ship with a draft of 13. 1 meter must {{be able to use the}} <b>lock</b> <b>tide</b> independently. Because of the large allowable draft the lock must be founded to a depth of NAP - 17. 26 m. It is becoming increasingly difficult to construct the new lock with traditional building methods like combi– or diaphragm walls to such extent. In this master thesis the use of pneumatic caissons as alternative construction method for the new lock in Terneuzen has been elaborated. Pneumatic caissons have been used for many times as construction method. However, pneumatic caissons have never been used with the dimensions required for the new lock head. (l = 132 m, w = 45 m & h = 33 m) The pneumatic caisson method involves the construction of a relative rigid concrete box at ground level that is lowered into the ground by excavating the soil underneath it. Under the bottom slab of a pneumatic caisson an air-pressurized space, called the working chamber, is present which is made up of tapering walls around the perimeter of the caisson base slab. These tapering walls are called the cutting edges of the caisson. The working chamber is kept dry by the presence of air pressure. Due to the air pressure, groundwater is not able to enter the working chamber. The deeper the caisson is located below the water table, the higher the air pressure should be. In this master thesis two construction alternatives for the lock heads with help of pneumatic caissons are elaborated: 1. The construction of one large pneumatic caisson with a length of 132 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter containing the complete lock head including the gate chamber and gate recess. The working chamber is divided into 14 compartments. 2. The construction of two (compartmentalized–) pneumatic caissons which can be subsided independently. One caisson with a length of 10 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate recess and the other caisson with a length of 67 meter, width of 45 meter and a height of 33 meter is covering the gate chamber. Between the pneumatic caisson an immersible caisson is located. This caisson acts as foundation for the guiding rail and moving equipment and prevents piping below the lock gates. With help of SCIA Engineer, a software package for structural calculations, the structural feasibility of the caisson is analysed and worked out. Due to the lack of bending and torsional stiffness in the first construction alternative the occurring forces and moments are up to 2 times larger in comparison to the second construction alternative. The use of pneumatic caissons to construct the lock head has some advantages over the use of a traditional building pit. The building time of 22 months is 8 months shorter in duration compared with the building pit and the building costs are with respectively Euro 48. 300. 000 and Euro 37. 700. 000 much lower than the building costs of a building pit which is estimated at Euro 52. 600. 000. Moreover the pneumatic caissons can be constructed in controlled conditions above the surface level. Despite of the advantages the construction method has a large number of disadvantages. Different conclusions can be drawn up. Some conclusions are in favor of the construction with pneumatic caisson. On the other hand the construction method has some important disadvantages that can not be neglected. A considerably large working space is required for the sedimentation basin and bentonite de-sanding installation during subsidence of the caisson(s). The possibility of rotation of the caisson during subsidence and working under an overpressure increase the associated risks. It should be taken into account that about 50 % of the surface area of the bottom slab must be reinforced against shear. Also a large amount of bending reinforcement (101 kg=m 3 – 219 kg=m 3) is required. Moreover there is less practical experience with the construction of pneumatic caissons. A comparison between the options on feasibility, safety, risk, required materials, building time and costs shows that the reference design, the use of a traditional building pit to construct the lock head, is the best conceivable option.
