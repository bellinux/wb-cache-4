5|$|After {{the breakup}} of <b>The</b> <b>Get</b> Up Kids, James Dewees toured with New Found Glory as their touring keyboardist, having been {{featured}} on their 2003 album Catalyst. While he was touring, his ongoing struggles with {{alcohol and drug abuse}} worsened. After moving to New York City, he began to attend rehab, a process which would inspire the fifth Reggie and the Full Effect album, Last Stop: Crappy Town. After another brief tour opening for Hellogoodbye in 2006, he joined My Chemical Romance as their full-time touring keyboardist.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, James Dewees {{recorded}} his first solo album under the pseudonym Reggie and the Full Effect. While Dewees wrote the songs himself, he asked Matt Pryor and Rob Pope to help record {{some of the}} instrumentals. The resulting album, Greatest Hits 1984-1987 leaned heavily {{on the use of}} synthesizer keyboards for its sound. Their work together on the Reggie and the Full Effect album led Pryor to invite Dewees to collaborate with <b>The</b> <b>Get</b> Up Kids on Red Letter Day, a five-track EP produced by Ed Rose to fulfill their two-record deal with Doghouse. The cleaner, more focused sound of the EP provided the chance to experiment with the inclusion of keyboards and acts as a sonic bridge between the raw sound of Four Minute Mile and the more dynamic, produced style of their next studio album.|$|E

Hornish drove seven {{races in the}} No. 54, also driving the No. 20 Camry at Michigan (where he finished second). In the No. 54, he started on the pole at Talladega and Mid-Ohio. The highlight of Hornish's season was his victory in <b>the</b> <b>Get</b> To Know Newton 250 at Iowa Speedway, where he started in second place and led for 167 laps. Despite his limited schedule he finished 27th with 242 points, the highest-ranked driver with less than ten starts. Gibbs tapped Hornish to drive the Auto Club 400 at Auto Club Speedway in the No. 11 Camry when regular driver Denny Hamlin was sidelined by a severe sinus infection, and he finished 17th.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gets</b> nappe, a decollement cover nappe {{located at}} the top of the Prealps, is {{characterized}} by the occurrence of ophiolitic rocks. The metamorphic grade in <b>the</b> <b>Gets</b> nappe was determined using illite crystallinity and clay mineral assemblages. Samples from the same locality were analyzed to estimate variations in illite crystallinity values and in the parageneses of clay minerals, both in sedimentary elements of a breccia and in the embedding shaly flysch. For samples from one and the same locality, the range in illite crystallinity data between breccia elements and the shaly flysch is comparable to the variation between different shaly beds. Two S-N transects along <b>the</b> <b>Gets</b> nappe reveal <b>the</b> same metamorphic gradient, with the internal parts of the nappe being characterized by middle anchizonal metamorphism and the external parts showing diagenetic conditions. The metamorphic grade is higher within <b>the</b> <b>Gets</b> nappe than in its hangingwall (i. e. the Breche and Simme nappes), suggesting that the metamorphism in <b>the</b> <b>Gets</b> unit is transported. The timing and conditions of thrusting of <b>the</b> <b>Gets</b> Nappe onto <b>the</b> Br che and the Simme nappes is constrained by stratigraphic and metamorphic data...|$|R

5|$|In late August and September 2008, while Dewees was touring with Reggie and the Full Effect, {{he began}} making hints that <b>The</b> <b>Get</b> Up Kids would be reuniting {{to commemorate the}} tenth anniversary of the band's second album Something to Write Home About. The reunion was finally {{confirmed}} by a post on the official music blog of The Kansas City Star, confirming rumors that the band would be playing a surprise reunion show at The Record Bar in Kansas City on November 16, 2008. According to the article, the band had made the decision over the summer and had Dewees intentionally leak the information to gauge fan interest.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Get</b> Up Kids toured relentlessly {{for almost}} three years in {{promotion}} of the record. As well as touring Europe, Japan, and Australia, they shared bills with acts such as Green Day, The Anniversary, Koufax, Hot Rod Circuit, Jebediah, Weezer and Ozma. Their 2000 tour with The Anniversary and Koufax was sponsored by Napster. Their fanbase kept expanding through word of mouth. Venues booked months in advance could no longer hold the demand {{by the time the}} band arrived in town and fans were forced to stand outside to see them perform. To capitalize on anticipation for the band's next album, Vagrant Records released a rarities compilation Eudora in 2001. Eudora consisted of alternate takes, covers, and B-sides since the band's formation. Likewise, Doghouse released a re-mastered edition of Four Minute Mile and a compilation entitled The EPs: Woodson and Red Letter Day, combining the two Doghouse-owned EPs on one compact disc.|$|E
5|$|The September 2014 tour {{comprised}} thirteen American dates, all {{in western}} and central states. At various shows, the Funs, the Neptunas, and Kelley Stoltz were the opening acts. The tour began in early September with dates in St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, and then continued west to Denver, Salt Lake City, and Garden City. On September 10, the Breeders started a short Pacific Coast stretch, performing in Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco. These {{were followed by}} the inland cities Las Vegas and Phoenix, then west again to San Diego, leading up to their concert on September 18 at the Hollywood Bowl with Neutral Milk Hotel and Daniel Johnston. Following the Hollywood concert, the Breeders finished their tour at the Goose Island 312 Urban Block Dance Party event in Chicago on September 20, with groups such as Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Thao & <b>the</b> <b>Get</b> Down Stay Down.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Red Letter Day, Dewees became a {{full-time}} member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write Home About on Vagrant Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make <b>The</b> <b>Get</b> Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's DIY ethic.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the early 2000s, the band {{continued}} to tour and shuffle through members. In late 2001, while touring in Milton, Pennsylvania with the band Submerge, they convinced two of its members—bassist Matthew Taylor and drummer Tony Thaxton—to join Motion City. Thaxton initially took about a year to convince to join the band. Jesse Johnson, a friend and co-worker of Cain's, joined the band as keyboardist just three weeks before the band recorded their first album. Johnson had never played the keyboard before but Cain taught him the parts that had already been written. After their first attempt at self-recording an album failed, the band culled together $6,000 to record with producer Ed Rose, best known for his work with <b>the</b> <b>Get</b> Up Kids. They recorded much of their debut album in ten days, which was stressful, and Rose would frustrate the band with insults in order to record better. Initial copies of the band's debut, I Am the Movie, were hand-packaged inside floppy disks, which were sold {{out of the back of}} their tour van for a year.|$|E
5|$|The camera app {{includes}} a new shooting mode known as Zoe (alluding to the zoetrope), which captures a short video alongside each photo taken. Individual frames {{can be saved}} from the clip, while the frames {{can also be used}} with other editing features such as Sequence Shot (which superimposes multiple frames into a composite image). Photos taken in Zoe mode are also displayed with animated thumbnails in the gallery. The Highlights feature can automatically generate a montage video from photos and videos with multiple theme and soundtrack options. The resulting video can be exported, or posted online through the HTC Share service (where they are accessible for 30 days). A television guide app is also provided, which incorporates remote control functionality via an infrared blaster hidden in the One’s power button, show recommendations powered by Peel, and the ability to display show reminders as stories on BlinkFeed. An updated music app now {{includes a}} visualizer and support for on-screen lyrics. An updated version of <b>the</b> <b>Get</b> Started feature (as introduced by HTC One X+) allows users to perform initial setup for their One via a web-based service, while a new Sync Manager allows data to be migrated from iOS device backups or HTC devices with Android 4.0 and higher. As with all devices in the One series, 25GB of Dropbox storage is available free for two years. Using NFC, the One can also share content between other compatible Android devices with Android Beam, and conduct mobile payments where compatible systems (such as FeliCa in Japan) are available.|$|E
