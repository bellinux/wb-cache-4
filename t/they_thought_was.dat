5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a submarine.|$|E
5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E

He adds that tourism has increased since the broadcast of pictures taken inside the Cathedral.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the reason}} and {{strength}} of this witness will lie here, that God will by the variety and crossness that their thoughts had one to another, and by the contradiction that was in them, prove them sinners and ungodly; because that, I say, sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> there <b>was</b> a God, sometimes again, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> there <b>was</b> none. Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought,</b> that he <b>was</b> such a God, and sometimes again, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> of him quite contrary; sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> worth regarding, and sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> not; as also, sometimes <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> he would <b>be</b> faithful, both to mercy, and justice, and sinners; and sometimes again, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> he would not.|$|R

5|$|Australia {{joined the}} Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, in {{response}} to intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation. By the next night, the German ships had withdrawn, and Australia returned to Rosyth. On 11 April, the British fleet was again deployed on the intelligence that a German force was planning an operation. The Germans intended to lay mines at the Swarte Bank, but after a scouting Zeppelin located a British light cruiser squadron, they began to prepare for what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a British attack. Heavy fog {{and the need to}} refuel caused Australia and the British vessels to return to port on 17 August, and although they were redeployed that night, they were unable to stop two German light cruisers from laying the minefield. From 26 to 28 January 1916, the 2nd BCS was positioned off the Skagerrak while the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron swept the strait in an unsuccessful search of a possible minelayer.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E
5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on {{radiation from the}} star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying what <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a binary pulsar, determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving {{an estimate of the}} mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.|$|E

5|$|To {{make the}} new game feel refreshing, only certain {{multiplayer}} elements were retained as the small team took {{the game in}} a different direction. They evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six series, which <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> about being a member of a counter-terrorist team traveling around the globe to deal with dangerous terrorist attacks – operations which are usually intense confrontations between attackers and defenders. However, the team wanted to fit these ideas into a multiplayer format which would increase the game's sustainability. These became the basic concept ideas for the game. As the development team hoped that the game can be replayed frequently, the team decided to devote all the resources into developing the game's multiplayer and abandoned the single-player campaign.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
