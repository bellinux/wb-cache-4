5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim {{to make their way}} to <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Living.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Gorch {{influenced}} later works {{within the}} Jim Henson universe as well, including {{the television show}} Dinosaurs produced by The Jim Henson Company.

5|$|Another of Donnchadh's sons, Eóin (John), owned <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> Straiton. He was {{involved}} in the Galwegian revolt of Gille Ruadh in 1235, during which he attacked some churches in the diocese of Glasgow. He received a pardon by granting patronage of the church of Straiton and <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> Hachinclohyn to William de Bondington, Bishop of Glasgow, which was confirmed by Alexander II in 1244. Two other sons, Ailean (Alan) and Alaxandair (Alexander), are attested subscribing to Donnchadh and Cailean's charters to North Berwick. A Melrose charter mentions that Ailean was parson of Kirchemanen. Cailean, and presumably Donnchadh's other legitimate sons, died before their father.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for Saturday Night Live were allowed to write sketches for the program. Henson and his puppeteers merely performed the scripts for the segments—they {{were not involved in}} the writing process. Saturday Night Live cast members did not enjoy working with <b>The</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Gorch segments. Writing assignments for <b>The</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Gorch sketches were given to Saturday Night Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E

5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible.

Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|In a 1982 {{interview}} with Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Henson said ideas for his feature film The Dark Crystal originated from his efforts at character creation on Saturday Night Live. Henson told the Associated Press in 1982 that The Dark Crystal characters evolved directly from his Saturday Night Live creations. Henson described the evolutionary process from <b>The</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Gorch to Dark Crystal, saying that because <b>The</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Gorch was featured on late-night television, it helped {{expand the scope}} of his puppets, including risqué behavior. He described the challenge that motivated him to further develop concepts from <b>The</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Gorch on Dark Crystal, saying his next motivation was to draft a universe of puppets for a feature film without humans.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico.

Meet Me in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> <b>of</b> Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E

5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections are {{connected}} to Coleridge's The Eolian Harp as the scene for both is the same. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> Clevedon is praised and seen full of life, and it serves as contrast to escaping {{from the real world}} into fantasy and pondering about the abstract. Both poems also describe Coleridge's relationship with his wife and feelings of sexual desire. The imagination aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The Eolian Harp. Although <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>of</b> Clevedon can bring one closer to God, one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth.|$|E
