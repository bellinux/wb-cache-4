5|$|In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who {{had been}} {{rejected}} as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital {{until the end of}} the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.|$|E

Nevertheless, he said that he was happy with the race. Cancellara, meanwhile, said that, although he was disappointed with the result in itself, he had pride in the way he had performed in coming back from his mechanical failure. After his long pursuit, with the help of several teammates in different groups, he had barely been able to follow the other riders in the group on the Tiegemberg.|$|E

5|$|With ten laps of {{the race}} remaining, Rossi {{reported}} to his team over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> his front tyres were degrading, while Vandoorne was experiencing the same issue. King quickly closed the gap to Yelloly and overtook him for ninth place on the 32nd lap. Vandoorne held the lead for the remainder {{of the race}} and crossed the start/finish line after 40 laps to secure his third consecutive GP2 feature race victory of the season, and his seventh in the series. He finished six seconds ahead of Rossi who reduced his speed, with Leal third on the road, but was issued with a ten-second time penalty upon being judged by the stewards to have been unsafely released from his pit stall. As a result, Canamasas inherited third-place, ahead of Pic and Sirotkin. Leal, Stanaway, Maricello, King and Yelloly rounded out the top-ten points-scoring finishers. Binder, de Jong, Lynn, Gasly and Vișoiu were the next five finishers, with Haryanto, Berthon, Nato, Stöckinger, Cecotto, Negrão and Amberg the last of the classified finishers.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{attacked}} Heidfeld but {{collided with}} the rear-end of his car at turn eight, send him spinning {{into the path of}} his teammate Rosenqvist, who was unable to swerve to avoid him, and ploughed into his vehicle. It came after Rosenqvist was sent airborne following contact with Evans's rear wheel. Despite his vehicle's back-end sustaining damage, Evans told his team over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> he could continue, but Rosenqvist was forced to retire. Prost however was delayed long enough to allow Evans move ahead of him for fifth place. Heidfeld was unhurt and was able to rejoin the race. On lap 44, D'Ambrosio lost third position to Bird who passed him around the outside at turn three. D'Ambrosio then ran out of electrical energy, allowing Gutiérrez into tenth. Di Grassi conserved his electrical energy usage and crossed the start/finish line after 45 laps to win the race. Vergne finished second, 1.966 seconds behind with Bird in third, Evans fourth and Prost fifth. López recovered from his lap 35 spin to secure sixth place, and Abt took seventh. Carroll, Piquet and Gutiérrez completed the top-ten points-scoring positions. Frijns, Heidfeld, Buemi and d'Ambrosio filled the next four positions with Sarrazin and Rosenqvist the last of the classified finishers. It was di Grassi's first victory of the season and the fifth of his career. Di Grassi's win ended e.Dams-Renault's streak of six consecutive victories, extending back to the 2016 Berlin ePrix. Four drivers led the field and the lead changed three times {{during the course of the}} ePrix. Di Grassi led once for a total of 19 laps, more than any other competitor.|$|E

25|$|By 26 March, {{the growing}} refusal of {{soldiers}} to fire into the largely nonviolent protesting crowds {{turned into a}} full-scale tumult, and resulted in thousands of soldiers putting down their arms and joining the pro-democracy movement. That afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Amadou Toumani Touré announced on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> he had arrested the dictatorial president, Moussa Traoré.

25|$|Because of poor planning, {{the coup}} leaders {{had failed to}} provide {{provisions}} for the troops on Lapangan Merdeka, who were becoming hot and thirsty. They were {{under the impression that}} they were guarding the president in the palace. Over the course of the afternoon, Suharto persuaded both battalions to give up without a fight, first the Brawijaya battalion, who came to Kostrad HQ, then the Diponegoro troops, which withdrew to Halim. His troops gave Untung's forces inside the radio station an ultimatum and they also withdrew. By 7pm Suharto was in control of all the installations previously held by 30 September Movement's forces. Now joined by Nasution, at 9pm he announced over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> he was now in command of the Army and that he would destroy the counter-revolutionary forces and save Sukarno. He then issued another ultimatum, this time to the troops at Halim. Later that evening, Sukarno left Halim and arrived in Bogor, where there was another presidential palace.|$|E
25|$|Kahalani moved {{towards the}} tanks behind the rampart and told their commanders {{to raise their}} flags if they heard him. He saw ten tanks, and most raised their flags.

His force was left with two shells per tank. He radioed Ben-Gal that he could no longer hold on. Ben-Gal asked him for ten more minutes. Zamir's tank ran out of shells, and he began to fill his pockets with grenades and withdraw. Kahalani reached the tanks behind the ramps and told them they were going to retake the ramp. He started moving and a few other tanks slowly followed. Two Syrian tanks were knocked out, but the tanks behind him began to pull back. Ben-Gal informed him on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> several tanks, under the command of Eli Geva, were on their way.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Section 1, in HMTR {{we use a}} hybrid packet forwarding approach in which topology-based routing scheme is used for forwarding packets over stable links, and position-based routing is used for forwarding packets over unstable links. A link is considered stable if {{it is expected to}} stay valid before the expiry time of the request packet which is determined by the application requesting the route. The logics employed by intermediate vehicles in HMTR to evaluate the stability of links for a received packet is explained in Section 4.2. To implement the hybrid packet forwarding approach in HMTR, <b>the</b> intermediate <b>radios</b> <b>that</b> use position-based routing include their locations in the header of the request packet, whereas <b>the</b> <b>radios</b> <b>that</b> use topology-based routing include their IDs in the request header, before rebroadcasting the packet.|$|R

25|$|Bottas {{entered the}} pit lane on lap eleven with Vettel, Alonso and Ricciardo doing {{likewise}} {{on the next}} lap. After Kvyat made his stop, he rejoined behind Rosberg but overtook him shortly after. Hamilton made his pit stop from the lead on lap 14, and emerged back in first, narrowly ahead of Button. Rosberg was informed over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> he could not go beyond 6,500 revolutions per minute in first gear because his pit lane limiter was faulty. He drove slowly into the pit lane on lap 14 and purposely stalled his car as his tyres and steering wheel were changed. Mechanics switched his car off and Rosberg selected multiple buttons on his steering wheel {{in an attempt to}} change gear. After being stationary for nearly two minutes, Rosberg's car was pushed back into his garage and retired. Massa overtook Pérez for sixth place on the 15th lap, and Vergne was handed a five-second stop-and-go penalty on the next lap after being judged to have exceeded track limits. Gutiérrez drove into his garage to retire with an engine electrical problem on lap 19. Chilton was forced into making an unscheduled pit stop two laps later after his front-right tyre was punctured because of a valve problem on the wheel.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen passed Kobayashi at the Novelle chicane for 12th {{place on}} lap 33 but ran wide {{and handed the}} {{position}} back to Kobayashi. Vergne was handed a drive-through penalty for his unsafe pit stop release on the following lap and served it four laps later. After Räikkönen got past Kobayashi, Bianchi made contact with the Japanese driver three times en route to overtaking him around the outside at Rasacasse corner for 13th on lap 36. Upfront, Rosberg continued to lead Hamilton and the two drivers {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Grosjean started to pressure Kobayashi for 14th but had difficulty passing the driver. He was able to get ahead of Kobayashi by braking late for the Novelle chicane on lap 40. Rosberg was instructed by his team over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> he should use longer gears at Sainte Dévote and Casino Square corners to save fuel. This meant Rosberg defended from Hamilton over the next few laps because of him having to lift and coast. Hamilton closed up to Rosberg but was unable to affect an overtaking manoeuvre on his teammate who had faster acceleration entering the tunnel. Massa made his only pit stop of the race on lap 45 and emerged in 11th place behind Räikkönen but ahead of Bianchi.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Harvick {{would spend}} the season concentrating on running the Cup Series and would only start four races in the Busch Series. He would only have one Top 10 in those four starts. Harvick began the 2002 season making his first Daytona 500 {{starting}} on the outside pole next to Jimmie Johnson, but his day ended after triggering an 18-car crash on lap 148, allowing him to finish 36th. Later in the season, he made a fine for a post-race incident with Greg Biffle at Bristol Motor Speedway. He was suspended for rough driving in a Truck race at Martinsville, in which he intentionally spun out driver Coy Gibbs, allowing NASCAR to immediately take {{him out of the}} race. Even though it was heard on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> he actually did, Harvick lied in a post-race interview saying that he didn't purposely wreck Gibbs. Harvick was banned from the Cup Series race the next day, which meant that Kenny Wallace would replace him. Harvick scored his first career Winston Cup pole position in the Pepsi 400 at Daytona. Later in the season, he scored his third Winston Cup Victory at Chicagoland Speedway. He finished 21st in the 2002 points standings with one win, one pole, five Top 5's and eight Top 10's. Harvick became the 2002 IROC Champion in his first season in the Series, winning at California Speedway. In Trucks, Harvick began fielding his own No. 6 truck, driving himself in five races and winning at Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} runners were {{separated}} by less than two seconds with six laps left in the race. Palmer and Leal received frequent reminders to preserve their tyres, while Trummer was informed over <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>that</b> to have any hopes of winning the race he had to attack. Quaife-Hobbs slowed because his tyres had degraded enough to enable Nasr to close up to him. Their battle allowed Pic, Richelmi, Evans and Binder to close up causing jostling and minor contact between all six cars. Nasr initially passed Quaife-Hobbs at the final corner on the 30th lap but Quaife-Hobbs reclaimed fourth place driving into the first turn. Nasr finally got ahead of Quaife-Hobbs by slipstreaming him driving on the outside line heading into turn four. On the final lap, Richelmi overtook Pic at turn eight for fifth place while Pic and Markelov lost positions to Evans and Binder. Trummer was unable to overhaul Palmer who kept the lead {{for the remainder of}} the race to clinch the victory. Trummer finished eight-tenths of a second adrift in second and took his first podium finish since the 2009 International Formula Master. Leal was a further six-tenths of a second in arrears in third, with Nasr fourth and RIchelmi fifth. Quaife-Hobbs, Evans and Binder rounded out the top-eight points scoring positions. Pic, Markelov, de Jong, Izawa, Abt, Cecotto and Lancaster followed in the next seven places with Haryanto, Berthon, Negrão, Sato and Regalia completing the top twenty. Jefferies, Vandoorne, Coletti, Marciello and Rossi were the last of the classified finishers. The victory was Palmer's fourth in the GP2 Series.|$|E
