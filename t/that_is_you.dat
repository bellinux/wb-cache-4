500|$|John Bradley, who portrays Samwell Tarly, {{also spoke}} about the scene, saying [...] "And what I like about that, and seeing her like <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> know then that her {{sexuality}} {{over the course of}} the last few seasons, we've seen her use as such a tool -- that's all very deliberate. She presents herself in this way as this beautiful woman because she knows the effect that that can have on people. She knows the effect that that has on Stannis, and that can make men do unadvisable things. So the fact that she did that and she uses that power in that way to have this influence on people. That puts her into context as somebody who really does know what she's doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{began writing}} {{the song in}} Almería, Spain, during the filming of Richard Lester's How I Won the War in September–October 1966. The {{earliest}} demo of the song, recorded in Almería, had no refrain and only one verse: [...] "There's no one on my wavelength / I mean, it's either too high or too low / <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> can't you know tune in but it's all right / I mean it's not too bad". He revised the words to this verse {{to make them more}} obscure, then wrote the melody and part of the lyrics to the refrain (which functioned as a bridge and did not yet include a reference to Strawberry Fields). He subsequently added another verse and the mention of Strawberry Fields. The first verse on the released version was the last to be written, close to the time of the song's recording. For the refrain, Lennon was again inspired by his childhood memories: the words [...] "nothing to get hung about" [...] were inspired by Aunt Mimi's strict order not to play in the grounds of Strawberry Field, to which Lennon replied, [...] "They can't hang you for it." [...] The first verse Lennon wrote became the second one in the released version of the song, and the second verse he wrote became the last.|$|E

2500|$|Halladay {{was named}} the starter for Games One and Five during the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays {{teammate}} Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and {{it would turn out}} to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said [...] "I think the one thing I took away from <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most. But when the squirrel runs across home plate while your team is trying to pitch, there is nothing you can do about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Krauthammer {{has said}} of his writing {{in support of the}} Reagan Doctrine, [...] "I {{basically}} came to the conclusion ... the Soviets had overextended their empire, and they were getting what the West had gotten with its overextended empire decades before a reaction, they got a rebellion, they got resistance. And the Soviets were now beginning to feel it, and the genius of Reagan, although I don’t think they had a plan in doing this is he instinctively realized that one of the ways to go after the Soviets was indirect, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> go after their proxies, you go after their allies, you go after their clients, or even in Afghanistan you go after them directly. So that’s what I called the Reagan Doctrine, it was sort of the opposite of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which was whatever we control we keep. And Reagan was saying, no you don’t." ...|$|E
