5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the water where they live <b>their</b> <b>entire</b> <b>lives.</b> In some species, the young are quite large: up to half {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all lay their eggs on land.|$|E

5|$|Rats {{that live}} <b>their</b> <b>entire</b> <b>lives</b> indoors usually {{are able to}} avoid disease-causing {{bacteria}} such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the Rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.|$|E
5|$|Female {{elephants}} spend <b>their</b> <b>entire</b> <b>lives</b> in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, some {{of which}} are made up of more than ten members, including three pairs of mothers with offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. The older matriarchs tend to be more effective decision-makers.|$|E
5|$|Resident {{killer whales}} {{in the eastern}} North Pacific have a {{particularly}} complex and stable social grouping system. Unlike any other mammal species whose social structure is known, residents live with their mothers for <b>their</b> <b>entire</b> <b>lives.</b> These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, {{as many as four}} generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, the killer whale named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.|$|E

5|$|Amonkhet has The Gatewatch set out {{to destroy}} the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after {{learning}} of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train <b>their</b> <b>entire</b> <b>lives</b> to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies {{to serve as an}} unquestionably loyal army. The block's setting is based ancient Egypt, with themes of social hierarchy and contrast between life and death.|$|E
5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups <b>their</b> <b>entire</b> <b>lives,</b> and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{and social}} {{organization}} among the Mikea {{can vary from}} one individual or community to the next. Some Mikea remain in the forest <b>their</b> <b>entire</b> <b>lives,</b> while others live {{part of their lives}} in villages or towns. While living in the forest, groups of Mikea typically move seasonally between encampments nearest to critical resources. In the rainy season, they often live in groups of 30-50 people near tracts of virgin forest in proximity to their newly cleared and planted corn fields. The houses in this settlement are square with peaked roofs, as elsewhere in Madagascar, and are typically made of thatch and bark on a wooden pole frame. These houses are loosely clustered with generous space between each lodging. The rainy season encampment serves for three to five years as a base for forest foraging before resource depletion requires a move to a new location. Those working the corn fields may live in simple grass shelters alongside their crops until April or May, when they return to the bark houses. During the dry season from May to October, the encampment splits into smaller groups that relocate deeper into the forest to settle near babo tuber patches, with dwellings limited to brush shelters and thatch sunshades, and some individuals not living in shelters at all. In both types of settlements furniture is nearly non-existent and Mikea typically sleep in the sand or pits dug at the base of giant termite mounds.|$|E

25|$|Some {{techniques}} of intensive agriculture may be cruel to animals: foie gras is a food product {{made from the}} liver of ducks or geese that have been force fed corn to fatten the organ; veal is criticised because the veal calves may be highly restricted in movement, have unsuitable flooring, spend <b>their</b> <b>entire</b> <b>lives</b> indoors, experience prolonged deprivation (sensory, social, and exploratory), and be more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.|$|E
25|$|Some synesthetes often {{report that}} they were unaware their {{experiences}} were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling {{as if they had}} been keeping a secret <b>their</b> <b>entire</b> <b>lives.</b> The automatic and ineffable nature of a synesthetic experience means that the pairing may not seem out of the ordinary. This involuntary and consistent nature helps define synesthesia as a real experience.

On the other hand one could not help but notice that tales embellish characters’ lives. Although, they seem to embark on their own adventures the longing for something more is still detectable. These urban legends are often produced {{under the influence of alcohol}} and so called [...] "magical element".
