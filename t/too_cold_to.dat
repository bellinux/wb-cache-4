They trained at WVU's Shell Building, which Mahoney had access to, when the weather was <b>too</b> <b>cold</b> <b>to</b> train outdoors. In youth baseball, Gyorko played as a second baseman.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} <b>too</b> <b>cold</b> <b>to</b> do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E

5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are <b>too</b> <b>cold</b> <b>to</b> radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} {{influence}} was the Gaia hypothesis, that the Earth {{is a single}} living system that self-regulates to maintain the optimum conditions for life, formulated by climate scientist James Lovelock and popularised in his 1979 book Gaia: A new look at life on Earth. Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA for the environmental organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh grass that grew {{on the surface of}} the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was <b>too</b> <b>cold</b> <b>to</b> sustain life, simulated in Lovelock's Daisyworld model.|$|E
5|$|This {{included}} the planting of Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley, a region long thought <b>too</b> <b>cold</b> <b>to</b> {{be suitable for}} viticulture. In the 1970s, more out-of-state winemakers migrated {{to the state and}} started to organize as an industry. The state's land use laws had prevented rural hillsides from being turned into housing tracts, preserving a significant amount of land suitable for vineyards. In 1979, The Eyrie Vineyards entered a 1975 Pinot noir in the Wine Olympics; the wine was rated among the top Pinots in the world, thus gaining the region its first international recognition.|$|E

5|$|Cummings {{was born}} in Los Angeles in 1920 and {{attended}} Redondo Union High School. Her father possessed a Doctor of Medicine from Tufts University School of Medicine and also worked as an athletics coach {{at the start of}} the 20th century at Columbia University and as the athletic director at Swarthmore College from 1902 through 1908. Her mother was a Greek and Latin teacher. Iris attended the 1932 Summer Olympics as a spectator and began competing in swimming the following year, winning numerous local and regional tournaments. When it was <b>too</b> <b>cold</b> <b>to</b> swim, she remained athletically active through cycling. She was not a member of any club during her first year of competition, but nonetheless placed first in several meets in addition to her participation at the 1933 Southern Pacific Amateur Athletic Union and Pacific Coast championships.|$|E
5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of the intensity of that on Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is <b>too</b> <b>cold</b> <b>to</b> support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{cultural}} implications {{and the importance of}} bearing children, infertility in Ghana can be devastating. Throughout the years, Ghanaians have believed that both physical and spiritual ailments are the cause of infertility. Some people believe that a womb could be too hot or <b>too</b> <b>cold</b> <b>to</b> support a developing baby. Others believe that the cause of their infertility is witchcraft, and this belief is often supported by traditional priests who assert that the woman can be rid of a witch's curse and be allowed to conceive if the priest performs a rite in which he asks fertility gods how they can be appeased. Other spiritual beliefs involving infertility include the belief that infertility {{is the result of a}} woman's disobedience to God, in which the remedy is prayer and repentance. Women who consult a tradition birth attendant are likely to be told that prayer is the medicine for infertility, although they acknowledge that infertility is sometimes caused by a physical ailment. In these cases, the traditional birth attendant may blame the infertility on stomach aches and advise the woman to visit a hospital and take the medicine given by the doctor.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, Merlot {{helped put}} the Washington wine {{industry}} on the world's wine map.

2500|$|Because {{so much of}} {{the story}} is set in the winter, it was crucial to film the series where it was likely snow would be available. Due to budget constraints, Russia, Norway, and Finland were deemed too expensive. Alberta, Canada was {{considered}} until the producers learned the previous year's snowfall had been minimal. Other Canadian provinces were rejected because the production crew was told it would be <b>too</b> <b>cold</b> <b>to</b> operate the needed equipment. Slovakia, where a 95% chance of snow was predicted, was selected for the March filming, and there was a blizzard two days before shooting began. But it quickly melted, and eventually the scenic designers had to utilize 1000 bags of artificial snow. Producer Hugh Warren recalled, [...] "We had all the expense of going to Slovakia as well as the trouble of crossing the border, and then there was no snow.
