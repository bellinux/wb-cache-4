25|$|The old French formal garden were {{completely}} {{abandoned in the}} 18th century; the park of the château had a rebirth in the 19th century, thanks {{to the efforts of}} Louis de la Saussaye. Currently only a ditch, the vestige of the old water level, and two small houses recall the old garden. One finds nevertheless diverse trees <b>there,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cedar of Lebanon planted in the 18th century, sequoias from America or an immense blue cedar.|$|E
25|$|While Bianu was there, Timotei Cipariu was at {{the height}} of his career. He lived with one of his teachers, Ioan Micu Moldovan, who helped provide for his daily needs and with whom the former pupil kept touch until the teacher's death in 1915. It was in Moldovan's home that Bianu's {{interest}} in old Romanian books was first awakened, and he recalled in later years how he was treated <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> son. One of his final acts at the school was to participate in an annual demonstration of the May 1848 assembly on Câmpia Libertății. This was the last such gathering, as the Hungarian authorities banned them henceforth.|$|E
500|$|Atherton was {{involved}} in the persecution of Quakers and there are two incidents in particular that the Quakers wrote about in relationship to Atherton. First, the case of Mary Dyer, a Quaker who was executed in 1660 after returning to Boston despite banishment. Atherton was assistant governor at the time, and at her hanging he was said to have remarked, [...] "She hangs <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> flag." [...] The Quakers understood this comment to be an insulting boast.|$|E

[...] It's {{not much of a}} film, but it sort of gets you halfway <b>there,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Yugo." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, saying, [...] "I'm yawning just writing this. [...] Sollett, hoping for a Before Sunrise/Before Sunset vibe, sadly settles for a soggy aftertaste." [...] In a review for The Village Voice, Robert Wilonsky likened the film to [...] "something crafted in a lab by 54-year-old hucksters trying to sell shit to the kids under the cheerless guise of '{{alternative}}.'

500|$|The Violin Concerto was Elgar's last popular triumph. The {{following}} year he presented his Second Symphony in London, but was disappointed at its reception. Unlike the First Symphony, it ends {{not in a}} blaze of orchestral splendour but quietly and contemplatively. Reed, who played at the premiere, later wrote that Elgar was recalled to the platform several times to acknowledge the applause, [...] "but missed that unmistakable note perceived when an audience, even an English audience, is thoroughly roused or worked up, as it was after the Violin Concerto or the First Symphony." [...] Elgar asked Reed, [...] "What is the matter with them, Billy? They sit <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lot of stuffed pigs." [...] The work was, by normal standards, a success, with twenty-seven performances within three years of its premiere, but it did not achieve the international furore of the First Symphony.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{believed}} that the motion control system in Fighters Uncaged did not work and that the fighting mechanic was poorly made. Mark Walton of GameSpot wrote that he {{found it to be}} [...] "immensely frustrating", saying that the controls were [...] "simply broken". Wyatt Fossett for Gamesradar abhorred the system, disparaging Ubisoft and AMA Studios for the poorly optimized game, saying that they [...] "didn’t [...] on this title; they weren’t even invited to the sport in which the ball exists". In regards to the motion detection, Fossett wrote that [...] "Every third punch thrown is recognized and every block you attempt is either exaggerated or completely ignored". Smith compared the combat to that of the luck in rock, paper, scissors, noting that [...] "90% of the time" [...] the attack will be avoided or blocked, while for the other 10%, the character [...] "just stands <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lemon, refusing to acknowledge the command". Jack DeVries thought that when in a fight, the moves become a [...] "series of desperate flails" [...] in an attempt for the game to notice the player's actions.|$|E
500|$|Calvin and Carmel become reunited {{and plan}} to remarry. Metcalfe told a What's on TV {{reporter}} that Mercedes was unable to accept Calvin loved Carmel more than her because [...] "in her head he doesn't. She can't think rationally about this. Her thing for Calvin is an obsession now". Mercedes tried to prevent the wedding going forward, including by anonymously threatening Calvin and by cancelling the wedding plans. Calvin discovered that Mercedes was behind the threats, and the pair go on to have a [...] "day of passion"; Metcalfe explained that their relationship is [...] "all about the sex". Mercedes tried everything to convince Calvin not {{to go through with}} the wedding. As Metcalfe stated, [...] "They talk, shout and cry and she tells him she loves him". Mercedes told Calvin, who [...] "just sat <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> puppy, being manipulated by her", that he should marry her instead, and he agreed and promised to tell Carmel. Mercedes later discovered that he has not told Carmel and she can not [...] "believe he's chosen Carmel over her". Calvin was killed on his wedding day; Metcalfe revealed to What's on TV that Mercedes has [...] "got it in her" [...] to kill Calvin. She added that her character still loves Malachy, but Malachy and Mercedes end their relationship. Mercedes' cousin Theresa (Jorgie Porter) was later found to have shot Calvin.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw, in {{his review}} for The Guardian, wrote, [...] "Perhaps it will even come {{to be seen as}} this director's flawed masterpiece: enthralling but {{structurally}} fractured—the second half is much clearer and more sure-footed than the first—and at times frustratingly reticent, unwilling to attempt any insight into Che's interior world". In his less favorable review for Esquire, Stephen Garrett criticized the film for failing to show Guevara's negative aspects, [...] "the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring". Richard Corliss had problems with Del Toro's portrayal of Guevara: [...] "Del Toro—whose acting style often starts over the top and soars from <b>there,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hang-glider leaping from a skyscraper roof—is muted, yielding few emotional revelations, seemingly sedated here ... Che is defined less by his rigorous fighting skills and seductive intellect than by his asthma". In his review for Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir praised Soderbergh for making [...] "something that people will be eager to see and eager to talk about all over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing. I'd be surprised if Che doesn't win the Palme d'Or ... but be that as it may, nobody who saw it here will ever forget it".|$|E

2500|$|... "The Enemy {{are driving}} us", Bee exclaimed to Jackson.

[...] Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting, [...] "There is Jackson standing like a stone wall. Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer. Rally behind the Virginians." [...] This exclamation was the source for Jackson's (and his brigade's) nickname, [...] "Stonewall". There is some controversy over Bee's statement and intent, which could not be clarified because he was mortally wounded almost immediately after speaking and none of his subordinate officers wrote reports of the battle. Major Burnett Rhett, chief of staff to General Johnston, claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee's and Bartow's brigades while they were under heavy pressure. Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee's statement was meant to be pejorative: [...] "Look at Jackson standing <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stone wall!" ...|$|E
