5|$|Pinnipeds spend {{many months}} at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> awake so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both sides of <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> go into sleep mode.|$|E
5|$|They do not {{generally}} sleep at the surface, {{but they must}} continue to breathe. Possibly only half of <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> sleeps at one time, with one half managing the surface-blow-dive process without awakening the other half.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{porpoises}} are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of sleep in wild cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> has a large, folded cerebrum, {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|The octopus (along with cuttlefish) has {{the highest}} brain-to-body mass ratios of all invertebrates, and is also greater than many vertebrates. It has a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is {{localised}} in its brain, which is contained in a cartilaginous capsule. Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of its arms, which show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organised in <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> via an internal somatotopic map of its body, instead using a nonsomatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves relative to <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> size, the organs {{responsible for a}} heightened sense of smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E

Chuck then brings Ellie to Castle and demonstrates martial arts skills from the Intersect. When Chuck claims to be Agent X, the first human Intersect, Ellie informs him that, according to the laptop, someone had originally uploaded the Intersect to <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> before Chuck's birth. After Chuck repairs the computer, they find a redacted file on British scientist Hartley Winterbottom.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, new {{insights}} into the effect of Internet usage on cognition were gleaned from the results, reported in a press release, of a study conducted by UCLA's Memory and Aging Research Center that had tested two groups of people between the ages of 55 and 76 years old; only one group of which were experienced web users. While they had read books or performed assigned search tasks <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> activity had been monitored with functional MRI scans, which revealed that both reading and web search utilize the same language, reading, memory, and visual regions of the brain; however, it was discovered that those searching the web stimulated additional decision-making and complex reasoning regions of the brain, with a two-fold increase in these regions in experienced web users compared with inexperienced web users. Gary Small, the director of the UCLA center and lead investigator of the UCLA study, concurrently released the book iBrain: Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind, co-authored with Gigi Vorgan, with the press release.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, Susan, Russell, wrangler Carter Blake, marine {{biologist}} Janice Higgins, and engineer Tom Scoggins witness the shark smash Jim's stretcher against the laboratory's main window, drowning him and flooding the facility. With few options left, the group {{goes to the}} facility's wet entry, where they plan to take a submersible to escape. Upon being confronted, Susan confesses to the others that she and Jim genetically engineered the sharks to increase <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> size, as they were not large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; this has the side effect of making them smarter and deadly. When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged. While delivering a monologue emphasizing the need for group unity, Russell is dragged into the submersible pool by the shark and killed.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaurs {{had large}} {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves (relative to <b>their</b> <b>brain</b> size). These suggest a highly developed {{sense of smell}} which could sniff out carcasses over great distances, as modern vultures do. Research on the olfactory bulbs of dinosaurs has shown that Tyrannosaurus had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled dinosaurs. Opponents of the pure scavenger hypothesis have used the example of vultures in the opposite way, arguing that the scavenger hypothesis is implausible because the only modern pure scavengers are large gliding birds, which use their keen senses and energy-efficient gliding to cover vast areas economically. Researchers from Glasgow concluded that an ecosystem as productive as the current Serengeti would provide sufficient carrion for a large theropod scavenger, although the theropod might {{have had to be}} cold-blooded in order to get more calories from carrion than it spent on foraging (see Metabolism of dinosaurs). They also suggested that modern ecosystems like the Serengeti have no large terrestrial scavengers because gliding birds now do the job much more efficiently, while large theropods did not face competition for the scavenger ecological niche from gliding birds.|$|E

25|$|Social stress, {{especially}} from overpopulation and crowding during early life, can cause brain damage and impair behavior development.

25|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, {{possibly}} {{more so than}} any other order of invertebrates. The level of their intelligence and learning capability are debated, but maze and problem-solving studies show they have both short- and long-term memory. Octopus have a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is localized in <b>their</b> <b>brain.</b> Two-thirds of an octopus' neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of their arms. Octopus arms show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even when they have no input from the brain.
