40|$|International audienceThe {{caudal fin}} of {{swimming}} animals can be modelled as a thrust-producing flapping foil. When considered alone, such a foil produces on average a jet wake {{with a positive}} net momentum. It {{has been argued that}} the instability characteristics of these averaged wakes are linked to the propulsion efficiency of swimming animals. Here, we reconsider this question by taking into account both the thrust and the drag exerted on a self-propelled swimming body. To do so, we study the stability of a family of momentumless wakes, constructed as the Oseen approximation of a force doublet moving at constant velocity. By performing a local stability analysis, we first show that these wakes undergo a transition from absolute to convective instability. Then, using the time stepper approach by integrating the linearised Navier–Stokes system, we investigate the global stability and reveal the influence of a non-parallel base flow as well as the role of the locally absolutely unstable upstream region in the wake. Finally, to complete the global scenario, we address the nonlinear evolution of the wake disturbance. These results are then discussed in the context of aquatic locomotion. According to the present stability results, and assuming the Oseen approximation whose validity has been assessed only for moderate Reynolds number, the momentumless wake of aquatic animals is generally stable, whereas the corresponding <b>thrust</b> <b>part</b> is unstable. It is therefore essential to consider all forces exerted on a self-propelled animal when discussing its wake stability and its propulsion efficiency...|$|E

It was intended to be a reusable liquid oxygen/RP- 1 booster engine of approximately 1 Mlbf <b>thrust.</b> <b>Part</b> of the test campaign consisted of testing subscale components to study key technologies such as oxygenrich, liquid oxygen/RP- 1 combustion. In late 2003, the subscale preburner completed 4 hot-fire tests at Stennis Space Center with various hardware configurations and operating conditions, but before all planned tests could be completed the RS- 84 engine development program was canceled in 2004. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the {{development of}} an oxygen-rich, liquid oxygen/RP- 1 combustion engine. Aerojet Rocketdyne and NASA completed testing of the subscale preburner in 2014 at Marshall Space Flight Center in an effort to better understand the chug encountered during the 2003 testing and to collect performance information over a wider range of operating conditions. The 2003 and 2014 data sets included extreme chug oscillations that reached nearly 200 % of the chamber pressure and were reduced to well below 10 % of the chamber pressure by incorporating a fuel orifice upstream of the fuel manifold.

40|$|Multi-beam swath {{bathymetry}} {{carried out}} in NW Gulf of Cadiz(offshore SW Iberia - MATESPRO campaign) revealed several intriguing morphologic features, lying at depths between - 3900 and - 4700 m., in an area characterized by very shallow general slope gradients (dipping approximately 0. 4 degrees). These three dimensional features are characterized by elliptical crescent shapes of kilometric length (major axis around 5 km), displaying internal escarpments up to 100 m high and slopes varying between 6 and 14 degrees. A single channel seismic profile acquired across two of these features shows {{that they have a}} sub-surface composite structure. The internal part of the crescent consists of a depression filled up with upslope prograding sedimentary units developing towards the scarp that sharply truncates the sedimentary horizons. The growth processes of these structures appears to be by retrogressive displacement of a morphological scarp and remobilization followed by deposition of the eroded material in front of the scarp, prograding towards it. This process is similar to the development of contourite bodies in which the current direction is parallel to the scarp, whilst in the present case the flow direction may be mainly perpendicular to the scarp. These units are overlain by a sub-horizontal turbidite-like sedimentary unit that partially infills the depression. A deep multi-channel seismic profile across the same structure revealed the existence of an underlying <b>thrust,</b> <b>part</b> of a major structure, the Gulf of Cadiz Accretionary Prism. These singular features are interpreted as the coupled of sedimentary and tectonic processes. It is proposed that the Deep Submarine Giant Scours formed when a local morphologic irregularity, corresponding to the bathymetric expression of movement on an underlying thrust, is enhanced by the erosional activity of turbidity and thermohaline bottom currents driven by the formation of local eddies in front of the scarp.

Early faults with an extensional geometry are common throughout the section leading to omission of small packets of strata. The faults are clearly tectonic as the fault planes are characteristically mineralised by vein-quartz which displays slickenside striae. They also have a well constrained geometry and there is absence of any chaotic disturbed sediment associated with deformation of unlithified sediment. Some of the early extensional faults have classic listric geometries, their trajectories curving sharply and abruptly into bed-parallel detachments. Displacements on individual faults are small (cmm) but cumulatively they may reflect considerable extension, The faults are easily distinguished from the late low-angle normal faults, well documented in the BGS memoir.

40|$|Abstract: Within {{the last}} decade, modern petrological and geochronological methods in combi-nation with {{detailed}} {{studies of the}} field geology have allowed the reconstruction of tectonic processes in the northwestern part of the Caribbean Plate. The development of an oceanic Proto-Yucatán Basin can be traced from the Late Jurassic to the Mid-Cretaceous. From the Mid-Cretaceous onward, an interaction of this basin with the Caribbean Arc can be observed. Geochro-nological data prove continuous magmatic activity and generation of HP mineral suites in the Caribbean Arc from the Aptian to the Campanian/Maastrichtian. Magmatism ceased at least in onshore central Cuba at about 75 Ma, probably as {{the southern edge of}} the continental Yucatán Block began to interact with the advancing arc system. Similarly, the youngest recorded ages for peak metamorphism of high-pressure metamorphic rocks in Cuba cluster at 70 Ma; rapid uplift/ exhumation of these rocks occurred thereafter. After this latest Cretaceous interaction with the southern Yucatán Block, the northern Caribbean Arc was dismembered as it entered the Proto-Yucatán Basin region. Because of the continued NE-directed movement, Proto-Yucatán Basin sedi-ments were accreted to the arc and now form the North Cuban fold and <b>thrust</b> belt. <b>Parts</b> of the island arc have been thrust onto the southern Bahamas Platform along the Eocene suture zone in Cuba...|$|R

Most of the contact between ALCAPA and TiszaDacia being covered by post-tectonic deposits, these effects can best be observed in northern Romania. Sedimentological data on facies, palaeocurrents and modal composition of sandstones combined with micropalaeontological data and 2 D wellcalibrated seismic lines constrain the tectonic history of the contact zone between ALCAPA and TiszaDacia. Pervasive deposition of sand-dominated siliciclastics beginning in late Early Oligocene (Late Rupelian) times is interpreted to reflect the onset of convergence between ALCAPA and TiszaDacia in the study area. The depocentre of coarse siliciclastic material migrates southward, finally forming a southeastward-thinning clastic wedge in the Transylvanian Basin.
