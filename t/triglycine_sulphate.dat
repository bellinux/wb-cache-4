The model takes into consideration the ceramic/polymer interfacial charge and the nonlinear hysteresis nature of the ferroelectric constituent materials to study the poling process of multilayered structures. The results obtained are compared with available experimental results on double-layer lead zirconate titanate/polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene and triple-layered <b>triglycine</b> sulphate/polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene/triglycine <b>sulphate</b> systems.

On the calculated relief, wide deep channels have been found which could account for the easy direction on minus domains. The easy direction on plus domains originates in an anisotropic interaction between nematic molecules and those of the crystal.

40|$|We operate {{dynamic force}} {{microscopy}} (DFM) in non-contact mode under ultrahigh vacuum conditions {{in order to}} differentiate local chemical inhomogeneities from ferroelectric domains in bulk single crystals of <b>triglycine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (TGS), Individual layers of both mixed glycine and sulphate, and pure glycine ions are resolved resulting in a lateral material contrast of 5 nm and a sub-unit cell vertical contrast. The clue information is deduced when analysing the excitation amplitude A(exc) applied to the piezo shaker in constant amplitude DFM which is strongly affected either by the short-range chemical force or the longer range electrostatic contribution. The latter arises from the bound surface charge within individual ferroelectric domains and results in a long-range tip-sample interaction. From variation of the bias voltage applied to the TGS counter electrode we deduce {{the sign of the}} bound surface charge within each ferroelectric domain. Hence, domain walls that separate regions of antiparallel polarization are resolved down to a 9 nm domain wall width. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
