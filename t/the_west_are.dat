5|$|Denver's {{early years}} as a major train hub of <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>are</b> still very visible today. Trains stop in Denver at {{historic}} Union Station, where travelers can access RTD's 16th Street Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city. Union Station will also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, {{at the completion of}} FasTracks.|$|E
5|$|Just {{beyond the}} station, to <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> <b>are</b> {{a pair of}} relief lines to allow slower trains to be overtaken. There are also some {{cross-over}} points, allowing trains to terminate on the westbound relief line and then return eastwards.|$|E
5|$|The station's geology is {{dominated}} by the Tomkinson Group, a formation comprising sedimentary rocks of the Paleoproterozoic era that is over 1.6 billion years old. The Tomkinson Group includes layers of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, with some claystone and siltstone, deposited in a fluvial to shallow marine environment. There are also Cambrian basaltic rocks, particularly near the homestead. The eastern parts of the station form a stony plateau within the Ashburton Range. The central parts are flat and include claypans, while to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>are</b> stony ridges. The region is drained by an ephemeral waterway, Tomkinson Creek, and is considered a good candidate to contain manganese deposits, the mineral having been extracted in the 1950s and 1960s at the Mucketty mine just east of Muckaty Station.|$|E

5|$|At Steeles Avenue, {{the freeway}} enters the Regional Municipality of York. To the east are {{industrial}} units, while on <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>are</b> residential suburbs. This land-use persists {{north to the}} Highway407 ETR interchange, a multi-level stack interchange with two flyovers. North of Highway407, the freeway crosses Highway7, where the HOV lanes transition to standard through lanes. The freeway passes west of Buttonville Municipal Airport and then interchanges with 16thAvenue. It narrows and the central barrier ends; a grass median taking its place between the opposing lanes. The land-use density continues to drop, {{with the appearance of}} some open spaces and farms interspersed with industrial and commercial buildings. By 19thAvenue, just north of the Honda Canada headquarters in Markham, the land-use is agricultural on both sides of Highway404. Highway 404 continues north, forming the eastern boundary of the municipalities of Richmond Hill, Aurora and Newmarket and the western boundary of Whitchurch-Stouffville. North of Wellington Street, the highway reduces in width to four lanes, which is its configuration north through East Gwillimbury. The route continues, passing east of the community of Sharon, eventually curving northeast and terminating at an at-grade intersection with Woodbine Avenue immediately south of Ravenshoe Road (York Regional Road32).|$|E
5|$|Within the interior, {{the upper}} and middle floors are State floors; they are in turn divided into several {{reception}} rooms, throne rooms and galleries complete with royal portraits of every Chakri Monarchs (including Second King Pinklao) and their consorts.

In {{other parts of the}} throne hall there are also libraries and rooms where the ashes of Kings (Rama IV to Rama VIII) and their Queens are housed. Many of the European-made chandeliers inside the Hall initially belonged to Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse; however they proved too big for his own residence and he eventually gave them to King Chulalongkron as gifts. The throne hall was also the first structure in Thailand in which electricity was installed, at the insistence of Prince Devavongse Varopakar. The lower floor or ground floor is reserved for servants and the Royal Guards. Currently there is a museum displaying old weapons.|$|E
