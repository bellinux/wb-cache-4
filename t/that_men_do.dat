25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church {{does not}} {{consider}} the age of Church Fathers to be over and includes later influential writers {{up to the present}} day. The Orthodox view is <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>do</b> not have to agree on every detail, much less be infallible, to be considered Church Fathers. Rather, Orthodox doctrine is determined by the consensus of the Holy Fathers—those points on which they do agree. This consensus guides the church in questions of dogma, the correct interpretation of scripture, and to distinguish the authentic sacred tradition of the Church from false teachings.|$|E
25|$|Kierski's {{research}} claimed <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>do</b> {{acknowledge that}} male {{fear of the}} feminine can have a strong influence on both hetero- and homosexual men. The research has also indicated that {{there appears to be}} a link between fear of the feminine and men's negative views about counseling and psychotherapy. In addition, this research has identified four possible groups of experiences that lead to male fear of the feminine, which relate to internal and external triggers. These are: Experiencing vulnerability and uncertainty; women who are strong and competent; women who are angry or aggressive; women who are like their mothers.|$|E

25|$|Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises {{as the son}} of Anthemion, {{who earned}} his fortune with {{intelligence}} and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well-suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>do</b> not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue.|$|E
500|$|Stating in her preface that [...] "my main {{argument}} {{is built on}} this simple principle, that if [...] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all", Wollstonecraft contends that society will degenerate without educated women, particularly because mothers are the primary educators of young children. She attributes the problem of uneducated women to men and [...] "a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who [...] females rather as women than human creatures". Women are capable of rationality; it only appears that they are not, because men have refused to educate them and encouraged them to be frivolous (Wollstonecraft describes silly women as [...] "spaniels" [...] and [...] "toys"). While stressing it is of the same kind, she entertains the notion that women {{might not be able}} to attain the same degree of knowledge <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
500|$|Because of women's {{expanded}} {{roles in}} the workforce have generally not been accompanied by any relaxation of expectations for their family and domestic activities, many women today face the [...] "double burden" [...] of home and work responsibilities. Women take on the largest portion of the domestic obligations of the home, {{even when they are}} working full-time jobs. This breeds anger and frustration, as women know they do the majority of the housework on top of their careers. There have been said to be more reasons, other than gender roles, as to why there is a difference in the housework performed by men and women. Some theories have suggested that women's expectations for household cleanliness are higher than men's. Women feel like they must be responsible for the condition of the home in a way <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>do</b> not. Men do invest most of their time in their careers, but women spend double that time caring for the children, state of the home and taking care of the domestic responsibilities. In a graph from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2004, that compare the workload of married men and {{women between the ages of}} 25-54, women are displayed as performing one hundred percent more housework than men, and men are displayed as having more leisure time than women. As the double burden increased in 1980, women became more critical of their marriages than men and wanted the men to do more around the house to ease the burden of a second shift. The double burden of women who have jobs and still shoulder the majority of the housework at home leads to women filing or initiating divorce.|$|E

2500|$|The critic Anthony Holden {{wrote in}} The Observer on his {{experience}} of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards. His overall {{view of the}} series was very negative—"the Potter saga was essentially patronising, very conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain." [...] A review in The Guardian echoed this interpretation and stated that [...] "despite all of the books' gestures to multiculturalism and gender equality, Harry Potter is a conservative; a paternalistic, One-Nation Tory, perhaps, but a Tory nonetheless." [...] Salon.com critic Christine Schoefer has also criticised the books as sexist, claiming that the series presents a patriarchal world filled with stereotypes and adherence to [...] "the conventional assumption <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>do</b> and should run the world".|$|E
