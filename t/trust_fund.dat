5|$|Trust {{funds are}} {{earmarked}} for specific programs and purposes {{in accordance with}} a statute that designates the fund as a trust. Its statutory designation distinguishes the fund as a trust rather than a special fund. The Highway <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund</b> {{is an example of}} trust funds.|$|E
5|$|Fiduciary {{funds are}} used to account for assets held in trust by the {{government}} for the benefit of individuals or other entities. The employee pension fund, created by the State of Maryland to provide retirement benefits for its employees, {{is an example of a}} fiduciary fund. Financial statements may further distinguish fiduciary funds as either trust or agency funds; a <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> generally exists for a longer period of time than an agency fund.|$|E
50|$|As of 2009, 131 county housing <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> existed {{across the}} U.S. In {{thirteen}} states, 41 county <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> existed. In addition, 51 county <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> {{are in place}} in Pennsylvania, and 39 county <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> exist {{in the state of}} Washington. These 90 funds were established by state enabling legislation. In 2007, these county <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> together received approximately $138 million per year in revenues. That year, these Funds leveraged $10.46 in external public and private contributions for every $1 of funding. Most commonly, the revenue for these funds stems from document recording fees.|$|R

The fund administered surplus monies from wartime service canteens for the families of former soldiers. Stevenson obtained a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Melbourne in 1948. A founding patron of the Council of Ex-Servicewomen's Associations, she was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1960 Queen's Birthday Honours for her welfare work on behalf of female veterans. She helped set up the Scholarship <b>Trust</b> <b>Fund</b> for Civilian Widows' Children in 1963, and was a research officer with the New South Wales Council on the Ageing (COTA) from 1969 to 1978. In 1975, Stevenson was involved in establishing the Kings Cross Community Aid and Information Service, serving for a time as President and {{as a member of the}} Management Committee until 1987.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{beautification}} plan for the Midway Plaisance, Time was constructed from {{a new type of}} molded, steel-reinforced concrete that was claimed to be more durable and cheaper than alternatives. It was said to be the first of any kind of finished work of art made of concrete. Before the completion of Millennium Park in 2004, it was considered the most important installation in the Chicago Park District. Time is one of several Chicago works of art funded by Benjamin Ferguson's <b>trust</b> <b>fund.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{controversial}} plan, {{known as}} the Major Moves plan, was passed in 2006. The Indiana Toll Road was leased to Statewide Mobility Partners, a joint venture company owned by Spanish firm Cintra and Australia's Macquarie Infrastructure Group for 75 years {{in exchange for a}} one time payment of $3.85 billion. The measure was opposed by most Democrats, who began an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling the road to foreign nations. The income from the lease was used to finance a backlog of public transportation projects and create a $500 million <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> to generate revenue for the maintenance of the highway system.|$|E

5|$|A84-201 {{continued}} and next landed at RAAF Woomera Airfield in South Australia to refuel. Its nose wheel locked up while landing due to ice accretion, {{but this was}} able to be repaired and the aircraft took off at 0:19am, local time. The repairs delayed the aircraft by 83 minutes, however. A84-201 arrived at Harewood Airport in Christchurch at 4:32am local time, and placed second in the race with a flight time of 22hours and 29minutes. The winning aircraft, RAF Canberra WE139, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Monty Burton completed its flight in 22hours and 25minutes.

He also established the state's largest-ever reserve <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> using income from the state's sales, income, corporate, coal, severance, and property taxes. He exceeded his goal of having a 7.4percent minority representation in the state workforce, and appointed three times more African-Americans than the previous administration had recruited. He also appointed more women to government positions than his predecessor, including Sara Combs, the first woman to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E

50|$|<b>Trust</b> <b>Funds</b> are {{typically}} funded with a dedicated source of revenue, though {{they can be}} funded through general budget allocations.

50|$|Housing <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> are {{established}} sources {{of funding for}} affordable housing construction and other related purposes created by governments in the United States (U.S.). Housing <b>Trust</b> <b>Funds</b> (HTF) began {{as a way of}} funding affordable housing in the late 1970s. Since then, elected government officials from all levels of government (national, state, county and local) in the U.S. have established housing <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> to support the construction, acquisition, and preservation of affordable housing and related services to meet the housing needs of low-income households. Ideally, HTFs are funded through dedicated revenues like real estate transfer taxes or document recording fees to ensure a steady stream of funding rather than being dependent on regular budget processes. As of 2016, 400 state, local and county <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> existed across the U.S.|$|R
