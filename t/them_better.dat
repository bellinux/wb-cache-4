5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} on September 15, 2015 for Microsoft Windows and OS X, and on July 17, 2016 for Linux. Fox has expressed interest in releasing Undertale on other platforms, but is unable to port it to Nintendo platforms without reprogramming the game due to the engine's lack {{of support for the}} platforms. A patch was released in January 2016, fixing bugs and altering the appearance of blue attacks to help colorblind players see <b>them</b> <b>better.</b> Sony Interactive Entertainment announced during E3 2017 that Undertale would get a release for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, a Japanese localization, and a retail version published by Fangamer. These versions were released on August 15, 2017.|$|E
5|$|French ornithologist Émile Oustalet {{described}} a specimen from Branco {{as a separate}} species Passer brancoensis in 1883, which was recognised as the subspecies Passer iagoensis brancoensis by W. R. P. Bourne, who claimed to observe differences between Iago sparrows from different islands. According to Bourne, birds of Passer iagoensis iagoensis on more wooded islands in the south are darker and larger, and also behave more like house or Spanish sparrows, competing with <b>them</b> <b>better</b> in human-altered habitats. He later wrote that the variations he saw comprised two clinal trends, of increasing darkness towards the south, and of smaller size further from the continental coast. Charles Vaurie, examining differences in plumage and measurements of specimens in major museums, {{did not find any}} significant variation, and neither Vaurie nor Summers-Smith recognised any subspecies.|$|E

5|$|In France, the Antoinist worship was {{classified}} as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary reports which considered {{it one of the}} oldest healer groups. Books published by Belgian and French anti-cult associations and activists sometimes included Antoinism in their lists of cults, such as Cults, State of Emergency—Better know <b>them,</b> <b>better</b> defend oneself in France and worldwide (Les Sectes, État d'urgence—Mieux les connaître, mieux s'en défendre en France et dans le monde), published by the Centre Roger Ikor, and others. However, on 27 May 2005, the 1995 annex of the French report and cult classifications in which the Antoinist worship was listed, were officially cancelled and invalidated by Jean-Pierre Raffarin's circulaire. In addition, in a 1984 letter, the French Minister of the Interior wrote that the movement was considered, from an administrative point of view, as having for exclusive purpose the exercise of a religion, thus complying with the 18th and 19th Articles of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. He added that antoinism had always been allowed to receive bequests or donations, which meant that its religious nature was never challenged. In the early 2000s, membership of an Antoinist mother in Valenciennes was used by her former husband to remove from her the custody of their son; the decision received attention from media and was criticized by the French sociologist Régis Dericquebourg as being unjustified.|$|E

25|$|Warning – A warning {{is issued}} when a {{hazardous}} weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely. A warning means weather conditions {{pose a threat}} to life or property.

Most of the grasses divide into two physiological groups, using the C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways for carbon fixation. The C4 grasses have a photosynthetic pathway, linked to specialized Kranz leaf anatomy, which allows for increased water use efficiency, rendering <b>them</b> <b>better</b> adapted to hot, arid environments and those lacking in carbon dioxide.|$|E

In December 1969, Perot organized and flew to North Vietnam {{in an attempt to}} deliver 30 tons of supplies to beleaguered American POWs in North Vietnam. Although North Vietnam blocked the flights, the effort was instrumental in bringing the plight of those POWs to the world's attention and their captors soon began treating <b>them</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
25|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{industrial}} workers in the auto factories, labor unions such as the American Federation of Labor and the United Auto Workers fought to organize workers to gain <b>them</b> <b>better</b> working conditions and wages. They initiated strikes and other tactics in support of improvements such as the 8-hour day/40-hour work week, increased wages, greater benefits and improved working conditions. The labor activism during those years increased influence of union leaders in the city such as Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters and Walter Reuther of the Autoworkers.|$|E

Kaspersky called it Duqu 2.0. The malicious software resided in memory to avoid detection. The hack was believed to have been done by the same group that did Duqu in 2011.

25|$|Recent {{studies show}} that there are {{significant}} brain differences between bonobos and chimps. The brain anatomy of bonobos has more developed and larger regions assumed to be vital for feeling empathy, sensing distress in others and feeling anxiety, which makes them less aggressive and more empathic than their close relatives. They also have a thick connection between the amygdala, an important area that can spark aggression, and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, which helps control impulses. This thicker connection may make <b>them</b> <b>better</b> at regulating their emotional impulses and behavior.|$|E
25|$|Watch – A {{watch is}} used when {{the risk of}} a {{hazardous}} weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location, or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities. The National Weather Service may activate weather spotters in areas affected by watches to help <b>them</b> <b>better</b> track and analyze the event.|$|E

25|$|While Skolnick adapted Criss Oliva's solos {{to his own}} style, former guitarist Chris Caffery, who {{had left}} after the Gutter Ballet tour, was {{convinced}} he could do <b>them</b> <b>better.</b> He then told Jon Oliva that he would rejoin the band {{to pay tribute to}} his friend and mentor Criss Oliva on the condition that he would play all of Criss' solos, which the band accepted. Atlantic Records, however, wanted a second, more well-known guitarist to join the band, and Al Pitrelli was chosen. Pitrelli was known for his previous work with Alice Cooper and Asia, among others, and would play the majority of the lead parts of the band's new material.|$|E
25|$|In Aliens, {{the adult}} creatures {{have a more}} {{textured}} head rather than a smooth carapace. In the commentary for Aliens, it was speculated that {{this was part of}} the maturation of the creatures, as they had been alive far longer than the original Alien, although James Cameron stated that he simply left the carapace off because he liked <b>them</b> <b>better</b> that way. The smooth design of the carapace would be used again in Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection, although made narrower with a longer muzzle and more prominent chin. This design would be kept in Alien versus Predator, and abandoned in Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in favor of the ribbed design.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is first mentioned in Red Mars; it takes off when Sax creates an alga {{to withstand the}} harsh Martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into breathable air. Eventually this is done on a massive scale, with thousands of types of GE algae, lichen and bacteria being created to terraform the planet. In Green Mars, GE animals began to be created to withstand the thin Martian atmosphere, and to produce a working planetary-biosphere. By Blue Mars, GE is commonly being done on humans, willingly, to help <b>them</b> <b>better</b> adapt to the new worlds; to breathe thinner air (e.g. Russell), or to see better in the dimmer light of the outer planets.|$|E
