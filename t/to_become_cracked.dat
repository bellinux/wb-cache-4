40|$|The {{method of}} {{caustics}} {{was used for}} the study of the evolution of stress concentration around a circular hole, which progressively changes in shape and becomes an elliptic hole, tending to an internal crack. The influence of the amount of ellipticity of the holes and their orientation relative to the axis of the applied external loads at infinity on the form of caustics created around the discontinuity was studied, as the elliptic holes tended <b>to</b> <b>become</b> internal <b>cracks.</b> A series of experiments with tension specimens containing small elliptic holes of any ellipticity and orientation was performed. Comparison of experimentally obtained caustics with theory yielded a good agreement of both results. Finally, the use of small elliptic holes drilled all over a biaxial stress field for the determination of the individual principal stresses and the principal directions at the area of the holes was outlined. © 1976...|$|R
40|$|During {{corrosive}} {{dissolution of}} metal ions from a body surface, an oxide compound is produced. This compound forms a protective film {{that reduces the}} dissolution rate. When {{a fraction of a}} millimetre depth is dissolved the dissolution rate become insignificant. However, repeated loading will damage the film with continued dissolution as a result. In connection with this a threshold strain is assumed to exist. This paper proposes a model where electro- chemical processes and the mechanical load work together in forming a corrosion pit. The ratio between the threshold strain and the remotely applied strain is shown to control the shape of the pit. For small applied strains cracks are formed. A crack evolving from a surface irregularity is studied. The growth rate of the crack is determined by the dissolution rate at the crack tip. No crack growth criterion is needed. The growing crack is itself creating conditions for strain concentration, which leads to a high crack growth rate. The model simulates how dissolution forms a pit that grows <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a <b>crack</b> in a single continuous process. For small loads the crack growth rate is independent of applied load...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the image-processing algorithm customized for high-speed, real-time inspection of pavement cracking. In the algorithm, a pavement image {{is divided into}} grid cells of 8 x 8 pixels, and each cell is classified as a non-crack or crack cell using the grayscale information of the border pixels. Whether a crack cell {{can be regarded as}} a basic element (or seed) depends on its contrast to the neighboring cells. A number of crack seeds can be called a crack cluster if they fall on a linear string. A crack cluster corresponds to a dark strip in the original image {{that may or may not}} be a section of a real crack. Additional conditions to verify a crack cluster include the requirements in the contrast, width, and length of the strip. If verified crack clusters are oriented in similar directions, they will be joined <b>to</b> <b>become</b> one <b>crack.</b> Because many operations are performed on crack seeds rather than on the original image, crack detection can be executed simultaneously when the frame grabber is forming a new image, which permits a real-time, online pavement survey. The trial test results show good repeatability and accuracy when multiple surveys were conducted in different driving conditions. 17.

40|$|As much as 25 % of all {{accidents}} in process industry {{reported to the}} Swedish Plant Inspectorate are caused by stress corrosion crack growth. The situation {{is believed to be}} similar in the all industrialised countries. It contributes to the severity of the accidents that they often occurs unexpectedly and at loads that may be far below what normally causes crack growth Experts in the fields of metallurgy, corrosion have treated stress corrosion using mechanical models based on elastic or elastic plastic stress fields where the crack tip is treated as a point. In view of the near tip load distribution this leads to paradoxic results. In the present model corrosion is forming the geometry of the crack tip and is thus itself creating the conditions for strain concentration. We incorporate an interaction between electro-chemical processes and the deformation of the crack tip region in a fracture mechanical theory. The model is based on material dissolution simply being proportional to the surface stretch. No crack growth criteria is used. Computation of the mechanical state is based on a finite element formulation for large strains. The formation of a crack from a surface depression via a pit is studied. Low frequency cyclic load is considered. At the end of a load cycle a metal oxide compound is growing on the crack surface. We assume that there is sufficient time for the chemical process to form a protective film that fully covers the crack surface. This temporarily interrupts the corrosion process. During the application of next load cycle the stretch of the surface breaks the protective film. This creates gaps in the film, which allow dissolution of the underlaying metal. The chemical environment of the crack tip is assumed to be constant and unaffected by the changing geometry as the crack is developing. We assume that there is a linear relationship between strain and corrosion rate, in the sense of removed material per unit of area during each load cycle. The model simulates how dissolution lead to surface roughness, how pits form and grow <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>cracks</b> in one continuous process. The resulting natural variation of lengths of the formed cracks causes the cracks to grow with different speeds. During continuation one crack after the other falls into a wake behind a larger crack. Thus, crack tip load of the smaller decreases and finally causes crack arrest: At the end of the simulation only one growing crack remains. The results are compared with experimental observations...|$|R
