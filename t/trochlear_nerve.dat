5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and <b>trochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements.

5000|$|In {{situations}} of tumor, hemorrhage, or edema, increased pressure within the cranial cavity, {{especially if the}} mass {{is in the middle}} fossa, can push the uncus over the tentorial notch against the brainstem and its corresponding cranial nerves and can result in a brain herniation. If the uncus becomes herniated the structure lying just medial to it, cranial nerve III, can become compressed. This causes problems associated with a non-functional or problematic CN III - the pupil on the ipsilateral side fails to constrict to light and absence of medial/superior movement of the orbit, resulting in a fixed, dilated pupil and an eye with a characteristic [...] "down and out" [...] position due to dominance of the abducens and <b>trochlear</b> <b>nerves.</b> Further pressure on the midbrain results in progressive lethargy, coma and death due to compression of the mesencephalic reticular activating system. Brainstem damage is typically ipsilateral to the herniation, although the contralateral cerebral peduncle may be pushed against the tentorial notch, resulting in a characteristic indentation known as Kernohan's notch and ipsilateral hemiparesis, since fibers running in the cerebral peduncle decussate (cross over) in the lower medulla to control muscle groups {{on the opposite side of}} the body.|$|R

40|$|Congenital {{fibrosis}} of extraocular muscles (CFEOM) is a {{group of}} neurologic maldevelopmental disorders that primarily involve the oculomotor nerves and nuclei or the <b>trochlear</b> <b>nerves</b> and nuclei or both with secondary abnormal-ities in the correspondingly innervated muscles [1]. CFEOM can be clinically classified into four major categories and several respective subtypes according to its genetic compo-nents. Of these, CFEOM type 1 (CFEOM 1; MIM 135700) and CFEOM type 3 (CFEOM 3; MIM 600638; MIM 609384) can be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. The diagnosis of CFEOM is usually supported by clinical and genetic findings. CFEOM 1, known as the classic form of CFEOM, is typified by congenital non-progressive bilateral external ophthalmoplegia manifesting restricted vertical and horizontal ocular motility and ptosis leading to droopy eyelids and the chin-up position of the head [2]. These phenotypes were generally believed to be the consequences of dysplasia of the oculomotor nucleus and nerve and its innervated muscles (superior, medial, and inferior rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superioris) [3]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a routine means of clearly showing the functional anatomy of associated cranial nerves and nuclei and extraocular muscles (EOMs) in the orbits of patients with CFEOM [4].

Polyclonal antibodies were used that were raised against a recombinant viral protein in combination with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase system for detection of immunoreactivity. Specificity of the antibodies was tested in Western blotting experiments. Cytoplasmic immunostaining was observed in motor nuclei of hypoglossal, accessory, vagus, facial, trigeminal, abducent, oculomotor and <b>trochlear</b> <b>nerves,</b> and in the nucleus ambiguus, nucleus retroambigualis, lateral vestibular nucleus, mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the red nucleus, raphe nuclei and reticular formation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} the anatomy of the cavernous sinus and to provide a guide for use when performing surgery in this complex area. Clinical cases are used to illustrate routes to the cavernous sinus and its contents and to demonstrate how the cavernous sinus can be used as a pathway for exposure of deeper structures. METHODS: Thirty cadaveric cavernous sinuses were examined using X 3 to X 40 magnification after the arteries and veins were injected with colored silicone. Distances between the entrance of the oculomotor and <b>trochlear</b> <b>nerves</b> and the posterior clinoid process were recorded. Stepwise dissections (if the cavernous sinuses, performed to demonstrate the intradural and extradural routes, are accompanied by intraoperative photographs of those approaches. RESULTS: The anatomy of the cavernous sinus is complex because of the high density of critically important neural and vascular structures. Selective cases demonstrate how a detailed knowledge of cavernous sinus anatomy can provide for safer surgery with low morbidity. CONCLUSION: A precise understanding of the bony relationships and neurovascular contents of the cavernous sinus, together with the use of cranial base and microsurgical techniques, has allowed neurosurgeons to approach the cavernous sinus with reduced morbidity and mortality, changing the natural history of selected lesions in this region. Complete resection of cavernous sinus meningiomas has proven to be difficult and, in many cases, impossible without causing significant morbidity. However, surgical reduction of such lesions enhances the chances for success of subsequent therapy...|$|R
40|$|The Wnt- 1 gene is {{required}} for the development of midbrain and cerebellum; previous work showed that knockout of Wnt- 1 causes the loss of most molecular markers of these structures in early embryos and deletion of these structures by birth. However, neither the extent of early neuronal defects nor any possible alterations in structures adjacent to presumptive midbrain and cerebellum were examined. By using a neuron-specific antibody and fluorescent axon tracers, we show that central and peripheral neuronal development are altered in mutants during initial axonogenesis on embryonic day 9. 5. The absence of neuronal landmarks, including oculomotor and <b>trochlear</b> <b>nerves</b> and cerebellar plate, suggests that both mesencephalon and rhombomere 1 (r 1) are deleted, with the remaining neural tube fused to form a new border between the caudalmost portion of the prosencephalon (prosomere 1, or p 1) and r 2. Central axons accurately traverse this novel border by forming normal longitudinal tracts into the rhombencephalon, implying that the cues that direct these axons are aligned across neuromeres and are not affected by the deletion. The presence of intact p 1 and r 2 is further supported by the retention of markers for these two neuromeres, including a marker of p 1, the Sim- 2 gene, and an r 2 -specific lacZ transgene in mutant embryos. In addition, alterations in the Sim- 2 expression domain in ventral prosencephalon, rostral to p 1, provide novel evidence for Wnt- 1 function in this region. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

50|$|Superior to the obex is {{the floor}} of the 4th ventricle. In {{the floor of}} the 4th ventricle, various nuclei can be visualized by the small bumps that they make in the {{overlying}} tissue. In the midline and directly superior to the obex is the vagal trigone and superior to that it the hypoglossal trigone. Underlying each of these are motor nuclei for the respective cranial nerves. Superior to these trigones are fibers running laterally in both directions. These fibers are known collectively as the striae medullares. Continuing in a rostral direction, the large bumps are called the facial colliculi. Each facial colliculus, contrary to their names, do not contain the facial nerve nuclei. Instead, they have facial nerve axons traversing superficial to underlying abducens (CN VI) nuclei. Lateral to all these bumps previously discussed is an indented line, or sulcus that runs rostrally, and is known as the sulcus limitans. This separates the medial motor neurons from the lateral sensory neurons. Lateral to the sulcus limitans is the area of the vestibular system, which is involved in special sensation. Moving rostrally, the inferior, middle, and superior cerebellar peduncles are found connecting the midbrain to the cerebellum. Directly rostral to the superior cerebellar peduncle, there is the superior medullary velum and then the two <b>trochlear</b> <b>nerves.</b> This marks the end of the pons as the inferior colliculus is directly rostral and marks the caudal midbrain.|$|R

Literature on the normal MRI anatomy of the rabbit brain and associated structures as well as related reference values is sparse. Therefore, it was {{the purpose of this}} study to generate an MRI atlas of the normal rabbit brain including the pituitary gland, the cranial nerves and major vessels by the use of a 3 T magnet. Results Based on transverse, dorsal and sagittal T 2 -weighted (T 2 w) and pre- and post-contrast 3 D T 1 -weighted (T 1 w) sequences, 60 intracranial structures were identified and labeled. Typical features of a lissencephalic brain type were described. In the 5 investigated rabbits, on T 1 w images a crescent-shaped hyperintense area caudodorsally in the pituitary gland most likely corresponded to a part of the neurohypophysis.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origin of}} novelties {{is a central}} problem in biology. At a cellular level this requires, for example, molecularly resolving how brainstem motor neurons change their innervation target from muscle fibers (branchial motor neurons) to neural crest-derived ganglia (visceral motor neurons) or ear-derived hair cells (inner ear and lateral line efferent neurons). Transplantation of various tissues {{into the path of}} motor neuron axons could determine the ability of any motor neuron to innervate a novel target. Several tissues that receive direct, indirect, or no motor innervation were transplanted into the path of different motor neuron populations in Xenopus laevis embryos. Ears, somites, hearts, and lungs were transplanted to the orbit, replacing the eye. Jaw and eye muscle were transplanted to the trunk, replacing a somite. Applications of lipophilic dyes and immunohistochemistry to reveal motor neuron axon terminals were used. The ear, but not somite-derived muscle, heart, or liver, received motor neuron axons via the oculomotor or <b>trochlear</b> <b>nerves.</b> Somite-derived muscle tissue was innervated, likely by the hypoglossal nerve, when replacing the ear. In contrast to our previous report on ear innervation by spinal motor neurons, none of the tissues (eye or jaw muscle) was innervated when transplanted to the trunk. Taken together, these results suggest that there is some plasticity inherent to motor innervation, but not every motor neuron can become an efferent to any target that normally receives motor input. The only tissue among our samples that can be innervated by all motor neurons tested is the ear. We suggest some possible, testable molecular suggestions for thi...|$|R
