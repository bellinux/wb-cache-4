5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang activity was on the rise, associated with crack cocaine. A task force was formed and was partially successful at reducing gang activity {{by a combination of}} removing gang-related graffiti and educating news sources <b>to</b> <b>not</b> name gangs in news reporting.|$|E
5|$|A {{suitable}} environment {{had developed}} to question scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in geography) and Galen (in medicine) were found <b>to</b> <b>not</b> always match everyday observations. As the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive {{shift in focus}} from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted {{in a period of}} major scientific advancements.|$|E

5|$|After hosting NXT, Striker began {{interviewing}} WWE {{employees on}} Raw and SmackDown. During {{the summer of}} 2012, Striker became the host of WWE Afterburn for international broadcasts. On the October 12 SmackDown, Striker tried to interview Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan), but they both attacked him. On the October 15 episode of Raw, Striker demanded that he receive an apology and was instead forced to face Kane in his final WWE match, which Striker lost. On June 20, 2013, Striker departed WWE after the company opted <b>to</b> <b>not</b> renew his contract.|$|E
5|$|After the Rainmen {{reached the}} site of the game hours early and began warming up, they were {{discovered}} by Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton. Windsor head coach Bill Jones later entered the room to retrieve a ball and violence erupted between him and Halifax center Liam McMorrow. This sparked a brawl between both the teams as a whole, causing police to arrive. The Rainmen eventually left the stadium and chose <b>to</b> <b>not</b> compete in Game 7 because of safety concerns.|$|E
5|$|After two losses, the Pros decided <b>to</b> <b>not</b> {{schedule}} {{a game in}} week five and challenge a non-APFA team in week six.

5|$|Although No Code debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200, it left a large section of the band’s fanbase {{unsatisfied}} and quickly fell down the charts. Critical reviews were also mixed, with praise to the musical variety but the album being considered inconsistent. The album became the first Pearl Jam album <b>to</b> <b>not</b> reach multi-platinum status, receiving a single platinum certification by the RIAA in the United States.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, {{as it had been}} ordered <b>to</b> <b>not</b> engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order <b>to</b> <b>not</b> engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing <b>to</b> <b>not</b> follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E
5|$|As {{computers}} {{offered more}} advanced user interfaces, such as windows and point-and-click menus, many traditional roguelikes were modified to include support for having multiple windows. This was useful <b>to</b> <b>not</b> only show the character-based dungeon, but {{details on the}} character's inventory, the monster they were in battle with, and other status messages, in separate windows. Having access to multiple windows also allowed having menus to complete more complex commands.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} travels to Kuldahar, they meet a drow (dark elf) named Nym, who tells {{them that the}} pass to Kuldahar is guarded by the Legion of the Chimera, and that an {{alternate}} path through the Underdark exists. Later, Isair and Madae locate the group with information from Nym. They state their intention to attack Kuldahar, and warn the group <b>to</b> <b>not</b> interfere. The group then passes through the Black Raven Monastery to enter the Underdark. After exiting the Underdark, they are flown to Kuldahar by Oswald Fiddlebender.|$|E

5|$|Baggio was {{controversially}} {{excluded from}} Italy's 2002 World Cup squad by coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who believed him <b>to</b> <b>not</b> have fully {{recovered from the}} serious injury he had sustained during the season. Although he was initially keen to include Baggio in the final 23-man list, he ultimately excluded him from the squad; Baggio had made a direct appeal to him prior to the tournament by writing him a letter. Fans and pundits criticised the omission, as Italy were eliminated by co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16.|$|E
