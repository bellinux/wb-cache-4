5|$|After Theophrastus, though {{interest}} in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is {{not until the}} age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology resumed. The first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> pulse while the former do not.|$|E

5|$|For instance, the {{periodontal}} ligament {{can detect}} the pressure exerted when biting on something {{smaller than a}} grain of sand (10-30µm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down {{to a group of}} three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour.

5|$|In May 1947 {{the artistic}} {{collaboration}} between Hergé and Jacobs ended after an argument. Hergé had been {{jealous of the}} immediate success of Jacobs' Blake and Mortimer series, and had turned down Jacobs' request that he be credited as co-creator of the new Adventures of Tintin. That same month, Hergé broke from his manager, Thiery, after discovering <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> had been siphoning off money for himself.|$|E

Dusky woodswallows also seem to typically be more smoky brown than other species of woodswallow. The little woodswallow, a smaller, darker woodswallow is also slightly more smoky brown that other woodswallows, {{but that is the}} only similarity <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> has with the dusky woodswallow; the little woodswallow does not share a white patch on the outer wing.|$|E
5|$|Linguist Ekkehart Malotki {{challenged}} Whorf's {{analyses of}} Hopi temporal expressions and concepts with numerous examples how the Hopi language refers to time. Malotki argues {{that in the}} Hopi language the system of tenses consists of future and non-future and that the single difference between the three-tense system of European languages and the Hopi system, is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> combines past and present to form a single category.|$|E
5|$|Little else {{is known}} about his childhood, {{although}} there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. Rémy — a tradition which is somewhat undermined by the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> disappears from the historical record after 1504, when the child was only one year old.|$|E

5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes are <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former.

5|$|Raiden's debut role as {{the protagonist}} of Metal Gear Solid 2 was controversial, however, due to his {{unexpected}} substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics have defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been highly praised for his role and Metal Gear Solid 4 redesign and even more for his role and design in Revengeance.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture of}} Kotor earned Tvrtko the enmity of George I of Zeta's brother and successor, Balša II, who also desired the city. Nothing {{is known about}} Balša's {{military}} conflict with Tvrtko except <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> asked Venice, whose trading opportunities were threatened by the clashes, to mediate with the Lord of Zeta. The mediation was thwarted by Balša's death in a 1385 battle with the invading Ottoman Turks. Balša's nephew and successor, George II, maintained Zeta's hostility toward Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the {{nomination}} speech, Howe and Roosevelt planned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> would run for Governor of New York in 1932 and President in 1936. However, Governor Smith was named the Democratic presidential candidate in 1928, and persuaded the state convention to draft Roosevelt. Howe predicted disaster, feeling that a Republican challenger was sure to beat Roosevelt in what was expected to be nationally a Republican year. Though Howe remained Roosevelt's unofficial campaign manager, he was technically subordinate to a state campaign manager selected by Smith, as well as Smith's personal campaign manager, Belle Moskowitz, with whom Howe frequently clashed. In the fall election, Roosevelt won the governorship by a small margin, though Smith was defeated by Herbert Hoover both nationally and in New York State.|$|E
5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, finding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> {{has been}} in contact with Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he should accept full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958– June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He {{researched}} Mount St. Helens in the United States {{before and}} after its 1980 eruption, and blamed himself {{for the death of}} fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>latter</b> could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions.|$|E

Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea by charging straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage in the mist and fog.|$|E
