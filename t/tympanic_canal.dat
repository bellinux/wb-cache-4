2500|$|The cochlea is {{a portion}} of the inner ear that looks like a snail shell (cochlea is Greek for snail.) The cochlea {{receives}} sound in the form of vibrations, which cause the stereocilia to move. The stereocilia then convert these [...] vibrations into nerve impulses which are taken up to the brain to be interpreted. Two of the three fluid sections are canals and the third is a sensitive 'organ of Corti' which detects pressure impulses which travel along the auditory nerve to the brain. The two canals are called the vestibular canal and the <b>tympanic</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Spiral {{ganglion}} neuron (SGN) {{damage and}} apop-tosis {{can lead to}} noise-induced hearing loss, age-associated hearing loss and, in certain cases, auditory neuropathy. The apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) -associated pathway may be important in this process. The present study aimed to inves-tigate the expression levels of AIF and calpain in damaged SGNs. Glutamate (Glu) perfusion and cell culture in different concentrations of Glu were performed to damage the SGNs of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, with saline water used as a control Different concentrations (5, 10, 20 and 40 mM) of Glu were injected into the cochlear <b>tympanic</b> <b>canal</b> of 18 SD rats, and 10, 20 and 40 mM Glu were added to SGN cultures. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were measured prior to and 2 days following the injection of Glu. Immunofluorescent staining was used to detect the SGN damage and the expression levels of AIF and calpain in vivo and in in vitro. Transmission elec-tron microscopy (TEM) {{was used to measure}} cell apoptosis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyse the gene expression levels of AIF and calpain in the damaged SGNs. The TEM identified mitochondrial vacuolisation, swelling of the SGN and hetero-chromatin formation. Injection of Glu reduced the number of SGNs and induced apoptosis. AIF was observed to translocate into the nuclei of the SGNs in the 20 and 40 mM Glu groups, and the expression levels of AIF and calpain were markedly upregulated in the modiolus of the Glu-damaged SGNs. The upregulation of AIF and calpain may be important in the process of SGN damage and apoptosis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Surgeons rely on {{anatomical}} landmarks {{including the}} round window (RW), the stapes (S), and facial recess (FR) to implant electrode array in the scala tympani, {{which is part of}} the cochlea. It is widely reported by clinicians that there are differences in the orientation and shape of of the structures in children versus adult patients. With IRB approval we obtained high resolution CT scans of 10 pediatric and 10 adult scans. The CT scans undergo a cochlear implantation planning software that is concerned on identification and segmentation of critical structures of the ear anatomy, such as the facial nerve, chorda tympani, ear <b>canal,</b> <b>tympanic</b> membrane, semi-circular <b>canals,</b> scala-tympani, scala-vestibule and ossicles. We picked two structures of interest for this study (the facial nerve and the scala tympani) and perform a shape based analysis to determine differences in adult versus pediatric segmented structures. We found that the facial nerve shows differences on the region of the second-genue that it makes sharper turn in pediatric patients than it does in adult patients. And, the scala tympani shows variations in shape localized to one direction – signifying changes in orientation as an individual grows. Index Terms—facial nerve, scala-tympani, cochlea...|$|R
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} number of mobile devices with a cellular link as well as services associated with them require innovations in audio technologies. Especially problematic are circumstances, in which high background noise level prohibits communication. This thesis studies a tissue-conducting device for audio reproduction and recording. The proposed concept {{is not based on}} producing or sensing pressure changes in air, but in soft tissues. The device considered is an in-ear actuator and sensor that couples to <b>tympanic</b> <b>canal</b> walls. A finite element model of ear is developed for simulating the actuator function. The FEmodel includes a novel idea of using a lumped parameter representation for the middle ear bones. The results are compared with respect to the published data and the approach is found valid. The simulations concerning the actuator function show that the mode is unfeasible due to the energy loss in soft tissues. The result is confirmed by subjective tests. The prototype of the actuator is analyzed with a FE-model. It is observed that the linear FEM cannot account for the observed characteristics in the actuator response. Therefore, a time-domain model accounting for hysteresis is developed. The hysteresis prediction is realized with a rate-independent Preisach model with an addition of a scalar product model for the reversible part of hysteresis. It is shown that the rate-independent Preisach model is not sufficient to predict the response and that a dynamic model is required. In the sensor mode the device works up to 2. 5 - 3 kHz, after which the recorded signal drops below the noise floor. The finding is supported by the literature. The transfer function between the speech recorded with a microphone and the device is observed to have a decreasing trend. The study leaves open, whether this effect is due to the tissue transfer characteristics, sensor coupling to the tissue or sensor properties. Moreover, a comprehensive discussion on the theory associated with the Finite Element Method is given. Both, structural and piezoelectric FEM are covered...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a new finite element (FE) model of human right ear, including the accurate geometry of middle ear ossicles, external ear <b>canal,</b> <b>tympanic</b> cavity, and mastoid cavity. The FE model would be suitable to study the dynamic behaviors of pathological middle ear conditions, including changes of stapedial ligament stiffness, tensor tympani ligament (TTL), and tympanic membrane (TM) stiffness and thickness. Increasing stiffness of stapedial ligament has substantial effect on stapes footplate movement, especially at low frequencies, but less effect on umbo movement. Softer TTL will result in increasing umbo and stapes footplate displacement, especially at low frequencies (f 1500 Hz. As (TM) thickness was increased, the umbo displacement was reduced, especially at very low frequencies (f< 600 Hz). Otherwise, the stapes displacement was reduced at all frequencies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn many European and American hospitals, {{represented}} by the House Ear Clinic (HEC), the overlay tympanoplasty is used with rare exception, with simultaneous canal wall up or down mastoidectomy being taken if needed. In China, underlay tympanoplasty is used across the country, but the overlay technique is used rarely. The aim {{of the current study}} was to report the authors’ experience with overlay tympanoplasty in 83 Chinese patients and study its value. MethodsEight-three patients (86 ears) underwent overlay tympanoplasty in accordance to the standard of the HEC. The patients were followed up and conditions of the external auditory <b>canal,</b> <b>tympanic</b> membrane and hearing were reviewed and analyzed. ResultsAll patients gained stage I incision healing. The size of external auditory <b>canal</b> and <b>tympanic</b> membrane morphology were satisfactory. Hearing either remained unchanged or improved. There were no hearing deterioration or serious complications. ConclusionsOverlay tympanoplasty carries positive value in treating chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma with the merits of procedure standardization, adequate operative exposure, thorough disease elimination and extensive adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Malformations of {{the middle}} ear are {{classified}} as minor and major malformations. Minor malformations appear with regular external auditory <b>canal,</b> <b>tympanic</b> membrane and aerated middle ear space. The conducting hearing loss is due to fixation or interruption of the ossicular chain. The treatment is surgical, following the rules of ossiculoplasty and stapes surgery. In major malformations (congenital aural atresia) there is no external auditory canal and a deformed or missing pinna. The mastoid and the middle ear space may be underdevelopped, the ossicular chain is dysplastic. Surgical therapy is possible in patients with good aeration of the temporal bone, existing windows, a near normal positioned facial nerve and a mobile ossicular chain. Plastic and reconstructive surgery of the pinna should proceed the reconstruction of the external auditory canal and middle ear. In cases of good prognosis unilateral aural atresia can be approached already in childhood. In patients with high risk of surgical failure, bone anchored hearing aids are the treatment of choice. Recent reports of implantable hearing devices may be discussed as an alternative treatment for selected patients...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE : To characterise {{auditory}} involvement {{secondary to}} excessive craniotubular bone growth in individuals with sclerosteosis in South Africa. METHODS : This cross-sectional study assessed the auditory profile of 10 participants with sclerosteosis. An auditory test battery was used and results for each ear were recorded using descriptive and comparative analyses. RESULTS : All participants presented with bilateral, mixed hearing losses. Of the 20 ears, hearing loss was moderate in 5 per cent (n = 1), severe in 55 per cent (n = 11) and profound in 40 per cent (n = 8). Air–bone gaps were smaller in older participants, although {{the difference was}} not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). Computed tomography scans indicated pervasive abnormalities of the external auditory <b>canal,</b> <b>tympanic</b> membrane, middle-ear space, ossicles, oval window, round window and internal auditory canal. Narrowed internal auditory canals corresponded to poor speech discrimination, indicative of retrocochlear pathology and absent auditory brainstem response waves. CONCLUSION : Progressive abnormal bone formation in sclerosteosis involves the middle ear, the round and oval windows of the cochlea, and the internal auditory canal. The condition compromises conductive, sensory and neural auditory pathways, which results in moderate to profound, mixed hearing loss. [URL]...|$|R

Materials and Methods: 920 {{patients}} were analysed retrospectively between July 2012 - March 2013 with history of dull earache, fullness and cerumen in External Auditory Canal. The External Auditory Canal examination was done only after removal of Cerumen. Result: Total 920 patients were examined and wax was removed sucssfully except in three patients where it was removed manually under cover of analgesic and antibiotic. After this examination of External Auditory <b>Canal,</b> <b>tympanic</b> membrane, middle ear, ossicles was done clinically. In case - 1,only inflammation was present. In case - 2,both inflammation as well as widening of bony part of EAC was present along with perforation of TM left side. In case- 3, erosion in the bony part of EAC with cholesteatoma sac. On CT scan,there was no extention of the disease process. Conclusion: KO is uncommon and occurs mainly as desquamative process of ear canal.

40|$|Otitis Media {{is defined}} as {{inflammation}} {{of the middle ear}} region associated with middle ear fluid. This condition typically follows an upper respiratory infection, is commonly misdiagnosed by physicians and can potentially lead to the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents. [1] This thesis describes the design of a novel medical device that utilized spectroscopy and digital imaging to provide physicians with a unique representation of the middle ear. Published literature has been reviewed to assess the different approaches that researchers have studied to improve the diagnosis of otitis media, where, for example, research conducted by Thorton et al. and Boppart et al. used fluorescence to identify bacteria contained in biofilms. [12, 13] In addition, a population study conducted by Jensen et al. determined what the level of diagnostic certainty is in pediatric patients and determined that general practitioners had a diagnostic certainty of 58 % in patients under one year of age and 73 % certainty in patients over {{two and a half years}} of age. [9] Eleven subjects, each with a history of recurrent acute otitis media and requiring myringotomy and ear tube placement, were selected for study in this thesis. All subjects received a digital imaging and spectroscopy examination using the device at the time of surgery. Five excitation and illumination wavelengths were used, including white light, 385 - 420 nm, 450 - 470 nm, 520 - 535 nm, and 640 - 650 nm as well as fluorescence imaging using 425 nm and 450 nm filters. Each of the chosen wavelengths were emitted into the ear <b>canal</b> and <b>tympanic</b> membrane during a typical otoscopic examination. Signal processing techniques were also applied to isolate various regions of the tympanic membrane using MatLAB to increase the resolution of the anatomical and physiological properties of the tympanic membrane. The spectral readings between the wavelengths of 560 nm and 760 nm were plotted for each subject and were classified according to fluid retention, consistency, and vascularity. In this subject population, eight of the 22 ears were identified to be a noneffusion normal. Reflectance of keratin, cerumen, and bone, with well defined blood vessels and contrast, allowed for better characterization of the middle ear. [8] Reflectance spectra were classified according to fluid consistency and trends were determined for non effusion and effusion patients. Class one spectra were defined as <b>tympanic</b> membrane and <b>canal</b> spectra with a rapid increase in percent reflection between 575 nm and 650 nm and a rapid decrease in percent reflection between 650 nm and 750 nm. Class two spectra were defined as <b>tympanic</b> membrane and <b>canal</b> spectra with a gradual decrease in percent reflection between 575 nm and 800 nm. This novel device was successfully used to detect effusion consistency and color and it will continue to aid in the development of a new diagnostic procedure. It provides a means for the creation of a new diagnostic procedure that may be useful in assisting a physician in making an accurate diagnosis, and as a result, increase the diagnostic certainty...|$|R
40|$|Sclerosteosis {{is a rare}} genetic bone {{dysplasia}} disorder characterised by generalised craniotubular bone modelling. Alongside many clinical appearances {{marked in}} sclerosteosis, the auditory system is considerably compromised on several levels during the disease progression. Extensive otolaryngological research {{on the history of}} sclerosteosis, the clinical presentation of sclerosteosis, radiographic studies and the gene causing the condition had been documented. No studies had been found describing the audiological profiles, auditory functioning and abnormalities for subjects with sclerosteosis. Thus the object of this study aimed to describe the auditory profile of subjects with sclerosteosis. A cross-sectional descriptive research design and quantitative research approach was followed to investigate the auditory characteristics of subjects with sclerosteosis. Subjects were selected from a database of patients with confirmed diagnoses of sclerosteosis. Ten subjects responded and provided written informed consent. Test procedures included otoscopy, tympanometry, acoustic reflexes, diagnostic pure-tone airand bone-conduction audiometry, speech audiometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and computed tomographic (CT) scans. The subjects were assessed with a comprehensive audiological test-battery within a single test session lasting approximately two hours. A CT scan was conducted on a separate occasion shortly after the audiological data were obtained. Normal type A tympanograms were obtained in 50 % (n= 10 / 20) of ears. All subjects presented with mixed hearing losses varying from moderate (5 %; n= 1), severe (55 %; n= 11) and profound (40 %; n= 8) degrees across ears. Hearing loss configurations ranged from rising (15 %), sloping (35 %) and air-conduction thresholds peaking at 2000 Hz (50 %). Air bone gaps (ABG) were larger in older subjects, although not statistically significant (p>. 05). The CT scans indicated anatomical abnormalities of the external auditory <b>canal,</b> <b>tympanic</b> membrane, middle ear space, ossicles, oval window, round window and the internal auditory canal. The progressive abnormal bone formation in sclerosteosis involved the middle ear, the round and oval windows of the cochlea and internal auditory canal. The progressive abnormal bony overgrowth, which is the hallmark of sclerosteosis, led to functional impairment at various levels in the auditory system. The current findings provided a comprehensive auditory profile for sclerosteosis. Results might be utilised alongside future research findings to direct criteria and audiological indications for surgical and audiological intervention.
