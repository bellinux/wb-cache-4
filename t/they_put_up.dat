5|$|During {{the period}} of Georgian {{architecture}} (about 1720–1840) the main architects and builders working in Bristol were James Bridges, John Wallis, and Thomas Paty with his sons John and William Paty. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> hundreds of new buildings, reflecting the increased prosperity {{that came with the}} new Floating Harbour and trade based at The Exchange, built in 1741–43 by John Wood the Elder. Their early work included the Royal Fort, Blaise Castle House and Arno's Court estate, with the associated Arno's Court Triumphal Arch and Black Castle Public House. More modest terraces and squares grew up in the new suburbs such as Hotwells and north into Clifton, including 7 Great George Street, now the Georgian House Museum. It was built around 1790 for John Pinney a successful sugar merchant, and {{is believed to be the}} house where the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge first met. It was also home to Pinney's slave, Pero, after whom Pero's Bridge at Bristol Harbour is named.|$|E

Agne had a torc which had belonged to Agne's great-great-great-grandfather Visbur. Agne married Skjalf who became pregnant with two sons, Erik and Alrik.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, she {{increased}} {{her power}} by co-founding United Artists (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA's creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also {{part of the}} studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company's movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with what many considered creative interference.|$|E

25|$|<b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> {{barbed wire}} fences around the {{perimeter}} of West Berlin in 1953, but not in Vienna. By 1955, the Soviets, by signing the Austrian State Treaty, agreed to relinquish their occupation zones in Eastern Austria as well as their sector in Vienna. In exchange they required that Austria declare its permanent neutrality after the allied powers had left the country. Thus they ensured that Austria would not be a member of NATO and that NATO forces would therefore not have direct communications between Italy and West Germany.|$|E
25|$|Botham {{took over}} the {{captaincy}} in 1980 and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a good fight against the West Indies, losing a five match Test series 1–0, although England were humbled in the return series. After scoring a pair in the first Test against Australia, Botham lost the captaincy due to his poor form, {{and was replaced by}} Mike Brearley. Botham returned to form and played exceptionally in the remainder of the series, being named man of the match in the third, fourth and fifth Tests. The series became known as Botham's Ashes as England recorded a 3–1 victory.|$|E
25|$|By 1914 the DATI had 138 {{instructors}} travelling the country, informing farmers {{about new}} methods in agriculture, horticulture and poultry-keeping. The {{start of the}} 20th century saw the high water mark in Plunket's achievements. The IAOS was flourishing and vigorous. In 1903 there were 370 dairy societies, 201 cooperative banks and 146 agricultural societies {{under the auspices of}} thee IAOS, and by 1914 there were over 1,000 societies and nearly 90,000 members. However, most unionists considered Plunkett too conciliatory and their hostility cost him his seat at the general election in October 1900, when <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a candidate to split the unionist vote.|$|E

As <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a futile effort to fight back, the crowd starts cheering for Joe and Silvia, which gives them the power to transform and ultimately defeat Jet Black. Captain Blue is restored to normal and reveals that Jet was his best friend and cinematographer, but had found the Black Film one day and became entranced by its power {{and that of the}} Rainbow Oscars. In the end, it is revealed that all Jet really wanted was to prove himself as a hero to his own son Joe.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrians in Persia armed {{themselves}} {{under the}} command of General Agha Petros, who had been approached by the Allies to help fight the Ottomans. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a resistance, and Agha Petros' volunteer army had quite a few successes over the Ottoman forces and their Kurdish allies, notably at Suldouze where 1,500 Assyrian horsemen overcame the far larger Ottoman force of over 8,000, commanded by Kheiri Bey. Agha Petros also defeated the Ottoman Turks in a major engagement at Sauj Bulak and drove them back to Rowanduz. Assyrian forces in Persia were greatly affected by the withdrawal of Russia from the war and the collapse of Armenian armed resistance in the region. They were left cut off, with no supplies, vastly outnumbered and surrounded.|$|E
25|$|Led by a {{battalion}} of the Kolberg Regiment, Zglinitzki's column stormed the redoubt while Schmidt's men scaled the city wall despite being enfiladed by canister shot from cannons sited on the south bank of the river. The Prussians prevailed in a terrific melee in which Marie was bayoneted three times and became a prisoner. Semiconscious from a wound, Charpentier barely escaped a similar fate. Amey assumed command of four battalions and led them in retreat across the river. Three French battalions became trapped within the city, and expecting no quarter, <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a bitter fight in the city streets. Some got away but most were killed or captured. The French managed to set the bridge on fire but the Prussian pioneers put out the blaze and made repairs.|$|E

25|$|Throughout history, {{access to}} the Western Wall has been limited by the {{controlling}} political power of the time. Under the British Mandate, Jews {{were not allowed to}} bring chairs to the Kotel, nor could <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a mechitza in order to separate between men and women and conduct traditional services. After the Kotel's capture from the Kingdom of Jordan in the Six Day War of 1967, part of the southern area next to the Kotel was cleared of abandoned Arab homes that had all but hid the place, and traditional worship was restored. Women of the Wall have been criticized as unwitting allies in ignoring the destruction of these homes and in supporting the Wall as a symbol of Israeli nationalism. Most of the Western wall runs the length of East Jerusalem, with the Temple Mount to the east and dwellings to the west.|$|E
25|$|The first attacks {{began at}} 03:00 on 22 June. The Soviets {{had been caught}} by surprise, their {{aircraft}} bunched together in neat rows which were vulnerable. The results were devastating. At Pinsk aerodrome 39 SBAP of 10 SAD lost 43 SBs and five Pe-2s on the ground after attacks by KG 3, which lost one bomber. Further to the west, 33 IAP/10 SAD lost 46 I-53 and I-16s to fighter-bombers of JG 51. Messerschmitt Bf 110s of SKG 210 destroyed 50 aircraft at Korbin airfield, near the headquarters of 10 SAD and the Soviet Fourth Army. The airfield based the 74 ShAP, which lost 47 I-15s, 5 I-153s and 8 IL-2 aircraft on 22 June. Worse was still to come. Slightly later, KG 54 attacked airfields in the area, and its 80 Ju 88s destroyed 100 Soviet aircraft. However, the Luftwaffe and its allies were far from alone in the skies. The VVS flew 6,000 sorties {{in comparison to the}} German 2,272 sorties and VVS ZOVO put 1,900 aircraft into the air. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> bitter resistance in the air scoring a few successes.|$|E
25|$|By {{convention}}, the Western Roman Empire {{is deemed}} to have ended on 4 September 476, when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus and proclaimed himself ruler of Italy, but this convention {{is subject to}} many qualifications. In Roman constitutional theory, the Empire was still simply united under one emperor, implying no abandonment of territorial claims. In areas where the convulsions of the dying Empire had made organized self-defence legitimate, rump states continued under some form of Roman rule after 476. Julius Nepos still claimed to be Emperor of the West and controlled Dalmatia until his murder in 480. Syagrius son of Aegidius ruled the Domain of Soissons until his murder in 487. The indigenous inhabitants of Mauretania developed kingdoms of their own, independent of the Vandals, with strong Roman traits. They again sought Imperial recognition with the reconquests of Justinian I, and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> effective resistance to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. While the civitates of Britannia sank into a level of material development inferior even to their pre-Roman Iron Age ancestors, they maintained identifiably Roman traits for some time, and they continued to look to their own defence as Honorius had authorized.|$|E

25|$|After the Civil War, Texas' growing cattle {{industry}} managed to regain {{much of its}} economy. Beef became a particular commodity after the war, and supplies from Texas were shipped to other states for a great price. Texas Longhorns were the ones sought after, and the state's open range became their new habitat and breeding ground. Hundreds of ranchers and farms sprang out {{by the end of}} the war, and veterans and former slaves were hired as cowboys to protect cattle. However, exporting the cattle was a dangerous task for the new ranches. The best routes to drive the cattle run straight through the Comanche territory. Relationships between them were mutual; cowboys are permitted to go across as long as they pay the toll. However, in times of conflicts or when food are scarce, Indians would attack cowboys and their cattle if ever seen in their land. One dire case happened to a black cowboy named Britton Johnson in 1864. His ranch was raided upon by a band of Comanches, who killed his son and kidnapped his wife and daughter. Although Johnson managed to negotiate with them for his family, the Comanches never left him alone. A band of 25 warriors attacked Johnson again with two of his cowboys during a routine cattle drive. Although <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a fight, all of them perished during their last stand.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the capture}} of Lord, the {{remaining}} prisoners agreed that 25 April would be {{the final day of}} the protest. Prison officers entered the prison early in the morning and gradually began to occupy the upper landings. At 10:20 am one of the remaining prisoners, a seventeen-year-old on remand for joyriding, was captured leaving five prisoners remaining on the roof. When prison officers reached the roof <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a sign similar to the ones used by prisoners throughout the protest, which read [...] "HMP in charge—no visits". At 6:20 pm the remaining five prisoners were removed from the roof in a [...] "cherry picker" [...] hydraulic platform, giving clenched fist salutes to the press and public as they descended. During the course of the 25-day riot, the longest in British penal history, 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners had been injured.|$|E

Hodgson said that Deathrow struggled to show grittiness {{in a very}} shiny environment. He added that the game suffered from immoderate violence, frustrating fighting sequences, lack of online play, and [...] "steep learning curve". Hodgson compared the core mechanics to a [...] "mini-game masquerading as sports entertainment". William Racer of the Official Xbox Magazine (OXM) praised the fast-paced nature {{of the game and}} its eye for detail, and complained about the camera angles and difficulty. He placed the game in a lineage of invented sports from a dystopian future and found the game more entertaining than the rest. Racer also found the music generic, and the voice acting good. Eric Bush of TeamXbox complimented the computer opponents's artificial intelligence and said that <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> a challenge. GameSpy Osborne appreciated the game's small details like the streak trailing the disc through the air. IGN's Kaiser Hwang called the arena lighting effects, bump mapping, and textures the best since [...] 1UP.com, OXM Racer, and IGN's Douglass Perry and David Clayman recommended Deathrow as a party game, with the IGN staff specifically recommending the game with System Link.|$|E

500|$|In June 2011 {{press reports}} had {{indicated}} that the party was unlikely to run a candidate both for financial reasons and also because {{it was unlikely that}} a Fianna Fáil nominee could be successful. In early August 2011 there was press speculation that RTÉ broadcaster Gay Byrne might seek a nomination. On 6 August Micheál Martin rang Byrne at his holiday home to indicate that Fianna Fáil Oireachtas members would facilitate his nomination. Byrne indicated that he had yet to make a decision on whether to put his name forward, but said that if he did so he would not run under the Fianna Fáil banner but as an independent, albeit {{with the assistance of the}} party's organisation. [...] "Fianna Fáil are convinced no matter who <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> will be unelectable, so they're giving me their support" [...] he told the Irish Independent. Éamon Ó Cuív, the party's deputy leader and member of the committee tasked with deciding on their strategy for the election stated that [...] "I know of no approach to Gay Byrne... Nobody has discussed the issue with me— good, bad or indifferent." [...] On 13 August Byrne informed Martin that he would not be going forward for nomination. He stated that the idea of running had been [...] "foisted on him and he had not known anything about it and what it would involve". This followed unease among Fianna Fáil parliamentary party Oireachtas members, with a number unhappy that a candidate was being imposed by the leadership without discussion.|$|E

Paul asks Cecilia Saint (Candice Alley) to sabotage the event, but is horrified when the hotel boiler explodes, injuring Daniel and killing Josh and Doug. While supporting a grieving Terese, admitting {{to her that he}} loves her, Paul worries that Cecilia caused the explosion. Paul persuades Nene to lie to the police to support his false alibi. Paul is arrested after he is found to have deleted CCTV footage of him in the boiler room. Steph visits Paul in prison, where he maintains his innocence. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the motel for Paul's bail and he is released.
