50|$|All SA gear hubs use {{epicyclic}} (planetary) geartrains {{of varying}} complexity. The AW is the simplest, using {{one set of}} planetary gears with four planets. The AM uses three compound planets with differently sized cogs on a common shaft <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> ring and sun gear separately, while the close-ratio three-speeds, and hubs with four or more speeds, use multiple planetary geartrains. Depending on the specific hub these may be in series with each other, or with {{one or the other}} set being selectable at any given time by locking a particular sun gear to the axle.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "relay case" [...] {{containing}} electromagnetic switches received {{signals from}} the governor and push buttons and then controlled a coupler, a decelerator to close <b>the</b> throttle during <b>gear</b> changes, and a solenoid to select operation of the reverse-first or second-third shift rail, using a reversible electric motor <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears.</b> <b>The</b> system was thus entirely electromechanical, without hydraulics, pneumatics or electronics.|$|R
50|$|Such {{gearboxes}} {{had been}} built before, but neither widely used nor successfully. Porsche had used one for his 1907 Maja, {{with a series of}} internal pawls inside the shaft which could be pushed out one-by-one <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears.</b> Goggomobil and Claude Hill of Ferguson, had both used an internal 'bung' sliding inside the shaft to push out a locking cam or balls through the hollow shaft and <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears.</b> Archie Butterworth's AJB Special had used a sleeve over a solid shaft, the sleeve sliding lengthways <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> and also <b>to</b> act as <b>the</b> other <b>gear's</b> bearing surface. <b>The</b> Butterworth design was the one chosen. The designs were so similar that Chapman initially negotiated with Butterworth for the rights to use it, but without any final agreement.|$|R
50|$|There can be {{significant}} backlash in unsynchronized transmissions {{because of the}} intentional gap between dog gears (also known as dog clutches). The gap is necessary so that the driver or electronics can <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> easily while synchronizing the engine speed with the driveshaft speed. If there was a smaller clearance, it would be nearly impossible <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> because <b>the</b> teeth would interfere {{with each other in}} most configurations. In synchronized transmissions, synchromesh solves this problem.|$|R
50|$|Ball detents are {{commonly}} found in the selector mechanism of a gearbox, holding the selector rods in <b>the</b> correct position <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> desired <b>gear.</b> Other applications include clutches that slip at a preset torque, and calibrated ball detent mechanisms are typically found in a torque wrench.|$|R

2500|$|In 1976, Honda {{introduced}} the CB750A to the United States, with the A suffix designating [...] "automatic," [...] for its automatic transmission. Although the 2-speed transmission includes a torque converter typical of an automatic transmission, the transmission {{does not automatically}} change <b>gears</b> for <b>the</b> rider. Each <b>gear</b> is selected by a foot-controlled hydraulic valve/selector (similar in operation to a manual transmission motorcycle). The foot selector controls the application of high pressure oil to a single clutch pack (one clutch for each <b>gear),</b> causing <b>the</b> selected clutch (and <b>gear)</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage.</b> <b>The</b> selected <b>gear</b> remains selected until changed by the rider, or the kickstand is lowered (which shifts the transmission to neutral).|$|R
5000|$|... 6000 Junior Motocultivator: Lombardini or Ruggerini HP14-16 diesel engine. Equipped with {{differential}} lock, reversing safety mechanism, adjustable handlebar, two PTO. Also {{available with}} powered trailer version. The safety mechanism, invented, designed and finally adopted by Cugini Randi, {{first on the}} 6000 Junior and then adopted across the range, allowed the model to be {{the winner of the}} 1st Prize at the 6th competition antinfortunistico ENPI (Ente Nazionale Prevenzione Infortuni) [...] for machines to be used on sloping ground. <b>The</b> mechanism allowed <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> reverse <b>gear,</b> but <b>the</b> motocultivator was enabled to retreat only if the cutter was disengaged. A version with a third independent PTO for the Portuguese market was produced. The motocultivators were also painted with red color instead of the traditional green color.|$|R
50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{had several}} advantages over other starting systems in {{use at the}} time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or external charging equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. Inertia starters used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand crank or electric motor, causing <b>the</b> spinning wheel <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> starter ring <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, {{and it did not}} require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas.|$|R
40|$|A {{method that}} finds fuel optimal speed {{profiles}} for traveling a predefined distance is presented. The vehicle is modeled using a quasistatic formulation and an optimal control problem is defined. In addition, the solving method {{is based on}} a multi-phase optimization algorithm based on dynamic programming. This approach results in lower computational time than solving the problem directly with dynamic programming, it also makes the computational time independent of the travel distance. In addition, the simulation generated data can be used to get the solution to several optimal control problems in parallel that have additional constraints. Further a finite time gear shift model is presented to include <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> selection in <b>the</b> optimization problem. The problem also considers speed losses and fuel consumption during the maneuver. The results presented show the optimal speed and gear profiles to cover a distance, making special emphasis at the acceleration phase, where it is optimal to perform a fast acceleration <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> highest <b>gear</b> as soon as possible. Finally a proposed application is to use the simulation data to provide eco-driving tips to the driver...|$|R
50|$|On the steeply graded Armi tunnel {{the train}} stalled with {{almost all the}} cars inside the tunnel. The {{passengers}} and crew were overcome by the smoke and fumes so slowly that they failed to notice the dangers. Most passengers died in their sleep and were found still in their resting position. Most of the few survivors were {{in the last few}} cars which were still in the open air. Rescuers later found that the driver of the 480.017 had tried until the last to restart the train in the forward direction, while the driver of the 476.058 locomotive at some point tried <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> reverse <b>gear</b> in attempt to exit the tunnel; the two drivers were unable to communicate because the 476 was an Austrian-built locomotive with right-hand drive, while the 480 had left-hand drive. Much carbon monoxide gas was produced as a by-product of combustion, and carbon monoxide poisoning is a well recognized danger when machines are used, or fires occur, in enclosed environments. It combines with haemoglobin when inhaled, so the victim dies of anoxia (lack of oxygen). It is still the principal cause of death in mine disasters after a fire or explosion.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a crew of}} two. The driver sat at {{the right}} front, behind a large cast double hatch and next to the {{combined}} gearbox and steering unit. Behind him was a round escape hatch {{in the bottom of}} the hull. Driving the vehicle was very hard work. The Hotchkiss lacked the Cleveland differential ("Cletrac") of its Renault competitor, and it responded unpredictably to direction adjustments. The brakes were little help in compensation: they were too weak, especially when driving down a slope. No less troublesome was the gearbox: it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> highest fifth <b>gear</b> and so <b>the</b> theoretical top speed of 27.8 km/h was rarely reached. There was one reverse <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> inevitable rough handling of the tank by the driver resulted in much wear and tear. Mechanical reliability was poor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the driven shaft (output), but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction <b>gear</b> on <b>the</b> driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A number of <b>gears</b> on <b>the</b> layshaft may then be connected, {{one at a}} time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction <b>gears,</b> <b>the</b> engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding <b>gears</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> and disengage <b>the</b> drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>gears.</b> An early improvement was to use separate dog clutches instead <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>gears,</b> leaving <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive dog clutch, that gradually <b>engages</b> <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> and matches their speed before <b>the</b> dog clutch <b>engages.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sauber C30s of Kamui Kobayashi and seventh-placed Sergio Pérez retired with {{near-identical}} gearbox problems, {{reducing the}} field to just fifteen drivers plus Daniel Ricciardo. Ricciardo's car had gone into anti-stall on the grid before failing <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> a <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> car was immediately returned to the pits while repairs were carried out, and although Ricciardo returned to the circuit, he was some eight laps behind the last-placed Timo Glock {{at the time of}} Pérez's retirement. Ricciardo would ultimately finish the race fourteen laps behind race winner Vettel, and was therefore not classified as a finisher as he had failed to complete 90% of the winner's race distance. With just fifteen drivers on the track, the Team Lotus drivers of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli were able to secure 13th and 14th place, further reinforcing the team's claim to tenth in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the solenoid actuated starter relay, closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> flywheel ring <b>gear,</b> and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with <b>the</b> ring <b>gear.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted air cylinder which actuated <b>the</b> bus bar <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> and disengage <b>the</b> <b>gears.</b> It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to disengage <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> instead of being used <b>to</b> keep them <b>engaged.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> change pedal was released it allowed <b>the</b> selected <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> by means of spring pressure in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a <b>gear</b> <b>engaged</b> and <b>the</b> air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} disengage that gear until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. 3 K {{type and}} 2 K- 2 H type {{planetary}} gear trains {{can be designed}} to have high reduction ratios. Due to the reason of power circulation, these two kinds of planetary gear trains with high reduction ratios have low meshing efficiencies. The 2 K type planetary gear reducer only contain two ring gears and one carrier, hence it {{will not have the}} problem of power circulation and will have better meshing efficiency than 3 K type and 2 K- 2 H type planetary gear reducers. Also, in general, <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> reducers with high reduction ratio are compound <b>gear</b> system. <b>The</b> {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose 2 K type planetary simple gear reducers with high reduction ratios. Based on the concept of train value equation, the kinematic design of 2 K type planetary gear trains with high reduction ratio are synthesized. Six 2 K type planetary gear reducers are designed to illustrate the kinematic design process. Three of the examples are 2 K type planetary gear reducers with simple planet <b>gears.</b> For <b>the</b> 2 K type planetary simple gear reducer, there is a problem that is <b>the</b> simple planet <b>gear</b> <b>engages</b> <b>to</b> two ring gears with different tooth number. One example is used to illustrate how to design <b>the</b> two ring <b>gears</b> with different shift coefficient <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> same planet <b>gear.</b> Based on <b>the</b> proposed process, all 2 K type planetary simple gear reducers with high reduction ratios can be synthesized...|$|R

50|$|In both types, a {{particular}} gear combination {{can only be}} <b>engaged</b> when <b>the</b> two parts <b>to</b> <b>engage</b> (either gears or clutches) are at the same speed. To shift to a higher <b>gear,</b> <b>the</b> transmission is put in neutral and the engine allowed to slow down until the transmission parts for <b>the</b> next <b>gear</b> are at a proper speed <b>to</b> <b>engage.</b> <b>The</b> vehicle also slows while in neutral and that slows other transmission parts, so the time in neutral depends on the grade, wind, and other such factors. To shift to a lower <b>gear,</b> <b>the</b> transmission is put in neutral and the throttle is used {{to speed up the}} engine and thus the relevant transmission parts, to match speeds for <b>engaging</b> <b>the</b> next lower <b>gear.</b> For both upshifts and downshifts, the clutch is released (engaged) while in neutral. Some drivers use the clutch only for starting from a stop, and shifts are done without the clutch. Other drivers will depress (disengage) the clutch, shift <b>to</b> neutral, then <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> clutch momentarily <b>to</b> force transmission parts to match the engine speed, then depress the clutch again to shift to <b>the</b> next <b>gear,</b> a process called double clutching. Double clutching is easier to get smooth, as speeds that are close but not quite matched need to speed up or slow down only transmission parts, whereas with <b>the</b> clutch <b>engaged</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> engine, mismatched speeds are fighting the rotational inertia and power of the engine.|$|R

5000|$|In a sliding-mesh gearbox, {{individual}} gears are mounted so they always <b>engage</b> <b>the</b> shaft, but <b>gears</b> on one shaft {{can be moved}} axially. <b>To</b> <b>engage</b> a particular pair of gears, one gear is slid axially until it fully <b>engages</b> a <b>gear</b> on <b>the</b> other shaft. If <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> shafts are spinning so <b>the</b> two <b>gears</b> have <b>the</b> same surface speed, <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> are relatively easy <b>to</b> <b>engage.</b> However, if speeds are mismatched, <b>the</b> <b>gears</b> tend to [...] "bounce" [...] off each other at first contact and resist engagement. Thus, gear engagement relies on the driver carefully matching speeds, typically through practice and intuition.|$|R

2500|$|Mechanical {{efficiency}} was {{improved by}} reversing {{the action of}} the push rod.

Thus the force on the rod was exerted by tension rather than compression, (or in less technical language, the trigger motor worked by being [...] "pulled" [...] rather than [...] "pushed") which enabled the rod to be lighter, minimising its inertia so that it could operate faster (at least in early versions of <b>the</b> <b>gear,</b> each revolution of the cam wheel produced two firing impulses instead of one). A single firing lever <b>engaged</b> <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> and fired <b>the</b> gun in one action, rather than <b>the</b> <b>gear</b> having to be [...] "turned on" [...] and then fired, as with some earlier gears.|$|R
