5|$|Since that time, most US space {{exploration}} {{efforts have been}} led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and later the Space Shuttle. Currently, NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing {{the development of the}} Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, the Space Launch System and Commercial Crew vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> also responsible for the Launch Services Program (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches.|$|E
5|$|The agency's leader, NASA's administrator, is {{nominated}} by the President of the United States {{subject to approval}} of the US Senate, and reports {{to him or her}} and serves as senior space science advisor. Though space exploration is ostensibly non-partisan, the appointee usually is associated with the President's political party (Democratic or Republican), and a new administrator is usually chosen when the Presidency changes parties. The only exceptions to this have been: James C. Fletcher, appointed by Republican Richard Nixon but stayed through May 1977 into the term of Democrat Jimmy Carter; Daniel Goldin, appointed by Republican George H. W. Bush and stayed through the administration of Democrat Bill Clinton; and Robert M. Lightfoot, Jr., associate administrator under Democrat Barack Obama kept on as acting administrator by Republican Donald Trump. Though <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> independent, the survival or discontinuation of projects can depend directly on the will of the President.|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{generated}} in Switzerland is 56% from hydroelectricity and 39% from nuclear power, {{resulting in a}} nearly CO2-free electricity-generating network. On 18 May 2003, two anti-nuclear initiatives were turned down: Moratorium Plus, aimed at forbidding the building of new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed), and Electricity Without Nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed) after a previous moratorium expired in 2000. However, {{as a reaction to}} the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Swiss government announced in 2011 that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades. In November 2016, Swiss voters rejected a proposal by the Green Party to accelerate the phaseout of nuclear power (45.8% supported and 54.2% opposed). The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) is the office responsible for all questions relating to energy supply and energy use within the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). <b>The</b> <b>agency</b> <b>is</b> supporting the 2000-watt society initiative to cut the nation's energy use by more than half by the year 2050.|$|E
5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules is that everyone has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>is</b> now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the duties}} of the sheriff include law {{enforcement}} services of the two county courthouses and surrounding property, service of court-ordered warrants, writs, protective orders, and other injunctions, and limited patrol responsibility with the County Police.

The creation of the School Resource Deputy division has placed a deputy sheriff at all of the local high schools, replacing the County Police. All other law enforcement services of the county are provided by multiple agencies but mostly left to the separate Prince George's County Police Department (PGPD), though some responsibilities are shared by both agencies. The PGSO, like most other county-level law enforcement agencies in the United States, is a progressive agency with an array of services in tom a Specialized Services Team dealing with high-risk arrest warrants and barricaded situations to community services aiding the county's residents in safety education.
