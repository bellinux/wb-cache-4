40|$|In {{this work}} I {{consider}} <b>the</b> exact <b>upscaling</b> of <b>the</b> transport in layered porous media. Some applications of <b>the</b> <b>upscaled</b> equation is discussed. 1. Introduction <b>The</b> <b>upscaling</b> of <b>the</b> transport phenomena {{plays an important}} role in many applications, flow in porous media, turbulent diffusion just to name a few. For the flow in heterogeneous reservoirs it is usually the case that the level of detail incorporated into geologic characterization of reservoirs typically exceeds the capabilities of traditional flow simulators by a wide margin. For this reason, <b>the</b> <b>upscaled</b> models play an important role in the simulation. Developing an <b>upscaled</b> equation for <b>the</b> transport of mass in porous media has been under extensive study (see e. g.

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{upscaling}} in reservoir simulation is to capture the dynamic behavior of fine scale models at the coarse scale. Traditional static or dynamic methods use assumptions about the boundary conditions to determine <b>the</b> <b>upscaled</b> properties. In this paper, we show that <b>the</b> <b>upscaled</b> properties are strongly dependent on the flow process observed at the fine scale. We use a simple no-crossflow depletion drive process and demonstrate that an upscaled property is not a constant value. Instead, {{if the goal is}} to match the performance of the fine scale model, <b>the</b> <b>upscaled</b> permeability changes with time. We provide an analytical solution to determine <b>the</b> <b>upscaled</b> permeability and present <b>the</b> value of <b>upscaled</b> permeability under limiting conditions. Our equation suggests that it is possible that upscaled value can fall outside the range of fine scale values under certain conditions. We show that for pseudo steady state flow, using common averaging methods like arithmetic or even geometric averaging methods can lead to optimistic results. We also show that the no-crossflow solution is significantly different than crossflow solution at late times. We validate our method by comparing the results of the method with flow simulation results in two and multi-layered models.|$|R

5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in <b>the</b> <b>upscale</b> Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this work, we revisit <b>the</b> <b>upscaling</b> {{process of}} {{diffusive}} mass transfer of a solute undergoing a homogeneous reaction in porous media {{using the method}} of volume averaging. For linear reaction rate kinetics, <b>the</b> <b>upscaled</b> model exhibits a vis-à-vis correspondence with the mass transfer governing equation at the microscale. When nonlinear reactions are present, other methods must be adopted to <b>upscale</b> <b>the</b> nonlinear term. In this work, we explore a linearization approach {{for the purpose of}} solving the associated closure problem. For large rates of nonlinear reaction relative to diffusion, the effective diffusion tensor is shown to be a function of the reaction rate, and this dependence is illustrated by both numerical and analytical means. This approach leads to a macroscale model that also has a similar structure as the microscale counterpart. The necessary conditions for the vis-à-vis correspondence are clearly identified. The validation of the macroscale model is carried out by comparison with pore-scale simulations of the microscale transport process. The predictions of both concentration profiles and effectiveness factors were found to be in acceptable agreement.

40|$|The Tubåen Formation in the Norwegian Sea is an aquifer and {{was used}} by Statoil ASA as the {{injection}} reservoir for CO 2 separated from produced gas at Snøhvit in the time period between April 2008 until it was abandoned in April 2011. The CO 2 injection and plume development is currently described with a simulation model using only one set of isotropic, un-scaled flow functions, i. e. {{the potential for a}} more accurate simulation model is great. This thesis investigate how upscaled flow functions affect the dynamic behaviour in <b>the</b> reservoir. Different <b>upscaling</b> techniques are used and compared by looking at how they affect the CO 2 plume development in the formation. All models used in this thesis are the property of Statoil ASA. Lithofacies models with small scale hetereogeneities typical for the Tubåen formation, Wavy and Flaser, are made to fit each of the zones in Tubåen before the flow functions are <b>upscaled</b> in <b>the</b> models using <b>the</b> <b>upscaling</b> techniques Capillary Equilibrium and Viscous Limit. <b>The</b> <b>upscaling</b> is performed by <b>the</b> <b>Upscaling</b> Module in <b>the</b> open source software Open Porous Media. The resulting relative permeability curves clearly show that the small scale heterogeneities and <b>upscaling</b> technique affect <b>the</b> two-phase flow. In the final step <b>the</b> <b>upscaled</b> flow functions are used in various combinations as input in the full scale simulation model of the Tubåen Formation. A set of models with various combinations of upscaled flow functions are made to be able to distinguish between geology effects in the reservoir and relative permeability effects on the CO 2 distribution. All models with upscaled curves are also compared to the Basecase with a single set of isotropic, un-scaled flow functions. The results are that small scale geological heterogeneities, demonstrated by Wavy and Flaser bedding, are found to greatly affect the development of the plume, and most so Wavy bedding. <b>The</b> choice of <b>upscaling</b> technique, Capillary Equilibrium or Viscous Limit, is also found to be of great importance for the CO 2 distribution - especially in the gravitational dominated period after injection stop.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, remote-sensing {{products}} found {{their use in}} numerous public applications and scientific research. Frequent validation of remote-sensing products is necessary {{to ensure the quality}} and accuracy. An important step in this process is <b>the</b> <b>upscaling</b> from field measurements of leaf area index (LAI) or other biogeophysical variables to the scale of a high-resolution satellite image. Unlike other vegetation types, semi-arid woodlands are often characterized by a distinct vegetation pattern, a low vegetation cover and site variations in bare soil reflectance which influence <b>the</b> <b>upscaling</b> process. This paper focuses on <b>the</b> <b>upscaling</b> of LAI field measurements of a semi-arid woodland in northwest China and the uncertainties associated with it. The LAI measurements were scaled up using two different approaches. <b>The</b> first <b>upscaling</b> method uses an ordinary average of the LAI measurements. The alternative method uses an area-based weighted average. The vegetation characteristics showed abundant small vegetation patches which were not accurately reflected in the systematic LAI field measurements. Therefore, the alternative method which reflected the vegetation structure more accurately needs to be considered. We conclude that an area-weighted average based on the fractional green vegetation cover is to be preferred over a simple average. If possible destructive sampling of the LAI is be preferred over indirect LAI measurements to reduce the errors associated with vegetation clumping and the presence of abundant non-green biomass. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
