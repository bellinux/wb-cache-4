40|$|Summary. The stabifity of an {{aircraft}} with automatic throttle and elevator controls {{has been investigated}} theoretically using an analogue computer. Throttle application proportional to change in airspeed,, incidence, or rate of pitch may provide damping of the long-period motion, but speed is shown {{to be the most}} suitable variable. The control of {{an aircraft}} having negative static margin is considered and shown to require either the addition of an integral control on the throttle or a combination <b>of</b> <b>throttle</b> and elevator controls. Where it is required to control height by means of the elevator, some aircraft flying under certain conditions can only be adequately stabilised by means <b>of</b> an automatic <b>throttle</b> control. 1.

50|$|There are {{two primary}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>throttle</b> {{position}} sensors (TPS): a potentiometer or a non-contact sensor Hall Effect sensor (magnetic device). A potentiometer is a satisfactory way for non-critical {{applications such as}} volume control on a radio, but as it has a wiper contact rubbing against a resistance element, dirt and wear between the wiper and the resistor can cause erratic readings. The more reliable solution is the magnetic coupling, which makes no physical contact, so will never be subject to failing by wear. This is an insidious failure as it may not provide any symptoms until there is total failure. All cars having a TPS have {{what is known as}} a 'limp-home-mode'. When the car goes into the limp-home-mode it is because the accelerator and engine control computer and the throttle are not talking to each other {{in a way that they}} can understand. The engine control computer shuts down the signal to the throttle position motor and a set of springs in the throttle set it to a fast idle, fast enough to get the transmission in gear but not so fast that driving may be dangerous.|$|R

For the internal combustion engine, the most promising of these include gasoline direct injection, downsizing and fully variable valve trains. While new <b>types</b> <b>of</b> spray-guided gasoline direct injection (GDI) combustion systems are finally set to yield the level of fuel consumption improvement which was originally promised for the so-called 'first generation' wall- and air-guided <b>types</b> <b>of</b> GDI, injectors for spray-guided combustion systems are not yet in production to help justify the added complication and cost of the NOx trap necessary with a stratified combustion concept. Conversely, hardware suitable for homogeneous combustion systems is available now and this approach offers the advantage that simple three-way catalysis only needs to be used for exhaust gas aftertreatment. This in turn means that homogeneous GDI is a technology applicable to a world-wide market, because NOx traps are susceptible to poisoning by sulphur, such as is to be found in high concentrations in US gasolines. Advanced mechanically-variable valve trains are in production now, which considerably reduce pumping losses in the 4 -stroke engine over the conventional 'variable density' <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>throttling.</b> Fully variable valve trains are being developed to production, too. These technologies allow throttling loss to be addressed directly rather than by the more circuitous route of stratified charge combustion. While homogeneous combustion systems with load control by valve event may not offer the ultimate thermodynamic benefits of stratified charge, the fuel consumption improvement possibilities are still considerable, relative to a state-of-the-art port fuel injection engine. The present work discusses the start of the HOTFIRE consortium project which is a three-year programme to investigate the strong interactions and synergies between homogeneous GDI and fully variable valve train systems. Initial results from the consortium's high-speed optical access engine, fitted with a research fully variable valve train system, are presented. Work responsibilities within the project are discussed together with the potential of the assembled test equipment to look at the interaction between variable valve trains and spray-guided GDI systems in the future...|$|R

In {{order to}} improve the {{drifting}} accuracy of aerostatic bearings, the manufacturing errors effects on disturbing torque of aerostatic bearings is studied by using the finite element method. The finite element mathematic model of the major influence factors of disturbing torque is established. Then, the finite element equation in the gas film domain is solved and the disturbing torque {{in the presence of}} disturbing factors is calculated. The research focuses on elliptical error and prismatic error of journal and incline error <b>of</b> <b>throttle</b> slit. The setting angle of journal, incline position angle <b>of</b> <b>throttle</b> slit and radial eccentricity ratio which affect the disturbing torque is also studied. The results show that roundness error of journal and incline error <b>of</b> <b>throttle</b> slit affect the disturbing torque significantly, that is the greater roundness error of journal and incline error <b>of</b> <b>throttle</b> slit the greater disturbing torque. Disturbing torque is periodic function of setting angle of journal and incline position angle <b>of</b> <b>throttle</b> slit.

In the research, the theoretical disturbing torque value is compared with the experimental value of a certain aerostatic bearing, find that they are on the whole accordant with each other and then prove that the finite element model and the method use to solve the problem is correct.

40|$|Abstract — Recently, some {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} about whether the increase of UDP traffic due to Skype <b>type</b> <b>of</b> applications will <b>throttle</b> down regular TCP users. This concern {{comes from the fact}} that UDP connections are unresponsive to congestion, i. e., UDP senders do not reduce their sending rates when congestion occurs. On the other hand, most UDP based real time applications, such as Voice-over-IP (VoIP) applications, will drop out completely if the user perceived quality becomes unacceptable as the network congestion increases. This user back-off mechanism effectively reduces UDP traffic rate when the network is congested. In this paper, we investigate the fairness issue between VoIP flows and TCP flows under different network environment. Our study explicitly takes into account both transport layer congestion control mechanism built-in TCP protocol stack and the selfadaptiveness of VoIP users. Various models are developed to characterize VoIP user back-off behaviors in response to call quality degradation resulted from packet loss inside the network. The comparison between VoIP user back-off and TCP rate adaption shows that not only VoIP flows consume much less bandwidth than TCP flows, but also VoIP traffic is indeed very responsive to congestion when the network is overloaded.

In this paper, a parametric study <b>of</b> <b>throttling</b> components in a multi-stage high {{pressure reducing}} valve (MSHPRV) is carried out, including the relative angle of inner and outer porous shrouded holes, the orifice plate thickness, the number of orifice plates and the diameter of plate holes. A numerical model is established to investigate internal flow and throttling characteristics with RNG k-ε model, and it is validated by the theoretical flux calculation. The results show that, the relative angle set as 180 ° can obtain the largest decompression pressure when steam flows through porous shrouded valve core, while the turbulence degree is the lowest. Setting one orifice plate can decrease the turbulent dissipation rate. The plate thickness has less influence on throttling effects. For ensuring the outlet flux, plate holes with smaller diameters should be chosen with a better flowing property on thermodynamic parameters.
