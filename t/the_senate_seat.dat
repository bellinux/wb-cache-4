5|$|Radio {{personality}} Janet Jeghelian took {{an early}} lead in polls among {{candidates for the}} Republican nomination for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat,</b> but Romney proved the most effective fundraiser. He won 68percent of the vote at the May 1994 Massachusetts Republican Party convention; businessman John Lakian finished a distant second, eliminating Jeghelian. Romney defeated Lakian in the September 1994 primary with more than 80percent of the vote.|$|E

Instead, Ford ran for and won <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat,</b> and Carroll succeeded him as governor. In 1975, he sought a full term in office and won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in a four-way primary against Jefferson County Judge Todd Hollenbach, former state Auditor Mary Louise Foust, and Robert McCreary Johnson.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Morrow {{was chosen}} as the Republican {{candidate}} for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> of Thomas Paynter. Paynter had decided not to seek re-election, and the Democrats nominated Ollie M. James of Crittenden County. The General Assembly was heavily Democratic and united behind James. On a joint ballot, James defeated Morrow by a vote of 105–28. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment the next year, this was the last time the Kentucky legislature would elect a senator.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1949, Nixon {{embarked}} on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less well known, to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran. With many of his closest advisers urging him to do so, Nixon decided in early October to seek <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.|$|E

5|$|James Abram Garfield (November 19, 1831– September 19, 1881) was the 20th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1881, {{until his}} {{assassination}} later that year. Garfield had served nine {{terms in the}} House of Representatives, and had been elected to the Senate before his candidacy for the White House, though he declined <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> once he was elected President. He is the only sitting House member to be elected president.|$|E
5|$|Jennings, {{seeking to}} advance his {{political}} career, {{ran for the}} Senate twice, but was defeated in both attempts. In 1825 he was a senate candidate {{at a time when}} the Indiana General Assembly elected the state's senators to Congress. On the first ballot Isaac Blackford came in first, the incumbent governor, William Hendricks, came in second, and Jennings was third. On the fourth ballot Hendricks won <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>seat.</b> In his second attempt Jennings lost to James Noble.|$|E
5|$|Six {{years later}} Beckham again {{attempted}} to win <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat.</b> Due {{to the passage}} of the Seventeenth Amendment, the senator would not be elected by the legislature, but by popular vote. In the Democratic primary Beckham defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a 12-year veteran congressman. The Republican nominee was former governor Augustus E. Willson. Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|The {{move was}} panned in the state's newspapers, and by {{prominent}} citizens such as future governor James Turner Morehead. Yet Slaughter {{followed up with}} another unpopular decision, appointing Martin D. Hardin, {{a member of the}} hated Federalist Party, to fill <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> of William T. Barry. Despite this, the General Assembly made the appointment permanent when it convened in December 1816. However, the administration candidate for a full senatorial term, John Adair was defeated in the General Assembly, which opted for John J. Crittenden.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{indications}} otherwise, Mathias {{announced on}} September 27, 1985, {{that he would}} not seek a fourth term. His announcement concerned Republican party officials in the state, who feared that local Republicans had poorer election chances without Mathias {{at the top of the}} ticket. At the national level, Mathias' announcement came shortly after news that Republican Paul Laxalt of Nevada would be retiring as well. The departure of two Republican senators from swing or Democratic-leaning states was treated by Republican party leaders as a poor sign of the party's chances in the upcoming elections. Linda Chavez won the Republican primary for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat,</b> and she lost the general election to Democrat Barbara Mikulski.|$|E
5|$|On November 27, 1950, Clements {{resigned}} {{to accept a}} seat in the U.S. Senate, elevating Wetherby to governor. One of his first actions was to call a special legislative session to convene on March 6, 1951 for the purpose of allocating the state's $10million budget surplus. Among the expenditures approved in the special session were increases in teachers' salaries and state benefits for the needy and government employees. Wetherby's popularity soared {{as a result of this}} session, and he seriously considered running for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> vacated by the death of Virgil Chapman in 1951. Instead, after talking with Clements and other Democratic leaders, he decided to seek a full, four-year term as governor.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 1874, he was {{nominated}} as the West Virginia Democratic Party candidate for the West Virginia Senate seat at the party's Eleventh Senatorial District Convention in Petersburg. In November 1874 Clayton won his election to <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> <b>seat</b> and represented the district alongside R.B. Sherrard of Hardy County. Clayton first served in the West Virginia Legislature's 12th Legislative Session, which convened in Charleston on January 13, 1875, and adjourned on December 23, 1875. He served in the 13th Legislative Session of 1876, and in the 14th legislative session of 1877 when he served as senator from the Eleventh Senatorial District alongside David Pugh of Hampshire County. Clayton served {{in the state senate}} until 1879.|$|E
5|$|State legislatures elected U.S. Senators {{until the}} {{ratification}} of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. In 1849 one of New York's seats was up for election, and a Whig would likely be elected to replace John Adams Dix. Seward, with Weed's counsel, decided to seek the seat. When legislators convened in January 1849, he was spoken of as the favorite. Some opposed him as too extreme on slavery issues, and intimated {{that he would not}} support the slaveholding President-elect Taylor, a Louisianan. Weed and Seward worked to dispel these concerns, and when the vote for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> took place, the former governor received five times the vote of the nearest other candidate, gaining easy election on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|A special {{election}} {{was scheduled for}} January 19, 2010, for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy's death. Shortly before his death, Kennedy had written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, for a term expiring upon the {{special election}}. (Kennedy had been instrumental in the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry's presidential campaign succeed.) The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> until {{the completion of the}} special election. Kirk announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the special election. In that election, Republican State Senator Scott Brown won the seat in a stunning upset, ending Democratic control of it going back to 1953.|$|E

5|$|As {{chairman}} of the state's Republican Party, McNary campaigned to get the Republican presidential nominee, Charles Evans Hughes, elected in the 1916 presidential election. Hughes, a former US Supreme Court justice and future chief justice, carried Oregon but lost the presidency to the incumbent, Woodrow Wilson. When US Senator Harry Lane died in office, on May 23, 1917, it created an opportunity for McNary to redeem himself after his failed bid for election to the Oregon Supreme Court. McNary was among several possible successors considered by Oregon Governor James Withycombe. The governor preferred someone who supported national women's suffrage and Prohibition, and he shared with McNary an interest in farming. Furthermore, McNary supporters argued that both progressive and conservative factions of the Republican Party would accept McNary and that unity would give the party {{the best chance of}} retaining <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> in the next election. Withycombe appointed McNary to the unexpired term on May 29.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the {{practice}} of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers. In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly. He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951. Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950. Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat</b> vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency. Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley's old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, the Democrats held a {{majority}} in the Ohio legislature. In a caucus meeting to determine the party's choice for United States Senator, many Democratic legislators looked to replace the incumbent Senator, Democrat George H. Pendleton, because they disagreed with his advocacy of civil service reform and low tariffs. Some of Pendleton's opponents, led by Oliver Payne, promoted Henry Payne for <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>seat,</b> recalling his opposition to both of those positions during his time in the House. After a secret ballot by the Democratic caucus, Payne received 46 out of 80 votes. Because Oliver was a trustee and treasurer of the Standard Oil company, many of the Pendleton supporters immediately alleged that $100,000 from the oil trust had been used to bribe Democratic legislators, and claimed that an open ballot would not have favored Payne.|$|E
