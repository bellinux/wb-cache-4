500|$|... "Dance Hall" [...] is styled in {{the genre}} of the same name, and also {{incorporates}} funk. The segue track [...] "Times Squares 2:30 A.M." [...] was recorded by the group {{on the street with}} a tape recorder. [...] "Fun" [...] has a hip hop groove, jazz fusion tone, and irreverent, party theme similar to [...] "Dance Hall". [...] "Anniversary" [...] is about mature, lasting love. Elysa Gardner of Vibe calls it [...] "a grandly romantic, nine-minute bolero that lavishes its female subject with such warmth and respect that the cheeky misogyny of [...] seems instantly forgiveable."

500|$|Bernthal was {{extremely}} comfortable with his character on set. [...] "The second {{he opened his}} mouth and started reading the scene, I knew it was him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good.

One of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> being secretary of state is I am out of politics. I am not interested in being drawn back into it by anybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 6, 2014, John Petrucci {{said that}} Dream Theater were already [...] "planting seeds for album No. 13". He commented: [...] "There are some song ideas and {{little things like}} that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted.

How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?' Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{ended up}} getting {{a job as a}} copywriter. <b>The</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> {{advertising}} from a British point of view, is that it didn't have a kind of class distinction as other jobs had.

2500|$|Chapman {{appeared}} in Captain Britain and MI: 13, as explained by writer Paul Cornell, [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> this title is that, because all British superheroes are de facto part of MI-13, we can visit disparate {{parts of the}} Marvel UK scene without it being a big deal.

But as a nation, we recognize the right of all people to believe as they want and not to impose our beliefs on other people. I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. I have since the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a U.S. Senate candidate. I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, that we should sustain and support it, and I sustain and support that law, {{and the right of}} a woman to make that choice, and my personal beliefs, like the personal beliefs of other people, should not be brought into a political campaign." ...|$|E

The second song released from the record was [...] "Smokin'" [...] from Boston, which prominently features session keyboardist Fred Mandel. Drummer Charlie Benante explained {{the selection of the}} Boston song by saying: [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>things</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Smokin’" [...] is that there’s a really cool section that has a real [...] "Anthrax-y" [...] feel to it, the guitars and drums and playing the same type of rhythm, the kick drums are going with the guitars – I immediately heard in my head what we could do with it." ...|$|E
