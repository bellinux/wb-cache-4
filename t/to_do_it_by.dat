It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of stokers <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This {{meant that the}} boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E

Our descendants will walk the hillside of that future, innocent beneath the stars, with no more between them and their naked will than a wolf has. THEN there will be Gods in the Earth.|$|E
25|$|The book {{tells the}} story of the quest for Captain Grant of the Britannia. After finding a bottle the captain had cast into the ocean after the Britannia is shipwrecked, Lord and Lady Glenarvan of Scotland contact Mary and Robert, the young {{daughter}} and son of Captain Grant, through an announcement in a newspaper. The government refuses to launch a rescue expedition, but Lord and Lady Glenarvan, moved by the children's condition, decide <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> themselves. The main difficulty is that the coordinates of the wreckage are mostly erased, and only the latitude (37 degrees) is known; thus, the expedition would have to circumnavigate the 37th parallel south. The bottle was retrieved from a shark's stomach, so it is impossible to trace its origin by the currents. Remaining clues consist of a few words in three languages. They are re-interpreted several times throughout the novel to make various destinations seem likely.|$|E

In the 1980s, remixing was still a new concept and technology, by which a particular vocal phrase could be endlessly copied, repeated, chopped up, transposed {{up and down in}} pitch and give them more echo, reverberation, treble or bass.

2500|$|Prior to the 20th century, {{it was a}} {{commonly}} held belief that nature itself was simple and that simpler hypotheses about nature were thus {{more likely to be}} true. This notion was deeply rooted in the aesthetic value that simplicity holds for human thought and the justifications presented for it often drew from theology. Thomas Aquinas made this argument in the 13th century, writing, [...] "If a thing can be done adequately by means of one, it is superfluous <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> means of several; for we observe that nature does not employ two instruments [...] one suffices." ...|$|E

[...] It was Chris Marker's suggestion to approach Hanns Eisler, to which Resnais agreed after hearing a recording of his music. Although he was concerned that the composer's fee would put the film over budget, the producer Dauman was supportive.

[...] "I am always embarrassed by {{doubt in my mind}} as to whether I shall act and speak, or whether I shall contribute most by silence.

[...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization.

McKenzie exhorted him to stay with the Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and that you may have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>by</b> constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for."
