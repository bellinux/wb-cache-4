Metesky had answered the door in pajamas; after he was ordered <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> for the trip to Waterbury Police Headquarters, he reappeared wearing a double-breasted suit, buttoned.|$|E
25|$|In 1639, he was arrested. His {{books were}} confiscated. The authorities, hardly giving Quevedo time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>dressed,</b> took the poet to the convent of San Marcos in León.

500|$|The {{thoroughness}} of the muster {{was heavily}} dependent on the class of the passengers; the first-class stewards {{were in charge of}} only a few cabins, while those responsible for the second- and third-class passengers had to manage large numbers of people. The first-class stewards provided hands-on assistance, helping their charges <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> and bringing them out onto the deck. With far more people to deal with, the second- and third-class stewards mostly confined their efforts to throwing open doors and telling passengers to put on lifebelts and come up top. In third class, passengers were largely {{left to their own devices}} after being informed of the need to come on deck. Many passengers and crew were reluctant to comply, either refusing to believe that there was a problem or preferring the warmth of the ship's interior to the bitterly cold night air. The passengers were not told that the ship was sinking, though a few noticed that she was listing.|$|E
2500|$|Lakeisha Gamble, {{one of the}} {{contributing}} {{founders of}} Mindless Behavior, convinced future producer of the group, Walter Millsap, to form an American boy band. He was opposed to the idea at first, as explained in the film, [...] Millsap {{is the founder of}} Conjunction Entertainment Inc., and has worked with the likes of Beyonce, Alicia Keys, and Jennifer Lopez. Along with Gamble and Millsap, there was Streamline Records head Vincent Herbert, who agreed on the concept of forming a boy band. Following the idea of forming the group, Gamble, Millsap, Herbert, songwriter Candice Nelson, and choreographer David Scott held open auditions in California in an attempt to find local boys that would fit the criteria of the group. Augusts' cousin had known Gamble, who encouraged her to bring him to the auditions. He was unaware of the group auditions, and was set to attend football practice the day of. Instead, his mother told instructed him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> in his football uniform, misleading him, as they’d gone to the auditions instead. For the auditions, he had to remember choreography that was given by Dave Scott. He performed them backwards, and was a terrible dancer. However, Gamble liked his personality, and thought he could improve overtime, much to Millsap’s dismay. In turn, he missed football tryouts, but he was the second member to join Mindless Behavior, behind that of Princeton.|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>dressed</b> at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The play {{begins with}} Henrietta Angkatell (Henry's younger cousin, in her 30s) {{working on a}} {{sculpture}} and Sir Henry Angkatell reading a newspaper.

[...] Discussion reveals {{that a number of}} guests will be arriving to spend the weekend at The Hollow. [...] The first guest to arrive is Midge Hardcastle, another cousin to the Angkatells.

[...] Henrietta gives Gerda a statuette for which she had previously posed. [...] John, Sir Henry, and Midge return from the garden, and John expresses disdain for the statuette.
