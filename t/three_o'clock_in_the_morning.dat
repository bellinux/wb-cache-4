5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. The home was a self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at <b>three</b> <b>o’clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E

Meanwhile, a company of the 2nd South Carolina under Captain Carver landed two miles above Fields Point at Tar Bluff and deployed into position. The two ships steamed upriver to the Nichols Plantation, where the gunboat Harriet A. Weed anchored.|$|E

In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers, mirrors and stretched condoms. After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation. On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace, London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise. In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called [...] "Moonhead".|$|E
500|$|An [...] "Anybody But McGovern" [...] coalition, led by {{southern}} Democrats {{and organized}} labor, {{formed in the}} weeks following the final primaries. McGovern's nomination did not become assured until {{the first night of}} the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, where, following intricate parliamentary maneuverings led by campaign staffer Rick Stearns, a Humphrey credentials challenge regarding the California winner-take-all rules was defeated. Divisive arguments over the party platform then followed; what resulted was arguably the most liberal one of any major U.S. party. On July 12, 1972, McGovern officially won the Democratic nomination. In doing so and in taking over the party's processes and platform, McGovern produced what The New York Times termed [...] "a stunning sweep". The convention distractions led to a hurried process to pick a vice presidential running mate. Turned down by his first choice, Ted Kennedy, as well as by several others, McGovern selected – with virtually no vetting – Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton. On the final night of the convention, procedural arguments over matters such as a new party charter, and a prolonged vice presidential nomination process that descended into farce, delayed the nominee's acceptance speech. As a result, McGovern delivered his speech, [...] "Come home America!", at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> reducing his television audience from about 70million people to about 15million.|$|E

2500|$|Associate Creative Consultant Donna Lettow {{says about}} Darius' {{character}} development, [...] "It was always planned that Darius would die in [...] "The Hunters". The original plan for Darius {{was that he}} would reappear in flashbacks, much like Fitzcairn does now." [...] Stocker's illness in early 1993 prevented this. Panzer remembers that Stocker [...] "had announced that he had a brain tumor." [...] The season 1 promotional booklet recounts, [...] "Just days before going into production [...] actor Werner Stocker was stricken ill and was unable to work. By now the character of Darius had {{become an integral part of}} the story and the writers had to scramble to adjust the story line." [...] Abramowitz recalls, [...] "I got a call at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> saying Werner would not be available, we were shooting in a day and a half, and there was fear if we were going to have to shut down. I went into work, wrote twenty-five straight hours, without a break, and got out a script and the show went on and it turned out pretty well." [...] This script bears the date March 15, 1993. The production crew, too, had to adapt to the situation. The promotional booklet reports, [...] "Footage from previous episodes was successfully used to fill in for the absent actor." [...] Stocker died on May 27, 1993. The episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "" [...] are dedicated to him.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Lewis was famously arrested outside Elvis Presley's Graceland {{home for}} {{allegedly}} intending to shoot him. [...] Lewis had already nearly killed his bass player, Butch Owens, on September 29 (Lewis's 41st birthday) when a [...]357 accidentally {{went off in}} his hand. In Rick Bragg's 2014 authorized biography, Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, Lewis explains that the reclusive Presley {{had been trying to}} reach him and finally did on November 23, imploring him to [...] "come out to the house." [...] Lewis replied that he would if he had time but that he was busy trying to get his father, Elmo, out of jail in Tunica, for driving under the influence. Later that night, Lewis was at a Memphis nightclub called Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. [...] "Charles Feron, he owned Vapors, he give it to me," [...] Lewis explained to Bragg. [...] "A [...]38 derringer. Me, pretty well drunk, with that derringer – it ain't somethin' 'strange'." [...] Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new Lincoln Continental with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates because [...] "the nose of that Lincoln was a mile long." [...] Presley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle through the car window, not realizing it was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but [...] "Elvis, watching on the closed-circuit television, told guards to call the police. The Memphis police found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening 'the', away in handcuffs." [...] Lewis said, [...] "The cops asked Elvis, 'What {{do you want us to}} do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me – knowin' me the way he did – was ridiculous." [...] Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. [...] Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mug shot was wired around the world. Presley died of a heart attack at Graceland eight months later.|$|E

500|$|Akiva Goldsman {{decided to}} move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take {{advantage}} of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, [...] "L.A. looks empty at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon, [...] New York is never empty [...] [...] [...] it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world." [...] Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park.

5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet <b>in</b> diameter. <b>The</b> purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|R

Soon almost all the Finns were surrounded, and Armfelt commanded Maidell and Yxkull to withdraw, which in that state was more easily said than done.Almost all the commanders were killed. Von Essen fought with his sword up to his end having 32 wounds in his body. 82 per cent of his regiment was lost.The battle field was filled with dead and wounded men. The rest were trying to flee to the rocky hill behind the present monument, and from there towards Laihia.Very few of the local reserves were lucky enough to survive.
