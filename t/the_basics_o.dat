The SSFNet platform is a Java-based software interface {{that might be}} implemented on its own or with a cooperation with an upper level software kit. First, we discuss the library classes for the network scheme development and the ways of launching the network simulation process. Later chapters briefly describe a newly developed graphical user interface into the SFFNet platform. The use of the simulation sofware is outlined {{in the end of}} the paper. 1 INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK MODELLING AND SIMULATIONS Network modelling and simulation plays an important role when designing large network infrastructures both heterogenous and homogenous.

40|$|Objective. The {{objective}} of the course is to introduce the modeling of heterogeneous agents economies, learn about economies with incomplete markets, and search and matching frictions. The student will be familiarize with the modern quantitative techniques used in macroeconomics, and will be exposed to important research questions in macroeconomics. In addition, the course will review some of the numerical methods used to solve heterogeneous agents economies with incomplete markets. The second part will cover topics on Search Theory and Labor Market Applications. Walrasian theory describes an ideal competitive market setting where trade is costless and markets always clear. While the theory is useful for discussing some issues, it does not capture well the actual functioning of some markets. In the labor market, for instance, unemployment coexists with unfilled job openings and homogeneous workers are sometimes paid different wages. We discuss an alternative approach to markets based on search theory. The key insight is that trade is an economic activity. Specifically, agents must sample the market for trading opportunities, and this search process is costly and its outcome is uncertain. The ultimate purpose {{of this approach is}} to build on an equilibrium theory where rational decision making by individuals is consistent with the absence of market clearing and with price dispersion. We will review classical models where some workers will optimally choose to remain unemployed (and wait for better opportunities), and some employers pay different wages even if their workers are identical. While we will focus on labor markets as a central application, this approach has been used in other areas, including IO, monetary economics, housing, finance and family economics. Requirements. The course requires some basic knowledge of: (1) dynamic programming, (2) measure theory, and (3) Markov chains. There are several references to refresh <b>the</b> <b>basics</b> <b>o...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction Genetics {{as a set}} of {{principles}} and analytical procedures did not begin until 1866, when an Augustinian monk named Gregor Mendel performed a set of experiments that pointed to the existence of biological elements called genes - <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> units responsible for possession and passing on of a single characteristic. Until 1944, it was generally assumed that chromosomal proteins carry genetic information, and that DNA plays a secondary role. This view was shattered by Avery and McCarty who demonstrated that the molecule deoxy-ribonucleic acid (DNA) is the major carrier of genetic material in living organisms, i. e. is responsible for inheritance. In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick deduced the three dimensional structure of DNA and immediately inferred its method of replication.

The logic, then, of designing an analogous term for use with the artificial kidney was persuasive for Wolf et al (2). While initially helpful, the interpretation of artificial kidney clearance has become overly complex owing to the proliferation of artificial kidney techniques with subsequent "customization " of the clearance term for each technique.

The rash occurs simultaneously {{with the onset}} of the effector phase of the antiviral immune response and substantial evidence of immune activation. This immune response is effective in clearing virus and in establishing long-term resistance to reinfection but is associated with immune suppression, autoimmune encephalomy-elitis, and increased susceptibility to secondary infections. This apparent paradox may be ex-plained in part by preferential long-term activation of type 2 CD 4 + T cells by measles virus infection. Preferential stimulation of type I CD 4 + T cells by inactivated virus vaccines is hypoth-esized to playa role in subsequent development of atypical measles.

Despite differences in detail, however, the general proposals are fairly uniform, each making minor {{modifications to the}} feature set of SPE (Chomsky and Halle, 1968) and the geometry of Clements (1985) – with two notable exceptions. First, Clements (1991) proposed an innovative unification of consonant and vowel place features, which greatly economized the set of place features. Second, all proposals for sign language depart radically from spoken language proposals. In this paper, we propose a very different model of feature geometry, in which the insights of Clements (1991) are extended {{to other areas of}} the phonology, and structural and featural economy are exploited to the greatest extent possible. This model not only eliminates a large number of features from the grammar (including the major class features), but it provides a unified analysis for consonants, vowels, place, manner, tones, complex and contour segments in spoken and signed languages. 1.

CO 2 interacts with <b>basic</b> OH– and <b>O</b> 2 – of PO 43 – groups to form hydrogenocarbonates and surface carbonates, respectively. It also generates surface type A carbonates and related water upon substitution of two neighboring structural OH– groups. Water modifies <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> properties of <b>the</b> HAp by decreasing the surface carbonatation and enhancing {{the formation of}} hydrogenocarbonates, and promotes the substitution ability of OH– by carbonates. Due to the affinity of HAp for carbonatation, the thermodesorption experiment of CO 2 accounts for the thermal decomposition of bulk type A and B carbonates rather than for the lone surface basicity. As for the acetylene probe, three nondissociative adsorption modes of acetylene on the HAp surface are observed: a π complex interaction with acidic POH, an interaction with an acid–base (POH–OH) pair, and finally, a σ complex interaction with basic OH– {{that is the most}} stable upon desorption. There is no evidence of <b>the</b> involvement of <b>basic</b> <b>O</b> 2 – of PO 43 – in the interaction with acetylene.

These measurements may be extended to other thin oxide films as well. The Kelvin probe technique, also known as the "vibrating capacitor " method, has been used commonly to measure the work functions of metals under vacuum.

Many security notions for PKE have been proposed, including several versions of CPA-security, CCA-security, and non-malleability. These security notions are usually {{defined in terms of}} a certain game that an efficient adversary cannot win with non-negligible probability or advantage. If a PKE scheme is used in a larger protocol, then the {{security of}} this protocol is proved by showing a reduction of breaking a certain security property of the PKE scheme to breaking the security of the protocol. A major problem is that each protocol requires in principle its own tailor-made security reduction. Moreover, which security notion of the PKE should be used in a given context is a priori not evident; the employed games model the use of the scheme abstractly through oracle access to its algorithms, and the sufficiency for specific applications is neither explicitly stated nor proven.
