5|$|<b>The</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> money {{derives from}} {{circulation}} and loan-making. A village of ten households may have 100,000 coins. If the cash {{is stored in}} the household of one individual, even after a century, the sum remains 100,000. If the coins are circulated through business transactions so that every individual of the ten households can enjoy <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> the 100,000 coins, then the utility will amount to that of 1,000,000 cash. If circulation continues without stop, <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> the cash will be beyond enumeration.|$|E

30|$|Equation (6) {{means that}} {{among all the}} {{alternative}} sets, the ratio of choice probabilities of any two of the decision-maker’s alternatives only associates with <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>of</b> these two alternatives but {{has nothing to do}} with <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>of</b> any other alternatives.|$|R
40|$|Most {{approaches}} to mining association rules implicitly consider <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> itemsets to be equal. We assume that <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>of</b> itemsets may differ, and identify <b>the</b> high <b>utility</b> itemsets {{based on information}} in the transaction database and external information about utilities. Our theoretical analysis of the resulting problem lays the foundation for future utility mining algorithms. ...|$|R

5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, as {{it would have been easy}} to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E
5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. <b>The</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters {{can be derived from}} it by applying a scaling factor to the components of the prototype. The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor.|$|E
50|$|Two classic {{allocation}} {{rules are}} the egalitarian rule - aiming to equalize <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>of</b> all agents (equivalently: maximize <b>the</b> minimum <b>utility),</b> and <b>the</b> utilitarian rule - aiming to maximize <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>utilities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> {{function}} is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> form [...] then <b>the</b> marginal <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> [...] is [...] and <b>the</b> marginal <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> [...] is [...] The {{slope of the}} indifference curve is, therefore,Observe that the slope {{does not depend on}} [...] or : the indifference curves are straight lines.|$|R

5|$|Four {{other species}} of hammerhead sharks overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and bonnethead, and the large-sized {{scalloped}} hammerhead and great hammerhead. Little competition occurs between these species because of their differing habitats and dietary preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> vision (hence its smaller eyes). Adult males and juveniles of both sexes form schools of uniform body size; these schools {{do not appear to}} relate to reproduction or migration. Adult females are apparently solitary.|$|E
5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a millimeter in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> such observations.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{scale was}} {{developed}} by Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 went on commission for the United Nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas. While performing the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. Mirroring <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> the Richter magnitude scale in describing earthquakes, he devised a 1–5 scale based on wind speed that showed expected damage to structures. Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E
30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} average effort of all {{households}} is distinctly {{higher in the}} exit-right scenario than in the exit-cost scenario, while the contrary {{is the case for}} households in teams. This difference increases as the value of theta grows. <b>The</b> average <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> all households is generally close in the two scenarios. <b>The</b> average <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> households in teams is distinctly higher in the exit-cost scenario. As theta grows, in the exit-cost scenario, <b>the</b> average <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> all households increases more rapidly, whereas <b>the</b> average <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> households staying in teams decreases more rapidly.|$|R

5000|$|... and if {{the person}} has <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> {{function}} with u(0)=0, u(40)=5, and u(100)=10 then <b>the</b> expected <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bet equals 5, {{which is the same}} as <b>the</b> known <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amount 40.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> Feynman {{diagrams}} is {{that other}} types of physical phenomena {{that are part of}} the general picture of fundamental interactions but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a neutron decays into an electron, proton, and neutrino, an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the weak nuclear force.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} brands ran {{commercials}} {{tied to the}} 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company General Motors aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which {{a group of friends}} drove Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.|$|E
5|$|Approaches to {{the design}} of {{genome-wide}} RNAi libraries can require more sophistication than the design of a single siRNA for a defined set of experimental conditions. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to design siRNA libraries and to predict their likely efficiency at gene knockdown. Mass genomic screening is widely seen as a promising method for genome annotation and has triggered the development of high-throughput screening methods based on microarrays. However, <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> these screens and the ability of techniques developed on model organisms to generalize to even closely related species has been questioned, for example from C. elegans to related parasitic nematodes.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of these}} and other successes, Lowe was {{authorized}} to build four additional balloons and the needed inflation equipment. However, Lowe's initial successes proved difficult to recreate in field conditions, and aside from limited successes, such as at the Battle of Seven Pines, <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> the Balloon Corps was limited. In addition, jurisdictional squabbles arose between Lowe's civilian command and the military officers under whom he worked. By early 1863, Lowe had grown tired of dealing with military minutia and left the Corps, returning to civilian research. The Balloon Corps fell to the command of less-capable individuals and was eventually eliminated in August 1863.|$|E
5|$|Kingswear Castle is an {{artillery}} fort, built to protect Dartmouth harbour in Devon, England. It was constructed between 1491 and 1502 {{in response to}} the threat of French attack {{and was one of the}} first purpose-built artillery forts in Britain. By the end of the 16th century, however, improvements in the range of artillery weapons had reduced <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> the castle. It took part in the English Civil War and continued to be armed until the early 18th century, but fell into ruin. Restored as a summer house in 1855, in the 21st century it is managed by the Landmark Trust as a holiday let.|$|E
5|$|While most insects {{have three}} simple eyes, or ocelli, only two ocelli {{are present in}} all species of Lepidoptera, except a few moths, {{one on each side}} of the head near the edge of the {{compound}} eye. On some species, sense organs called chaetosemata are found near the ocelli. The ocelli are not homologous to the simple eyes of caterpillars which are differently named as stemmata. The ocelli of Lepidoptera are reduced externally in some families; where present, they are unfocussed, unlike stemmata of larvae which are fully focussed. <b>The</b> <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> ocelli is not understood at present.|$|E

30|$|A {{strategy}} proof {{and efficient}} resource allocation strategy, which satisfies {{the property of}} intuitive fairness (see Definition 6) is robust to a particular user’s scaling down <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>utility,</b> when <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>of</b> all other users are fixed.|$|R
30|$|In practice, multinominal {{logit model}} (MNL) has to satisfy IIA property, which means that, all the {{alternatives}} are independent {{with each other}} and the ratio of choice probabilities only associates with <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> given alternatives and is irrelevant to <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>of</b> any other alternatives. IIA property is generated from IID assumption of error term (The error term satisfies independent and identical type I extreme value distribution). IID constrains cannot be guaranteed if heterogeneity and similarity problems remain, which may result in the wrong statistic inference.|$|R

50|$|In other words: if an individual's {{behavior}} always {{satisfies the}} above axioms, {{then there is}} a utility function such that the individual will choose one gamble over another if and only if <b>the</b> expected <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> one exceeds that of the other. <b>The</b> expected <b>utility</b> <b>of</b> any gamble may be expressed as a linear combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outcomes, with the weights being <b>the</b> respective probabilities. <b>Utility</b> functions are also normally continuous functions. Such utility functions are also referred to as von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) utility functions. This is a central theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> expected <b>utility</b> hypothesis in which an individual chooses not the highest expected value, but rather <b>the</b> highest expected <b>utility.</b> <b>The</b> expected <b>utility</b> maximizing individual makes decisions rationally based on the axioms of the theory.|$|R
