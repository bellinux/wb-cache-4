The gold piece was the second quarter eagle to be a commemorative, after the Panama–Pacific issue of 1915.

5|$|All {{of these}} {{temperatures}} {{could be reached}} with ancient methods used since the Bronze Age. Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond , {{it is important that}} smelting take place in a low-oxygen environment. Smelting, using carbon to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy (pig iron) that retains too much carbon to be called steel. <b>The</b> <b>excess</b> carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.|$|E
5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to <b>the</b> <b>excess</b> level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E
5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy.

The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E

5|$|A new convoy, codenamed Operation Excess {{was on its}} {{way through}} Malta with {{ammunition}} supplies. Excess coincided {{with the arrival of the}} Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) in Sicily to support the faltering Italians in the theatre, after the failed invasion of Egypt. On 9 January the Regia Aeronautica flew a fighter sweep over the Grand Harbour. Eighteen Macchi C.200s from 6° Gruppo were engaged in aerial combat. MacLachlan climbed to 22,000 feet and spotted the enemy fighters 10,000 below. He attacked a group of six and shot one down into the sea where it left a large plume of water. MacLachlan circled the sea and noticed the Italian pilot had escaped his aircraft and survived. Capitano Luigi Armanino was taken aboard a rescue craft to a prisoner of war camp in Malta, wounded in the thigh and arm. MacLachlan claimed a second Macchi shot down minutes later. The following day he attacked an Italian Fiat CR.42 over <b>the</b> <b>Excess</b> convoy as the Italians attacked the ships once more. Four others appeared and they climbed over him and dropped onto his tail. Not risking a five to one encounter, MacLachlan flew over <b>the</b> <b>Excess</b> convoy hoping the ship's fire would protect him The British vessels fired at him in error but his aircraft was not hit.|$|E

5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as <b>the</b> <b>excess</b> profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E
