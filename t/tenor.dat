5|$|The introduction's {{keyboard}} fantasia gradually {{opens the}} band's languid, expansive interplay. The song's groove is established {{with the introduction}} of a bass guitar ostinato at 4:50. Rhythm and <b>tenor</b> guitars and a horn section are played in the next two minutes. During the bridge, Allen's drumming intensifies within the song's seven-minute mark, which leads to a fully developed Afrobeat section; Afrobeat is a type of loose funk music embellished with African syncopation, R-styled horn instrumentation, and improvisatory solos. Confusions extended mid-tempo section has complex arrangements of danceable grooves, multiple solos, and Allen's polyrhythms. In this section, Kuti plays <b>tenor</b> saxophone, which he had learned after the 's original <b>tenor</b> player, Igo Chico, left in 1973. The music is complemented by his outspoken call-and-response vocal passages. The song's final 10 minutes comprise raucous trumpet, <b>tenor</b> saxophone solos, and Kuti's lead vocals.

5|$|Some {{instruments}} {{fall into}} more than one category: for example, the cello may be considered <b>tenor,</b> baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble, and the trombone may be alto, <b>tenor,</b> baritone, or bass and the French horn, bass, baritone, <b>tenor,</b> or alto, depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range {{as part of their}} name: soprano saxophone, <b>tenor</b> saxophone, baritone horn, alto flute, bass guitar, etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabass clarinet. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C3 to F♯6, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.|$|E
