5|$|The men's singles {{rules have}} {{undergone}} several changes {{since the first}} edition. This event has always been contested in a knockout format, and all matches have been best-of-five sets except in 1970, 1973, and 1974, when the first round was best-of-three sets, and in 1982, when {{the third and fourth}} round were best-of-three sets. Since 1905, all sets have been decided in the advantage format. The lingering death best-of-twelve points <b>tie-break</b> was introduced in 1971 and has been used for the first four sets since then, except from 1980 to 1982, when the <b>tie-break</b> was also played in fifth sets.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{took the}} first set on a <b>tie-break</b> {{just as he had}} done in the US Open final the {{previous}} year, and while the second set followed a similar pattern with no breaks of serve, this time Djokovic took the <b>tie-break.</b> One break of serve in the eighth game (two hours and 52 minutes into the contest) was enough for Djokovic to take the third set before taking the fourth 6–2 comfortably against a tired-looking Murray, who needed four hours to defeat Federer in the semifinal just two days before. The match lasted three hours and 40 minutes and four sets. By winning Djokovic won his sixth Grand Slam tournament title to tie him with greats such as Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, whereas Murray equalled Edberg's feat of three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open.|$|E
40|$|Two BOLA {{projection}} {{devices were}} {{used to test the}} reactions of eight good tennis players with simulated serves up to 160 mph. It was found that the number of successful returns decreased with speed and the number if aces increased significantly at speeds over 126 mph. The percentage of <b>tie-breaks</b> at Wimbledon, the US Open and Roland Garros (for 1999) was compared to average first serve speeds for male players. It was found that the number of <b>tie-breaks</b> increased significantly at speeds above 100 mph and that the serve speed and percentage of <b>tie-breaks</b> was related to the surface played upon with faster surfaces having higher serve speeds. It was concluded that the ability to return a ball successfully decreased rapidly above 126 mph, that this was more likely to occur on faster surfaces and that average serve speeds above 110 mph led to an increased percentage of <b>tie-breaks...</b>|$|R

5|$|The men's singles' {{rules have}} {{undergone}} several changes {{since the first}} edition. From 1884 to 1911, the event started with a knockout phase, the All-Comers singles, whose winner faced the defending champion in a challenge round. The All-Comers winner was awarded the title six times (1888, 1893, 1898, 1901, 1904, 1907) {{in the absence of}} the previous year's champion. The challenge round system was abolished with the 1912 edition. Since 1881, all matches but the All-Comers final and the challenge round were played as the best-of-three sets, before the event switched to best-of-five for all rounds in 1886. Best-two-out-of-three-sets matches were reintroduced for early rounds in 1917, from 1943 to 1945, and from 1975 to 1978. Before 1884, the winner of the next game at five-games–all took the set in every match except the All-Comers final and the challenge round, which were won by the player who had at least six games and at least two games more than his opponent. This advantage format was introduced for the final sets of early rounds in 1884, and used for all sets in all rounds from 1887 to 1969. The <b>tie-break</b> system was introduced in 1970 for all sets, in its best-of-nine points sudden death version until 1974, and in its best-of-13 points lingering death version since 1975. In addition, the US Open is the only slam to have a fifth set <b>tie-break,</b> which has never occurred in the final since the <b>tie-break</b> was instituted.|$|E

5|$|The Gentlemen's Singles' {{rules have}} {{undergone}} several changes {{since the first}} edition. From 1878 until 1921, the event started with a knockout phase, the All Comers' Singles, whose winner then faced the defending champion in a challenge round. The All Comers' winner was automatically awarded the title six times (1879, 1887, 1891, 1895, 1907, 1908) {{in the absence of}} the previous year's champion. The challenge round system was abolished with the 1922 edition. Since the first championships, all matches have been played at the best-of-five sets. Between 1877 and 1883, the winner of the next game at five games – all took the set in every match except the All Comers' final, and the challenge round, which were won with six games and a two games advantage. All sets were decided in this advantage format from 1884 to 1970. The lingering death best of 12 points <b>tie-break</b> was introduced in 1971 for the first four sets, played at eight games all until 1978 and at six games all since 1979.|$|E
5|$|The US Open final they contested equalled {{the record}} as the longest US Open final in history, {{as well as}} the second longest major final in Open Era history, behind the 2012 Australian Open final. It also {{featured}} the longest ever <b>tie-break</b> in a US Open final, with a 12–10 final score in the first set. Other notable matches include a nearly five-hour-long semifinal match in the 2012 Australian Open, which Djokovic won 7–5 in the fifth set, as well as a semifinal meeting at the 2012 Olympic Games, with Murray winning in straight sets. At ATP Masters 1000 level, they've met 20 times, with Djokovic leading 14–6. Ten of these meetings came in finals, and they are tied at 5–5. Their most notable match in this category was in the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, where Djokovic saved 5 championship points to win the title, ending Murray's perfect 12–0 record at the event.

5|$|Fifteen {{of their}} 38 matches {{have been on}} clay which is {{statistically}} Nadal's best surface and Federer's worst, with 13 being in finals. Nadal has a winning record on outdoor hard courts (8–6) and clay (13–2), while Federer leads on grass (2–1) and indoor hard courts (5–1). Because tournament seedings are based on rankings, 24 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record 9 Grand Slam tournament finals. From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final. Nadal won six of the nine, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Four of these finals were five set-matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts. Thirteen of their 38 meetings have reached a deciding set. They have also played in 12 Masters Series finals, including their lone five-hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set <b>tie-break</b> having saved two match points and at the 2005 Miami Masters where Federer came back from 2 sets down to win in nearly 4 hours. They also contested {{the final of the}} ATP World Tour Finals in 2010 with Federer winning in 3 sets. Nadal has defeated Federer on grass in Wimbledon (which is Federer's better surface) but Federer {{has not been able to}} beat Nadal on clay in Roland Garros losing to him several times.|$|E
