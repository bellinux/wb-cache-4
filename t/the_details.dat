50|$|Once {{costs are}} {{appended}} to accounting or billing tables, <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> transactions from an ECRS may be “rolled up” to higher-level totals for movement to invoices, statements and bills. However, <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> transactions can remain in interim ECRS tables or files for subsequent reporting.

5|$|Episodic {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of specific events. This sort of memory can last for a lifetime.

5|$|Historical {{accuracy}} {{was important}} to many British designers, resulting {{in the use of}} genuine military equipment as models for memorials, and long discussions with committees over <b>the</b> <b>details</b> to be incorporated into designs.

50|$|Synchrotron X-ray {{tomography}} can employ {{phase contrast}} imaging to enable imaging {{of the interior}} surfaces of objects. In this context, phase contrast imaging is used to enhance the contrast that would normally be possible from conventional radiographic imaging. A difference in the refractive index between a detail and its surroundings causes a phase shift between the light wave that travels through <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> and that which travels outside <b>the</b> <b>detail.</b> An interference pattern results, marking out <b>the</b> <b>detail.</b>|$|R

Burrell next orders <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> to perform an undercover operation, which ends with the shooting of Detective Kima Greggs. The shooting prompts more involvement from Frazier who, along with Burrell, try to project the image of a strong department to the public by seizing a large amount of narcotics.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{progressive}} encoding method for geometric information of 3 D object model, which is represented with binary voxels. For progressive transmission, we create multi-resolution {{model of the}} 3 D models by pyramidal decomposition. However, a simple pyramidal decomposition, which decimates 3 D model by 3 D sampling, can not preserve <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> structure of <b>the</b> 3 D model, which is very sensitive to human vision system, in low resolution model. The proposed algorithm creates adaptive pyramidal decomposition models for <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> region in <b>the</b> 3 D model. First, comparing the surface normal, <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> region is classified. <b>The</b> <b>detailed</b> region is described by smaller size voxels {{than that of the}} other region. Thus <b>the</b> <b>detailed</b> region can preserve higher resolution. For encoding, each resolution model is predicted from its lower resolution model, and the prediction errors are arithmetic encoded. It is demonstrated by simulation results that the proposed algorithm provides better coding gain than the conventional mesh-based algorithm, especially for natural objects. 1...|$|R
