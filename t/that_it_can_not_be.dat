Most of the a priori arguments, both religious and [...] anti-religious, on the origin of things, are fallacies drawn from [...] the same source.|$|E

5000|$|Confocal microscopy: {{this method}} has the {{advantage}} of high lateral resolution because of the use of a pin hole but has the disadvantage <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> measure on steep flanks. Also, it quickly loses vertical resolution when looking at large areas since the vertical sensitivity depends on the microscope objective in use.|$|R
50|$|Featuring a non-unified memory architecture, the console's RDRAM {{has very}} high access latency, which is contrasted with its high {{bandwidth}} advantage. The R4300 CPU's ability to access RAM is constrained by its requirement to route all RAM accesses through the RCP, {{and by the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> use DMA to do so.|$|R
6000|$|... 190 In some cases, a Kind is {{sufficiently}} identified by some one [...] remarkable property: but most commonly several are required; each [...] property considered singly, being a joint property {{of that and}} of [...] other Kinds. The color and brightness of the diamond are common to [...] it with the paste from which false diamonds are made; its octohedral [...] form is common to it with alum, and magnetic iron ore; but the color [...] and brightness and the form together, identify its Kind: that is, [...] are a mark to us that it is combustible; that when burned it [...] produces carbonic acid; <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> cut with any known [...] substance; together with many other ascertained properties, and the [...] fact that there exist an indefinite number still unascertained.|$|E
60|$|After {{they shall}} have {{provided}} for the present emergency, it will merit their most serious labors to render tranquillity with the savages permanent by creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace, the establishment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States {{is most likely to}} conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion, with constant and plentiful supplies, with a ready market for the commodities of the Indians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive in exchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress, they will recollect <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> accomplished by any means yet {{in the hands of the}} Executive.|$|E
6000|$|... § 7. If, in {{the second}} place, the property, in the {{instances}} {{in which it has}} been observed, is not an effect of causation, it is a property of Kind; and in that case the generalization can only be set aside by the discovery of a new Kind of crow. That, however, a peculiar Kind not hitherto discovered should exist in nature, is a supposition so often realized <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> considered at all improbable. We have nothing to authorize us in attempting to limit the Kinds of things which exist in nature. The only unlikelihood would be that a new Kind should be discovered in localities which there was previously reason to believe had been thoroughly explored; and even this improbability depends on the degree of conspicuousness of the difference between the newly-discovered Kind and all others, since new kinds of minerals, plants, and even animals, previously overlooked or confounded with known species, are still continually detected in the most frequented situations. On this second ground, therefore, {{as well as on the}} first, the observed uniformity of co-existence can only hold good as an empirical law, within the limits not only of actual observation, but of an observation as accurate as the nature of the case required. And hence it is that (as remarked in an early chapter of the present book) we so often give up generalizations of this class at the first summons. If any credible witness stated that he had seen a white crow, under circumstances which made it not incredible that it should have escaped notice previously, we should give full credence to the statement.|$|E
50|$|Reaction 1 is a {{pretreatment}} of {{the sample}} performed by adding glucokinase to convert glucose to glucose 6-phosphate {{in the presence of}} adenosine triphosphate, pyruvate kinase, and phosphoenol pyruvate.

40|$|Numerous {{scenarios}} of emissions growth presume <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> grow infinitely: {{there are certain}} limits that may not or must not be exceeded. Applying the theory of pulsing logistic growth, I detected two pulses of logistic growth. This {{led me to the}} conclusion that constructing a scenario of emissions growth one should pay {{attention to the fact that}} limits to their growth do not remain constant...|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} experiment, the rod is lowered using a manual or {{automatic}} device {{to the surface}} being analyzed until a meniscus is formed, and then raised so that the bottom edge of the rod lies on {{the plane of the}} undisturbed surface. One disadvantage of this technique is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> bury the rod into the surface to measure interfacial tension between two liquids.|$|R
60|$|The law {{of cause}} and effect, being thus certain, is capable of imparting its {{certainty}} to all other inductive propositions which can be deduced from it; and the narrower inductions may be regarded as receiving their ultimate sanction from that law, {{since there is no}} one of them which is not rendered more certain than it was before, when we are able to connect it with that larger induction, and to show <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> denied, consistently with the law that every thing which begins to exist has a cause. And hence we are justified in the seeming inconsistency, of holding induction by simple enumeration to be good for proving this general truth, the foundation of scientific induction, and yet refusing to rely on it for any of the narrower inductions. I fully admit that if the law of causation were unknown, generalization in the more obvious cases of uniformity in phenomena would nevertheless be possible, and though in all cases more or less precarious, and in some extremely so, would suffice to constitute a certain measure of probability; but what the amount of this probability might be, we are dispensed from estimating, since it never could amount to the degree of assurance which the proposition acquires, when, by the application to it of the Four Methods, the supposition of its falsity is shown to be inconsistent with the Law of Causation. We are therefore logically entitled, and, by the necessities of scientific induction, required, to disregard the probabilities derived from the early rude method of generalizing, and to consider no minor generalization as proved except so far as the law of causation confirms it, nor probable except so far as it may reasonably be expected to be so confirmed.|$|E

50|$|The {{aspect of}} {{retribution}} for the deed {{may be the}} reason that Abegg was also an advocate for death penalty. In a review he states that for him death penalty is not a revenge, not violence against a crime - no, it shall be the revocation of the wrong, highly personified, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> persist anymore without objection.

50|$|The {{rule was}} named after Hugo Paul Friedrich Schulz and Rudolf Arndt. The latter {{originally}} formulated it in 1888. However, the exceptions to the rule are so numerous <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> considered a general law. For instance, many paralysing substances have no exciting effect in weak doses, and what constitutes a weak, medium or strong stimulus is highly individual, as pointed out by Arndt himself.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of sodium persulfate for ISCO {{began in the}} late 1990s because of the limitations in using peroxide or permanganate as oxidants. Peroxide has such a short life <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> transported properly. Permanganate only treats chlorinated solvents with double bonds and is easily used up by organic material in soil. Persulfate is more stable, treats a wider range of contaminants, and is not used up by soil organics as easily.|$|E
