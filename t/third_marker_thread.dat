40|$|One of the {{challenges}} facing the management of undergraduate research projects is achieving and maintaining consistency in the marking process. High staff turnover, {{the introduction of new}} academics to supervisory teams and the desire to benchmark internationally exacerbate the challenge. The current assessment process within the Unitec Bachelor of Construction programme requires the student project first to be marked by the student’s supervisor. This is then followed by second, independent marking of all the student assignments by an external academic. When significant variation of marks occurs and post-marking negotiation between the markers cannot achieve agreement, a <b>third</b> independent <b>marker</b> is utilised. This paper outlines the development of an assessment rubric intended to provide clear standards and goals for both students and supervisors. The introduction of a rubric is intended {{to reduce the number of}} times significant variation in marks is experienced between markers. In cases where variation still occurs, the use of a rubric serves to define the problem and clarify the marking expectations. This assists with the negotiation process between the first and second markers, ideally removing the need for a <b>third</b> <b>marker</b> in most instances. In the most difficult of cases, negotiation will be required between three markers. Again, the use of the rubric allows a clear statement of the issues under discussion and the areas of divergence, allowing the participants to focus on reaching a satisfactory outcome...|$|R
50|$|In 2000 a <b>third</b> <b>marker</b> was {{dedicated}} by the Lemhi Shoshone tribe. As {{the son of}} Sacagawea, a Northern Shoshone {{who lived in the}} Lemhi Valley, Charbonneau is considered one of their people. Earlier in the twentieth century, Dr. Grace Raymond Hebard of the University of Wyoming, a political economist, not a historian or anthropologist, argued that Charbonneau died and was buried at the Shoshone Wind River Indian Reservation. Dr. Charles Eastman, a Santee Sioux and not of the Shoshone language group, did research that attempted to establish that Charbonneau's mother Sacagawea died at the reservation on April 9, 1884. Some believe that Charbonneau died in 1885 and was buried next to her. Memorials in their names were erected in 1933 at Ft. Washakie. Eastman did his research in 1924-25, interpreting oral history. But his translation has been superseded by documentary evidence for both Charbonneau and Sacagawea.|$|R
30|$|Although it was {{demonstrated}} that the basic method developed here (Fig.  2 a) was applicable for the isolation of yeast cells with mating ability from common sake yeast strains, due to the requirement for the repeated exchange of plasmids, this approach still required multiple steps to perform the final hybridization and isolated a- or α-type derivatives. To {{reduce the need for}} plasmid exchange steps, we introduced a <b>third</b> <b>marker</b> gene, which was compatible with the hygro and kanMX 4 marker genes, into the selection system. Using the commercial plasmid pAUR 112, which contains the AUR 1 -C marker gene, we successfully isolated hybrid cells without the need for the time-consuming plasmid exchange process. In a back-crossing comprising n cycles of hybridization, only a single plasmid exchange step would be required in the scheme illustrated in Fig.  2 b and c, whereas (2 n +  1) plasmid exchange steps would be needed in the scheme described in Fig.  2 a.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are also}} constructions in some {{languages}} {{that appear to}} change the valence of a verb, but in fact do not. So called hierarchical or inversion languages are of this sort. Their agreement system will be sensitive to an external person or animacy hierarchy (or a combination of both): 1 > 2 > 3 or Anim > Inan and so forth. E.g., in Meskwaki (an Algonquian language), verbs inflect for both subject and object, but agreement markers do not have inherent values for these. Rather, a <b>third</b> <b>marker,</b> the direct or inverse marker, indicates the proper interpretation: ne-wa:pam-e:-w-a 1-look.at-DIR-3-3Sg [...] "I am looking at him", but ne-wa:pam-ekw-w-a 1-look.at-INV-3-3Sg [...] "He is looking at me".

40|$|We {{present a}} general method for {{isolating}} molecular markers specific to any region of a chromosome using existing mapping populations. Two pools of DNA from individuals homozygous for opposing alleles for a targeted chromosomal interval, defined {{by two or}} more linked RFLP markers, are constructed from members of an existing mapping population. The DNA pools are then screened for polymorphism using random oligonucleotide primers and PCR (1). Polymorphic DNA bands should represent DNA sequences within or adjacent to the selected interval. We tested this method in tomato using two genomic intervals containing genes responsible for regulating pedicle abscission (jointless) and fruit ripening (non-ripening). DNA pools containing 7 to 14 F 2 individuals for each interval were screened with 200 random primers. Three polymorphic markers were thus identified, two of which were subsequently shown to be tightly linked to the selected intervals. The <b>third</b> <b>marker</b> mapped to the same chromosome (11) but 45 cM away from the selected interval. A particularly attractive attribute of this method is that a single mapping population {{can be used to}} target any interval in the genome. Although this method has been demonstrated in tomato, it should be applicable to any sexually reproducing organism for which segregating populations are being used to construct genetic linkage maps...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{samples were}} {{extracted}} separately from 10 male and 10 female sexual progeny of pointed gourd (Trichosanthes dioica), and 3 plants from a parthenocarpic clone (IIVRPG- 105); the DNAs were bulked by sex type.

A total of 509 amplification products were obtained of which six were associated with sex expression. These six markers were then tested with individual plant DNA samples, and three sex-associated RAPD markers were identified. A 1000 bp amplification product from the primer OPC 05 was found to be present in all the male and absent from all the female and parthenocarpic plants. In contrast, a 400 bp amplification product from the primer OPC 14 was present only in the female individuals. Thus the two RAPD markers, male-specific marker OPC 051000 and female-specific marker OPC 14400, together can reliably differentiate between male and female plants of T. dioica.

40|$|We have {{constructed}} strains {{that allow}} a direct selection for mutators of Escherichia coli {{on a single}} plate medium. The plate selection is based on using two different markers whose reversion is enhanced by a given mutator. Plates containing limiting amounts of each respective nutrient allow the growth of ghost colonies or microcolonies {{that give rise to}} full-size colonies only if a reversion event occurs. Because two successive mutational events are required, mutator cells are favored to generate full-size colonies. Reversion of a <b>third</b> <b>marker</b> allows direct visualization of the mutator phenotype by the large number of blue papillae in the full-size colonies. We also describe plate selections involving three successive nutrient markers followed by a fourth papillation step. Different frameshift or base substitution mutations are used to select for mismatch-repair-defective strains (mutHLS and uvrD). We can detect and monitor mutator cells arising spontaneously, at frequencies lower than 10 − 5 in the population. Also, we can measure a mutator cascade, in which one type of mutator (mutT) generates a second mutator (mutHLS) that then allows stepwise frameshift mutations. We discuss the relevance of mutators arising on a single medium as a result of cells overcoming successive growth barriers to the development and progression of cancerous tumors, some of which are mutator cell lines...|$|R

In {{the present}} study, we {{undertook}} an integrative approach, using molecular data {{to assess the}} diversity of the Laurencia complex in Macaronesian islands (Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands) where speciation events are supposedly common leading to a high endemism. Identification of species of the Laurencia complex based on anatomical and morphological characters is extremely difficult due to phenotypic plasticity and overlaps in many morphological characters. As a consequence, among the 28 species reported so far from these Macaronesian archipelagos, 14 species records have been regarded as doubtful. We used DNA barcode data (mitochondrial COI gene and partial nuclear LSU marker) as a tool for species delimitation. A <b>third</b> <b>marker</b> (rbcL gene) was also studied and phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the three independent markers as well as the combined data set, in the aim to infer the phylogenetic relationships and biogeographic affinities of members of the complex from Macaronesia.

40|$|Background: DNA barcoding {{has been}} {{successfully}} established in animals {{as a tool for}} organismal identification and taxonomic clarification. Slower nucleotide substitution rates in plant genomes have made the selection of a DNA barcode for land plants a much more difficult task. The Plant Working Group of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) recommended the two-marker combination rbcL/matK as a pragmatic solution to a complex trade-off between universality, sequence quality, discrimination, and cost. Methodology/Principal Findings: It is expected that a system based on any one, or a small number of plastid genes will fail within certain taxonomic groups with low amounts of plastid variation, while performing well in others. We tested the effectiveness of the proposed CBOL Plant Working Group barcoding markers for land plants in identifying 46 bromeliad species, a group rich in endemic species from the endangered Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. Although we obtained high quality sequences with the suggested primers, species discrimination in our data set was only 43. 48 %. Addition of a <b>third</b> <b>marker,</b> trnH–psbA, did not show significant improvement. This species identification failure in Bromeliaceaecould also be seen in the analysis of the GenBank’s matK data set. Bromeliaceae’s sequence divergence was almost three times lower than the observed for Asteraceae and Orchidaceae. This low variation rate also resulted in poorly resolved tree topologies.
