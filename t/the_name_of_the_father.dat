5|$|Donnchadh {{was the son}} of Gille-Brighde, son of Fergus, king of the Gall-Gaidhil. Donnchadh's ancestry {{cannot be}} traced further; no patronymic is known for Fergus from {{contemporary}} sources, and when Fergus' successors enumerate their ancestors in documents, they never go earlier than he does. The name Gille-Brighde, used by Donnchadh's father (Fergus' son), was also <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of Somhairle, petty king of Argyll {{in the third quarter of}} the 12th century. As the original territory of the Gall-Gaidhil kingdom probably adjoined or included Argyll, Alex Woolf has suggested that Fergus and Somhairle were brothers or cousins.|$|E
5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer {{would have made it}} an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their influence {{can be seen in the}} AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each in <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E

Thompson scripted and starred in Sense and Sensibility (1995), which earned her (among other awards) an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and a BAFTA Award for Best Actress.

25|$|The surname 'Irani' {{was adopted}} by the Zoroastrian {{immigrants}} in the 18th century and later, and only by them, for legal and communal reasons. Sheriar was then not born with 'Irani' as a last name, and would originally have had his father's first name as a surname; thus his birth name was probably Sheriar Moondegar. Inversely, in Indian Zoroastrian tradition, which goes back to the days before family names were introduced by the British colonial government, the middle name is always the father's first name, so if one knows a person's middle name, one knows <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>father.</b> For instance, Meher Baba's full legal name was Merwan Sheriar Irani.|$|E

500|$|Branham {{stated that}} his first {{exposure}} to Pentecostalism was in 1936; however, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church he attended prior to 1933 believed {{in most of the}} basic doctrines of Pentecostalism.

Pentecostalism is a renewal movement that started in the early 20th century that stresses a post-conversion baptism with the Holy Spirit for all Christians, with speaking in tongues ("glossolalia") as the initial evidence of this baptism.
