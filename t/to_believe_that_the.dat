5|$|Because Montgomery was now {{tied to the}} Livingston family, who {{supported}} the Patriot cause, he began to turn against the British government, seeing himself as an American instead of an Englishman. He came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British government was being oppressive and was acting like a tyrannical parent-state.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{considered}} {{not making}} Tali a squadmate in Mass Effect 3. Some writers, such as Weekes, felt passionately about her inclusion, which {{led the team}} <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players could share his passion. Preston Watamaniuk, lead designer for the Mass Effect series, found Tali's death in 3 was the toughest for him to plan, though felt {{it needed to be}} possible due to the option of wiping out the quarians.|$|E
5|$|Donal {{meanwhile}} {{turns to}} alcohol, devastated {{at the fact}} that he has brought about a god who, according to Donal's religion, should not even exist. However, Reed's analysis leads him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> final component needed to deal with the rift is lightning, and Donal is convinced to turn into the Viking god once more.|$|E

5|$|George Went Hensley (May 2, 1881 – July 25, 1955) was an American Pentecostal {{minister}} {{best known}} for popularizing the practice of snake handling. A native of rural Appalachia, Hensley experienced a religious conversion around 1910: {{on the basis of}} his interpretation of scripture, he came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> New Testament commanded all Christians to handle venomous snakes.|$|E
5|$|The final {{catalyst}} {{for the expansion of}} the investigation was the Seattle General Strike, which began the day before the Senate passed Resolution 439. This confluence of events led members of Congress <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> alleged German-Bolshevist link and Bolshevist threat to the United States were real.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.

60|$|Every {{person with}} whom he became acquainted {{with any degree of}} {{intimacy}} was made familiar with his side of the story. Moore's Biography is from first to last, in its representations, founded upon Byron's communicativeness, and Lady Byron's silence; and the world at last settled down <b>to</b> <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> account so often repeated, and never contradicted, must be substantially a true one.|$|R

5|$|With {{some people}} unable <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese {{would be so}} ruthless, rumours began to spread almost {{immediately}} after news of the attack was made public. The most common rumour was that Centaur had been carrying munitions or commandos {{at the time of}} her sinking, with the Japanese made aware of this prior to her departure. This stemmed from an incident involving the ambulance drivers' weapons during loading in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described what she saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
50|$|Protestant {{denominations}} of Christianity {{reject the}} claims of Petrine primacy of honor, Petrine primacy of jurisdiction, and papal infallibility. These denominations vary from simply not accepting the pope's claim to authority as legitimate and valid, <b>to</b> <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pope is the Antichrist from 1 John 2:18, the Man of Sin from 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12, and the Beast out of the Earth from Revelation 13:11-18.|$|R

5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has no reason <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E
5|$|As {{the park}} is a {{national}} nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading {{to the death of}} wildfowl, the park's dogs-on-leads policy was extended. Park users are said <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park and Royal Parks advises against walking dogs in the park during the deer's birthing season.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{was largely}} forested in this period; {{widespread}} forest clearance {{did not occur}} in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from {{the vicinity of the}} White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the river, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Maloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.|$|E

5|$|Catherine's father, Tom Miller (Ken Pogue), tells Black {{about two}} {{friends of his}} whose son was convicted of killing his wife. The father, C. R. Hunziger, is dying of {{pancreatic}} cancer, but maintains his distance from his son over the crime; his wife Adele, however, still believes her son to be innocent. Black visits the terminal Hunziger, hoping to change his mind, but the elderly man holds his position. Adele gives Black a folder full of documents relating to the case, which Black reviews. His knowledge of offender profiling leads him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> convicted man, Malcom, is innocent; however the conviction was secured with a substantial level of physical evidence.|$|E
5|$|Judge Kaul {{issued a}} dissenting opinion in both cases. In these {{opinions}} {{he asserted that}} he continues <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ICC lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae over the situation in Kenya. His assertion was that the although crimes were committed they were not of a nature which constitute crimes against humanity within {{the jurisdiction of the}} ICC. This was the third time that Judge Kaul wrote a similar dissent opposing the prosecutions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) shows Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to {{a garden}} that Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) has started. Kate discovers that Sun speaks English {{when the two}} are working in the garden, and Sun asks her not to tell anyone. Locke finds Sayid {{trying to make sense}} of Danielle Rousseau's maps, and gives him a compass. Sayid tells Jack that {{according}} to Locke's compass, north is not where it should be, causing him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> instrument is defective. Hurley and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) spend the day fishing. After Hurley fails to catch anything and accidentally steps on a sea urchin after giving up, Jin treats the wound and later gives Hurley a fish.|$|E
60|$|Our forefathers, in {{the days}} of Popery, lost it; and because they did not trust in God as a good God, who took good care of the world which He had made, they fell <b>to</b> <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> devil, and witches, the {{servants}} of the devil, could raise storms, blight crops, strike cattle and human beings with disease. And they began, too, to pray, not to God, but to certain saints in heaven, to protect them against bodily ills.|$|R
50|$|Jeff - Jeff's {{installation}} {{is going}} swimmingly until Jeff and Fred decide to screw their window into their shim (which {{would cause the}} shim to split). Then, Fred, <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> screws <b>that</b> came into <b>the</b> window were too small (due <b>to</b> <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> screws should be flush with the window's inside frame - and hence the predrilled holes are too big), proceeds to void the window's warranty by drilling holes next to the window's predrilled holes. When informed by Andrew of Fred's mistake, though, they do manage to finish.|$|R

5|$|On 26 November, {{the detainees}} were deported, {{along with their}} families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware {{although}} government assistance was provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, was his idea. A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and it remains unclear what the party's official position was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a new Jewish homeland.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Afonso's {{death from}} fever {{at the age}} of one devastated the Emperor, and the {{imperial}} couple had no further children. Pedro Afonso's older sister Dona Isabel became heiress, but PedroII was unconvinced that a woman could ever be accepted as monarch by the ruling elite. He excluded Isabel from matters of state and failed to provide training for her possible role as empress. With no surviving male children, the Emperor started <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> imperial line was destined to end with his own death.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} scored {{four hits}} and three near misses on and around Arizona.

The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain's pantry, causing a small fire. The next forwardmost hit was near the port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating {{in the area of the}} anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.|$|E
