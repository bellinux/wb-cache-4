5|$|In response, the {{legislature}} published the revisions on its own, effectively creating {{a situation of}} dual constitutions. As {{there was not a}} quorum, the Supreme Court was unable to act. To solve the situation, the legislators appointed six new justices, but the Court still refused to act, as doing so would be to accept the appointments and thus validate the new constitution. Chamorro choreographed a ruling from the Supreme Court which voided the Assembly's publication of the reforms, provoking the Assembly to refuse to acknowledge the Court's authority. As international investors began <b>to</b> <b>fret</b> over the ensuing instability and evaluate further aid, the Roman Catholic cardinal, Miguel Obando y Bravo, stepped in as mediator and brokered an accord. Chamorro agreed to publish the new constitution, as required by law, and the assembly agreed to allow the president to continue to negotiate foreign aid and tax measures, though no longer by decree. One of the most contentious provisions, the one banning nepotism was conceded by Chamorro. Both sides claimed victory, though the Supreme Court issue was still not resolved with the Assembly insisting their appointees were valid and the President refusing to acknowledge them.|$|E

500|$|After the riff, {{the verse}} {{sections}} begin, which Shadwick describe as [...] "simplicity itself, consisting of just three chords": E79, G, and A. [...] The E79, or dominant seventh sharp ninth chord, {{has come to}} be called the [...] "Hendrix chord" [...] by guitarists and was used primarily in rhythm and blues and jazz before Hendrix helped popularize it. [...] He also used an unconventional fingering technique for the G and A chords. [...] Because Hendrix used his thumb <b>to</b> <b>fret</b> the roots of the G and A chords on the sixth string, his fingers were left in a position to create different chord voicings. [...] Instead of the usual G barre chord (G–B–G–B–D–G), a G5 (G–X–G–G–D–G) is sometimes played with the major third (B) being muted on the fifth string and replaced by the open third string (G). [...] Redding follows the chord changes mostly by playing the root with occasional passing notes, while Mitchell heightens the tension with drum flourishes that accentuate Hendrix's vocal and guitar.|$|E
500|$|Gibson's {{writing was}} {{positively}} received by science fiction writers Dennis Danvers, Candas Jane Dorsey, and Rudy Rucker. Rucker has written: [...] "ith a poet's touch, he tiles words into wonderful mosaics" [...] and Danvers wrote that [...] "no sentence has a subject {{if it can}} do without one". One critic found the prose to be as [...] "hard and compact as glacier ice" [...] and another that it [...] "gives us sharply observed small moments inscribed with crystalline clarity". Gibson's descriptions of interiors and of the built environments of Tokyo, Russia and London were singled out as impressive, and The Village Voices review remarked that [...] "Gibson expertly replicates the biosphere of a discussion board: the coffee-shop intimacy, the fishbowl paranoia, the splintering factions, the inevitable flame war". Lisa Zeidner of The New York Times Book Review elaborated: As usual, Gibson's prose is ... corpuscular, crenelated. His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles. Without any metafictional grandstanding, Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture: {{how it feels to}} be close to someone you know only as a voice in a chat room, or <b>to</b> <b>fret</b> about someone spying on your browser's list of sites visited. Filled with name-dropping of businesses and products, such as MUJI, Hotmail, iBook, Netscape, and G4, the language of the novel was judged by one critic to be [...] "awkward in its effort to appear [...] "cool"" [...] while other critics have found it overdone and feared it would quickly date the novel. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette review commented that the [...] "constant, unadulterated [...] "hipster-technocrat, cyber-MTV" [...] lingo [...] overdone and inappropriate" [...] On the technology, Cory Doctorow found Gibson's use of watermarks and keystroke logging to be hollow and has noted that [...] "Gibson is no technologist, he's an accomplished and insightful social critic ... and he treats these items from the real world as metaphor. But ... Gibson's metaphorical treatment of these technologies will date this very fine book".|$|E

40|$|Prediction {{of fatigue}} damage due <b>to</b> <b>fretting</b> is complex {{due to the}} number of {{influential}} factors and the competitive interaction between wear and fatigue. The majority of current fretting damage modeling approaches are limited to narrow ranges of conditions where little competition between damage mechanisms occurs. Recent models which account for damage interaction are largely phenomenological in nature and are still limited to a narrow range of applicability. A method to characterize and model the level of fatigue damage due <b>to</b> <b>fretting</b> was developed in this work to address the shortcomings of the current methods available by extending the range of conditions captured and enhancing the physical basis of the damage model. 	Baseline material properties for thin sheets of AISI 301 stainless steel in the full hard condition were determined as a function of temperature through tensile tests, fatigue tests, and metallography. Fretting experiments were performed for contact between 301 stainless steel and each ANSI A 356 aluminum and AISI 52100 steel. Fretting experiments were performed over a range of material combinations, normal forces, displacement amplitudes, atmospheres, and temperatures. Subsequent characterization of the damage due <b>to</b> <b>fretting</b> was performed <b>to</b> determine the level of wear and fatigue damage incurred for each condition tested. 	A finite element model of the experiment was created to determine the cyclic stress-strain behavior and local frictional energy dissipation for each condition. Fatigue damage metrics were evaluated {{to determine the effects of}} the contact conditions on the driver for fatigue damage. A new model for fatigue damage due <b>to</b> <b>fretting</b> was developed which incorporates the wear behavior to describe the effect of wear on the level of fatigue damage caused by fretting. The level of fatigue damage is influenced using a function of frictional energy dissipation and wear rate to account for differences in wear mechanisms and changes in the severity of wear caused by changes in oxidation behavior and mechanical properties which result from changes in temperature or contacting materials.
