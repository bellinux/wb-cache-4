40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} we have {{proposed}} a system that enables deaf-blind people to work with android mobile phones. The system utilizes the International Morse Code as a general communication medium. Blind & Deaf person will get Morse code via a vibrotactile device situated in every mobile to see the mobile screen. System enables deaf-blind individuals to receive immediate feedback from their typing and scanning the screen as well. Its value added services provide a means for deaf-blind people {{to communicate with the}} sighted through a common medium. Vibrotactile Morse code is particularly viable because it can be adapted for the individual’s particular <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Morse encoding communication fits well in a social facilitation context for understanding. It is technologically simply easy and standard.

40|$|Approximately, 90 % of {{patients}} with Angelman syndrome present with epileptic seizures. Obtaining an electroencephalogram (EEG) with sleep improves the chances of detecting ictal, interictal, and benign abnormal rhythms in Angelman syndrome. However, electroencephalograms, even when obtained during sleep, can be challenging in this population because of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivities</b> as well as anxiety related to a novel environment. We tested the hypothesis that 1 hour of sleep on an electro-encephalogram would provide {{as much information as}} an entire night of electroencephalogram recording, yet more than a routine electroencephalogram conducted during the day. Overnight polysomnograms were collected in 14 children with Angelman syndrome seen at Vanderbilt University. All patients who obtained sleep within the first hour of the overnight electroencephalogram had interictal discharges recorded. Our results show that when sleep is obtained, a 1 -hour electroen-cephalogram yields just as much information as recording an entire night...|$|R

40|$|Our recent {{findings}} {{have demonstrated that}} rodent models of closed head traumatic brain injury exhibit comprehensive evidence of progressive and enduring orofacial allodynias, a hypersensitive pain response induced by non-painful stimulation. These allodynias, tested using thermal hyperalgesia, correlated with changes in several known pain signaling receptors and molecules along the trigeminal pain pathway, especially in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. This study focused to extend our previous work to investigate the changes in monoamine neurotransmitter immunoreactivity changes in spinal trigeminal nucleus oralis, pars interpolaris and nucleus tractus solitaries following mild to moderate closed head traumatic brain injury, which are related to <b>tactile</b> allodynia, touch-pressure <b>sensitivity,</b> and visceral pain. Our results exhibited significant alterations in the excitatory monoamine, serotonin, in spinal trigeminal nucleus oralis and pars interpolaris which usually modulate <b>tactile</b> and mechanical <b>sensitivity</b> {{in addition to the}} thermal sensitivity. Moreover, we also detected a robust alteration in the expression of serotonin, and inhibitory molecule norepinephrine in the nucleus tractus solitaries, which might indicate the possibility of an alteration in visceral pain, and existence of other morbidities related to solitary nucleus dysfunction in this rodent model of mild to moderate closed head traumatic brain injury. Collectively, widespread changes in monoamine neurotransmitter may be related to orofacial allodynhias and headache after traumatic brain injury...|$|R

It appears that this is because distortion occurs in the periodontal mechanoreceptor stimulation input system, impairing the signal transduction system from the peripheries to the higher centers and the information processing mechanism of the central nervous system.|$|R
30|$|Another {{example of}} a genetically {{modified}} model {{is the use of}} Col 9 a 1 (−/−) mice [18, 19]. These mice have collagen type IX alpha 1 gene inactivation and they are frequently used to characterize the role of collagen type IX in the pathogenesis of OA [18, 19]. Costello et al. used this method and found that male mice homozygous for this gene inactivation developed OA and associated increased <b>tactile</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> and gait alterations by 9  months of age [20]. They were able to use this model to evaluate the degree to which OA impacts locomotor activity in mice [20]. Another genotype of mice that is highly susceptible to OA is interleukin- 6 knockout gene mice (IL- 6 (−/−)) [21]. These mice have a deficiency in interleukin 6 which results in decreased proteoglycan synthesis and reduced bone morphology density among male IL- 6 (−/−) mice compared to their wild type counterparts. This leads to the development of more severe OA among these mice [21].|$|R

5000|$|Quantitative {{psychology}} has {{its roots}} in early experimental psychology when, in the nineteenth century, the scientific method was first systematically applied to psychological phenomena.

5000|$|The {{sense of}} touch, or tactile perception, is what allows organisms {{to feel the}} world around them. The {{environment}} acts as an external stimulus, and tactile perception is the act of passively exploring the world to simply sense it. To {{make sense of the}} stimuli, an organism will undergo active exploration, or haptic perception, by moving their hands or other areas with environment-skin contact. [...] This will give a sense of what is being perceived, and give information about size, shape, weight, temperature, and material. Tactile stimulation can be direct in the form of bodily contact, or indirect {{through the use of a}} tool or probe. Direct and indirect send different types messages to the brain, but both provide information regarding roughness, hardness, stickiness, and warmth. The use of a probe elicits a response based on the vibrations in the instrument rather than direct environmental information. [...] Tactual perception gives information regarding cutaneous stimuli (pressure, vibration, and temperature), kinaesthetic stimuli (limb movement), and proprioceptive stimuli (position of the body). [...] There are varying degrees of tactual sensitivity and thresholds, both between individuals and between different time periods in an individual's life. [...] It has been observed that individuals have differing levels of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivity</b> between each hand. This may be due to callouses forming on the skin of the most used hand, creating a buffer between the stimulus and the receptor. Alternately, the difference in sensitivity may be due to a difference in the cerebral functions or ability of the left and right hemisphere. [...] Tests have also shown that deaf children have a greater degree of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivity</b> than that of children with normal hearing ability, and that girls generally have a greater degree of sensitivity than that of boys.|$|E
40|$|Human neuropsychology {{suggests}} that there are two distinct body representations. Body image and body schema are, respectively, thought to be involved in conscious perceptual judgments and unconscious sensorimotor guidance. The evidence is based on the double dissociation between disorders of perceptual detection and sensorimotor guidance. Until now, research focused on cases that had impaired <b>tactile</b> pressure <b>sensitivity</b> and comparisons of performance were of cases suffering from different types of lesions (peripheral and central). Here, we report a unique double dissociation in two stroke patients with intact basic somatosensory processing (tactile detection). One patient was poor at identifying the position of where she had been touched on a line drawing of a hand, but was able to point accurately towards the actual position on her/his hand itself. The reverse pattern was observed in the other patient. This finding provides further support for separate Processing for body image and body scheme. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) {{disciplines}} {{are challenging}} to {{blind and visually}} impaired (BVI) individuals. One of the possible reasons is the complexity in representing and understanding scientific content. Introducing tactile elements such as textures into existing Braille characters can potentially increase the information content of Braille and could likely simplify the complex notations. However, such a task requires a thorough understanding of the discrimination of textures through touch. The current dissertation focuses on: 1) Investigating the psychophysical factors involved in texture discrimination and, 2) Developing a testing system to assess friction induced skin damage from repetitive motion over textured surfaces. The <b>tactile</b> discrimination <b>sensitivity</b> for six fine textured non-patterned surfaces (fine-grit abrasive papers) was evaluated using a two-alternative forced choice technique. The surface roughness parameters and the coefficient of friction of the abrasive papers interacting with human skin were measured. Scanning electron microscopy images were used to observe the surface microstructure. The results suggest that differences in the mean spacing and the friction coefficients could be indicative of differentiability of fine textured samples. Three clearly differentiable textures identified from this study were used to investigate the effect of texture area on <b>tactile</b> discrimination <b>sensitivity.</b> A perception measurement experiment in combination with a friction measurement experiment was performed to understand the possible role of friction in touch-based texture discrimination. There was decrease in the discrimination ability with the decrease in the texture area. An elastomeric skin simulant with layered structure similar to that of human skin was constructed to replicate skin friction blisters. The relationship between applied normal load and number of cycles of reciprocating motion required for blistering was studied. Additionally, a crack-growth model was developed treating the skin simulant as an adhesive-bonded laminar composite. This study made it evident that complete profile of the tribological system is required to develop a skin simulant that can accurately predict skin friction damage. Based on the current literature, the role of surface topography and elastic properties of the human skin on friction was uncertain. Coefficient of friction of four probing surfaces, human index finger pad, silicone replicas of the finger with and without fingerprints, and a smooth silicone sphere, when sliding against fine grit abrasive papers were compared to identify these roles...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{realistic}} body representation {{needs to}} be constantly updated. In case of physiological modifications, body representations integrate information coming from different sensory sources, including the sense of touch. Previous studies described transient modifications of these representations following illusory distortions. In this single case study, we documented the changes occurred in lower-level, primary somatosensory, and higher-level representations, {{in a case of}} upper arms elongation. Method: We explored effects of arm lengthening on primary <b>tactile</b> perception (<b>sensitivity</b> and acuity), an implicit perceptual measure of body size (tactile distance judgement), body image (Daurat-Hmelijak test), and peri-personal space representation (audio-tactile interaction task). Results: We show that patient's arm representation was changed after surgery. Specifically, we observed significant changes on tactile distance judgments, body image test and audio-tactile interaction task; also even though no changes were found on primary tactile perception a significant modification emerged in tactile acuity. Conclusions: These findings are in line with evidence of cortical reorganization after arm elongation. They also support the view that the body representation of achondroplasics are modified after body-size reconstruction, and became similar to that of healthy controls...|$|R

5000|$|One {{aspect of}} raccoon {{behavior}} {{is so well}} known that it gives the animal part of its scientific name, Procyon lotor; [...] "lotor" [...] is neo-Latin for [...] "washer". In the wild, raccoons often dabble for underwater food near the shore-line. They then often pick up the food item with their front paws to examine it and rub the item, sometimes to remove unwanted parts. This gives {{the appearance of the}} raccoon [...] "washing" [...] the food. The <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of raccoons' paws is increased if this rubbing action is performed underwater, since the water softens the hard layer covering the paws. However, the behavior observed in captive raccoons in which they carry their food to water to [...] "wash" [...] or douse it before eating has not been observed in the wild. Naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, believed that raccoons do not have adequate saliva production to moisten food thereby necessitating dousing, but this hypothesis is now considered to be incorrect. Captive raccoons douse their food more frequently when a watering hole with a layout similar to a stream is not farther away than 3 m. The widely accepted theory is that dousing in captive raccoons is a fixed action pattern from the dabbling behavior performed when foraging at shores for aquatic foods. This is supported by the observation that aquatic foods are doused more frequently. Cleaning dirty food {{does not seem to be}} a reason for [...] "washing".

In fact the tongue representation is bilateral in both modalities, but predominantly ipsilateral in the gustatory modality and predominantly contralateral in the tactile modality. The absence of left gustatory extinction in those patients {{can be attributed to}} the predominant channeling of left hemitongue taste inputs into the intact left hemisphere. Since there were no severe disturbances manifested in any of the present RHD or LHD patients, it seems reasonable to assume that gustatory extinction surfaces only as an accompaniment and possibly a consequence of a very marked extinction of <b>tactile</b> lingual <b>sensitivity,</b> or even a full blown intraoral tactile hemineglect.

40|$|Background: Autism {{spectrum}} {{conditions have}} a strong genetic component. Atypical sensory sensitivities {{are one of the}} core but neglected features of autism spectrum conditions. GABRB 3 is a well-characterised candidate gene for autism spectrum conditions. In mice, heterozygous Gabrb 3 deletion is associated with increased <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> However, no study has examined if <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is associated with GABRB 3 genetic variation in humans. To test this, we conducted two pilot genetic association studies in the general population, analysing two phenotypic measures of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (a parent-report and a behavioural measure) for association with 43 SNPs in GABRB 3. Findings: Across both <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivity</b> measures, three SNPs (rs 11636966, rs 8023959 and rs 2162241) were nominally associated with both phenotypes, providing a measure of internal validation. Parent-report scores were nominally associated with six SNPs (P < 0. 05). Behaviourally measured <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivity</b> was nominally associated with 10 SNPs (three after Bonferroni correction). Conclusions: This is the first human study to show an association between GABRB 3 variation and <b>tactile</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> This provides support for the evidence from animal models implicating the role of GABRB 3 variation in the atypical sensory sensitivity in autism spectrum conditions. Future research is underway to directly test this association in cases of autism spectrum conditions...|$|E

40|$|Interplay {{between the}} {{cerebral}} hemispheres {{is vital for}} coordinating perception and behavior. One influential account holds that the hemispheres engage in rivalry, each inhibiting the other. In the somatosensory domain, a seminal paper claimed to demonstrate such interhemispheric rivalry, reporting improved <b>tactile</b> detection <b>sensitivity</b> on the right hand after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the right parietal lobe (Seyal, Ro, & Rafal, 1995). Such improvement in tactile detection ipsilateral to TMS could follow from interhemispheric rivalry, if one assumes that TMS disrupted cortical processing under the coil and thereby released the other hemisphere from inhibition. Here we extended the study by Seyal et al. (1995) {{to determine the effects}} of right parietal TMS on tactile processing for either hand, rather than only the ipsilateral hand. We performed two experiments applying TMS in the context of median-nerve stimulation; one experiment required somatosensory detection, the second somatosensory intensity discrimination. We found different TMS effects on detection versus discrimination, but neither set of results followed the prediction from hemispheric rivalry that enhanced performance for one hand should invariably be associated with impaired performance for the other hand, and vice-versa.
