40|$|Maximum 200 words.) Recently, a new impetus {{has been}} given to work to produce a whole body human/computer {{interface}} system, which encumbers the wearer to a minimum degree and operates over long distances. The input portion of such an interface can be derived by appropriate processing of signals from a nine-axis sensor package consisting of a <b>three-axis</b> angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensor,</b> a <b>three-axis</b> magnetometer, and a three-axis linear accelerometer. This paper focuses on data processing algorithms for MARG sensors. Since human limb segments are capable of arbitrary motion, Euler angles do not provide an appropriate means for specifying orientation. Instead, quaternions are used for this purpose. Since a quaternion is a four-dimensional vector, and a MARG sensor produces nine signals, this data processing problem is "overspecified". This fact can be used to discriminate against sensor noise and to reduce the effects of linear acceleration on measurement of the gravity vector by accelerometers. Detailed computer simulation studies and the results of preliminary experiments with a prototype body tracking system confirm the effectiveness of the quaternion body-tracking filter...|$|R

Extensive testing of the filter with synthetic data and actual sensor data proved it to be satisfactory. Test cases included the presence of large initial errors as well as high noise levels.

40|$|Angle {{random walk}} is {{commonly}} used as a specification for <b>rate</b> <b>sensors.</b> What is it? An angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> measures the rotation rate about its sensitive axis. The output of a <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> will be a signal proportional to deg/sec. Noise is often {{thought of as the}} short- term variation in the output, such as the peak-to-peak output variation or the standard deviation of the output while the sensor is at rest. These measures of noise will also be in units of deg/sec. Noise can also be defined as a function of frequency using a power spectral density (PSD) or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In these cases, the noise specification will be a noise density in deg/sec/Hz 1 / 2 or (deg/sec) 2 /Hz that describes the output noise {{as a function of the}} bandwidth of the sensors. Often one is interested in using the <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> to track angle changes, not simply angular rate. In this case, the output of the angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> is integrated over time to find the angle as a function of time.
