Scrub itch, a skin irritation caused by mite bites, was a more common but far less serious ailment. Tinea was also a problem, due to the inability of men to keep their clothes or boots dry, or to wash them. A shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables caused vitamin-deficiency-related problems.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to collect and analyse the {{frequency}} of fruit (fresh, dried, canned and nuts) and <b>vegetable</b> (fresh, <b>tinned,</b> legumes, soya) consumption in the group of 242 respondents aged 19 - 22 years-students of Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra; to evaluate differences according to field of study and language in which they study (Hungarian or Slovak) by questionnaire method. On the base of collected data it can be concluded that in general the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables can be considered as very low (only once a day) together with canned and dried fruit (nuts) and <b>tinned</b> <b>vegetable</b> (rarely). Furthermore, the majority of respondents took legumes only 1 - 3 times a week or rarely and soya had never been consumed. The statistically significant differences between college students of PEEH and the rest of assayed group of students had not been confirmed so the higher level of knowledge in health has not been connected with the higher consumption of fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, statistically significant differences have been proved between the following assayed groups of university students: RTH ↔ RTS (χ 7. 90, p < 0. 05), J ↔ RTH (χ 9. 99, p < 0. 05), J ↔ RTS (χ 10. 00, p < 0. 05), J ↔ PEES - SK (χ 9. 91, p < 0. 05). Statistically significant differences were assayed also in consumption of dried fruits or nuts among the following field of study: J ↔RTS (χ 9. 48, p < 0. 01), RTH ↔ RTS (χ 12. 57, p < 0. 05), RTS↔PEES (χ 8. 19, p < 0. 01). Consumption of fresh vegetables was statistically different between the students J↔RTS (χ 9. 95, p < 0. 05) and RTS ↔PEES (χ 8. 19, p < 0. 01). © 2016 Potravinarstvo. All rights reserved...|$|R

An in depth analysis is dedicated to the level of expenditures for vegetables and <b>tinned</b> <b>vegetables</b> and the structure of expenditure on the purchasing power for various types of vegetables by regions and social categories. The results show a quite high level of income dedicated for consumption and important disparities among social categories as far as the vegetable consumption is concerned. Also there is a high polarization among the EU countries concerning the income dispersion and its impact on vegetable consumption...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{differences}} between Saudis and resident foreigners in the pattern of expenditure on food commodities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The economic indicators provided by the study may help decision makers when they decide policies concerning the reduction of foreign labor in the Saudi economy. The study relied on cross sectional data from the family budget survey conducted in the Kingdom. Quantitative analysis and statistical tests were utilized. The results of the study showed that the average expenditures for Saudi household on bread and cereals, meat and poultry, dairy products, cooking oils and fats, and drinks were higher than those for foreign resident households. However, the average expenditures on smoking, food and drinks away from home were higher in foreign households than Saudi households, single and aggregate semi-logarithmic consumption-expenditure functions were estimated for each food commodity for Saudis and foreigners. The test of homogenity of regression was applied. Food commodities were categorized in two main groups according to the results of the test. The first group included the food commodities with consumption-expenditure functions which were different between Saudis and foreigners. These commodities were: bread and cereals, meat and poultry, dairy products, cooking oils and fats, fresh vegetables, pulses, fresh fruits, drinks, tobacco, and food away from home. The second group included the food commodities with consumption-expenditure functions which were homogenous for Saudis and foreigners. These com¬modities were fish and shell, fish, eggs, preserved and <b>tinned</b> <b>vegetables,</b> tubers, preserved and tinned fruits, sugar and sugar products, nuts, and other foods. Even though the consumption-expenditure elasticity on food, drinks, and tobacco for Saudis was equal to 0. 54 which was larger than that for foreigners (0. 49), yet the situation varied between com¬modities. It is expected, according to the results of this study that the reduction of foreign labor in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would result in a decrease in food consumption as well. The pattern of change would vary according to the commodities. The consumers of restaurants would be highly decreased. The consumption of tobacco - and accordingly its imports - would decrease. The changes in the levels of total expenditures would be accompanied with lower response in the expenditure on cooking oils and fats, and food and drinks away from home. It would also be accompanied with a higher response in the expenditure on bread and cereals, meat and poultry, dairy products, fresh vegetables, pulses, fresh fruits, and drinks...|$|E

40|$|A linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) {{approach}} is proposed for achieving rapid information on metal release from tinned containers into preserved vegetables. Chopped tomato and pea preserves were chosen as prototypes for acid and nearly neutral canned food, respectively.

These ligands were concomitantly found to also affect LSV profiles recorded in parallel at Sn and Fe electrodes in synthetic samples, causing the starting potential for their oxidation to be lower, the higher the ligand activity of the species considered. The data indicated that metal release and starting potentials for metal discharge are strictly related, so that LSV is able to provide rapid and useful information {{on the nature of the}} protective effect (electrochemical or physical) of tin on the steel underlayer, as well as on the extent of Sn and Fe release...|$|R
40|$|Improving the {{suboptimal}} vegetable consumption {{among the}} majority of Australian children is imperative in reducing chronic disease risk. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine whether there was a relationship between food security determinants (FSD) (i. e., food availability, access, and utilisation dimensions) and adequate vegetable consumption among children living in regional and remote Western Australia (WA). Caregiver-child dyads (n = 256) living in non-metropolitan/rural WA completed cross-sectional surveys that included questions on FSD, demographics and usual vegetable intake. A total of 187 dyads were included in analyses, which included descriptive and logistic regression analyses via IBM SPSS (version 23). A total of 13. 4 % of children in this sample had adequate vegetable intake. FSD that met inclusion criteria (p ≤ 0. 20) for multivariable regression analyses included price; promotion; quality; location of food outlets; variety of vegetable types; financial resources; and transport to outlets. After adjustment for potential demographic confounders, the FSD that predicted adequate vegetable consumption were, variety of vegetable types consumed (p = 0. 007), promotion (p = 0. 017), location of food outlets (p = 0. 027), and price (p = 0. 043). Food retail outlets should ensure that adequate varieties of vegetable types (i. e., fresh, frozen, <b>tinned)</b> are available, <b>vegetable</b> messages should be promoted through food retail outlets and in community settings, towns should include a range of vegetable purchasing options, increase their reliance on a local food supply and increase transport options to enable affordable vegetable purchasing...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Knowledge of {{the types}} and {{quantities}} of foods and drinks available in family homes supports the development of targeted intervention programmes for obesity prevention or management, or for overall diet improvement. In the UK, contemporary data on foods that are available within family homes are lacking. The present study aimed to explore home food and drink availability in UK homes. Design: An exploratory study using researcher-conducted home food availability inventories, measuring all foods and drinks within the categories of fruits, vegetables, snack foods and beverages. Setting: Bradford, a town {{in the north of}} the UK. Subjects: Opportunistic sample of mixed ethnicity families with infants approximately 18 months old from the Born in Bradford birth cohort. Results: All homes had at least one type of fruit, vegetable and snack available. Fresh fruits commonly available were oranges, bananas, apples, satsumas and grapes. Commonly available fresh vegetables included potatoes, cucumber, tomatoes and carrots. The single greatest non-fresh fruit available in homes was raisins. Non-fresh vegetables contributing the most were frozen mixed <b>vegetables,</b> <b>tinned</b> tomatoes and tinned peas. Ethnic differences were found for the availability of fresh fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages, which were both found in higher amounts in Pakistani homes compared with White homes. Conclusions: These data contribute to international data on availability and provide an insight into food availability within family homes in the UK. They have also supported a needs assessment of the development of a culturally specific obesity prevention intervention in which fruits and vegetables and sugar-sweetened beverages are targeted...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{low-cost}} foods have an equivalent nutrient composition compared to high-cost foods, but such information is lacking in Switzerland. Thus, we compared the caloric and nutrient content of "best price" (BPF) and brand name foods (BNF) in Switzerland using the version 5. 0 (April 2015) of the Swiss Food and Nutrient composition database. Over 4000 processed food items were included and 26 food categories were compared regarding total energy, protein, fat and carbohydrates, saturated fatty acids, sugar, fiber and sodium. BPF, namely core food categories like Bread, Red meat, White meat and Fish products, were 42 %, 39 %, 42 % and 46 % less expensive than their BNF equivalents, respectively. No differences were found between BPF and BNF regarding total energy and protein, fat and carbohydrates for most food categories. In the Cheese category, BPF had a lower caloric content than BNF [Median (interquartile range, IQR) : 307 (249 - 355) vs. 365 (308 - 395) kcal/ 100  g, respectively, p <  0. 001]; BPF also had lower fat and saturated fatty acid content but higher carbohydrate content than BNF (both p <  0. 01). In the Creams and puddings group, BPF had lower fat 1. 3 (0. 9 - 1. 7) vs. 6. 0 (3. 5 - 11. 0) g/ 100  g and saturated fatty acid 0. 6 (0. 6 - 0. 8) vs. 2. 9 (2. 3 - 6. 0) g/ 100  g content than BNF (both p <  0. 005). In the <b>Tinned</b> fruits and <b>vegetables</b> group, BPF had lower sodium content than BNF: 175 (0 - 330) vs. 370 (150 - 600) mg/ 100  g, p =  0. 006. BPF might be a reasonable and eventually healthier alternative of BNF for economically deprived people in Switzerland...|$|R
