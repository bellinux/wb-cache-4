5|$|There are {{specific}} proteins expressed in cardiac muscle cells. These are mostly associated with muscle contraction, and bind with actin, myosin, <b>tropomyosin,</b> and troponin.

5|$|C-terminal truncation: The C-terminal end {{segment is}} the most conserved region of TnI. As an {{allosteric}} structure regulated by Ca2+ in the troponin complex, it binds and stabilizes the position of <b>tropomyosin</b> in low Ca2+ state implicating {{a role in the}} inhibition of actomyosin ATPase. A deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids was found during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Langendorff perfused rat hearts. It was also seen in myocardial stunning in coronary bypass patients. Over-expression of the C-terminal truncated cardiac TnI (cTnI1-192) in transgenic mouse heart resulted in a phenotype of myocardial stunning with systolic and diastolic dysfunctions. Replacement of intact cTnI with cTnT1-192 in myofibrils and cardiomyocytes did not affect maximal tension development but decreased the rates of force redevelopment and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control striated muscle contraction and relaxation. Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, <b>tropomyosin</b> and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power strokes and muscle contraction.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) -mediated induction of actin stress fibers in normal and metastatic epithelial cells. We found that stress fiber formation requires de novo protein synthesis, p 38 Mapk and Smad signaling. We show that TGF-beta via Smad and p 38 Mapk up-regulates expression of actin-binding proteins including high-molecular-weight <b>tropomyosins,</b> alpha-actinin and calponin h 2. We demonstrate that, among these proteins, <b>tropomyosins</b> are both necessary and sufficient for TGF-beta induction of stress fibers. Silencing of <b>tropomyosins</b> with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) blocks stress fiber assembly, whereas ectopic expression of <b>tropomyosins</b> results in stress fibers. Ectopic-expression and siRNA experiments show that Smads mediate induction of <b>tropomyosins</b> and stress fibers. Interestingly, TGF-beta induction of stress fibers was not accompanied {{by changes in}} the levels of cofilin phosphorylation. TGF-beta induction of <b>tropomyosins</b> and stress fibers are significantly inhibited by Ras-ERK signaling in metastatic breast cancer cells. Inhibition of the Ras-ERK pathway restores TGF-beta induction of <b>tropomyosins</b> and stress fibers and thereby reduces cell motility. These results suggest that induction of <b>tropomyosins</b> and stress fibers play {{an essential role in}} TGF-beta control of cell motility, and the loss of this TGF-beta response is a critical step in the acquisition of metastatic phenotype by tumor cells...|$|R

5|$|The calcium {{sensitivity}} of the sarcomere, that is, the calcium concentration at which muscle contraction occurs, is directly determined by the calcium binding affinity of cNTnC. To date, there are no known post-translational modifications of cTnC that impact its calcium binding affinity. However, calcium binding by cNTnC is a dynamic process that can be impacted by the closed-to-open conformational equilibrium of cNTnC, the domain positioning of cNTnC, or the relative availability of cTnI148-159, the physiologic binding partner of cNTnC. The closed-to-open equilibrium of cNTnC can be shifted towards the open state by small compounds (see section below on troponin-binding drugs). Domain positioning of cNTnC can be impacted by phosphorylation of cTnI, of which the most important site in humans is Ser22/Ser23. The availability of cTnI148-159 depends on the blocked-closed-open equilibrium of <b>tropomyosin</b> on actin, which can be impacted by any interactions involving the thin filament, including actin-myosin cross-bridging and length dependent activation (also known as stretch activation or the Frank Starling law of the heart). All of these processes can be impacted by mutations (see section below on disease-causing mutations).|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} the expression of brain-specific <b>tropomyosins</b> during neuronal differentiation. Both TmBr- 1 and TmBr- 3 were shown to be neuron specific. TmBr- 1 and TmBr- 3 mRNA levels increased during the most active phase of neurite outgrowth in the developing rat cerebellum. In PC 12 cells stimulated by nerve growth factor (NGF) to differentiate to the neuronal phenotype, TmBr- 1 and TmBr- 3 levels increased with an increasing degree of morphological differentiation. Induction of TmBr- 1 and TmBr- 3 expression only occurred under conditions where PC 12 cells were permitted to extend neurites. NGF was unable to maintain levels of TmBr- 1 and TmBr- 3 {{with the loss of}} neuronal phenotype by resuspension of differentiated PC 12 cells. The unique cellular expression and regulation in vivo and in vitro of TmBr- 1 and TmBr- 3 strongly suggests a critical role of these <b>tropomyosins</b> in neuronal microfilament function. The findings reveal that the induction and maintenance of the neuronal <b>tropomyosins</b> is dependent on morphological differentiation and the maintenance of the neuronal phenotype...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundCell {{migration}} and morphogenesis {{are driven by}} both protrusive and contractile actin filament structures. The assembly mechanisms of lamellipodial and filopodial actin filament arrays, which provide the force for plasma membrane protrusions through actin filament treadmilling, are relatively well understood. In contrast, the mechanisms by which contractile actomyosin arrays such as stress fibers are generated in cells, and how myosin II is specifically recruited to these structures, are not known. ResultsWe demonstrate that four functionally distinct <b>tropomyosins</b> are required for assembly of stress fibers in cultured osteosarcoma cells. Tm 1, Tm 2 / 3, and Tm 5 NM 1 / 2 stabilize actin filaments at distinct stress fiber regions. In contrast, Tm 4 promotes stress fiber assembly by recruiting myosin II to stress fiber precursors. Elimination of {{any one of the}} <b>tropomyosins</b> fatally compromises stress fiber formation. Importantly, Dia 2 formin is critical to stress fiber assembly by nucleating Tm 4 -decorated actin filaments at the cell cortex. Myosin II is specifically recruited through a Tm 4 -dependent mechanism to the Dia 2 -nucleated filaments, which subsequently assemble endwise with Arp 2 / 3 -nucleated actin filament structures to yield contractile stress fibers. ConclusionsThese experiments identified a pathway, involving Dia 2 - and Arp 2 / 3 -promoted actin filament nucleation and several functionally distinct <b>tropomyosins,</b> that is required for generation of contractile actomyosin arrays in cells...|$|R

25|$|In both cardiac and {{skeletal}} muscles, muscular force {{production is}} controlled primarily {{by changes in}} the intracellular calcium concentration. In general, when calcium rises, the muscles contract and, when calcium falls, the muscles relax. Troponin, along with actin and <b>tropomyosin,</b> is the protein complex to which calcium binds to trigger the production of muscular force.|$|E
25|$|Actin {{participates in}} many {{important}} cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, {{and the establishment}} and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape. Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes. In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins, found in muscle tissues, are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility. It is believed that the diverse range of structures formed by actin enabling it to fulfill such a large range of functions is regulated through the binding of <b>tropomyosin</b> along the filaments.|$|E
40|$|Cell {{migration}} and invasion requires the precise {{temporal and spatial}} orchestration {{of a variety of}} biological processes. Filaments of polymerized actin are critical players in these diverse processes, including the regulation of cell anchorage points (both cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix), the uptake and delivery of molecules via endocytic pathways and the generation of force for both membrane protrusion and retraction. How the actin filaments are specialized for each of these discrete functions is yet to be comprehensively elucidated. The cytoskeletal <b>tropomyosins</b> are a family of actin associating proteins that form head-to-tail polymers which lay in the major groove of polymerized actin filaments. In the present review we summarize the emerging isoform-specific functions of <b>tropomyosins</b> in cell {{migration and}} invasion and discuss their potential roles in the specialization of actin filaments for the diverse cellular processes that together regulate cell migration and invasion...|$|R

Chaf 1, Met e 1, and Hom a 1 had six conserved regions with sequence similarities to known epitopes, whereas Per v 1 and Pen a 1 contained only one.

25|$|There {{are limits}} to electrophoretic techniques. Since passing current through a gel causes heating, gels may melt during electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is {{performed}} in buffer solutions to reduce pH changes due to the electric field, which is important because the charge of DNA and RNA depends on pH, but running for too long can exhaust the buffering capacity of the solution. There are also limitations in determining the molecular weight by SDS-PAGE, {{especially if you are}} trying to find the MW of an unknown protein. There are certain biological variables that are difficult or impossible to minimize and can affect the electrophoretic migration. Such factors include protein structure, post-translational modifications, and amino acid composition. For example, <b>tropomyosin</b> is an acidic protein that migrates abnormally on SDS-PAGE gels. This is because the acidic residues are repelled by the negatively charged SDS, leading to an inaccurate mass-to-charge ratio and migration. Further, different preparations of genetic material may not migrate consistently with each other, for morphological or other reasons.|$|E
500|$|The {{structural}} {{domain of}} cTnC (cCTnC) is anchored to troponin I and T, forming the so-called IT arm, {{made up of}} cTnC93-161, cTnI41-135 and cTnT235-286 (in the cardiac complex). cCTnC binds to helical cTnI41-60 via its large hydrophobic patch, stabilizing the Ca2+-bound open conformation of cCTnC and enhancing its affinity for Ca2+ (from Kd = 40 nM to Kd = 3 nM). cTnT235-286 forms a helical coiled coil with cTnI88-135 that binds to the opposite face of cCTnC. The IT arm is anchored to <b>tropomyosin</b> via adjacent segments of cTnT, so it is believed to move as a unit along with <b>tropomyosin</b> throughout the cardiac cycle. In the low calcium environment present during diastole (~100 nM), <b>tropomyosin</b> is anchored into the [...] "blocked" [...] position along the actin thin filament through the binding of the troponin I inhibitory (cTnI128-147) and C-terminal (cTnI160-209) regions. This prevents actin-myosin cross-bridging and effectively shuts off muscle contraction.|$|E
500|$|As the cytoplasmic Ca2+ {{concentration}} {{rises to}} ~1 μM during systole, Ca2+ binding to the regulatory domain of cardiac troponin C (cNTnC) {{is the key}} event that leads to muscle contraction. Hydrophobic binding of cNTnC to the [...] "switch" [...] region of troponin I, cTnI148-159, stabilizes the Ca2+-bound open conformation of cNTnC (increasing the Ca2+ binding affinity of cNTnC from about Kd = 5 μM to Kd = 0.8 μM). This binding event removes the adjacent cTnI inhibitory regions from actin and stabilizes <b>tropomyosin</b> in its default [...] "closed" [...] position on the thin filament, allowing actin-myosin cross-bridging and muscle contraction to proceed.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{regulatory}} mechanisms, employing many actin-binding proteins, {{have evolved to}} control {{the dynamics of the}} actin filament system.

2500|$|The {{signaling}} {{process to}} contract or relax the sternocleidomastoid begins in Cranial Nerve XI, the accessory nerve. The accessory nerve nucleus {{is in the}} anterior horn of the spinal cord around C1-C3, where lower motor neuron fibers mark its origin. The fibers from the accessory nerve nucleus travel upward to enter the cranium via the foramen magnum. The internal carotid artery to reach both the sternocleidomastoid muscles and the trapezius. After a signal reaches the accessory nerve nucleus in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the signal is conveyed to motor endplates on the muscle fibers located at the clavicle. Acetylcholine (ACH) is released from vesicles and is sent over the synaptic cleft to receptors on the postsynaptic bulb. The ACH causes the resting potential to increase above -55mV, thus initiating an action potential which travels along the muscle fiber. Along the muscle fibers are t-tubule openings which facilitate {{the spread of the}} action potential into the muscle fibers. The t-tubule meets with the sarcoplasmic reticulum at locations throughout the muscle fiber, at these locations the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium ions that results in the movement of troponin and <b>tropomyosin</b> on thin filaments.
