5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
25|$|Maria demanded as Quisling's wife to get {{half the}} value of the bo. The {{directorate}} did not accept this, but accepted that she should get back everything she had brought into it. She obtained many letters of support, including from Odd Nansen, a son of Fridtjof Nansen who had been imprisoned by the authorities during the occupation. In 1950, the Compensation directorate undid the sale of the apartment in Erling Skjalgssons street and she got it back. She continued to provide letters that were meant to document which <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> brought into the bo.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that Douty went {{straight}} from the ferry to her room to drop off the <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> bought which included presents for her younger son's upcoming 19th birthday. Taking the new red towel she had just purchased she headed to secluded Dinghy Bay. Butler had been following her but lost her at this time. Unfortunately, he knew her destination and asked a member of staff for directions. It is estimated that she reached the beach at about 10.40 but when the 11 o'clock plane flew in, {{she was no longer}} on the beach. She was found in scrub behind the beach, her body covered with the red towel which had blood and semen on it. Douty's clothes and personal possessions, including a handbag, were missing and were never found. She had been beaten on the head with a stone.|$|E

500|$|... "A Change in Me" [...] is {{considered}} to be among the musical's original songs that both advance its storyline and provide character development; [...] "A Change in Me" [...] specifically allows Belle to further explore and elaborate on her newfound feelings for the Beast, adding dimension to their relationship. The song also further empowers Belle, expanding upon her dimension as a character. Appearing during the show's second act, the ballad is performed by Belle to indicate that her feelings towards the Beast have softened. Delivered simply, she explains to her father Maurice that she no longer longs for the <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> wished for earlier in Act 1's [...] "Belle (Reprise)", revealing just how much her time spent in the Beast's castle has transformed both her identity and perspective. Belle claims that she has evolved into a better person as a result of having gotten to know and ultimately fallen in love with the Beast, the same individual she once viewed [...] "with abhorrence and dread". Forced to confront feelings she has never felt before, Belle tries to convince Maurice that the Beast is not the monster he thinks he is while explaining how much she has matured. According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, [...] "A Change in Me" [...] "encapsulate the show's sweet emotion." [...] Vladimir Bunoan of ABS-CBNnews.com felt that the ballad [...] "signal a break in [...] relationship".|$|E
2500|$|It {{had always}} been Rudge's {{intention}} {{to set up a}} foundation of some kind to house Pound's archives, but this was a task she always deferred, while continuing to assist scholars of his work and organize several exhibitions devoted to him. In 1986, Rudge together with an American friend, Jane Rylands, and an attorney from Cleveland, Ohio, formed the [...] "Ezra Pound Foundation". She sold most of her archive and her house to the Foundation for a sum of approximately seven thousand dollars. After the establishment of the Foundation, Rudge's family alleged that this had not been her intention, and that the house and archive were worth considerably more. Part of the problem was that, aged 91, Rudge was becoming forgetful of <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> agreed to.|$|E
2500|$|Gamezebo's Erin Bell {{praised the}} game's {{animated}} sequences and highly detailed environments, {{which made the}} game easy on the eye, its character voice-overs, and pleasant soundtrack rounded out the high production values that {{she had come to}} expect from a Dream Chronicles game. But mostly in her review, Bell cited that The Book of Air lacked some of the outstanding factor of previous games in the series as she said that most of the mini-games were variations on <b>things</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> seen dozens of times before. Bell also felt that the story ultimately fell a bit flat as players were simply searching for a bunch of keys. Concluding the review, she said: [...] "The Book of Air is still an enjoyable casual adventure/HOG, but compared to the high standards set by previous games in the series, it comes up a little short. Let's hope that Lyra's next adventure is a more memorable one" [...] and eventually gave it 3.5 stars out of 5.|$|E

2500|$|Nina {{was very}} much {{involved}} in {{the whole process of}} producing the album that she had to give up several television appearances, which included dropping out of her ASAP group and segment entitled the Sessionistas. She explained [...] "Umalis po ako sa ASAP dahil nagprepare po talaga ako sa album. At nasasabay sa mga out of town and out of the country na shows. [...] " [...] She kept a close watch from the album's conceptualization to its songs and arrangement, and even the paper dolls inside the album was her own idea. To be able to do all these <b>things,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to temporarily disappear in the scene for a while. Production for the album took nearly two years to finish, making people wonder if she had gone out of the music industry for good. In choosing a title for the album, Nina personally decided to call it Stay Alivecoming from the album's second track, [...] "Staying Alive"to remind the people that she is still very much around, in spite of the hiatus on TV, and the long break from the recording scene. She further explained the origin of the title: ...|$|E

60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{done it all}} herself, poor <b>thing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> no maid, and it {{was almost}} the only {{accomplishment}} she could boast of. Hence the unstinted pains.|$|R
