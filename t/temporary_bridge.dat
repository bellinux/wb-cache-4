5|$|Two {{years after}} the bridge's opening the Second World War broke out. Because of their close {{proximity}} to Chelsea Barracks {{it was expected that}} enemy bombers would target the three road bridges in the area, and a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> was built parallel to Chelsea Bridge. As with the four other temporary Thames bridges built in this period, it was built of steel girders supported by wooden stakes; however, despite its flimsy appearance it was a sturdy structure, capable of supporting tanks and other heavy military equipment. As it turned out, no enemy action took place in the area, and all three bridges survived the war undamaged. The <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> was dismantled in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{crossing}} {{resulted in the}} closure of the QEW until a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new structure as well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, construction began on the Freeman Diversion, bypassing the old trumpet interchange and creating a new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, , a {{container}} ship, {{was acquired by}} Davie Shipyards to be converted into an auxiliary vessel, to be leased to the RCN as a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> between the Protecteur class until the new AOR class becomes available. However, no contract has yet been signed. On 10 March 2017, ex-Protecteur caught fire while being dismantled in Liverpool, Nova Scotia. Residual fuel caught fire during demolition of the vessel.|$|E
50|$|From June 2013 {{the bridges}} {{have been closed}} to {{vehicular}} traffic. Starting in November 2013, the north bridge superstructure {{will be replaced by}} three <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> - two for traffic, and a third for pedestrians. These will open in early 2014. The <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> will be used until 2016, when construction will begin on a new bridge to replace the two current spans.|$|R
50|$|Initially two <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> {{were built}} in August 2006. While this detour {{alleviated}} {{a significant portion of}} the economic impact to the area, vehicles over 28 feet could not use it. In June 2008, new <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> which could accommodate longer vehicles were constructed. The detour via the bridges is one-way, controlled by traffic lights. At the height of the tourist season, this has sometimes resulted in significant delays.|$|R
50|$|Before a {{permanent}} bridge was {{built over the}} Vistula, crossing were made by ferries and boats. During elections, <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> were also constructed.|$|R
5|$|In Ship Harbour {{citizens}} were isolated for 5 days until a temporary road was made. Also in Spaniard's Bay, the flooding caused {{a bridge to}} depress about 1.5feet (50cm); a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> was built within two months, with a permanent replacement scheduled to be finished {{by the summer of}} 2008. Insured damage across the area totaled $25million (2007CAD, $24.3million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|The Commandos {{were forced}} {{to spend the night}} {{freezing}} in the open in a ditch. The following day, after sappers from the Royal Engineers managed to erect a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> across the canal, a number of Churchill and Sherman tanks from the 8th Hussars managed to get across and No. 1 and No. 6 Troops climbed on top and advanced across the open ground and into the centre of the town.|$|E
5|$|Edward and {{his allies}} amongst the Welsh princes soon began to quarrel, and in early 1282 {{rebellion}} broke out, led by Llwelyn's brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd. Edward responded to the revolt by mobilising a royal army of 8,000 foot soldiers and 750 cavalry, which he marched north to Rhuddlan, while in South and mid-Wales Marcher Lord forces advanced from Carmarthen and Montgomery. Edward then mounted a naval invasion of the Isle of Anglesey and formed a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> to cross over onto the mainland, taking the war into the Welsh heartlands of Snowdonia. Llywelyn was killed that December, and in early 1283 Dafydd was captured and executed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> access a road grade, on {{the north}} side of the river, which is a vestige of the Yosemite Valley Railroad.|$|R
5000|$|The Second World War caused {{damage to}} the line, {{especially}} {{in the area of}} Stralsund. On 1 May the Ziegelgraben Bridge was blown up and, two days later, the Strelasund Bridge was also demolished by retreating Wehrmacht soldiers.ref name="Eisenbahnstrecken Stralsund" [...] /> As a result, the RÃ¼gendamm was closed {{for the next two years}} and did not re-open until 15 October 1947 after the erection of <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges,</b> whereupon international traffic to Sweden could be resumed. The <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> lasted until 1961 before being replaced by the Dessau Steelworks (Stahlbau Dessau).|$|R
5000|$|The use of emplaced logs is now {{sometimes}} used in <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> used for logging roads, where a forest tract {{is to be}} harvested and the road then abandoned. Such log bridges have a severely limited lifetime due to soil contact and subsequent rot and wood-eating insect infestation.|$|R
5|$|The {{landing at}} Juno was delayed because of choppy seas, {{and the men}} arrived ahead of their {{supporting}} armour, suffering many casualties while disembarking. Most of the offshore bombardment had missed the German defences. Several exits from the beach were created, but not without difficulty. At Mike Beach on the western flank, a large crater was filled using an abandoned AVRE tank and several rolls of fascine, which were then covered by a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge.</b> The tank remained in place until 1972, when it was removed and restored {{by members of the}} Royal Engineers. The beach and nearby streets were clogged with traffic for most of the day, making it difficult to move inland.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Wayne {{became the}} second typhoon {{to strike the}} Philippines within nine days. Furthermore, 42people {{lost their lives in}} flood waters while {{attempting}} to cross a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge.</b> A total of 28persons were hurt and 39 were rescued, and there were initially reports of up to 200people missing. Although Wayne passed south of Taiwan, moderate flooding was reported due to rough seas. Elsewhere, in China, Wayne was the fifth most intense typhoon on record to impact Fujian between 1960 and 2005. Throughout China, 440 persons were injured, 105people died, and 30,000dwellings collapsed. Overall, 147people were killed due to Typhoon Wayne.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to work on}} the new bridge, work crews {{constructed}} and opened a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> just {{to the north of the}} new bridge. The <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> allowed for the relocation of utilities, construction of an improved river wall and uninterrupted substructure construction for the new bridge. The center span was constructed on three barges in the Chicago River, because of Coast Guard regulations that required the channel to be open at all times. After the center span was constructed, it was towed to the bridge, where 16 jacks lifted the span into place.|$|E
5000|$|DACC Category 3: Assistance in {{recovery}} from an emergency or disaster {{which is not}} directly related to the saving of life or property. Requests for such assistance are normally made by civilian emergency services through Emergency Management Australia. This includes, for example, providing <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> where permanent bridges have been destroyed by fire or flooding.|$|R
6000|$|... [Midsummer-day breaks, and the {{sun rises}} on the right, {{revealing}} [...] the position clearly. The eminence overlooks for miles the river [...] Niemen, now mirroring the morning rays. Across the river three [...] <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> have been thrown, and towards them the French [...] masses streaming {{out of the forest}} descend in three columns.|$|R
50|$|The US 40 {{bridge over}} the Patapsco River in Ellicott City, {{originally}} constructed in 1936, will be replaced in a project that started {{in the spring of}} 2011 and is expected to be completed in 2013. During the <b>bridge</b> replacement, <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> will be constructed to serve traffic {{for the first time in}} a major bridge project in Maryland.|$|R
25|$|The third {{bridge was}} damaged during World War II in 1940, {{leading to a}} {{permanent}} weight restriction. To alleviate this a fourth <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> was constructed in 1953 on the downstream side of the old bridge; this was relegated to use by cyclists and pedestrians only until finally demolished in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Major {{redesign}} work {{started in}} 2014 {{in connection with}} the LuxTram project. A <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> running in parallel has been built between September 2013 - March 2014 to accommodate traffic and was in use from 14 April 2014 until April 2017, when the renovated and reconstructed Adolphe Bridge reopened, now once again with tram tracks, just like there were when the bridge was first opened in 1903.|$|E
25|$|Whilst many ferry {{services}} were launched {{to try and}} aid commuters stranded by the disaster, others had to endure a 20km round trip to the <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> that was constructed near Risdon Cove. Although it isolated many city workers, the disaster had a positive effect in that it encouraged a boom {{in the establishment of}} local commercial services on the eastern shore in places such as Rosny Park.|$|E
50|$|There were no {{permanent}} bridges over the Volga or Oka before the October Revolution in 1917. <b>Temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> were built during the trade fair. The first {{bridge over the}} Volga was started by the Moscow-Kazan Railway Company in 1914, but only finished in the Soviet Era when the railway to Kotelnich was opened for service in 1927.|$|R
50|$|While in Kyoto, the {{division}} was {{called upon to}} provide emergency relief efforts during massive flooding of the Kamo River 28 June 1935. For the three days, sappers from {{the division}} helped shore up dikes and construct <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges,</b> while over a 1,000 men assisted with traffic control and rescue efforts {{at the request of}} the Kyoto city government.|$|R
5000|$|Komsomolskaya {{was built}} using the {{cut and cover}} method, with {{construction}} beginning on 3 May 1933. <b>Temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> were built over the construction site to avoid disrupting traffic, especially the numerous tram routes in the area. To counteract the high water table, the station was built on 636 piles which were driven into the saturated soil.|$|R
25|$|Construction is {{underway}} by {{the province of}} Alberta to significantly upgrade Glenmore Trail from 101StreetSW to 37StreetSW {{as part of the}} southwest Stoney Trail project, after which Glenmore will be re-designated as Stoney Trail from Sarcee Trail to 101Street. A large cloverstack interchange will be constructed at Sarcee Trail, extending Sarcee south to Highway 22X as Tsuu'tina Trail. Glenmore will be widened to 10 lanes from Sarcee past a pair of new interchanges at Westhills Way and 69Street, eventually narrowing to four lanes before reaching the city limit at 101Street. The current <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> carrying 37Street over Glenmore Trail will be dismantled, and a new diamond interchange will be built eliminating the current roundabouts.|$|E
25|$|In November 1935, {{work began}} on a bridge from Columbia Island to the Virginia mainland. This bridge was financed with $25,000 from Arlington County, $25,000 {{from the state}} of Virginia, and $350,000 from the Public Works Administration. The bridge was the second {{connection}} to the Virginia mainland (after the Boundary Channel Bridge leading to Memorial Drive). But it was designed only to carry the George Washington Memorial Parkway (formerly the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway) across Boundary Channel. The parkway would then continue north to Key Bridge. The CFA gave its approval for the design of this bridge in October 1936. Construction of a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> in this location was approved in April 1937. it was built by the firm of Joseph A. LeVezza & Sons of Baltimore, Maryland, for $24,875.|$|E
25|$|Having {{disposed}} of O'Donnell's relief army, Suchet invested LÃ©rida and demanded the city's surrender but GarcÃ­a Conde refused his summons. The city {{lay on the}} west bank of the Segre River with a tÃªte-de-pont on the east bank. A hill to the north was crowned by the citadel while Fort Garden and two redoubts were located on a hill to the south. The northern wall between the citadel and the Segre was particularly weak. Suchet posted Musnier's men and the majority of his cavalry on the east bank to watch for any relief forces. Habert's troops faced the northern and western walls {{on the west bank}}. A <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> connected the two parts of the besieging corps. The formal siege began on 29 April. Suchet brought up his siege train and on 7 May had a battery of heavy cannons in action.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} <b>temporary</b> {{military}} <b>bridge</b> construction is the two Caesar's Rhine bridges.|$|R
50|$|As an inventor, Wattenburg {{has eight}} patents to his credit, one {{being the first}} home alarm system using {{electrical}} wiring for its communication medium. Many of his ideas, such as using flatbed rail cars as <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges,</b> unenergized electric water heaters for storage of emergency potable water, and converting plow blades into minesweepers are deceptively simple, variants of prior art or folk technology.|$|R
5000|$|After the Battle of the Sangro (19 November-3 December) the River Sangro rose {{rapidly and}} swept {{away all the}} <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges.</b> 8th ATRE began urgent work on 4 December for a {{high-level}} Sangro Bridge on Highway 16, the site being floodlit at night. This was longest Bailey bridge built during the Italian campaign, and was opened to traffic on 14 December.|$|R
25|$|Two {{swimmers}} {{were lost}} and at Ghoraniyeh and the 2/17th Battalion, London Regiment suffered severe casualties {{trying to get}} a line across the river. Later, repeated unsuccessful attempts were made to cross the river in punts and rafts. Many were drowned when Asim's German and Ottoman defenders opened fire on barges made of wood and tarpaulins stretched over framework which became waterlogged after being holed by gunfire. All attempts to put rafts across at Ghoraniyeh were defeated and Brigadier General Watson, commanding the 180th Brigade decided to concentrate all efforts at Makhadet Hijla ordering the 2/20th Battalion and the 2/17th Battalion London Regiments to reinforce the bridgehead there. Steel chains were eventually attached to trees and a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> constructed. Working under Ottoman fire, this first bridge was established by sappers from an Australian and New Zealand engineer unit which had been training for three weeks. By 01:30 a second pontoon bridge at Makhadet Hajlah had been finished by the Anzac Bridging Train.|$|E
25|$|Van Dorn {{ordered a}} retreat first towards Pocahontas, where he {{proposed}} for the Confederate army to attack Corinth again from the south; both Price and Maury talked him out of it. The retreat continued westward, with Lovell's division serving as a rearguard against Rosecrans and Price's divisions in front. On the morning of October 6, Van Dorn learned that another Union force commanded by Stephen Hulbut was approaching from the west; he assigned Maury's division to hold the Davis Bridge over the Hatchie River until the army could reach another crossing six miles to the south. Maury formed a line {{on the west side}} of the creek but the line was overrun with the loss of 300 prisoners. Hulbut then crossed several regiments to the east bank, which suffered 570 casualties, mostly due to sharpshooters and artillery fire. Once a <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> was built across the Hatchie, the Confederate army retreated to Holly Springs.|$|E
25|$|During {{the attack}} his platoon {{was cut off}} and, under fire, was making its {{way back to the}} British lines when it was forced to cross a crude bridge of planks over a swamp on the Sheika River. Four men fell into the swamp. Despite the Bolshevik gunfire, Sullivan {{immediately}} set about retrieving them. The first man that Sullivan followed into the swamp was Lieutenant Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, Lord Settrington, who had been wounded. He was the eldest son of the 8th Duke of Richmond and heir to the dukedoms of Richmond, Lennox and Gordon. He would die of his wounds two weeks later in hospital at Bereznik. The second and third soldiers rescued were similarly pulled out of the swamp by Sullivan after either being hit or avoiding enemy fire. The fourth man was some distance away and Sullivan waded out with a piece of broken handrail from the <b>temporary</b> <b>bridge</b> which the soldier was able to grab and be pulled to safety.|$|E
50|$|Expanded through acquisition, {{parts of}} the group were founded over 150 years ago. The group is still wholly family owned. With an {{administrative}} headquarters in Twyford, Berkshire, the group employs over 1,000 people in 40 locations and has an annualised turnover of Â£100 million. In excess of 90% of the company's production is exported to over 115 countries for use either in permanent or <b>temporary</b> <b>bridging</b> solutions.|$|R
50|$|During the construction, 2.2 {{million cubic}} yards of {{earthwork}} was used, 350,000 {{cubic yards of}} concrete was mixed on site, and 300,000 square feet of retaining walls were built. Additionally, 40,000 feet of drilled shafts and 75,000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed. In addition {{to the construction of}} 43 permanent <b>bridges,</b> six <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges</b> were built, resulting in 2.3 million square feet of bridge deck.|$|R
50|$|The {{attack was}} carried forth from a front from Tolmin (in the upper Isonzo valley) to the Adriatic Sea. The Italians crossed {{the river at}} several points on <b>temporary</b> <b>bridges,</b> but the main effort was exerted on the BanjÅ¡ice Plateau, whose capture was to further the {{offensive}} and break the Austro-Hungarian lines in two segments, isolating the strongholds of Mount Saint Gabriel and Mount Hermada.|$|R
