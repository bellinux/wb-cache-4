5|$|Manuscripts 1eap and 1rK Erasmus {{borrowed}} from Johannes Reuchlin. The {{rest of the}} manuscripts he {{borrowed from}} Dominicans. It is significant {{that he did not}} use the Codex Basilensis, which was held at the Basel University Library, and was available for him. Erasmus had three manuscripts of the Gospels and Acts, four manuscripts of the Pauline epistles, but only one manuscript with the Book of Revelation. In every book of the New Testament he compared three or four manuscripts, except the last book, Book of Revelation. Unfortunately, this manuscript was not complete, it lacked the final leaf, which contained the last six verses of the book. Instead of delaying the publication, on account of the search for another manuscript, he decided to translate the missing verses from the Latin Vulgate into Greek. He used an inferior manuscript of Vulgate with textual variant libro vitae (book of life) instead ligno vitae (tree of life) in Rev 22:19. Even {{in other parts of the}} Book of Revelation and other books of the New Testament Erasmus occasionally introduced self-created Greek text material taken from the Vulgate. F. H. A. Scrivener remarked, that in Rev 17:4 he created a new Greek word: ἀκαθαρτητος (instead τὰ ἀκάθαρτα). There is no such word in Greek language as ακαθαρτητος. In Rev 17:8 he used καιπερ εστιν (and yet is) instead of και παρεσται (and shall come). In Acts 9:6 <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Paul asks at the time of his conversion on the Damascus road, Τρέμων τε καὶ θαμβὣν εἲπεν κύριε τί μέ θέλεις ποιῆσαι ("And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do?") was incorporated from the Vulgate.|$|E

Maurice Metzinger, Jean's brother, made several trips to the United States, in 1906, 1910 and would soon move there permanently in pursuit of his career as a Cellist. In light of the turmoil surrounding his non-acceptance at the Armory show, his brother's experiences in New York, his soon to be exposition at the Cubist Exhibition, Boggs & Buhl's, and the representation of a steamship in the upper right quadrant of L'Oiseau bleu, it would not be out of <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Metzinger made reference to the American flag (as opposed to a red and white stripped canopy of a Parisian café as suggested by Fry).|$|E

25|$|One {{graduate}} student with whom Boring developed a student-professor relationship {{similar to the}} one Boring had had with Titchener was Stanley Smith Stevens. In 1936 the two published their research on tonal brightness. At the time it was known that tonal brightness varied with pitch; and, based on previous research, it was believed that high tones are bright and low tones are dull. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Stevens and Boring researched was concerning the bright and dull tones that could be produced with a siren when the holes were appropriately spaced, hypothesizing that brightness varies with both the intensity and the frequency of the pitch. Boring suggested that they embrace the new technology and conduct the experiment with a cathode-ray oscilloscope and a wave-analyzer. They concluded through this study that tonal brightness is essentially the same as tonal density.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, Annabelle Wilcox {{opined that}} the film {{primarily}} reinforced the gender binary by showing that [...] "Brandon's body is branded by such rhetoric and representation, and {{is assumed to be}} a site of 'truth' that closes <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> being transgender poses for subjectivity, gender, and sexuality." [...] She also went on to note that many film critics either disregarded Brandon's male identity or used female pronouns when referring to him. Rachel Swan, writing for Film Quarterly, wrote that Brandon's masculinity was often contrasted with Lana's femininity as a means of illustrating {{the two sides of the}} gender binary. In addition, she regarded John and Tom's rape of Brandon as an attempt to psychologically castrate him.|$|E

500|$|If Hurcomb {{persisted in}} {{adhering}} to his {{terms of reference}} and approved the power station, but Durham Rural District Council then withheld planning consent {{on the grounds of}} the objections, NESCo would be entitled to compensation for their losses due to the delay and building on a new site. [...] The District Council would be liable for this but it was out of <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> they would be able to afford the large amount involved and the Government wished to avoid stepping in to pay themselves. [...] If the inquiry could be persuaded to find against NESCo then no compensation would be payable and Hurcomb came under pressure from Ministers to do just that. [...] Hurcomb argued that this would be denying compensation to those entitled to it and by April 1945 the decision on the station was still being delayed. The chairman of NESCo at the time voiced his anger in The Times, and Frank Tribe, secretary of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, wrote to Hurcomb asking if anything could be done to bring the inquiry to a decision.|$|E

Shorey's {{review of}} the initial seven reel Broadway release {{declared}} it another masterpiece of Mack's writing and notes that the film {{would be the best}} example to go before the courts to argue for [...] "free speech" [...] in films. Shorey notes that the propaganda film [...] "is bold, clear, tremendous in the force of its convincing showing that to drive the scarlet woman from a restricted district into the hotels and apartment houses of a city is a worse crime than it seeks to cure." [...] The only complaint was found that it [...] "does not sufficiently misrepresent the ease and luxury of the underworld. It shows a scarlet woman who finds the [...] "easiest way" [...] truly easy. She does not die, nor even suffer. The intended moral of the picture, that once abandoned to that life a woman finds it to her taste to remain in it and cannot be [...] "reformed," [...] necessarily does include the above corollary to that proposition." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film [...] "deals with a question that has perplexed the sages from the beginning of time and it traverses life's scroll, writing with thought and deed certain actions of everyday application.

500|$|It is {{possible}} to create an express trust without being aware that one is doing so, {{so long as the}} court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce. In the Constance case, Constance was described as a man of [...] "unsophisticated character" [...] who did not know he was creating a trust– nevertheless, the courts found that was what he had done. [...] In Re Kayford, the company involved took actions to protect its customers by moving their funds into a separate bank account. Even though they had never indicated a desire to create a trust, their intention had been in line with the purpose of a trust, and thus it was considered valid. Many trusts are formed through wills, which create additional issues when determining intention. In Re Hamilton, Lindley LJ set out the standard rule that to [...] "take the will you have to construe and see what it means, and if you {{come to the conclusion that}} no trust was intended you say so"; essentially that judges should not simply assume that there is a trust. This literal approach was followed until the 1950s; since then, the judiciary have been more willing to interpret trust documents in such a way as to make the trusts valid rather than void. According to Byrnes v Kendle, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> needs to be answered in determining whether a certainty of intention exists is [...] "What is the meaning of what the parties have said?"

Shortly after [...] "Girl Gone Wild"s release to YouTube on March 21, 2012, the video was rated by many viewers as inappropriate. This caused YouTube to set an age restriction, only allowing those of age 18 or older to view the video. According to the website, the video was labeled explicit because of the [...] "raunchy" [...] and [...] "orgy" [...] scenes, thereby blocking it from getting uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. YouTube also asked Madonna's representative to upload a more PG-rated version. Madonna later commented, [...] "What's wrong with... what grinding?
