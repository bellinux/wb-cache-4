5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires â€“ since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
5|$|International Baccalaureate (IB) is a rigorous, internationally {{accepted}} {{academic program}} required of all 21st century Baltimore City College students. The IB Middle Years Program {{is intended to}} teach freshman and sophomore students to understand how core subjects are interrelated, how to master critical thinking processes, and to increase intercultural awareness. As juniors and seniors, students engage in the rigorous two-year IB Diploma curriculum <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> comprehensive study of world topics, literature, languages, science, and math. City College's IB certificate and diploma programs provide upperclassmen access to thirty advanced studies courses, which often translate into credit hours at colleges and universities worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Jessica {{was born}} in Falmouth, Massachusetts to Lisa Blair Hathaway and Lloyd Dubroff {{and moved to the}} San Francisco Bay Area in California when she was four. Although billed by the media as a pilot, Dubroff did not possess a medical {{certificate}} or a student pilot certificate, since they require a minimum age of 16, or a pilot certificate <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> minimum age of 17, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. There was also no record-keeping body {{at the time of her}} trip recognizing any feats by underage pilots. Nevertheless, local, national, and international news media picked up and publicized her story, and closely followed her attempt until its tragic ending.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{need for}} a {{computer}} program that is easier to operate and <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> simpler data structure than most currently available models.

25|$|Users {{generally}} do not communicate directly with a DNS resolver. Instead DNS resolution takes place transparently in applications such as web browsers, e-mail clients, and other Internet applications.

25|$|Today, the {{composition}} and yields of such fish catches are virtually negligible.

25|$|The WRIM is used {{primarily}} {{to start a}} high inertia load or a load <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.|$|E
25|$|Implicitly, {{according}} to this estimate, the level of self-financing by water and wastewater utilities is zero. Nevertheless, there clearly will be an upward pressure on tariffs, since 70-80% of water infrastructure and 50-60% of wastewater infrastructure is financed either through debt or private equity <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> remuneration. The remainder is financed through municipal equity, which typically requires no remuneration and thus helps to keep tariffs low.|$|E

25|$|Vault (French voÃ»te, from Italian volta) is an {{architectural}} term for an arched form {{used to provide}} a space with a ceiling or roof. The parts of a vault exert lateral thrust <b>that</b> <b>requires</b> <b>a</b> counter resistance. When vaults are built underground, the ground gives all the resistance required. However, when the vault is built above ground, various replacements are employed to supply the needed resistance. An example is the thicker walls used {{in the case of}} barrel or continuous vaults. Buttresses are used to supply resistance when intersecting vaults are employed.|$|E

Carrying commercial cargo on a boat with a yacht ensign is deemed to be smuggling in many jurisdictions. There is a system of international maritime signal flags for numerals and letters of the alphabet. Each flag or pennant has a specific meaning when flown individually.
