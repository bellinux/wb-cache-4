5|$|Magic in Vagrant Story {{is learned}} {{later in the}} game using Grimoires that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell {{associated}} with the Grimoire will remain in <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> <b>and</b> players only need to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells {{can be used to}} attack, heal, create status effects, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.|$|E
5|$|The current menu {{still has}} {{elements}} {{from the earlier}} days of the restaurant, such as lobster thermidor and grouse. Chef Gueller produces modern French cuisine, with classical elements. Dishes on the restaurant's menu include a terrine of foie gras served with a salad of smoked eel, alongside apple served both as a jelly and as a purée. Foie gras was temporarily taken off the menu in 2008 following threats of protests from animal rights activists. The dish was later restored to <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> <b>and</b> foie gras has also since been served with a duck terrine and pistachios.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the move}} to the Le Méridien Piccadilly Hotel, <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> wine list were {{expanded}} once more. White sought to have a far wider range of wine than at other three Michelin star restaurants; one example given was that while a different restaurant might have four or five bottles of Pétrus, the Oak Room list had more than 70 different vintages. There was a collection of Château d'Yquem listed over five pages going back to 1850. By November 1997, the wine cellar was valued at £1.5 million, with an average weekly taking on wine alone between £25,000 and £30,000. The menu was changed to include more table service, such as meat carvings. The other courses and side dishes were carried from the kitchen on silver platters. The idea that this would provide entertainment for all diners, {{even if they did}} not order a course with table service.|$|E

There are also two teppanyaki grill tables, which serve as either a traditional grill or in combination with <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> dishes from the main kitchen. In addition to chef Nobu Matsuhisa's signature dishes featuring black cod in miso sauce, rock shrimp tempura, and yellowtail sashimi the menu has variations on the dishes which are not available at other Nobu restaurants, as well as an exclusive list of sakes available nowhere else in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Pillsbury's {{management}} {{made several}} attempts at reorganization or {{restructuring of the}} restaurant chain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called Operation Phoenix, Smith initiated a restructuring of corporate business practices {{at all levels of}} the company. Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening of <b>the</b> <b>menu,</b> <b>and</b> new store designs to standardize the look and feel of the company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the financial performance of both Burger King and its parent. Poor operating performance and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game overseas, Square and Sony {{launched}} a widespread three-month advertising campaign in August 1997. Beginning with a television commercial that ran alongside popular {{shows such as}} Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons, the campaign included numerous articles in both gaming and general interest magazines, advertisements in comics from publishers such as DC Comics and Marvel, a special collaboration with Pepsi, media events, sample discs, and merchandise. According to estimations by Takechi, the total worldwide marketing budget came to USD$40 million; $10 million had been spent in Japan, $10 million in Europe, and $20 million in North America. Unlike its predecessors, Final Fantasy VII did not have its numeral adjusted {{to account for the}} lack of a Western release for Final Fantasy II, III and V—while only the fourth Final Fantasy released outside Japan, its Japanese title was retained. It released in North America on September 7, 1997. The game released in Europe on November 17, becoming the first Final Fantasy game to be released in Europe. The Western version included additional elements and alterations, such as streamlining of <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> Materia system, reducing the health of enemies, new visual cues to help with navigation across the worldmap, and additional cutscenes relating to Cloud's past.|$|E

500|$|The {{player can}} locate and collect maps of each area, stylistically similar to tourist maps. Accessible from <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> {{readable}} only when sufficient light is present, each map is marked with places of interest. Visibility is mostly low due to fog and darkness; {{the latter is}} prevalent in the [...] "Otherworld". The player locates a pocket-size flashlight early in the game, but the light beam illuminates only a few feet. Navigating through Silent Hill requires the player to find keys and solve puzzles.|$|E

London's Evening Standard wrote that the book [...] "works both as a practical manual and an engrossing read. ... Nobody else writes so openly about the emotional significance of food." [...] Lawson appeared frequently on American television in 2004, conducting cookery slots on talk shows such as The Ellen DeGeneres Show.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Marketing Communication, Richard J. Varey used the product range {{as an example}} of a company capitalising on a form of product {{placement}} or [...] "stealth advertising", writing that [...] "Viewers don't realize that they are, in effect, watching an advertisement". Betty Driver said of the range's launch: [...] "Betty Turpin's hotpots have become something of an institution at the Rover's and she's very proud of her reputation for good, wholesome food. I think it is a lovely idea that people will be able to buy them in supermarkets now." [...] Driver discussed her astonishment at the general level of interest in her character's hotpots, disclosing: [...] "I was on a cruise on the QE2 a few weeks ago, and everyone was asking me about it. Then one day, they served hot pot on <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> everyone thought it was mine!" ...|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals {{received}} a mixed response, with critics reporting occasional problems with Strikers framerate. While praising the character models and goal animations, GameSpot bemoaned {{the absence of}} a [...] "Mario feel" [...] when appraising <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> settings. IGN noted [...] "blurry textures, uninspired stadium designs, and almost incomprehensibly a sometimes sluggish framerate", despite enjoying the characters art style. The audio {{received a}} mediocre response, with critics praising the use of character and audience chants while criticising a lack of variety and repetitiveness. GameSpot thought the menu music had [...] "some nice flair to it", despite noting sounds such as Luigi's goal celebration that, while charming when first heard, became tedious. [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave the game a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40; Famitsu Cube + Advance, on the other hand, gave it a score of one nine, two eights, and one seven, for a total of 32 out of 40.|$|E
500|$|Players {{have the}} option to develop their character. At the {{beginning}} of the game, players create their character by selecting their sex and choosing between one of several races, including humans, orcs, elves and anthropomorphic cat or lizard-like creatures, and then customizing their character's appearance. Over the course of the game, players improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of their ability in certain areas. There are eighteen skills divided evenly among the three schools of combat, magic, and stealth. When players have trained skills enough to meet the required experience, their character levels up. Each time their character levels, the players may choose to select a skill-specific ability called a perk, or store perk points for later use. Earlier entries in The Elder Scrolls series used a character class system to determine which skills would contribute to the character's leveling, but Skyrim allows players to discover preferred skills as they play the game and rewards them with more experience when a frequently used skill is leveled. A head-up display (HUD) appears when any of the player's three main attributes (health, magicka, and stamina) are being depleted. Attributes regenerate over time, although this process can be accelerated by using potions or regenerative spells. Health is depleted primarily when the player takes damage, and the loss of all health results in death. Magicka is depleted by the use of spells, certain poisons, and by being struck by lightning-based attacks. Stamina determines the player's effectiveness in combat and is depleted by sprinting, performing heavy [...] "power attacks", and being struck by frost-based attacks. The player's inventory can be accessed from <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> items can be viewed in 3D, which may prove essential in solving puzzles found in dungeons.|$|E

On launch, the restaurant offered two fixed-price menus at £25 for three courses or six courses for £40.|$|R
2500|$|The battle system {{received}} mixed reviews. AllGame's J.C. Barnes {{found the}} game's use of elemental attacks awkward; [...] "Rooms can have anywhere {{from three to}} five monsters at a time, each having different elemental attributes. This means that gamers will most likely have to kill a monster that's weak against a specific attribute, open the weapon menu, select another attribute for the other monster, close <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> repeat until all the monsters are defeated. He also found the dungeon crawling aspect somewhat repetitive. GamePro called the fighting [...] "monotonous," [...] arguing that the game [...] "doesn't do the basics right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Battles are {{structured}} around the player selecting actions from the battle menu. Actions include options such as [...] "Attack", [...] "Change Weapon", [...] "Item" [...] and [...] "Skip." [...] Another feature of battling is [...] "Perfect Mode." [...] As the player successfully executes {{attacks on the}} enemy, their momentum meter will fill. When it is completely full, {{any member of the}} party can select [...] "Perfect Mode" [...] from <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>and</b> execute a more powerful attack. Perfect attacks are general to the party, with any character able to execute any attack; they are not specific to each character. At the end of each battle, each member of the party receives experience points, based upon their actions during the battle. For example, if one character killed all the enemies, they will get more points than the others. If a character did not participate in the battle at all, they will get less points than those who did. Gaining experience points leads to the characters leveling up. When a character levels up, they receive attribute points, which they can spend on their various attributes; Strength, Spirit, Constitution, Speed and Dexterity. Weaponry and armor also effect the level of each attribute.|$|E

50|$|Since using <b>the</b> <b>menus,</b> <b>and</b> {{subsequently}} <b>the</b> mouse, is {{not always}} the best solution, it is important to provide users with the possibility to minimize usage of the mouse.
