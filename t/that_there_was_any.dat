5|$|Chadwick did {{not believe}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> {{likelihood}} of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.|$|E
5|$|The {{weather in}} the area had wind up towards , with clouds and heavy rain, and some reports of turbulence. The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed {{that none of them}} perceived <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> problems with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a normal path.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 and 1973 Thorpe's {{political}} fortunes, {{and those}} of the Liberals, revived. Thorpe's personal standing was enhanced when, on 14 March 1973, he married Marion, Countess of Harewood, whose former husband was a first cousin to the Queen. After a series of by-election victories and local government gains, an electoral breakthrough for the party looked plausible when Heath called a general election in February 1974. In that election, with more than six million votes (19.3% of those cast), the Liberals achieved by far their best election result since the Second World War, but under the first-past-the-post voting system this large vote translated into only 14 seats. However, as neither major party won an overall majority, these seats gave Thorpe (whose personal majority in North Devon increased to 11,072) significant leverage. He was briefly in coalition discussions with Heath, who was prepared to give cabinet posts to Thorpe and other senior Liberals. Thorpe later denied <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> serious prospect of agreement, and in March 1974 Harold Wilson formed a minority Labour government. In the second 1974 general election, in October, Wilson achieved a narrow majority; the Liberals lost ground, with 5.3 million votes and 13 MPs.|$|E

25|$|Jane's {{relationship}} with the Queen was close, but it became strained {{for a short period}} when rumours circulated that Jane was to remarry.

25|$|Peter Taylor, in his 2000 {{description}} of the genus, suggested that the morphology Philcoxia resembles that of the carnivorous Lentibulariaceae and the relatively unrelated Droseraceae in some aspects. The upper surface of the leaves are covered in stalked capitate glands similar to those seen in other carnivorous plants. Taylor noted that field observations had not indicated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> carnivorous function of the leaves, citing a lack of captured prey as evidence.|$|E
25|$|During the 1981 provincial election, {{allegations}} surfaced {{that the}} Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives had {{entered into a}} tacit agreement in 1980, under which the PCs ran an intentionally weak campaign in Nickel Belt to help Erola defeat Rodriguez, purportedly {{in exchange for the}} Liberals similarly throwing the Sudbury riding in 1981 to help Jim Gordon defeat incumbent NDP MPP Bud Germa; the allegations surfaced after the Liberals mounted a stronger campaign for the provincial seat than the PCs were expecting, and Liberal organizers denied <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> mutual agreement.|$|E

25|$|Brandeis was {{becoming}} increasingly conscious of and hostile to powerful corporations and {{the trend toward}} bigness in American industry and finance. He argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added {{a new dimension to}} the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. As early as 1895 he had pointed out the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans. Although the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was enacted in 1890, {{it was not until the}} 20th century <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> major effort to apply it.|$|E
25|$|In {{what some}} have speculated {{was an attempt}} at damage control {{just days after the}} interview, Barbour {{suspended}} the prison sentences of Jamie and Gladys Scott, two African American women who received life sentences resulting from a 1993 mugging in which the two women stole $11. Barbour has denied <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> connection between the suspension of the Scott sisters' prison sentence and the controversy surrounding his Weekly Standard interview. Jamie Scott suffered from kidney failure while in prison, and requires a donated organ, which her sister Gladys had volunteered to provide. Barbour's decision to release the Scott sisters, however, is contingent upon the promised organ donation by Gladys Scott, which critics argued amounted to coercion and raises questions of medical ethics.|$|E
25|$|On 13 July 2016, {{national}} broadcaster NHK {{reported that}} the Emperor intended to abdicate in favor of his eldest son Crown Prince Naruhito within a few years, citing his age; an abdication within the Imperial Family has not occurred since Emperor Kōkaku abdicated in 1817. However, senior officials within the Imperial Household Agency denied <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> official plan for the monarch to abdicate. A potential abdication by the Emperor would require {{an amendment to the}} Imperial Household Law, which currently has no provisions for such a move. On 8 August 2016, the Emperor gave a rare televised address, where he emphasized his advanced age and declining health; this address is interpreted as an implication of his intention to abdicate.|$|E
25|$|I {{have come}} to the clear {{conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no basis upon which <b>there</b> should <b>be</b> a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> occasion for any further investigation.|$|R

25|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that the reason why so many Christian runestones were raised in Uppland is that the district was the focal point in the conflict between Norse paganism and the newly Christianized King of Sweden. It is possible that the chieftains tried to demonstrate their allegiance to the king and to display their Christian faith to the world and to God by adding Christian crosses and prayers on their runestones. What speaks against this theory is the fact that Norway, Denmark, and Götaland did not have any corresponding development in the runestone tradition. Moreover, not a single runestone declares <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> relationship towards the king. Additionally, the runestones appear to show that the conversion was a rather peaceful process.|$|E
25|$|On December 19, Gazprom {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} no supply contract could be signed for 2009 because Ukraine said it would not make any more payments in 2008. This was denied by a Naftogaz spokesman. On the same day, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko's spokesman on international energy security stated that Ukraine had paid for its October and September supplies, and that although it still had to pay for November's supply before the end of 2008, no other payments would be due until the end of January. On December 23, President Yushchenko said that part of the debt was restructured for January – February 2009, but Gazprom denied <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>any</b> such agreement and said that it remained committed to cut supplies to Ukraine on January 1 if Ukraine did not pay its remaining $1.67billion debt for gas supplies and an additional $450million in fines.|$|E
