40|$|The {{tribological}} {{properties of}} the mechanical seal lubricated with the refrigerating machine oil with oiliness and anti-wear additives were studied by using a <b>thrust-washer</b> test rig. Frictiontests were carried out under bath lubrication for the basc oil，oil A (basc oil+ oleic acid and tricresyl phosphate at 5 mmol/kg) and oil B (base oil +oleic acid and tricresyl phosphate at 10 mmol/kg， 5 mmol/kg, respectively). From the tests，the following results were obtained. (1) The coefficient of friction μ decreased in following order at sliding velocity 3. 93 m/s :base oil> oil A> oil B. The value ofμ with oil B was 0. 08 ～ 0. 10 ，and was about 1 / 2 times as small as that with base oil. (2) The amount of friction loss decreased in following order: base oil >oilA >oil B. Therefore，the additives of oleic acid and tricresyl phosphate showed significant improvements in tribological {{properties of the}} reftigerating machine oil...|$|E
