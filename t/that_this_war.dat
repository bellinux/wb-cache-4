25|$|As a Marxist–Leninist, Stalin {{expected}} {{an inevitable}} Second World War between competing capitalist powers; as Nazi Germany annexed Austria and then part of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Stalin recognised <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> was looming. He sought to maintain Soviet neutrality in the conflict, hoping that a German war against France and the UK {{would leave the}} Soviets a dominant force in Europe. Militarily, the Soviets also faced a threat from the east, with Soviet troops clashing with the expansionist Japanese at Nomonhan, Mongolia in May 1939. Stalin initiated a military build-up, with the Red Army more than doubling between January 1939 and June 1941, although in its haste to expand many of its officers were poorly trained.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{called his}} U.S.-based {{advisers}} to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, {{as it would}} damage public morale. He also noted {{that because of the}} political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was {{despite the fact that the}} Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that [...] "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was [...] "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [...] political crisis". Johnson said to Taylor that [...] "Every time I get a military recommendation it seems to me that it calls for large-scale bombing. I have never felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> will be won from the air." [...] At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy.|$|E

2500|$|Kennedy {{also argued}} {{strongly}} against providing {{military and economic}} aid to the United Kingdom. [...] "Democracy is finished in England. It may be here," [...] he stated in the Boston Sunday Globe of November 10, 1940. With German troops having overrun Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France, and with daily bombings on Great Britain, Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated his belief <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> was not about saving democracy from National Socialism (Nazism) or from Fascism.

[...] came back marked [...] "disparu". Gleizes painted two works entitled To Jacques Nayral (A Jacques Nayral) in 1914 and 1917 as an homage to the writer. These are private portraits that signify an intensely personal memorial to his closest friend and key figure who shared the hopes of the pre-war Passy group for an innovative collective artistic program.|$|E

I'm convinced and sure <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> was planned and that the capture of these hostages was just their excuse to start their pre-planned war, but if I had known on July 11 ... that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it?

2500|$|However, some Jewish sources defend Moses' role. The Chasam Sofer {{emphasizes}} <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> was not fought at Moses' behest, but was {{commanded by}} God {{as an act}} of revenge against the Midianite women, who, according to the Biblical account, had seduced the Israelites and led them to sin. Rabbi Joel Grossman argued that the story is a [...] "powerful fable of lust and betrayal", and that Moses' execution of the women was a symbolic condemnation of those who seek to turn sex and desire to evil purposes. Alan Levin, an educational specialist with the Reform movement, has similarly suggested that the story should be taken as a cautionary tale, to [...] "warn successive generations of Jews to watch their own idolatrous behavior".|$|E
2500|$|German {{politician}} Sahra Wagenknecht, {{the deputy}} {{leader of the}} party Die Linke in the German Parliament, has compared the US drone attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan or Yemen with the terrorist attacks in Paris. ″If a drone controlled by the West extinguishes an innocent Arab or Afghan family, {{which is just a}} despicable crime as the attacks in Paris, and it should fill us with the same sadness and the same horror". We should not operate a double standard. Through the drone attacks had been [...] "murdered thousands of innocent people", in the concerned countries, this created helplessness, rage and hatred: [...] "Thereby we prepare the ground for the terror, we officially want to fight." [...] The politician stressed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> is also waged from German ground. Regarding the Afghanistan war with German participation for years, she said: [...] "Even the Bundeswehr is {{responsible for the deaths of}} innocent people in Afghanistan." [...] As the most important consequence of the terrorist attacks in Paris, Wagenknecht demanded the end of all military operations of the West in the Middle East.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, [...] {{wrote an}} article for International Centre for Defense Studies, where he noted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> {{was the first time}} {{after the fall of the}} Soviet Union that modern Russia used {{military}} force against another sovereign country. The war in Georgia in August sent a clear signal to the world: when necessary, Russia will engage in full-scale conventional warfare against other countries in order to pursue its political interests. The military operation was only one of the phases in a longer-term anti-Georgian campaign. The staffs concerned must have planned the war for months – they had to develop an overall operations plan, to move in the stocks necessary for the battle, to allocate the aviation resources for the deployment of troops to Georgia and other logistic capabilities, to produce a target list for the air force, and so on. The scope and intensity of Russian attack exceeded the forecasts made by the Georgian leadership and the Western countries. The Russians achieved a strategic advantage by using the element of surprise. He pointed out that most of the units deployed against Georgia were from the North Caucasus Military District, whose military capabilities are the greatest in Russia.|$|E

50|$|Although {{this was}} {{technically}} an Anglo-Dutch war (as it was fought between Britain and the Netherlands), many respectable historians, such as Steven Pincus, argue <b>that</b> <b>this</b> later <b>war</b> stemmed from completely different causes and therefore {{should not be}} included in a discussion of these earlier wars.|$|R

2500|$|The Boers and the British both {{feared the}} {{consequences}} of arming Africans. The memories of the Zulu and other tribal conflicts were still fresh, and they recognised that whoever won would {{have to deal with}} {{the consequences of}} a mass militarisation of the tribes. There was therefore an unwritten agreement <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> would be a [...] "white man's war." [...] At the outset, British officials instructed all white magistrates in the Natal Colony to appeal to Zulu amakhosi (chiefs) to remain neutral, and President Kruger sent emissaries asking them to stay out of it. However, in some cases there were old scores to be settled, and some Africans, such as the Swazis, were eager to enter the war with the specific aim of reclaiming land confiscated by the Boers. As the war went on there was greater involvement of Africans, and in particular large numbers became embroiled in the conflict on the British side, either voluntarily or involuntarily. By the end of the war, many blacks had been armed and had shown conspicuous gallantry in roles such as scouts, messengers, watchmen in blockhouses, and auxiliaries.|$|E
