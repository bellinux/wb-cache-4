5|$|Although {{the western}} slope that the Cog Railway ascends is {{straightforward}} from base to summit, the mountain's other sides are more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater {{surrounded by the}} Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach well into the <b>treeless</b> alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern wall and the incline is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.|$|E
5|$|River {{channels}} {{in the region}} support River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and River Cooba (Acacia stenophylla) communities. Nearby higher areas contain Black Box (Eucalyptus largiflorens) woodlands and a salt-tolerant grass, saltbush and daisy understorey. Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora) and Grey Box (Eucalyptus microcarpa) occur along with Cypress Pine (Callitris glaucophylla) on areas rarely subjected to flooding. The area away from the rivers often consists of <b>treeless</b> plains, consisting of various saltbush (Atriplex) species, Cotton Bush (Maireana aphylla) and varieties of Danthonia and Austrostipa native grasslands.|$|E
5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely <b>treeless</b> habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|The Benjaminville Friends Meeting House {{is located}} on a {{relatively}} elevated area of land east of Bloomington, Illinois, near the community of Holder. The land was originally flat, <b>treeless</b> prairie but today is designated mostly for agricultural use. The unincorporated community of Bentown is located nearby as well. To the east a large wind farm is being constructed within Arrowsmith Township. The building is the last extant structure in the now-defunct village of Benjaminville, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} coal city of Lens, France {{had fallen}} under German control in October 1914 during the Race to the Sea. Consequently, the Germans also controlled the heights at Hill 70 {{to the north}} of the city and Sallaumines Hill to the southeast, both of which had commanding views over the surrounding area as well as the city itself. Hill 70 was a <b>treeless</b> expanse at the end of one of the many spurs. In September 1915, the British had overrun the hill during the Battle of Loos but had not managed to hold it.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands are}} frequented by marine mammals, {{such as the}} {{southern}} elephant seal and the South American fur seal, and various types of cetaceans; offshore islands house the rare striated caracara. The Falklands are also home to five different penguin species {{and a few of}} the largest albatross colonies on the planet. Endemic fish around the islands are primarily from the genus Galaxias. The Falklands are <b>treeless</b> and have a wind-resistant vegetation predominantly composed of a variety of dwarf shrubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} breeds {{in much of}} Europe and {{temperate}} Asia, although it is absent from the <b>treeless</b> far north, and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast Europe, Turkey and the Middle East. In these warmer southern areas, {{it tends to be}} found in the milder uplands and coastal regions. Nominate T. v. viscivorus breeds in Europe and in Asia east to the Ob, beyond which it is replaced by T. v. bonapartei. The southern form T. v. deichleri is resident in North Africa, Corsica and Sardinia.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{are part}} of the family Picidae, a group of near-passerine birds that also consist of piculets, wrynecks, and sapsuckers. Members of this family are found worldwide, except for Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, Madagascar, and the extreme polar regions. Most species live in forests or {{woodland}} habitats, although a few species are known that live in <b>treeless</b> areas, such as rocky hillsides and deserts, and the Gila woodpecker specialises in exploiting cacti.|$|E
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the <b>treeless</b> alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|Grey jays are {{classified}} as least concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List, having stable populations over a very large area of boreal and subalpine habitats only lightly occupied by humans. Significant human impacts may nevertheless occur through anthropogenic climate warming. Grey jays at the northern edges of their range may benefit from the extension of spruce stands out onto formerly <b>treeless</b> tundra. A study of a declining population {{at the southern end}} of the grey jay's range linked the decline in reproductive success to warmer temperatures in preceding autumns. Such warm temperatures may trigger spoilage of the perishable food items stored by grey jays upon which success of late winter nesting partly depends.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the <b>treeless</b> Sahel further north.|$|E
5|$|Modern Scotland is {{half the}} size England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly {{the same amount of}} {{coastline}} at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall: today about 700cm per year in the east and over 1,000cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands <b>treeless.</b> The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and {{may have contributed to the}} fragmented nature of political power.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse is {{the common}} name for Pteroclididae, a family of sixteen species of bird, members of the order Pteroclidiformes. They are {{traditionally}} placed in two genera. The two central Asian species are classified as Syrrhaptes and the other fourteen species, from Africa and Asia, are placed in the genus Pterocles. They are ground dwelling birds restricted to <b>treeless,</b> open country, such as plains, savannahs and semi-deserts. They are distributed across northern, southern and eastern Africa, Madagascar, the Middle East and India through to central Asia. The ranges of the black-bellied sandgrouse and the pin-tailed sandgrouse extend into the Iberian Peninsula and France, and Pallas's sandgrouse occasionally breaks out in large numbers from its normal range in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{is roughly}} {{half the size of}} England and Wales and has {{approximately}} the same amount of coastline, but only between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land, under 60 metres above sea level, and most of this is located in the south and east. This made marginal pastoral farming and fishing the key factors in the pre-modern economy. Its north Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, which encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the western islands <b>treeless.</b> The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's good arable and {{pastoral}} land is found {{mostly in the}} south and east of the country. Heavy rainfall, wind and salt spray, in combination with thin soil and overgrazing, made most of the western islands <b>treeless.</b> The terrain often made internal land communication difficult, encouraging a coastal network. In the Neolithic period, from around 6,000 years ago, there is evidence of permanent settlements and farming. The two main sources of food were grain and cow milk. From the Bronze Age, arable land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, there were hill forts in southern Scotland associated with cultivation ridges and terraces and the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture. During the period of Roman occupation of Britain there was re-growth of trees indicating a reduction in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The {{park was}} {{established}} in 1966 and {{is considered one of}} the most important protected areas for the maintenance of mountainous biodiversity and ecosystem integrity at the national level. Forests of European black pine (Pinus nigra) and common beech (Fagus sylvatica) cover the park's lower and middle altitudes , with several of these trees being more than 700 years old. At higher altitudes , Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) woodland is dominant, while at the greatest heights , only certain types of bushes are found in the <b>treeless</b> alpine meadows. Additionally, the dry places and the lower parts of the valley are characterized by the domination of Buxus sempervirens, while some individuals of Abies borisii-regis are scattered among the Pinus nigra and Fagus sylvatica forests.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{it grows}} in {{deciduous}} woodland during autumn, especially among oak, birch and beech, {{but is also}} found on occasion with conifers. It is also occasionally known from <b>treeless</b> heathland, where it is associated with bracken. The species favours acidic soil. Cortinarius violaceus forms mycorrhizal associations with several species of tree. In this symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with beneficial minerals. In Nordic countries, its hosts include white birch (Betula pubescens), silver birch (B. pendula), European aspen (Populus tremula) and rarely European beech (Fagus sylvatica). No records of association with oak (Quercus) are known from this region. Brandrud reported that {{what he described as}} spp. hercynicus grew with Picea abies, generally in more alkaline soils and along with mosses of the genera Hylocomium and Pleurozium, and, in moister areas, big shaggy-moss (Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus), as well as the buttercup-family shrub Hepatica nobilis. The species grows with Betula pubescens in Greenland, and is also associated with hazelnut (Corylus avellana) in Central and Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Smilodon lived {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya–10,000 years ago), and {{was perhaps the}} most recent of the saber-toothed cats. Smilodon {{probably}} lived in a closed habitat such as forest or bush. Fossils of the genus have been found throughout the Americas. In North America, the varied habitat supported other saber-toothed cats in addition to Smilodon, such as Homotherium and Xenosmilus; the habitat here varied from subtropical forests and savannah in the south, to <b>treeless</b> mammoth steppes in the north. Smilodon inhabited the temperate latitudes of North America, where the mosaic vegetation of woods, shrubs, and grasses in the southwest supported large herbivores such as horses, bison, antelope, deer, camels, mammoths, mastodons, and ground sloths. Other large carnivores included dire wolves, short-faced bear (Arctodus simus) and the American lion. Due to competition from larger carnivores in North America, S.fatalis was perhaps not able to attain the same size as S.populator. The similar sizes of S.fatalis and the American lion suggests niche overlap and direct competition between these species, and they appear to have fed on similarly sized prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} breeding {{habitat in}} Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch {{of four or}} five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and <b>treeless</b> Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren is well {{adapted to}} dry environments, and M.l. leuconotus is found {{throughout}} arid and semi-arid environments between latitudes 19 and 32oS in mainland Australia. It occupies coastal Western Australia from around Port Hedland south to Perth, and stretches eastwards over to Mount Isa in Queensland, {{and along the}} western parts of the Great Dividing Range through central Queensland and central western New South Wales, into the northwestern corner of Victoria and the Eyre Peninsula and across the Nullarbor. It commonly cohabits with other species of fairywren, including the purple-backed fairy-wren (M. lamberti assimilis). White-winged fairywrens often inhabit heathlands or <b>treeless</b> shrublands dominated by saltbush (Atriplex) and small shrubs of the genus Maireana, or grasses such as tussock grass (Triodia) and cane-grass (Zygochloa), as well as floodplain areas vegetated with lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta). M.l.leucopterus inhabits similar habitats on Dirk Hartog Island and M.l.edouardi does the same on Barrow Island. The white-winged fairywren is replaced {{to the north of}} its range on mainland Australia by the red-backed fairywren.|$|E

Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, today about 700cm per year in the east and more than 1,000cm in the west.

The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. This was reversed in the period c. 1150 to 1300, with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and making land more productive. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand Teton National Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this <b>treeless</b> region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line {{to the base of}} the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E
5|$|There were {{no further}} engagements that day, so Beresford {{was able to}} {{complete}} his dispositions. The front of the Allied position was defined {{by a series of}} small watercourses flowing from south to north. Two of these, the Nogales (sometimes called the Feria) and Chicapierna brooks, meet just south of the village to form the Albuera river, but none of these were formidable obstacles and the river itself could be crossed at two bridges and a ford. Alten's men were placed in Albuera itself, while Hamilton's division along with most of the Portuguese cavalry formed the Allied left wing {{to the north of the}} village and Major General William Stewart's 2nd Division formed up on a hill just to the west of Albuera. The right wing of the Allied army was to be supplied by Castaños's and Blake's four Spanish infantry divisions, while the Allied cavalry and artillery along with the 4th Division would provide a strong strategic reserve. To the west of the Chicapierna and the Albuera, the land rises to a low, <b>treeless</b> north-south ridge crowned by several knolls that become progressively higher to the south. After the battle, Beresford was severely criticized for failing to occupy two of these high points, the first of which lies approximately one mile southwest of the village and the second some 500 yards further south.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the island}} is <b>treeless,</b> but there are {{substantial}} stands in some places, especially near the island's small reservoir.|$|E
25|$|In these <b>treeless</b> flatlands this stone, {{given its}} size, {{would have been}} a {{distinctive}} landmark on the flat Solway Plain for several millennia.|$|E
25|$|The {{terrain is}} entirely <b>treeless,</b> {{although}} quite lush owing to frequent precipitation. Cape Horn is the southern {{limit of the}} range of the Magellanic penguin.|$|E
25|$|Baker has {{no natural}} fresh water sources. It is <b>treeless,</b> with sparse {{vegetation}} consisting of four kinds of grass, prostrate vines and low-growing shrubs. The island {{is primarily a}} nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat for seabirds, shorebirds, and marine wildlife.|$|E
25|$|Flexible trees {{may be a}} {{compromise}} between the two camps, but manufacturing quality and design varies greatly. While flexible, adjustable trees are an alternate choice to traditional wooden trees, they carry limitations inherent in both solid tree and <b>treeless</b> designs.|$|E
25|$|The {{preferred}} habit is open countryside with {{scattered trees}} and magpies are normally absent from <b>treeless</b> areas and dense forests. They sometimes breed at high densities in suburban settings such as parks and gardens. They {{can often be}} found close to the centre of cities.|$|E
25|$|Schematically, Oz is {{much like}} the United States, with the Emerald City taking the place of Chicago: to the East, mixed forest and farmland; to the West, <b>treeless</b> plains and fields of wheat; to the South, warmth and lush growth, and red earth.|$|E
25|$|In {{seasonally}} snow-covered zones, winter albedos of <b>treeless</b> {{areas are}} 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow {{does not cover}} the trees as readily. Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the island}} was largely <b>treeless</b> {{by the time the}} Europeans first visited, the {{movement}} of the statues was a mystery for a long time; pollen analysis has now established that {{the island was}} almost totally forested until 1200 A.D. The tree pollen disappeared from the record by 1650.|$|E
25|$|One way {{in which}} the eucalyptus, mainly the blue gum E. globulus, proved {{valuable}} in California was in providing windbreaks for highways, orange groves, and other farms in the mostly <b>treeless</b> central part of the state. They are also admired as shade and ornamental trees in many cities and gardens.|$|E
25|$|The city is {{situated}} on a broad, flat, <b>treeless</b> and largely waterless plain, {{except for a}} large underground aquifer – {{at the time of}} its founding, a matter of national scandal and notoriety as to corrupt dealings at the time, since it is immediately adjacent to amply watered and treed rolling parklands.|$|E
25|$|Kerguelen Island (49°S), South Georgia (54°S), {{and other}} subantarctic islands are all so heavily wind exposed {{and with a}} too cold summer climate (tundra) that none have any {{indigenous}} tree species. The Falkland Islands (51°S) summer temperature is near the limit, but the islands are also <b>treeless</b> although some planted trees exist.|$|E
25|$|Trees. Along the <b>treeless</b> {{coast and}} islands of Alaska, {{driftwood}} {{has always been}} the main source of wood for people. Driftwood mainly transported by rivers and delivered by the sea is a natural and renewable resource. In the Yup’ik area, driftwood species commonly used includes white spruce, willow and cottonwood are mostly used, but occasionally logs of red cedar, Alaska yellow cedar, and hemlock are found.|$|E
