5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the dollar bill. Since 1861, the reverse side of the dollar bill has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> {{the front of the}} banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E

25|$|The {{well-known}} Baroque painter Martino Altomonte, who {{was over}} eighty during this commission, created the altar-pieces within six years. According to a Cistercian custom, the high altar-piece {{is dedicated to}} the Assumption of Mary. The two anterior altar-pieces, placed nearest to the high altar, refer to Mary’s work in the Benedictine (left) and Cistercian (right) Orders. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> the two middle altars show the death of Saint Joseph (left) and the guardian angel (right). Both altar-pieces at the back are dedicated to the Fourteen Holy Helpers (die Vierzehn Nothelfer): the holy virgins to the left and the intercessors for agriculture to the right. The paintings represent Late Baroque Italian Classicism.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the rest}} of the office get into a heated debate over whether actress Hilary Swank can be {{considered}} [...] "hot".

Jim temporarily convinces Kevin to switch sides by having him imagine Hilary kissing him, only for Kevin to switch back, saying the debate is whether she is hot, not whether he would have sex with her. Angela (Angela Kinsey) resists the debate, but eventually votes [...] "hot" [...] after getting offended by Kevin's crude remarks. Kelly (Mindy Kaling), who believes herself less attractive than Swank, gets emotional when Toby (Paul Lieberstein) defends his [...] "not hot" [...] vote. Pam (Jenna Fischer) argues they should not let the Kevins of the world decide who is hot, or decide anything at all. Oscar (Oscar Nuñez) gives a detailed overhead presentation about the structure of Swank's facial features, concluding she is [...] "attractive...not hot." [...] An uncharacteristically uplifting Stanley (Leslie David Baker) votes hot, claiming pointing out flaws is no way to live life. At the end of the debate, the sides are still tied until Michael, oblivious of their debate, passes by <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> the wall and casually calls her hot.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} named after the {{nickname}} Dumont's seventh grade teacher had for Disneyland, which is in Anaheim, California, where the band members grew up.

Gwen is featured in the foreground {{while the rest of}} the band members are standing in an orange grove in the background. Gwen pushed for Eric to be included on the album cover—a source of tension for the band—reasoning that although he had left the band, he had still contributed substantially to the album. Eric is seen near the back of the picture, looking away from the camera. <b>The</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> the cover and in the liner notes were taken on city streets in their native Orange County (namely Anaheim and City of Orange) and in orange groves.

500|$|Crisis Core uses a slot machine-like {{mechanic}} {{to affect}} the combat system. The [...] "Digital Mind Wave" [...] (DMW) features two sets of three spinning wheels; one set with the numbers one through seven, and another with pictures of characters that Zack befriends during the game. The DMW automatically spins as long as Zack has at least 10 [...] "Soldier Points", which are awarded to the player by defeating foes. If the DMW stops with the same three pictures lined up, Zack will then perform an appropriate Limit Break attack that can greatly harm an enemy or significantly heal Zack. Additionally, in this case, if the number slots give {{two or more of}} the same number, the materia in that slot will power up. Should the numbers line up as [...] "777", Zack will gain an experience level, increasing his health, soldier points, and ability points. If there is no match in the pictures, matching numbers on the slots will grant temporary bonuses, such as limited invincibility or zero-cost use of skills and abilities. The chance of matching pictures is tied to the current Limit level, which is raised by taking damage in battle and reduced upon successful battles, and after certain storyline events. After collecting certain items in the game, <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> the DMW may also randomly change to summonable creatures, which have more destructive and beneficial Limit Breaks should the pictures match up.|$|E

2500|$|Krämer instead {{proposed}} as the [...] "most obvious source" [...] of Degas's composition a lithograph by Paul Gavarni: sheet number five from the Lorettes series, published in 1841 in Le Charivari. Gavarni {{was an artist}} greatly admired by Degas, who amassed a collection of some 2,000 of Gavarni's lithographs. Points of similarity between the print and Interior are described by Krämer: As in Degas's Le Viol, [...] has her back turned towards the man who {{stands in front of}} the door, his legs spread wide and his hands in his pockets. From above, as if contemplating his prize, his gaze is fixed on the woman who, significantly, is seated on an animal-skin rug. Not only is the man's posture reminiscent of Degas's painting, but the woman is also in a comparable pose, her right hand raised to her head, her garment sliding off her shoulder. Even <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> the wall and the discarded clothes on the sofa could have inspired Degas.|$|E

The interior of Scully's home was a set in Burnaby, outside of Vancouver. The set was an old roller rink or at least sounded like one, as it was very noisy. During filming, Carter placed a carrot juice bottle on the table of the set, having just finished the drink, as {{he thought it would}} be [...] "a nice sort of Mulder touch." [...] Some of the artwork in Mulder's office came from a friend of Carter's who had a gallery in Vancouver and was named Monica Reyes, a name that had previously been used in her honor for a character who features in a recurring role in the series' eighth season and appears as a main character in every episode of the series' ninth season. One of <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> the wall of Mulder's office was by Douglas Coupland, who was featured in the real Monica Reyes' gallery and had written a book Carter liked which was called Hey Nostradamus!, so Carter stuck a Post-It on which he wrote the book's title onto the picture.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{a report}} by the {{magazine}} Foreign Policy, children as young as six are recruited or kidnapped and sent to military and religious training camps, where they practice beheading with dolls and are indoctrinated with the religious views of ISIL. Children are used as human shields on front lines and to provide blood transfusions for Islamic State soldiers, according to Shelly Whitman of the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative. The second instalment of a Vice News documentary about ISIL focused on how the group is specifically grooming children for the future. A spokesman told VICE News that those under the age of 15 go to sharia camp to learn about religion, while those older than 16 can go to military training camp. Children are also used for propaganda. According to a UN report, [...] "In mid-August, ISIL entered a cancer hospital in Mosul, forced at least two sick children to hold the ISIL flag and posted <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>on</b> the internet." [...] Misty Buswell, a Save the Children representative working with refugees in Jordan, said, [...] "It's not an exaggeration to say we could lose a whole generation of children to trauma." [...] A UN report indicated that at least 89 children, mostly from the ages of 12 to 16 had been killed fighting for the Islamic State in 2015, 39% of which died in suicide bombing attacks. Der Spiegel estimated in 2016 that 1,500 boys were serving as child soldiers for ISIL. It was reported that on 12 March 2017, ISIS used 6 child suicide bombers against the Syrian Army soldiers besieged in Deir Ez-zor.|$|E
