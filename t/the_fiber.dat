5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>fiber,</b> the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium-based fiber systems. all factors of <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> must be considered. These can be {{achieved}} only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, {{in order to reduce}} the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity. The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>fiber,</b> and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E

5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and the core part of optical fibers.

At the end of 2002, <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption.

25|$|Fiber {{with large}} core {{diameter}} (greater than 10micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> core by total internal reflection. Rays {{that meet the}} core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) {{is determined by the}} difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along <b>the</b> <b>fiber.</b> The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of <b>the</b> <b>fiber,</b> often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into <b>the</b> <b>fiber.</b> However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse <b>the</b> <b>fiber.</b>|$|E
25|$|When light {{traveling}} in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the critical angle for the boundary), {{the light is}} completely reflected. This is called total internal reflection. This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> core, bouncing back and forth off {{the boundary between the}} core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> within a certain range of angles can travel down <b>the</b> <b>fiber</b> without leaking out. This range of angles is called the acceptance cone of <b>the</b> <b>fiber.</b> The size of this acceptance cone {{is a function of the}} refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.|$|E
