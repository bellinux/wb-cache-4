5|$|Revelations: Persona is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control {{of a group of}} high school students. A mixture of navigation styles are used: navigation round the students' hometown is done using an overhead view, navigation of standard environments such as outside areas and story locations use an angled third-person view, and dungeons and most buildings are navigating in first-person. An icon in the <b>top</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner</b> of the screen displays a lunar phase: this display shows the passage of in-game time, and its status determines the activity patterns and moods of enemy demons. Battles are both triggered by story events and through random encounters around the world map and dungeon environments. If the player attacks an enemy from behind, the party is given a set of attacks costing no magic points or health points.|$|E
5|$|Celestine Babayaro, who {{had been}} {{struggling}} with an injury, played no further part in the final and was substituted before the second half commenced. Terry came on in his place to partner Desailly, which meant Gallas moved to left-back. Arsenal resumed play and a shot by Henry was kept out by Cudicini. The scare brought Chelsea to life and resulted in the team enjoying their best spell of the match. Guðjohnsen's effort in the 57th minute forced a save from Seaman, who tipped the ball over the bar. Jesper Grønkjær then roamed forward and played the ball to Le Saux, but the defender's shot went well over. Chelsea continued to pile pressure on Arsenal; Grønkjær's pass intended for Hasselbaink in the 61st minute was intercepted just in time by Adams and Melchiot's header unsettled Seaman in goal. Wiltord then collected the ball from midfield and played a one-two with Henry, but directed his shot wide from the left flank. Chelsea made their second change in the 67th minute, bringing on Zola for Hasselbaink. The substitution {{did not have the}} desired effect as Arsenal went a goal ahead. Adams cleared the Chelsea danger and Wiltord's reverse pass found Parlour with acres of space to manoeuvre. The midfielder advanced as the Chelsea defence backed off and looked up before curling the ball from 25 yards. His effort went over a diving Cudicini, into the <b>top</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner</b> of the Chelsea goal.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} debut for Millwall {{in the opening}} game of the 2009–10 season, {{starting}} in the club's 1–1 draw with Southampton; providing the assist for Millwall's equaliser. A month later, he scored his first goal for Millwall in a 3–1 victory over Huddersfield Town. Playing in a deeper role than when at Stevenage, Morison struggled for goals, but made the majority of Millwall's goals throughout October, whilst also netting in a 5–0 win over Tranmere Rovers. In December 2009, he scored a 91st-minute winner in a 3–2 victory over Milton Keynes Dons, and also scored a similar goal in a 4–0 win over Staines Town in the FA Cup. Three days later, Morison scored twice in Millwall's 2–1 victory over Walsall. His fine form through December continued, scoring twice in a 4–4 draw against Charlton Athletic at The Valley. He scored his seventh goal in as many games in a 2–0 win over Bristol Rovers, whilst also assisting the second goal. Morison scored his second goal of Millwall's FA Cup campaign against Derby County at Pride Park in early January 2010; scoring in the 108th minute as Millwall were knocked out 5–3 on a penalty shootout. He provided the assists for both of Millwall's goals in games against Southampton and Oldham Athletic respectively, before scoring the winner in a 1–0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion; his 11th goal of the season. This was followed up with a brace in a 3–1 win away to Carlisle United, whilst also setting up Millwall's third goal. Morison scored another brace four days later, as Millwall beat Charlton Athletic 4–0. His 17th of the season came {{in front of the}} Sky cameras against Leeds United at Elland Road. Shortly after, Morison scored his 18th goal of the campaign, scoring a header from an acute angle in Millwall's 5–0 win over Stockport County. As a result of his fine goalscoring form throughout March, Morison was named Football League One Player of the Month. Another goal followed for Morison in a 2–1 win away at Colchester United. Morison's 20th goal of the season came in a 2–1 victory over Leyton Orient, scoring Millwall's second goal from the penalty spot. The goal subsequently means that Morison has now scored 20 goals or more in his last six seasons for three different clubs. On {{the last day of the}} season, Morison scored a brace against Swindon Town in a 3–2 victory. Morison's first was a coolly dispatched penalty, whilst he supplied the cross that led to an own goal. Morison's second goal of the game was a half-volley from outside the area; looping into the <b>top</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner</b> of the net. He scored his 23rd goal of the season in Millwall's 2–0 win against Huddersfield Town as Millwall progressed to the League One play-off final, where they beat Swindon Town 1–0 at Wembley Stadium; Morison's third successive victory at the stadium.|$|E

It depicts the Indian flag with the patriots' slogan, Jai Hind ("long live India"), at the <b>top</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner.</b> The stamp was valued at three and one-half annas. A memorial to Mahatma Gandhi was issued 15 August 1948 on {{the first anniversary of}} independence. One year later a definitive series appeared, depicting India's broad cultural heritage (primarily Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh and Jain temples, sculptures, monuments and fortresses). A subsequent issue commemorated the beginning of the Republic of India on 26 January 1950. Definitives included a technology-and-development theme in 1955, a series depicting a map of India in 1957 (denominated in naya paisa—decimal currency) and a 1965 series {{with a wide variety of}} images. The old inscription [...] "India Postage" [...] was replaced in 1962 with [...] "भारत INDIA", although three stamps (issued from December 1962 to January 1963) carried the earlier inscription.|$|E

2500|$|This {{dramatic}} increase in prices has also led to unscrupulous sellers attempting to pass off prints from the Bohn Edition as originals, {{and it can be}} difficult for those unfamiliar with these practices {{to tell the difference between}} a restrike (commonly called [...] "a Bohn") and an original. The key indicators of a print coming from the Bohn Edition are (i) the presence of a number in the <b>top,</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>corner</b> of the print (the number is most commonly in the image itself, but may be outside in the margin); (ii) the fact that the Bohn edition was issued without colouring; and (iii) the fact that the strikes for the main published volumes of the Bohn Edition were printed on both sides of the paper (the Bohn Edition of the so-called [...] "Suppressed Plates" [...] was, like the originals, printed on one side of the paper only). However, the fact that a print is single-sided does not mean that it is not a Bohn restrike: there are in existence many Bohns (for example, Light expelling Darkness) that bear a number, but which are printed on one side of the paper only. These single-sided numbered strikes are almost always printed on much higher quality paper than was used for the bound volumes, and the quality of the printing is usually much superior too, with more care having been taken to ensure a crisp impression. These impressions are believed to have been struck by Henry Bohn with a view to colouring them, and then selling them as high-quality single prints, in much the same way as the prints published in Gillray's lifetime. There are many example of such single-sided restrikes, both coloured and uncoloured. Since prices for Bohns are usually between one-tenth and one-twentieth of those for originals, unscrupulous sellers will go to great lengths to disguise the fact that a print is a Bohn. Some common methods include: (i) tortuously worded descriptions, which attempt to avoid disclosure of the fact the print is a restrike (although some sellers will just plain lie); (ii) if the number is outside the image, trimming the print to the very edges of the image; (iii) if the number is inside the image, carefully abrading the surface to obliterate the number; (iv) cutting strips of the image to remove the number; (v) laying the print to paper or framing it such that it is difficult to determine whether there is printing on the reverse; and (vi) adding colour.|$|E
