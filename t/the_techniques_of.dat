Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised as excellent. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view. The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2ft).|$|E

It was very important as a trigger in predicting the children’s ability in future. In fact, recently, there are many children who have not {{had an interest in}} the early literacy, besides, it also make mothers pay much attention related to the children’s literacy ability. One of evidences of mothers’ attention is mothers’ enthusiasm in attending a training <b>of</b> multisensory <b>technique.</b> Based on <b>the</b> training, it was obtained results that the mothers’ understanding was increased related to <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> literacy stimulation and the children felt comfortable on <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> literacy stimulation given by the mothers. Nevertheless, in another side, a question was raised on how the mothers implement <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> early literacy stimulation to the children at home. This research aimed at understanding on the ways of mothers in implementing <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> early literacy ability stimulation to the preschool children at home. The determination of participants was selected based on the previously determined criteria, that was mothers who had ever attended the training of early literacy stimulation. Based on the criteria, the researcher selected 6 participants. The method of research used a qualitative approach through the data collection in the forms of interview, observation, and daily notes. Based on the results of data analysis, it could be concluded that <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> early literacy ability stimulation that the mothers conducted was appropriate to <b>the</b> stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> literacy stimulation previously taught, besides, it was also found that <b>the</b> <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> writing together was effective in increasing the children’s writing ability.

5|$|During his lifetime, Morris {{produced}} {{items in}} a range of crafts, mainly those to do with furnishing, including over 600 designs for wall-paper, textiles, and embroideries, over 150 for stained glass windows, three typefaces, and around 650 borders and ornamentations for the Kelmscott Press. He emphasised the idea that the design and production of an item should not be divorced from one another, and that where possible those creating items should be designer-craftsmen, thereby both designing and manufacturing their goods. In the field of textile design, Morris revived a number of dead techniques, and insisted on the use of good quality raw materials, almost all natural dyes, and hand processing. He also observed the natural world first hand to gain a basis for his designs, and insisted on learning <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>of</b> production prior to producing a design.|$|E
5|$|During that time, Shapiro {{instructed}} ex-captive orangutans in {{the acquisition}} {{and use of}} signs following <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>of</b> psychologists R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner, who taught the chimpanzee, Washoe, in the late 1960s. In the only signing study ever conducted in a great ape's natural environment, Shapiro home-reared Princess, a juvenile female, which learned nearly 40 signs (according to the criteria of sign acquisition used by psychologist Francine Patterson with Koko, the gorilla) and trained Rinnie, a free-ranging adult female orangutan, which learned nearly 30 signs over a two-year period. For his dissertation study, Shapiro examined the factors influencing sign learning by four juvenile orangutans over a 15-month period.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Smith {{moved to}} MIT as an Institute Professor with {{appointments}} {{in both the}} Departments of Humanities and Metallurgy. His focus was to transplant <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>of</b> metallurgy into {{the study of the}} production methods used to create artefacts discovered by archaeologists such as samurai swords. In his role of teaching the history of science, he argued that important advances were often the result of curiosity rather than the pursuit of defined goals. He was interested in the scientific aspects of fine arts, and published several works linking the arts with the sciences. He lectured about this at the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, film {{producer}} Panchu Arunachalam commissioned him to compose {{the songs and}} film score for a Tamil-language film called Annakkili ('The Parrot'). For the soundtrack, Ilaiyaraaja applied <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>of</b> modern popular film music orchestration to Tamil folk poetry and folk song melodies, which created a fusion of Western and Tamil idioms. Ilaiyaraaja's use of Tamil music in his film scores injected new influence into the Indian film score milieu. By the mid-1980s Ilaiyaraaja was gaining increasing stature as a film composer and music director in the South Indian film industry. He has worked with Indian poets and lyricists such as Kannadasan, Vaali, Vairamuthu, O. N. V. Kurup, Sreekumaran Thampi, Veturi Sundararama Murthy, Aacharya Aatreya, Sirivennela Sitaramasastri, Chi.

5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>of</b> perturbation theory.

One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E

5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>of</b> other batsmen.|$|E
5|$|In January 1891, Morris began {{renting a}} cottage near to Kelmscott House, No. 16 Upper Mall in Hammersmith, which {{would serve as}} the first {{premises}} of the Kelmscott Press, before relocating to the neighbouring No. 14 in May, that same month in which the company was founded. Devoted {{to the production of}} books which he deemed beautiful, Morris was artistically influenced by the illustrated manuscripts and early printed books of Medieval and Early Modern Europe. Before publishing its first work, Morris ensured that he had mastered <b>the</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>of</b> printing and secured supplies of hand-made paper and vellum which would be necessary for production. Over the next seven years, they would publish 66 volumes. The first of these would be one of Morris' own novels, The Story of the Glittering Plain, which was published in May 1891 and soon sold out. The Kelmscott Press would go on to publish 23 of Morris' books, more than those of any other author. The press also published editions of works by Keats, Shelley, Ruskin, and Swinburne, as well as copies of various Medieval texts. A number of the Press' books contained illustrations provided by Burne-Jones. The Press' magnum opus would be the Kelmscott Chaucer, which had taken years to complete and included 87 illustrations from Burne-Jones. Morris still remained firmly in an employer relation with those working at the Press, although organised outings for them and paid them above average wages.|$|E

A Comparative Study on Teaching Top-down and Bottom-up <b>Techniques</b> <b>of</b> Reading (A Quasi-Experimental Study at 8 th Grade of SMP N 5 Surakarta in the Academic Year 2012 / 2013). A thesis. Surakarta : Faculty of Teacher Training and Education of Sebelas Maret University, 2013. The aims of this {{research}} are to find out: (1) {{whether there is a}} significant difference in reading comprehension achievement between the students taught <b>the</b> top-down <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading and those taught <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading; (2) whether <b>the</b> top-down <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading is more effective than <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading. This quasi-experimental study used 29 students for the experimental group and 29 students for the control group. The data were analyzed by using t-test formula. The computation of the data shows that the t-observation (to) is 2. 42, which is higher than the t-table (56, 0. 05) : 1. 960. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a significant difference in reading comprehension achievement between the students taught <b>the</b> top-down <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading and those taught <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading. <b>The</b> mean of the group of students who are taught <b>the</b> top-down <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading is 79. 4, while that of those who are taught <b>the</b> bottom-up <b>technique</b> <b>of</b> reading is 76. 78.
