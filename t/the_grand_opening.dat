5|$|Work on {{the tunnel}} cost {{the lives of}} 24 men. <b>The</b> <b>grand</b> <b>opening</b> was 9 July 1849, a week later than intended, but the first train, full of Leeds and Thirsk railway officials, pulled by Bray's {{locomotive}} Stephenson, went through {{a few weeks earlier}} on 31 May. The railway was opened to the public on 10 July. When built it was the third longest rail tunnel in the country. The Leeds and Thirsk Company was renamed the Leeds Northern Railway shortly after the line was completed.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>opening,</b> {{the theatre}} {{served as a}} venue for {{vaudeville}} and film, and following the decline of vaudeville as a movie palace until the 1970s. With the economic recession, the advent of television, and movie complex development in the suburbs, crowds dwindled and the theatre struggled to stay open. It was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with the nearby Orpheum theatre. A variety of re-use possibilities were proposed for the theatre including a Chinese restaurant, a triplex movie theater, an office building, or a shopping center. The city of Seattle was unable to protect the theatre as a designated landmark because of its unique position {{on the site of}} the original territorial university grounds owned by the state of Washington.|$|E
5|$|The A1 was a showpiece {{project of}} the Croatian {{government}} and a symbol of uniting the country. The first attempt to revive the project in earnest occurred in the 1993, when the excavation of Sveti Rok Tunnel began. More comprehensive construction work started in 2000 and Karlovac–Vukova Gorica section opened in 2001. In 2003, the first sections not shared with the Zagreb–Rijeka Motorway were completed: Vukova Gorica–Mala Kapela Tunnel and Gornja Ploča–Zadar2. Mala Kapela Tunnel–Gornja Ploča, Zadar2–Pirovac and Vrpolje–Dugopolje sections opened in 2004 and Mala Kapela Tunnel itself and Pirovac–Vrpolje section opened in 2005 marking completion of the Zagreb–Split Motorway, culminating with <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>opening</b> of Karlovac— Split section on 26 June 2005.|$|E

5|$|The AT Plaza is {{a public}} space that hosts the Cloud Gate sculpture. The plaza opened in July 2004 with the {{unveiling}} of the sculpture during <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>opening</b> weekend of the park. Ameritech donated $3million for the naming right for the plaza, but it was SBC Plaza when the park opened, as a merger had changed the company name to SBC Communications. The 2005 merger of SBC and AT Corporation led to the present name. The sculpture and the AT Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. The plaza has become a place to view the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. During the holiday season, the plaza hosts Christmas caroling.|$|E
5|$|After A You {{spends time}} in this world, Grandpa Beard decides that his {{problems}} are solved and returns to take {{him away from the}} imaginary world. A You protests, not wanting to return to the cold reality, but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he must change that reality if he dislikes it. Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually gets married to his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>opening</b> of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{was renamed}} Almirante Latorre {{once again and}} {{formally}} {{handed over to the}} Chilean government on 27 November 1920. It departed Plymouth the same day with two of the destroyers, and they arrived in Chile on 20 February 1921, where they were welcomed by Chile's president, Arturo Alessandri. Almirante Latorre was made the flagship of the navy. The dreadnought was frequently used by Alessandri for various functions, including as transport to Vallenar after a 1922 earthquake, and to Talcahuano for <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>opening</b> of a new naval drydock in 1924. In 1925, with the fall of the January Junta, the ship hosted Alessandri after his return from exile. In September, the last month of his term, Alessandri received the United Kingdom's Edward, Prince of Wales, on board the battleship.|$|E

5|$|A/S Ullevaal Stadion {{was founded}} on 27 January 1925. The company was owned 73.5% by Lyn, 24% Aker Municipality and 5.1% by the clubs Ullevaal, Tåsen, Nydalen and Heming. The stadium was built with a running track, {{allowing}} the stadium to {{also be used for}} track and field, and had a capacity of about 35,000 spectators. The stadium cost NOK416,000. <b>The</b> <b>grand</b> <b>opening</b> was held on 26 September 1926 by Crown Prince Olav. It was followed by a friendly match between a reinforced Lyn and Örgryte IS of Sweden, where Lyn won 5–1. In the opening game, tickets cost NOK3 for seats, NOK2 for standing places and NOK1 on the end stands. The stadium became both the home ground for Lyn and hosted track and field events. The first international match was held on 29 May 1927 and featured Norway losing 0–1 against Denmark. The match against Sweden from the Nordic Football Championship 1933/36 on 22 September 1935 was held in front of a crowd of 35,495, which still stands as the spectator record. The stadium was served by the Oslo Metro {{with the opening of the}} Sognsvann Line in 1934. In 1938, a new East Stand (Klokkesvingen) was opened.|$|E
5|$|At the Sabre store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to put on}} a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Dwight assigns the members of his team various tasks: Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is to act like a hipster to make the Sabre Pyramid more appealing, Cathy (Lindsey Broad) is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is to give a presentation to wow the critics, and Todd Packer (David Koechner) is to play the part of a sexual predator— much to Packer's chagrin. As <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>opening</b> progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) using his old cell phone instead of his Sabre Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim— who imitate Kelly and his mother respectively in an attempt to calm him down— leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named vice president by Nellie.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected for <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>opening</b> of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate. In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas. When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section. Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, required to produce the sculpture's mirror-like finish.|$|E
