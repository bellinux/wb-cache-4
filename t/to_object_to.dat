5|$|The right <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> false {{attribution}} is {{the oldest}} of the statutory moral rights, originating (albeit in a limited form) in the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862. Found in Section 84 of the 1988 Act, the right <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> false attribution allows individuals to avoid being named on works they are not the author of, and applies to literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, as well as films. It only applies to acts of false attribution perpetrated after 1 August 1989, and lasts for 20 years after the death of the person falsely attributed with authorship. It is infringed whenever an individual issues copies of a work to the public, exhibits them in public or broadcasts them with a false attribution.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, as Berkman {{finished}} {{the fifth year}} of his sentence, he applied to the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. Having served as his own attorney, Berkman had failed <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the trial judge's rulings and thus had no legal basis for an appeal; a pardon was his only hope for early release. The Board of Pardons denied his application in October 1897. A second application was rejected in early 1899.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Edward I, the new king, Edward II, asked that Winchelsey be restored, which the pope agreed to on 22 January 1308. Soon after his return to England in early 1308 the {{archbishop}} joined the king's enemies. The archbishop, along with the Earl of Warwick, {{were the only people}} <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the return of the new king's favourite Piers Gaveston to England in 1309. Winchelsey aided the barons in their prosecution of Edward II by sentencing their enemies to excommunication. He was appointed an Ordainer in 1310, and died at Otford on 11 May 1313.|$|E

5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} of a former royal clerk as Pope Clement V in 1305, the king was able to secure the archbishop's exile that same year. Upon the succession of Edward's son, Edward II, Winchelsey was allowed to return to England after the new king petitioned the pope to allow his return. Winchelsey soon joined the king's enemies, however, and was the only bishop <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the return of the king's favourite, Piers Gaveston. Winchelsey died in 1313. Although miracles were alleged to have happened at his tomb, an attempt to have him declared a saint was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Moral {{rights in}} United Kingdom law {{are parts of}} {{copyright}} law that protect the personal interests of {{the author of a}} copyrighted work, as well as the economic interests protected by other elements of copyright. Found in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, the moral rights are the right to be identified as the author of a work, known as the right of paternity, the right <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> derogatory treatment of a work, known as the right of integrity, the right not to be identified as the author of someone else's work, and the right to privacy. The right of paternity exists for the entire copyright term, and requires individuals who commercially broadcast, sell, perform or exhibit literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works to identify the author of the work – but this does not apply to things such as typefaces, encyclopaedias or works subject to crown copyright.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E
5|$|Before talks could begin, Coalition armies {{crossed the}} Rhine on 22 December. Metternich retired from Frankfurt to Breisgau to {{celebrate}} Christmas with his wife's family before travelling {{to the new}} Coalition headquarters at Basel in January 1814. Quarrels with Tsar Alexander, particularly {{over the fate of}} France intensified in January, prompting Alexander to storm out. He therefore missed the arrival of Castlereagh in mid-January. Metternich and Castlereagh formed a good working relationship and then met with Alexander at Langres. The Tsar remained unaccommodating however, demanding a push into the centre of France; fortunately, he was too preoccupied <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> Metternich's other ideas, like a final peace conference in Vienna. Metternich did not attend talks with the French at Chatillon, as he wanted to stay with Alexander. The talks stalled, and, after a brief advance, Coalition forces had to retreat after the Montmirail and Montereau. This relieved Metternich's fears that an overconfident Alexander might act unilaterally.|$|E

25|$|On September 18, Clarett filed {{a guilty}} plea {{to the charges}} in a plea bargain that {{involved}} these events {{as well as the}} earlier robbery charges. He was sentenced by Judge David Fais to seven {{and a half years in}} prison, with the possibility to apply for early release after three and a half years. As part of the plea agreement, the prosecution agreed not <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> early release if and when Clarett applied for it.|$|E
25|$|Bush's four {{reasons for}} the {{invasion}} provided sufficient justification to establish bipartisan Congressional approval {{and support for the}} invasion. However, the secrecy before initiation, the speed and success of the invasion itself, and U.S. public support for it (80% public approval) did not allow Democrats <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> Bush's decision to use military force. One contemporary study suggests that Bush decided to invade for domestic political reasons, citing scarce strategic reasoning for the U.S. to invade and immediately withdraw without establishing the structure to enforce the interests that Bush used to justify the invasion.|$|E

In a 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that where the government has unintentionally failed <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the filing of a petition after the AEDPA limitations period has expired, {{it is not an}} abuse of discretion for a district court to nevertheless sua sponte (on its own initiative) dismiss the petition on that basis.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the powers}} granted {{by the state to}} {{political}} subdivisions is the power to enact local regulations regarding matters covered by the local charter, called ordinances.

The ordinance must be debated in a public meeting, and passed by a majority vote of the governing body of that subdivision.|$|E

The plaintiffs in the case were granted title to property improperly conveyed {{by the state of}} Tennessee north of this border. In the ruling, the Supreme Court asserted the fundamental right of states and nations to establish their borders regardless of private contract, and made a fundamental statement about the rights of parties <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> a trial court ruling under the rules of civil procedure.|$|E

25|$|Business {{rates are}} the latest {{incarnation}} {{of a series of}} taxes for funding local services known as rates, based on property values. The first rate was part of the Elizabethan Poor Law Act 1572, which established relief for the poor at the local parish level, paid for by inhabitants of the parish. A system of rates to fund local government and services evolved over the next three centuries, including a separate system for London from 1869 to 1963. Changes included a stricter definition of how to value for a rate; the introduction of a valuation list containing the assessed values; the ability <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> the assessed value; and the introduction of the valuation officer, appointed by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue (now Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs), as the assessor.|$|E
25|$|Statistics New Zealand gathers {{information}} on religious affiliation in the five-yearly census. Completing a census form is compulsory by law {{for every person}} in New Zealand on census night but respondents are able <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> answering the question of religious affiliation, and around 6% do object. The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% were in this category. The proportion {{more than doubled in}} two decades, reaching 41.9% in the 2013 census. Younger people were more likely to indicate they had no religion; except in the 10-14 age bracket, the majority of people under 35 at the 2013 Census stated they had no religion. More males than females stated they had no religion, particularly among people aged 65 years or over.|$|E
25|$|Leopold II, King of the Belgians, privately {{controlled}} and owned the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908. In 1908, {{the area was}} annexed by Belgium as a colony known as the Belgian Congo. Leopold used his personal control to strip the county of vast amounts of wealth, largely {{in the form of}} ivory and rubber. These labor-intensive industries were serviced by slave labor, and the local peoples were forced to work through various means, including torture, imprisonment, maiming and terror. Christian missionaries and a handful of human rights organizers internationally publicized these atrocities. Slowly, various nations, including Great Britain and the United States of America, began <b>to</b> <b>object</b> <b>to</b> Leopold's tyranny with the result that the country's administration was transferred to Belgium. Little changed inside the country, however, until the ivory and rubber were exhausted.|$|E
