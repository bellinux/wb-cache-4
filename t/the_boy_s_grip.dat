40|$|This is a {{carefully}} designed, multi-layered picture book for older readers. At the most literal level of <b>the</b> story, a <b>boy</b> demands {{that his mother}} buy a bracelet or amulet at a fair in the town square. The artifact looks like a snake chasing or devouring its own tail in an endless cycle. Alone in his attic room, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> puts <b>the</b> bracelet on and falls asleep. At this, the snake comes to life in <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>s</b> dreaming, thus telling its story. Even as <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> sees visions in his dreaming, through his open attic window, we, the readers, {{look down on the}} town square and see high drama. Invaders attack the town and rob <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> house as he sleeps, a girl is rescued from the attic window opposite, there are scenes of heroism and death these events might be what leads <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> to dispose of the charm when he wakes, taking it for a bad omen. But what is real and what is not? Are <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>s</b> fantastic snake-induced dreams the real events, or the events that we see at the real-life story level, taking place in the town square? The snake serves as a metaphor for story and narrative itself story as world-creating, eternal, terrifying at times, but sublimely beautiful. [Book Synopsis]Illustrated by Matt Ottley...|$|R

40|$|Recurrent {{dislocation}} of the patella {{probably has}} several causes. In many patients abnormal laxity {{of the knee}} is present and this may predispose to dislocation (Dc Palma 1954). A family has come to our notice in which three members suffered recurrent dislocation of the patella and a fourth had probably sustained a single dislocation. All the former had abnormally lax knees and most other joints showed similar hypermobility. Five other living {{members of the family}} were also “double jointed ” but had not suffered dislocation. The particular interest of the patients we shall describe lies in the association of familial joint laxity with recurrent dislocation of the patella.
