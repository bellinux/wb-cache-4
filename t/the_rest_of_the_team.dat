5|$|In the {{shortened}} 2011–12 NBA season, the Blazers {{got off to}} a 7–2 start.

5|$|The {{match between}} the Sheffield FA and the FA {{that took place}} in December 1871 is notable for {{evidence}} of the development of several new positions. As well as the first mention of forwards, sides (now called wingers) were also mentioned. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> made up the midfield. The Half backs (referred to as centre backs in the modern game) were mentioned a year later. By the mid-1870s it was common to use one goalkeeper assisted by two cover goals and two half backs. The attack was made up of five midfielders and one forward. This produced the 2–2–5–1 formation.|$|E

5|$|Development of Burning Rangers started around November 1996, {{after the}} release of Sonic Team's {{previous}} game Christmas Nights (a Christmas-themed demo for Nights into Dreams...). The concept originated with the idea of rescuing people as opposed to killing them, which was an element that producer Yuji Naka felt was too common in contemporary video games. The development team of 31 (out of Sonic Team's staff of about 50) was directed by Naoto Ohshima, the director and lead designer Takao Miyoshi. <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> consisted of three game planners, six programmers, eighteen designers, and two sound producers, most of whom had worked on Nights into Dreams....|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

The United States tied Japan 2–2 during regular and overtime leading to their second penalty kick shootout of the tournament. They were defeated 3–1 in penalties and concluded the tournament with a silver medal. Rapinoe's tournament record included one goal and three assists.

5|$|Hammond was {{selected}} for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1932–33. Known as the Bodyline series, it became notorious for the controversial English tactic of bowling short on the line of leg stump, making the ball rise towards the batsman's body to create deflections that could be caught by leg-side fielders. Hammond, {{one of the first}} players selected, was part of the selection committee on tour, and the M.C.C. captain, Douglas Jardine, may have discussed tactics with him on the outward journey. Hammond disapproved of Bodyline bowling, believing it to be dangerous, although he understood some of the reasons for its use. He kept his feelings hidden during the tour, preferring to go along with his captain and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team.</b> It was not until 1946 that he openly voiced his opinion.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Crawford was {{included}} in an Australian team which toured North America. The team was organised by Edgar Mayne, a South Australian batsman who tried to secure backing from the Australian Board of Control {{to make it an}} official representative team, but the Board refused to do so. In all matches, Crawford scored over 1,000 runs and took over 200 wickets, and he was particularly effective as a bowler in the matches designated first-class. He later stated that this was the best tour he had been on; more press rumours suggested that he would return to England {{at the conclusion of the}} tour, but he returned to Australia with <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Shreveport, meanwhile, {{whatever}} positive momentum {{the team}} had gained {{at the end of}} the 1994 season failed to carry over into 1995. Notable NFL quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver was signed and put up decent numbers; <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> however, was unable to muster much success and limped to a 5–13 record. As elsewhere, the team saw a second season attendance decline. With the season winding down, the city had clearly soured on the Gliebermans. They became embroiled in legal difficulties and, in one particularly absurd incident, Bernie Glieberman had his lawyer attempt (unsuccessfully) to abscond with a half-million dollar Tucker automobile that Glieberman had donated to a local museum.|$|E
