In contrast, the Interactive Discourse Planner (IDP) tries {{to recognize a}}n expansion of its own <b>text</b> <b>plan</b> from the user's queries. During interaction, IDP builds a <b>text</b> <b>plan</b> in reaction to user feedback that it uses as the discourse context.

40|$|Our {{experience}} with a critiquing system shows that when the system detects problems with the user's performance, multiple critiques are often produced. Analysis of a corpus of actual cri-tiques revealed that even though each individ-ual critique is concise and coherent, the set of critiques as a whole may exhibit several prob-lems that detract from conciseness and coher-ence, and consequently assimilation. Thus a text planner was needed that could integrate the <b>text</b> <b>plans</b> for individual communicative goals to produce an overall <b>text</b> <b>plan</b> representing a con-cise, coherent message. This paper presents our general rule-based system for accomplishing this task. The sys-tem takes as input a set of individual <b>text</b> <b>plans</b> represented as RST-style trees, and produces a smaller set of more complex trees represent-ing integrated messages that still achieve the multiple communicative goals of the individual <b>text</b> <b>plans.</b> Domain-independent rules are used to capture strategies across domains, while the facility for addition of domain-dependent rules enables the system to be tuned to the require-ments of a particular domain.

To this end, we regard <b>text</b> <b>planning</b> as a goal-driven process that dynamically constructs a text plan.

40|$|In expository discourse, {{listeners}} {{ask questions}} {{in response to}} unsatisfactory explanations. A system that explains interactively {{must be able to}} recognize how to elaborate its answer to produce an explanation that meets a listener’s informational needs. Sometimes, listeners ask questions that digress from the purpose of the discussion. Therefore, a system that provides interactive explanations must also be able to distinguish pertinent questions from questions that digress from the discussion purpose. It must also be able to recognize questions that are incoherent. This paper discusses the representation issues that are involved in building such a system. The Interactive Discourse Planner (IDP) <b>plans</b> <b>text</b> to describe and/or justify a domain plan inter-actively. To perform these tasks, both the system’s <b>text</b> <b>plans</b> and the domain plans are represented uniformly. The uniform representation of information makes it possible for IDP to access both domain and discourse information to recognize how to plan each response. The system’s planning rules refer to information at both the domain- and discourse-level. Therefore, these levels of information are reasoned about together to plan additional discourse. IDP uses questions from the user to recognize how to extend its own <b>text</b> <b>plan</b> in a way that both satisfies its listener and achieves the system’s discourse goal. In {{the process of trying to}} recognize ways to expand its own <b>text</b> <b>plan,</b> IDP can detect three types of digressions from the discourse purpose that the user can initiate with a question. Two types of <b>text</b> <b>plan</b> representations that are used in the system make it possible for the system to distinguish these types of digressions. As a testbed, IDP <b>plans</b> <b>text</b> to discuss driving route plans. ...|$|R

Includes bibliographical refences. Natural Language Generation (NLG) {{is roughly}} {{decomposed}} into two stages: <b>text</b> <b>planning,</b> and text generation. In the <b>text</b> <b>planning</b> stage, the semantic {{description of the}} text is produced from the conceptual inputs. Then, the text generation system transforms this semantic description into an actual text. This thesis focuses on the design and implementation of a Turkish text generation system rather than <b>text</b> <b>planning.</b> To develop a text generator, we need a linguistic theory that describes {{the resources of the}} desired natural language, and also a software tool that represents and performs these linguistic resources in a computational environment. In this thesis, in order to carry out the mentioned requirements, we have used a functional linguistic theory called Systemic-Functional Grammar (SFG), and the FUF text generation system as a software tool. The ultimate text generation system takes the semantic description of the text sentence by sentence, and then produces a morphological description for each lexical constituent of the sentence. The morphological descriptions are worded by a Turkish morphological generator. Because of our concentration on the text generation, we have not considered the details of the <b>text</b> <b>planning.</b> Hence, we assume that the semantic description of the text is produced and lexicalized by an application (currently given by hand).

Motivation 1 All current flexible approaches to <b>text</b> <b>planning</b> that assume that the abstract structure of text is a tree-like structure are, esentially, top-down approaches. Some of them define plan operators and exploit hierarchical planning techniques (Hovy 1993; Moore and Paris 1993; Moore and Swartout 1991; Cawsey 1991; Maybury 1992) and partial-order planning techniques (Young and Moore 1994).

We start by illustrating the two-step approach employed in {{the first version of}} the natural language generator, and the limitations of generated texts, that we discovered through analytical and empirical evaluations. We claim, that, although style refinement would be needed in these texts, particular care should be devoted to implementing some of the persuasion techniques that doctors employ in their explanations. This would require either throughly revising the <b>text</b> <b>planning</b> techniques employed, or converting to a multistep generation architecture.
