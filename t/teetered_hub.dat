50|$|The WTS-4 (4 megawatt) {{wind turbine}} in Wyoming was {{designed}} by United Technologies (Hamilton Standard Division), under the technical management of NASA and with funding from the United States Department of Interior. The WTS-4 was placed into operation in Medicine Bow, Wyoming in 1982. It featured a “soft” steel tube tower, fiberglass blades, torsional springs and dashpots in the drivetrain, and a flexible <b>teetered</b> <b>hub.</b> To this day, the WTS-4 {{is the most powerful}} wind turbine to have operated in the US and it held the world record for power output for over 20 years. A second commercial prototype with a smaller generator (3 megawatts) designated the WTS-3 was constructed and operated in Sweden. Glidden Doman was Hamilton Standard's System Design Manager for the WTS-4 project and was hired by the Swedish government to initiate the WTS-3 project.|$|E
50|$|System {{reliability}} {{is affected}} by blade count primarily through the dynamic loading of the rotor into the drive train and tower systems. While aligning the wind turbine to changes in wind direction (yawing), each blade experiences a cyclic load at its root end depending on blade position. This is true of one, two, three blades or more. However, these cyclic loads when combined together at the drive train shaft are symmetrically balanced for three blades, yielding smoother operation during turbine yaw. Turbines {{with one or two}} blades can use a pivoting <b>teetered</b> <b>hub</b> to also nearly eliminate the cyclic loads into the drive shaft and system during yawing. A Chinese 3.6 MW two-blade is being tested in Denmark. Mingyang won a bid for 87 MW (29 * 3 MW) two-bladed offshore wind turbines near Zhuhai in 2013.|$|E
40|$|A {{flexible}} rotor concept, called the balanced pitch rotor, is described. The system provides passive adjustment of cyclic pitch {{in response to}} unbalanced pitching moments across the rotor disk. Various applications are described and performance predictions are made for wind shear and cross wind operating conditions. Comparisons with the <b>teetered</b> <b>hub</b> are made and significant cost savings are predicted...|$|E
40|$|A {{horizontal}} axis wind turbine with a ball-and-socket hub is disclosed. The hub enables {{horizontal axis}} turbines {{with two or}} more blades to teeter in response to wind shear gra-dients. Computer modeling was done using existing and modified FAST code in order to compare the new hub design with existing designs. Results show that a three-bladed tur-bine with the ball-and-socket hub provides very significant reductions in out-of-plane bending loads applied to the main shaft in comparison to a three-bladed turbine with a rigid hub. Results also show that the new hub design provides significant reductions in the out-of-plane loads applied to the blades. A blade fatigue study using a rainflow counting of multi-axial torque contributions at the blade root was performed in order {{to assess the impact of}} these reductions, and results show that the three-bladed turbine equipped with a ball-and-socket, <b>teetering</b> <b>hub</b> provides for very significant reductions in lifetime blade damage in comparison to existing wind turbine designs due to a combination of factors. The first factor is that teetering largely eliminates the cyclic variations in out-of-plane tor-que on the blades that are observed with rigid hubs. Here, the fatigue study shows that the three-bladed wind turbine with a <b>teetering</b> <b>hub</b> provides for an approximate sixfold reduc-tion in lifetime blade damage in comparison to a three-bladed turbine with a rigid hub. The second factor is that the addition of a third blade reduces the load on each blade by one-third. Here, the fatigue study shows that a three-bladed turbine with a <b>teetering</b> <b>hub</b> provides for an approximate fourfold reduction in lifetime blade damage in comparison to a two-bladed turbine with a <b>teetering</b> <b>hub.</b> [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4029813]...|$|R
25|$|Most of the MOD-series wind {{turbines}} went to sites outside of Ohio, {{but the first}} unit, the MOD-0 operated at NASA's Plum Brook facility near Sandusky from 1975 to 1988. Initially the wind turbine had a lattice tower, a 38.1m diameter two-bladed rotor mounted downwind from the tower, and a capacity of 100kW. Lockheed Corporation manufactured the aluminum rotor blades. The discovery of severe stress resulting from the rotor blades passing through the tower's wind shadow led to several redesigns. In 1979, NASA rebuilt the MOD-0 with an upwind rotor mounted on a <b>teetering</b> <b>hub,</b> with a steel spar reinforcing the blades. In 1982, a tubular tower replaced the lattice tower. Finally, in 1985 NASA tested a single-bladed rotor with a <b>teetering</b> <b>hub.</b> In 1981, two NASA Glenn engineers, Larry Viterna and Bob Corrigan, used the adjustable-pitch blade feature of the MOD-0 to invent an analytical method for calculating wind turbine output in high winds, which has since become widely used in the wind power industry as the Viterna method.|$|R
40|$|This report {{surveys the}} {{analysis}} and tests performed at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, on a horizontal-axis, two-laded wind turbine with <b>teeter</b> <b>hub.</b> The introduction is a brief account of results obtained during the 5 -year period ending December 1985. The wind tunnel model and the test turbine (7. 6 m [25 ft. ] in diameter) at Washington University`s Tyson Research Center had a 67 {degree} delta-three angle of the teeter axis. The introduction explains why this configuration was selected and named the passive cycle pitch (PCP) wind turbine.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests is {{currently}} being conducted using the DOE/NASA 100 kW Experimental Wind Turbine with a two-bladed, teetered rotor with 30 % span tip control. Preliminary evaluation test results indicates that the teetered rotor significantly decreases loads on the yaw drive mechanism and reduces blade cyclic flapwise bending moments by 25 % at the 20 % span location when compared to rigid hub rotor.

40|$|Stall {{control and}} pitch control {{are the most}} {{commonly}} used methods of regulating power. However, through the opportunities presented by the flexible (or <b>teetered)</b> <b>hub</b> of a two-bladed teetered rotor one can also utilize yaw control to regulate power. This is achieved by adjusting the capture area of the rotor disk relative to the prevailing wind direction. This paper presents the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic results obtained from theoretical models for such a rotor when is yawed to the undisturbed flow. The non-axial flow operating conditions results in a variation in the power output and noise spectrum. Some comparisons between calculated and measured noise spectra of a yaw controlled wind turbine show good agreement over all angles up to 60 degrees of yaw...|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} aeroelastic {{simulations of}} the UNIWEX wind turbine. The {{descriptions of the}} different FE-modes {{can be found in}} separate reports. After identification, adaptation and validation of the total model, the following investigations were performed for three different hub configurations (rigid <b>hub,</b> <b>teetering</b> <b>hub</b> and individual flapping) : - Stability analysis and solution of the homogeneous system; - response calculations with different excitations; -comparison with measurements. The response behaviour of the three hub configurations was then compared. The report concludes with an abstract of a separate work where the influence of the unsteady parts of the induced velocities on the aeroelastic behaviour is investigated and with remarks on the animation of time history results.

Operational experience shows that 1 per rev excitation exists in the drive train, high aerodynamic damping prevents resonance response of the blade flatwise modes, and <b>teetering</b> the <b>hub</b> substantially reduces the chordwise blade response to odd harmonic excitation.

50|$|The company (CAT) {{was founded}} in 1994 by Jay Carter Jr., {{two years after the}} partial sale of the wind turbine company Carter Wind Systems, now being run by his son Matt. The company is {{developing}} the CarterCopter slowed rotor/compound (SR/C) aircraft series, the CarterCopter Propeller System and a landing gear system. According to Carter, the development of the propeller and landing gear was not strictly necessary, and delayed the SR/C. The <b>teetering</b> blade <b>hub</b> principle used in Carter Wind Systems is also used in Carter aircraft.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} briefly {{the structural}} design {{analysis of a}} 500 kW two-bladed downwind type wind turbine indigenous developed under NMITLI program. The major components developed were rotor blades, <b>teetered</b> <b>hub,</b> rotor shaft, platform and yaw system whereas gear box and alternator were procured. Several configurations were initially explored for each subsystem and finally the suitable one for a prototype was fabricated. The wind turbine developed composed of minimum elementary systems required for prototype testing. The design has been rationalized/ simplified for single set/piece fabrication. The aerodynamic design of the blade {{was carried out in}} a separate exercise and the aerodynamic loads obtained were used for this structural analysis. Further, a special purpose code, “BLADED’ was used to generate aerodynamic loads for some cases. The critical loads in all phases of wind turbine existence were identified and used in the design. The blade apart from generating power is the source from where all the dynamic loads originates. The blade shell was made out of glass-epoxy laminates. The load carrying spar integrated with the shell of the blade composed of more UD layers. Foam sandwich construction was employed in non-critical area. The blade was attached to the hub flange with use of T-Bolts embedded into the root. Preload was introduced into the T-Bolt to improve it’s the fatigue life. Shaft and teeter pin were made out of forged EN 24 steel whereas hub, platform and yaw system were fabricated out of plates by welding. Thus, the design exercise was focused for the prototype wind turbine development...|$|E
40|$|In {{support of}} a program to advance wood {{composite}} wind turbine blade technology, a design was completed for a prototype, 90 -foot diameter, two-bladed, one-piece rotor, with all wood/epoxy composite structure. The rotor was sized for compatibility with a generator having a maximum power rating of 4000 kilowatts. Innovative features of the rotor include: a <b>teetering</b> <b>hub</b> to minimize the effects of gust loads, untwisted blades to promote rotor power control through stall, joining of blades to the hub structure via an adhesive bonded structural joint, and a blade structural design which was simplified relative to earlier efforts. The prototype rotor was designed to allow flexibility for configuring the rotor upwind or downwind of the tower, for evaluating various types of teeter dampers and/or elastomeric stops, and with variable delta-three angle settings of the teeter shaft axis. The prototype rotor was also designed with provisions for installing pressure tap and angle of attack instrumentation in one blade. A production version rotor cost analysis was conducted. Included in the program were efforts directed at developing advanced load take-off stud designs for subsequent evaluation testing by NASA, development of aerodynamic tip brake concepts, exploratory testing of a wood/epoxy/graphite concept, and compression testing of wood/epoxy laminate, with scarf-jointed plies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a multibody dynamics model of a VTOL teetering rotor. The developed model includes a <b>teetering</b> <b>hub,</b> containing a flexure and torque tube, rotor blades, pitch links, and swashplate system. A non-teetering rotor configuration, which modified the baseline teetering rotor by removing the teetering hinge, is also developed, and its aeromechanics characteristics compared to those of the baseline teetering design. The rotor aeroelastic responses and loads are studied under various flight conditions including the conversion flights. The rotor natural frequencies are calculated for two blade pitch angles, which represents respectively the rotor operating in helicopter and airplane modes. The MBDyn predictions of aerodynamics loading of the teetering rotor are compared with those of OVERFLOW in both helicopter and airplane modes. The comparison shows overall good agreements. The blade responses and loads in conversion flight are then compared between the baseline teetering rotor and the modified non-teetering version. Similar aeromechanical characteristics are shown for the two rotor configurations, such as the blade response, steady hub loads, and steady and oscillatory blade shear forces. However, the non-teetering rotor displays a much larger blade bending moments, both the mean and oscillatory components. Overall, the study shows that the multibody analysis has the capability to model complex rotor configurations, and helpful in establishing the requirement and criteria applied to VTOL proprotor load analysis in supporting the aircraft design...|$|R
40|$|Three {{designs of}} a guyed {{cylindrical}} tower and its foundation for an intermediate size horizontal axis {{wind turbine generator}} are discussed. The primary difference in the three designs is the configuration of the rotor. Two configurations are two-blade rotors with <b>teetering</b> <b>hubs</b> - one with full span pitchable blades, the other with fixed pitch blades. The third configuration is a three-bladed rotor with a rigid hub and fixed pitch blades. In all configurations the diameter of the rotor is 38 meters and the axis of rotation is 30. 4 meters above grade, and the power output is 200 kW and 400 kW. For each configuration the design is based upon for the most severe loading condition either operating wind or hurricane conditions. The diameter of the tower is selected to be 1. 5 meters (since it was determined that this would provide sufficient space for access ladders within the tower) with guy rods attached at 10. 7 meters above grade. Completing a design requires selecting the required thicknesses of the various cylindrical segments, the number and diameter of the guy rods, the number and size of soil anchors, {{and the size of the}} central foundation. The lower natural frequencies of vibration are determined for each design to ensure that operation near resonance does not occur. Finally, a cost estimate is prepared for each design. A preliminary design and cost estimate of a cantilever tower (cylindrical and not guyed) and its foundation is also presented for each of the three configurations...|$|R
50|$|In 1975 NASA {{designed}} and built its first prototype wind turbine, the 100 kW Mod-0 in Sandusky Ohio, with funding from the National Science Foundation and ERDA. The Mod-0 was modeled after the light weight two-bladed research turbine by Austrian Ulrich Hütter. The two-bladed wind turbine with flexible or <b>teetered</b> rotor <b>hubs</b> characterized the NASA-led program. NASA and its contractors found that two blades can produce essentially equivalent energy as three blades but at a savings of the cost and weight of a blade. Two-blade rotors turn faster than equivalent three-blade rotors, reducing the ratio in the gearbox. Flexibility in the rotor minimizes the transfer of bending loads into the drive train; none of the NASA wind turbines experienced gearbox failures that are often a problem for rigid rotor systems in use today.|$|R
40|$|Stability {{and control}} of rotors at high advance ratio are considered. Stability of teetering, articulated, and {{gimbaled}} hub types is considered with a simple flapping blade analysis. Rotor control in autorotation for <b>teetering</b> and articulated <b>hub</b> types is examined in more detail for a compound helicopter (rotor and fixed wing) using the comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II. Autorotation {{is found to be}} possible at two distinct trim conditions with different sharing of lift between the rotor and wing. Stability predictions obtained using the analytical rigid flapping blade analysis and a rigid blade CAMRAD II model compare favorably. For the flapping blade analysis, the teetering rotor is found to be the most stable hub type, showing no instabilities up to an advance ratio of 3 and a Lock number of 18. Analysis of the trim controls, lift, power, and blade flapping shows that for small positive collective pitch, trim can be maintained without excessive control input or flapping angles for both teetering and articulated rotors.

5000|$|In January of 1978, Doman {{returned}} to Connecticut as Chief Systems Engineer {{of the wind}} energy program at Hamilton Standard division of United Technologies. [...] Drawing on Doman’s extensive knowledge of rotor dynamics for both helicopters and wind turbines, United Technologies designed and built two of the largest wind turbines ever built {{up to that time}} (i.e. WTS-3, WTS-4). [...] Key features of those turbines, in addition to their size, were the use of only two blades (instead of three, which is more common) and the mounting of the blades on a <b>teeter</b> hinge <b>hub.</b> [...] This was analogous to Doman’s use of the gimbaled hub on his helicopters, which had 4-bladed rotors. [...] One turbine (WTS-4) was installed and successfully tested at Medicine Bow, Wyoming, and the other (WTS-3) in Sweden. [...] The WTS-4 wind turbine held the world power output record for over 20 years. [...] Throughout all the research studies and the testing of the actual turbines, there was rapid evolution in Doman’s thinking on the best design concepts. [...] However, when oil prices plummeted in the mid-1980s, United Technologies deemed the wind energy market to be uneconomical and halted the program.The Italian government took notice of Doman’s work, and in July of 1987, when Doman retired from United Technologies, he was hired by Aeritalia (the Italian manufacturer later known as Alenia) and moved to Rome to head Italy’s wind energy program. [...] In this program, Doman applied his latest thinking to a new machine, considerably improved over the WTS-4 and WTS-3 machines he had designed for installation in Wyoming and Sweden respectively. [...] Under Doman’s leadership a team of Italian engineers designed the Gamma 60 turbine. [...] The Gamma 60 was the world's first variable speed wind turbine with a teeter hinge. [...] Three Gamma 60 turbines were manufactured, and one was erected and successfully tested for 4 years on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. [...] There had been intentions to build many more Gamma 60 turbines, but Italian politics and a lack of urgency due to relatively low oil prices in the 1990s resulted in the program being cancelled.|$|R
