5|$|In Canada, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on football, much to the disappointment of Rex. By the time Rex was a teenager, Doris realized he and his brothers were too much to handle for a single mother trying to advance her career. She decided {{it was in the}} best interest of the brothers to send them to live with their father, who was the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings at the time. The reasons behind this were <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> trouble and to help them expand their knowledge of the game of football where it was more prevalent.|$|E
5|$|In a Storybrooke drugstore, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) meets a {{young girl}} named Ava (Karley Scott Collins). Henry is stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the {{siblings}} are living without parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out of a desire <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but the system would have to place the kids in two different homes in Boston. Determined to keep her promise not to separate them, Emma asks them for something {{that had belonged to}} their father. Ava provides her with a compass.|$|E
5|$|The {{towns of}} Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the hands of}} the Mexican army. Santa Anna was intent on {{executing}} members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco.|$|E

5|$|Of the British troops, {{approximately}} 3,300 {{formed into}} a shallow horseshoe formation that {{stretched across the}} width of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, to cover the left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to {{the width of the}} lines. As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2014 the Mavs {{handed the}} Suns {{one of three}} {{straight}} losses <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the playoffs, 101-98. The other losses from rival San Antonio and the Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
25|$|As an {{immediate}} {{consequence of the}} Robertson Panel recommendations, in February 1953, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the public eye.|$|E

50|$|Swimming {{at these}} falls was outlawed {{for a number}} of years {{following}} the pipeline disaster, of which damage is visible from popular cliffs. After various signs warning swimmers from entering, and fences meant <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> were destroyed, the city gave up regulating the area and removed all warnings and barriers.|$|R
25|$|Before retreating, Romanian troops {{burned down}} the oil wells at Ploiești {{along with the}} {{surrounding}} wheat fields so as <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the hands of the}} Central Powers. After Falkenhayen's Ninth Army cut off a portion of the Romanian Army, the remainder retreated to the Siret–Putna defensive line, one of the outermost defensive lines of Bucharest. There they rendevouzed with the Bucharest garrison and prepared to hold the line.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{around the}} mid-19th century, Wigan pit-brow girls scandalised Victorian society by wearing {{trousers}} {{for their work}} at the local coal mines. They wore skirts over their trousers and rolled them up to their waists <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way. Although pit-brow lasses worked above ground at the pit-head, their task of sorting and shovelling coal involved hard manual labour, so wearing the usual long skirts of the time would have greatly hindered their movements.|$|E
25|$|Rapping {{grew up in}} Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a young age, Rapping went to {{demonstrations and}} protests with his mother, Elayne Rapping, a {{community}} organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women’s movements. The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about social justice, and trying to change {{things in the world}} that aren't fair or right. Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired the lawyers who worked <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> jail. After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.|$|E
50|$|After {{tension between}} Russia and Britain in Europe {{ended with the}} June 1878 Congress of Berlin, Russia turned its {{attention}} to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, tried unsuccessfully <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.|$|R
50|$|Finishing {{second in}} the group behind the French, they earned {{a game against the}} South American {{powerhouse}} of Argentina. The Nati managed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> for almost 2 hours of football, a goal from Ángel Di María just two minutes from penalties sealed the fate of the Swiss. A heartbreaking end to their tournament, which was to be head coach Ottmar Hitzfeld's last ever game in charge, as he retired after the tournament.|$|R
50|$|In December 1947 and January 1948 {{the leaders}} of al-Shaykh Muwannis, Al-Mas'udiyya, Al-Jammasin al-Sharqi/Al-Jammasin al-Gharbi, and the mukhtars of 'Arab Abu Kishk and the two Ijlil-villages met with Haganah representatives in Petah Tikva. These villages wanted peace, and promised not to harbor any Arab Liberation Armies or local Arab Militia. They further promised that, in the case {{they were not able}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> alone, they were to call on Haganah for help.|$|R
25|$|Dysdera {{are one of}} the few known {{arthropods}} to {{hunt and}} prey on woodlice, which is their main food source. Their wide jaws and large fangs help to overcome woodlice hard armor like shells, as well as their ability to release chemicals <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> harm's way. These adaptations also enable them to prey on other common ground-dwelling invertebrates such as silverfish, earwigs, millipedes, and small burying beetles. Dysdera crocata is the only species from the Dysdera family to prey on other spiders. Dysdera spiders' huge, sharp fangs make them very powerful predators for their size, allowing them to dominate, and sometimes kill, competitors such as centipedes and other spiders.|$|E
25|$|By 1883 the {{membership}} of the SLP had fallen to an estimated 1500 members in just 30 Sections, a depressing atrophy which had led to the abandonment of the organization in April of that year even by its nominal head, Corresponding Secretary Philip Van Patten. Two individuals filled the role on a temporary basis {{for the rest of the}} year, culminating in the party's 4th National Convention in December 1883. There the 16 delegates, in an effort to forge links with non-party revolutionary socialists in an effort <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the camp of the rival anarchist movement, decided to steer the organization on a leftward course, curtaining the authority of the governing National Executive Committee and abolishing the centralizing post of Corresponding Secretary altogether in an effort to render the SLP a more decentralized organization amenable to the revolutionary left.|$|E
25|$|As the British advanced, {{the hostages}} in Akbar Khan's hands were treated less {{severely}} than previously, {{although they were}} moved to Bamian <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach of the British armies. Nott was urged to send cavalry to rescue the hostages, but he declined to do so (possibly {{as a result of}} a minor disaster on 29 August, when his cavalry had suffered heavy losses in a mishandled attack). Instead, Pollock sent Qizilbashi irregular cavalry under Richmond Shakespeare (his Military Secretary) and infantry under Brigadier Sale to rescue them. They found that when news of the Afghan defeats reached their guards, the hostages, including Sale's own wife, had negotiated their own release in return for payments. In all, thirty-five British officers, fifty-one private soldiers, twelve officers' wives and twenty-two children who had been taken hostage by Akbar Khan were released.|$|E
50|$|The {{group also}} finds crop {{circles in the}} nearby cornfield. When Iris {{suddenly}} disappears, they realize something is really wrong. During a blackout, the house is attacked by aliens. The group figures out the aliens are allergic to iron, which is why Joe had covered the house in it <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b> They attempt <b>to</b> fight the aliens off, but the house is eventually blown up with Layne, Macy, and Katrina the only survivors.|$|R

In the second, {{building}} pillars <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>'em</b> <b>out</b> is purely a Cypriote trick, unworthy of British bees. In the third, if you trust a Death's Head, he will trust you. Pillar-building shows lack of confidence. Our dear sister in grey says so." ...|$|R

25|$|The UPMC Sport Performance Complex was {{designed}} by the architectural firm L. D. Astorino Associates, Ltd. Development was managed by Oxford Development Company and construction of the complex by Mascaro Construction was initiated in June 1999 and completed on September 5, 2000 although the Panthers and Steelers moved into their respective portions of the facility in August. The complex was completed at a cost reported from $30 to $80 million and, as part of Pittsburgh’s urban river-front revitalization effort, {{is located on the}} former site of the Jones & Laughlin, and later LTV, steel mill in the SouthSide Works. The MRI room had to be encased in five layers of steel plate, plus a sixth layer of copper, in order to shield the MRI machines from the nearby CSX railroad tracks. Fill was also brought in to raise the level of the land where the practice fields are by nine feet in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the flood plain.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate army {{experienced}} a persistent shortage of horses and mules, and requisitioned them with dubious promissory notes given to local farmers and breeders. Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South. Both armies needed horses for cavalry and for artillery. Mules pulled the wagons. The supply was undermined by an unprecedented epidemic of glanders, a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians. After 1863 the invading Union forces had {{a policy of}} shooting all the local horses and mules they did not need - in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Confederate hands. The Confederate armies and farmers {{experienced a}} growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the Southern economy and the war effort. The South lost half of its 2.5 million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left. Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; they had a life expectancy of about seven months.|$|E
25|$|In 1535 {{the abbey}} was valued in the Valor Ecclesiasticus {{as having an}} income of £540, a very {{comfortable}} sum, which leads one to wonder {{how many of the}} abbey's financial problems were due to bad management. This figure meant that Vale Royal escaped being dissolved {{under the terms of the}} First Suppression Act, King Henry VIII's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot was John Hareware (elected 1535), who had previously been abbot of Hulton Abbey. He pursued a two-pronged policy of attempting to ensure the survival of his abbey and, should that fail, the security of himself and his brethren thereafter. He bribed courtiers, influential nobles and in particular chief minister Thomas Cromwell with money and property in the hope of gaining respite; he also leased out most of the abbey lands to friends and associates of the monastery <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> royal hands should the abbey fall (many of these leases had a clause which stated that they should be void if the abbey survived). He began to realise the other assets such as livestock and timber for cash.|$|E
30|$|We {{also tried}} to include some other {{explanatory}} variable potentially relevant in explaining productivity growth, such as tax wedge and unemployment benefits. Overall, they appear not significant, even if in some specifications without the EPL index and TUD they are significant. Indeed, {{this is not surprising}} given the high cross-country correlations among labour market institutions in OECD countries (OECD 2007; Bassanini et al. 2009). We therefore suspect that this result emerges because of multicollinearity and, for this reason, we preferred <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> from our estimates.|$|R
5000|$|Following the war Russia {{steadily}} advanced across Central Asia conquering Tashkent in 1865, Samarkand in 1868, Khokand in 1868 and Khiva in 1873. Britain suggested Afghanistan as {{a buffer}} state but following the June 1878 Congress of Berlin, Russia sent a diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, tried unsuccessfully <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> but Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too. The incidents resulted in the Second Anglo-Afghan War.|$|R
5000|$|This {{was almost}} entirely unexpected. The {{occupation}} {{had become a}} homeless camp unlike any other in recent Auckland history. The homeless had been [...] "radicalised", being introduced to self-governance methods and direct democracy as {{a new way of}} resolving community problems without reliance on force, intimidation, gangs or drugs. The Occupation of Auckland became a self-governing, self-funding, democratic community, living in an extremely difficult and challenging environment. Those who did not conform to its drug-free and alcohol-free policy were found and ejected, although it was a constant struggle <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
500|$|Shelters are {{generally}} maintained by local volunteers.

500|$|Several battlecruisers survived World War I {{only to be}} scuttled in its aftermath. The five German battlecruisers {{that survived}} World War I—, , , , —were interned at Scapa Flow pending the signing of a peace treaty between Germany and the Allies. The {{commander}} of the German ships in Scapa, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, thought the British were going to seize the ships immediately after the expiration of the Armistice, and preemptively ordered the ships be scuttled {{on the morning of}} 21 June 1919 <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> British hands.

2500|$|... "Okies" [...] {{were the}} 250,000 hard-luck {{migrants}} {{who fled the}} Dust Bowl and depression in Oklahoma and neighboring states in the 1930s {{in search of a}} better future. Many sought farm labor jobs advertised in the Central Valley. They were harshly disparaged at the time. Police were stationed at the Arizona line <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> and the state legislature passed a law <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> but it was overturned by the United States Supreme Court. Historian James Gregory has explored the long-term impact of the Okies on California society. Gregory finds that most came from urban backgrounds, and one in six had been a white-collar worker. He notes that in The Grapes of Wrath, novelist John Steinbeck saw the migrants becoming active agitators for unions and the New Deal, demanding higher wages and better housing conditions. Steinbeck did not foresee that most Okies would move into well-paid jobs in war industries in the 1940s. The children and grandchildren of the Okies seldom returned to Oklahoma. They did leave the farms and became concentrated in Southern California's cities and suburbs. Long-term cultural impacts include a commitment to evangelical Protestantism (especially the Pentecostals and the Southern Baptists), a love of country music, populist conservatism of the sort that boosted Reagan, and strong support for traditional moral and cultural values.|$|R
