5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, the 24th Infantry Division was the closest unit to <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> and in July, Red Cloud's company was among the first units into the country. The division was heavily engaged throughout July by North Korean troops as it attempted to stem their invasion of South Korea, and the 19th Infantry saw action in the Battle of Taejon, fighting at the Kum River before being forced out of Taejon.|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950.

Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
50|$|According to Robert E.

This view is supported by another professor, Brian Reynolds Myers of Dongseo University.|$|R

Brown died of his wounds despite the efforts of wingman Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1950 {{after the}} {{successful}} landing at Inchon by the US X Corps {{and the subsequent}} destruction of the Korean People's Army, the Korean War appeared to be all but over. United Nations (UN) forces advanced rapidly into North Korea {{with the intention of}} reuniting North and South Korea before the end of 1950. North Korea is divided through the center by the impassable Taebaek Mountains, which separated the UN forces into two groups. The US Eighth Army advanced north through the western coast of <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> while the Republic of Korea (ROK) I Corps and the US X Corps advanced north on the eastern coast.|$|E
50|$|During {{most of the}} Joseon Dynasty, Korea {{was divided}} into eight provinces (do; 도; 道).

The names of all eight provinces are still preserved today, {{in one form or}} another.|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{measurement and}} understanding of horizontal stress rates within the earth&# 39;s crust is important for providing fundamental insights into the mechanisms driving plate motion and intraplate tectonic activity. In this paper, the stress field within the crust of <b>the</b> South <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula</b> is obtained from observed displacement rates based on 4 -year continuous GPS observations (2000 - 2004). Results show that <b>the</b> South <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula</b> is under both compression and extensional stress regimes with maximum shear stress rate being in the mid {{part of the study}} area coinciding with the geologically defined Honam Shear Zone (HSZ) and relatively highly seismically active zone. In addition, the variation rate of strain energy density, an important index reflecting the intensity of crustal activity, is further derived, and its distribution indicates high earthquake potential in the mid-part as well as the north and northeast edges of the crust of <b>the</b> South <b>Korean</b> <b>peninsula...</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the battle ended, the United States had moved enough forces onto <b>the</b> <b>Korean</b> <b>Peninsula</b> to roughly equal the number of attacking North Korean forces. For its delaying actions in and around Taejon, the 24th Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.

Philippine Sea saw three tours to Korea during the war, receiving nine battle stars for her service.|$|E
