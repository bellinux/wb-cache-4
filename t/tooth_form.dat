5000|$|The {{affinity}} between Dorygnathus and Dimorphodon, {{assumed by}} early researchers, was {{largely based on}} a superficial resemblance in <b>tooth</b> <b>form.</b> Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1928 assigned the species to the Rhamphorhynchinae, which was confirmed by Peter Wellnhofer in 1978.

David Unwin in 2003 found that it belonged to the clade Rhamphorhynchinae, but analyses by Alexander Kellner resulted {{in a much more}} basal position, below Dimorphodon or Peteinosaurus. Padian, using a comparative method, in 2008 concluded that Dorygnathus was close to Scaphognathus and Rhamphorhynchus in the phylogenetic tree but also that these species were forming a series of successive off-shoots, meaning {{that they would not be}} united in a separate clade. This was again contradicted by the results of a cladistic study by Brian Andres in 2010 showing that Dorygnathus was part of a monophyletic Rhamphorhynchinae.

A broad phylogenetic analysis of crocodyliforms published the same year by Andrande et al. (2011), found the specimen to be the sister taxon of the clade formed by Anteophthalmosuchus hooleyi and the unnamed [...] "Dollo’s goniopholidid".

5000|$|The {{skull of}} plesiosaurs showed the [...] "euryapsid" [...] condition, lacking the lower {{temporal}} fenestrae, the openings {{at the lower}} rear sides. The upper temporal fenestrae formed large openings {{at the sides of}} the rear skull roof, the attachment for muscles closing the lower jaws. The eye sockets were large, in general pointing obliquely upwards; the pliosaurids had more sideways directed eyes. The eyes were supported by scleral rings, the form of which shows that they were relatively flat, an adaptation to diving. The anteriorly placed internal nostrils, the choanae, have palatal grooves to channel water, the flow of which would be maintained by hydrodynamic pressure over the posteriorly placed, in front of the eye sockets, external nares during swimming. According to one hypothesis, during its passage through the nasal ducts, the water would have been 'smelled' by olfactory epithelia. However, more to the rear a second pair of openings is present in the palate; a later hypothesis holds that these are the real choanae and the front pair in reality represented paired salt glands. The distance between the eye sockets and the nostrils was so limited because the nasal bones were strongly reduced, with many species even absent. The premaxillae directly touched the frontal bones, with the elasmosaurids even reaching backwards to the parietal bones. Often, the lacrimal bones were also lacking.The <b>tooth</b> <b>form</b> and number was very variable. Some forms had hundreds of needle-like teeth.

Many paleontologists think that lachrymal position is a poor taxonomic indicator as it is so difficult to determine in many specimens. However, Metopsaurids vary in so few taxonomic characteristics that it is unwise to abandon any that may be important and distinguishing. The genus was formerly named Buettneria by Case in 1922, but in 2007, B.D. Mueller realized that the name Buettneria had already been given to a bush cricket from the Republic of Congo by Simroth, so Mueller renamed the genus Koskinonodon. The name Koskinonodon represents the oldest generic synonym of the previous name, Buettneria Case, that was available. [...] There were some efforts trying to favor the amphibian Koskinonodon keeping the name Buettneria instead of the bush cricket, citing evidence that the amphibian name is much more well known and widely used. [...] Buettneria of Simroth has been nomen oblitum, meaning unused in the scientific community, almost continuously since it was given the name in 1888, with only a few instances of use. The fossil amphibian name Buettneria of Case, however, has been used over 75 times in scientific literature and books over the last 85 years.
