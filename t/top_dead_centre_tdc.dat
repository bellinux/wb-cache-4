50|$|This is {{different}} from the design of other oval style chainrings, which have the smaller effective chainring diameter coincide with the cranks being at <b>top</b> and bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC</b> and BDC), thus making the crank easier for the rider to turn through BDC for a constant chain tension. By having the chainring at its peak effective diameter with the cranks level, where the rider has maximum leverage over the crank during the power stroke, these designs are supposed to make better use of the rider's power output.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands from}} governments {{on the engine}} manufactures to lower the fuel consumption, lower the exhaust emissions and to reduce the noise have lead to an intensive research in the combustion process. Measurement of the combustion process inside the cylinder is only suitable in laboratory environment due {{to a number of}} limitations; the pressure transducer needed to measure the pressure is expensive, difficult to mount in the cylinder and has a limited lifetime that is much shorter than the engine's lifetime. Demands of on-board diagnostics where the combustion process is continuously monitored, on production vehicles have created a need for a method to indirectly measure the combustion process. The two main indirect methods are vibration measurement based reconstruction and crankshaft angular speed measurement reconstruction. The combustion process give rise to vibrations in the engine body that in the former method is measured with an accelerometer and the pressure can be reconstructed by using inverted transfer functions. The idea behind the latter method, the crankshaft angular speed reconstruction method, is that when one cylinder fires the produced torque is higher than the load torque and the crankshaft accelerates. As next cylinder goes into compression the total load torque increases and the crankshaft speed will decrease. This is repeated when the next cylinder fires and the produced crankshaft speed fluctuations will then contain information about the combustion and compression that caused it. In this thesis an indirect method to predict the maximum cylinder pressure is developed based on the crankshaft speed fluctuations combined with neural networks. The speed fluctuations were measured on a 6 -cylinder inline diesel engine at 9 speed-load-combinations. A two layer (one hidden and one output layer) feedforward neural network was trained with the backpropagation algorithm. The prediction accuracy for pmax was found to be better than ± 5 % at 95 %-confidence interval for the validation set. Another important parameter for the engine control and for optimising the fuel efficiency {{at the same time as}} the exhaust emissions are kept to a minimum, is the position of the pistons most upper position, <b>TDC</b> (<b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre).</b> The <b>TDC</b> position is normally measured mechanically with means that need access to the cylinders (the cylinder head has to be removed). This method is time consuming and therefore expensive and because of that not used on production engines. Several indirect methods to measure the TDC- positions have been suggested. Either based on measured cylinder pressures, that again need a pressure transducer mounted in the cylinder, or on the crankshaft speed fluctuations. An indirect method based on the speed fluctuations, that are measured when the starter motor rotates the engine with turned off ignition, is developed. From the measured crankshaft speed fluctuations the TDC-positions can be determined either by curve fitting or with neural networks. The TDC position determined by curve fitting has a bias error, due to the out-of-phase acceleration component in the crankshaft that are induced by the starter motor, but also caused by heat exchange between the compressed gas and the cylinder walls and gas. The results from the neural network were found to be better and the TDC-position for all 6 cylinders was determined within ± 0. 1 degree crank angle at 95 %-confidence interval.

50|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> of piston #1 is {{the point}} from which ignition system measurements are made and the firing order is determined. For example, ignition timing is normally specified as degrees of crankshaft rotation before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BTDC). A very few small and fast-burning engines require a spark just after <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (ATDC), such as the Nissan MA engine with hemispherical combustions, or hydrogen engines.|$|R
50|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, {{the dead}} centre is {{the position of}} a piston in which it is farthest from, or nearest to, the crankshaft. The former is known as <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC)</b> while the latter is known as bottom dead centre (BDC).|$|E
50|$|The spark {{ignition}} system of mechanically controlled gasoline internal combustion engines {{consist of a}} mechanical device, known as a distributor, that triggers and distributes ignition spark to each cylinder relative to piston position - in crankshaft degrees relative to <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC).</b>|$|E

50|$|John Allen and Sons used {{a number}} of engine types, the most common being a Villiers {{two-stroke}} with magneto ignition and rope start. The engines may fail to start because of ignition problems. The spark should occur when the piston is 3/16 of an inch before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC)</b> on all Villiers engines except for the Villiers Mk. 11C & 25C which should spark 5/32 of an inch before TDC.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an engine}} {{designed}} {{to use the}} squish effect, at <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC)</b> the piston crown comes very close, (typically less than 1 mm), to the cylinder head. The gases are suddenly [...] "squished" [...] out within the combustion chamber, creating turbulence which promotes thorough fuel/air mixing, a factor beneficial to efficient combustion.

50|$|As the {{ignition}} system is normally arranged to produce sparks before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{there is a}} risk of the engine kicking back during hand starting, to avoid this problem one of the two magnetos used in a typical aero engine ignition system is fitted with an 'impulse coupling', this spring-loaded device delays the spark until <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and also increases the rotational speed of the magneto to produce a stronger spark. When the engine fires, the impulse coupling no longer operates and the second magneto is switched on.|$|R
50|$|At <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> {{the piston}} gets {{very close to}} the flat portion of the {{cylinder}} head above, and the resultant turbulence produces excellent mixing of the fuel and air.|$|R
50|$|Diesel's {{original}} engine injected fuel {{with the}} assistance of compressed air, which atomized the fuel and forced it into the engine through a nozzle (a similar principle to an aerosol spray). The nozzle opening was closed by a pin valve lifted by the camshaft to initiate the fuel injection before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC).</b> This is called an air-blast injection. Driving the compressor used some power but the efficiency and net power output was more than any other combustion engine at that time.|$|E
50|$|As well as {{the high}} level of {{compression}} allowing combustion to take place without a separate ignition system, a high compression ratio greatly increases the engine's efficiency. Increasing the compression ratio in a spark-ignition engine where fuel and air are mixed before entry to the cylinder is limited by the need to prevent damaging pre-ignition. Since only air is compressed in a diesel engine, and fuel is not introduced into the cylinder until shortly before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC),</b> premature detonation is not a problem and compression ratios are much higher.|$|E
50|$|Good exhaust {{scavenging}} and controllable {{swirl of}} the inlet air/fuel mixture in single-sleeve designs. When the intake ports open, the air/fuel mixture {{can be made}} to enter tangentially to the cylinder. This helps scavenging when exhaust/inlet timing overlap is used and a wide speed range required, whereas poor poppet valve exhaust scavenging can dilute the fresh air/fuel mixture intake to a greater degree, being more speed dependent (relying principally on exhaust/inlet system resonant tuning to separate the two streams). Greater freedom of combustion chamber design (few constraints other than the spark plug positioning) means that fuel/air mixture swirl at <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC)</b> can also be more controlled, allowing improved ignition and flame travel which, as demonstrated by H. Ricardo, allows at least one extra unit of compression ratio before detonation, compared with the poppet valve engine.|$|E

50|$|Honda {{introduced}} several 200 cc motorcycles {{with similar}} engines but different body {{variations in the}} 1980s. The model introduced in South Africa and Pakistan {{was known as the}} CD200 RoadMaster. It had a twin cylinder 10-degree cylinder angle with a 360-degree crank shaft angle engine which meant the pistons moved together and reached <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC)</b> and bottom dead centre (BDC) at the same time. It was a detuned version of the Honda CD185 twin. The engine had the same bore as the CD185 but low compression pistons (8.8:1) with a bore and stroke of 53.0 x 44.0 mm, compared to 9.0:1 Compression and 53.0 x 41.0 mm for the CD185. The result was less power, a higher fuel economy and a lower top speed. The alternator system was also different from the CD185. Apart from this the models were much similar, using the same frames, suspension, wheels, tyres, and brakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{high oil}} {{consumption}} problem {{associated with the}} Knight double sleeve valve was fixed with the Burt-McCollum single sleeve valve, as perfected by Bristol. The models that had the complex 'junk head' installed a non-return purging valve on it; as liquids cannot be compressed, the presence {{of oil in the}} head space would result in problems. Mike Hewland, after adding an expander ring that worked in reserve, found the oil consumption of his single sleeve valve engines was half that of a similar poppet valve engine. 'In this engine all we really have to lubricate is the crankshaft, the rest seems to lubricate itself' (C&D, Jul 1974). At <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC),</b> the single-sleeve valve rotates in relation to the piston. This prevents boundary lubrication problems, as piston ring ridge wear at TDC and bottom dead centre (BDC) does not occur. The Bristol Hercules time between overhauls (TBO) life was rated at 3,000 hours, very good for an aircraft engine, but not so for automotive engines. Sleeve wear was located primarily in the upper part, inside the 'junk head'.|$|E
5000|$|There {{may be one}} or more pistons. Each piston {{is inside}} a cylinder, into which a gas is introduced, either already under {{pressure}} (e.g. steam engine), or heated inside the cylinder either by ignition of a fuel air mixture (internal combustion engine) or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder (Stirling engine). The hot gases expand, pushing the piston {{to the bottom of}} the cylinder. This position is also known as the Bottom Dead Center (BDC), or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder. The piston is returned to the cylinder top (<b>Top</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Centre)</b> (<b>TDC)</b> by a flywheel, the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or (in a double acting cylinder) by the same process acting on the other side of the piston. This is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder. In most types the expanded or [...] "exhausted" [...] gases are removed from the cylinder by this stroke. The exception is the Stirling engine, which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas. The stroke is simply the distance between the TDC and the BDC, or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction.|$|E
40|$|Recent papers [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5] have {{proposed}} two different systems to more efficiently and more rapidly burn the fuel in highly boosted, high compression ratio, directly injected internal combustion engines permitting multi-mode combustion operation. In a first system, a second direct injector is {{coupled with the}} standard Diesel direct injector and glow plug. The second direct injector introduces {{the most of the}} fuel while the Diesel direct injector only introduces a minimum amount of fuel to control the start of the combustion about <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> The fuel injected before the Diesel ignition injection burns premixed, the fuel injected after the Diesel ignition injection burns diffusion. This design permits combustion premixed gasoline-like if all the fuel is injected before the Diesel ignition injection, diffusion Diesel-like if all the fuel is injected after the Diesel ignition injection (as done in the Westport High Pressure Direct Injection concept [12]), and mixed gasoline/Diesel like injecting the fuel before and after the Diesel ignition injection. The premixed gasoline-like mode is actually a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) -like mode, where an amount of fuel smaller than the threshold value producing <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> auto ignition is then ignited at <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> by the Diesel ignition injection in a more robust, stable and repeatable operation unaffected by small changes in properties and composition of the fuel and air mixture...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{three-dimensional}} CFD simulations involving {{flow and}} combustion chemistry {{are used to}} study the effect of swirl induced by re-entrant piston bowl geometries on pollutant emissions from a single-cylinder diesel engine. The baseline engine configuration consists of a hemispherical piston bowl and an injector with finite sac volume. The first iteration involved using a torroidal, slightly re-entrant bowl geometry, and a sac-less injector. Pollutant emission measurements indicated a reduction in emissions with this modification. Simulations on both configurations were then conducted to understand {{the effect of the}} changes. The simulation results indicate that the selected piston bowl geometry could actually be reducing the in-cylinder swirl and turbulence and the emission reduction may be entirely due to the introduction of the sac-less injector. In-cylinder air motion was then studied in a number of combustion chamber geometries, and a geometry which produced the highest in-cylinder swirl and Turbulence Kinetic Energy (TKE) around the compression <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC)</b> was identified. The optimal nature of this re-entrant piston bowl geometry is confirmed by detailed combustion simulations and emission predictions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a fast-response {{numerical}} model {{was used to}} investigate potential disturbances to a free-piston engine generator (FPEG), i. e. engine cycle-to-cycle variations, misfire and immediate electric load change. During the engine operation, there could be one disturbance taking place or several disturbances take place simultaneously. By identifying different types of system disturbance with specific occurring times, the influence on the system was characterised. It was found that a step change of electric load would induce a corresponding <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (<b>TDC)</b> step change. Low variations on piston TDC are observed when cycle-to-cycle variations take place. When unsuccessful ignition occurs, the engine will stop after one oscillation cycle. Reducing the electric load after misfire would cause more oscillation cycles and require a restart of the engine. Technically feasible control variables were identified and coupled with a PI feedback controller design to minimise the impact of each kind of disturbance, a design {{which could be used}} in future FPE control system designs. The controller performance was seen to be satisfactory for the electric load step change, and the piston TDC was controlled to back to the set point in 0. 5 s...|$|E
