500|$|In late 2000, Kuntz {{decided not}} {{to return to his}} role as first-base coach and outfield instructor. Instead, {{he went back to his}} {{position}} as a roving instructor with the team, which allowed for more time to be spent with his family. At that time, Marlins players including Cliff Floyd and Mark Kotsay praised Kuntz for the amount of preparation that he put into his coaching. Kotsay gave Kuntz credit for the stolen bases he had accrued. Floyd said, [...] ""I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm telling you, he's meant everything. He <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> every pitcher we're facing. He keeps me going when I'm down. You don't get that too often in this game. You're expected just to be strong, handle everything. But it ain't that easy sometimes. He's a players' man. He loves us." ...|$|E

I don't like her particularly; je n'en suis pas folle. But she gives me information; she <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> America. Mamma has always tried to prevent my knowing {{anything}} about it, and I am all the more curious. And then Miss Ruck is very fresh." ...|$|E

6000|$|Aurora {{watched her}} friend {{while the latter}} devoted herself to her ice. “You wonder, no doubt, why I should care for her at all. So does mamma; elle s’y perd.

"Everybody <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> how one poor dear soul, {{a charming}} lady {{who used to}} take in washing or salt gold-mines or something, and she came here {{a little while ago}} with billions and billions of dollars, and tried to buy her way in by {{shopping}} for all the charities in town, and apparently she's just as out of it here as she would be in London. You and I aren't exclusive like that, are we!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He sat not {{far from}} {{opposite}} to her at table, and could sometimes hear what she said in answer to Sir Hugo, who was at his liveliest in conversation with her; but though he looked toward her {{with the intention of}} bowing, she gave him no opportunity of doing so for some time. At last Sir Hugo, who might have imagined that they had already spoken to each other, said, [...] "Deronda, you will like to hear what Mrs. Grandcourt <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> your favorite Klesmer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] she said, [...] "be {{quiet and}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the world; <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> {{everything}} that's ever happened, and I'll <b>tell</b> you--let <b>me</b> see, what can I tell you?--I'll {{tell you about}} Miss Montgomerie and the river party.

6000|$|... "That is true. Randall never notices what a {{woman has}} on. I {{like a man who}} does notice--and <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it. I like a man who likes me better in silk than in drugget. I will wear this rosebud silk when I'm married, and it will be {{supposed}} to last me {{the rest of my life}} and be worn on all state occasions, and in time become an heirloom like Aunt Matilda's hideous blue satin.

6000|$|... "I am {{too busy}} to go, but my cousin Velvetback often comes down and <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the splendid life he leads up there, where no foot ever treads on him, no hand ever breaks his webs, and {{everything}} is so still and bright that he always is {{in a hurry to}} get home again.

6000|$|... "Margaret Devereux {{was one of}} {{the loveliest}} creatures I ever saw, Harry. What on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could understand. She could have married anybody she chose. Carlington was mad after her. She was romantic, though. All the women of that family were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad! the women were wonderful. Carlington went on his knees to her. Told me so himself. She laughed at him, and there wasn't a girl in London at the time who wasn't after him. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this humbug your father <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Dartmoor wanting to marry an American? Ain't English girls good enough for him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now that Ralph was {{in trouble}} she {{addressed}} him {{in a tone of}} larger allowance and told him that she was much indebted to him for having made her acquainted with Mr. Bantling. [...] "He has told me just the things I want to know," [...] she said; [...] "all the society items and all about the royal family. I can't make out that what he <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the royal family is much to their credit; but he says that's only my peculiar way of looking at it. Well, all I want is that he should give me the facts; I can put them together quick enough, once I've got them." [...] And she added that Mr. Bantling had been so good as to promise to come and take her out that afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you believe}} him, sir; yes, it is. He tells me of {{everything}} he sees {{down at his}} work. You would be surprised what a quantity he gets together for me every day. He looks into the carriages, and tells me how the ladies are dressed--so that I know all the fashions! He looks into the carriages, and tells me what pairs of lovers he sees, and what new- married couples on their wedding trip--so that I know all about that! He collects chance newspapers and books--so that I have plenty to read! He <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the sick people who are travelling {{to try to get}} better--so that I know all about them! In short, as I began by saying, he tells me everything he sees and makes out down at his work, and you can't think what a quantity he does see and make out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, now, for my part," [...] said Marianne, [...] "I confess I like parties: they amuse me. I {{come home}} feeling kinder and better to people, {{just for the}} little I see of them when they are all dressed up and in good humor with themselves. To be sure we don't say {{anything}} very profound,--I don't think the {{most of us have}} anything profound to say; but I ask Mrs. Brown where she buys her lace, and she tells me how she washes it, and somebody else <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> her baby, and promises me a new sack-pattern. Then I like to see the pretty, nice young girls flirting with the nice young men; and I like to be dressed up a little myself, even if my finery is all old and many times made over. It does me good to be rubbed up and brightened." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{was the way}} {{in which}} John Eames avenged himself. Sir Raffle turned his face upon his private secretary, and his face was very black. Johnny bore the gaze without {{dropping}} an eyelid. [...] "I'm not going to stand it, and he may as well know that at once," [...] Johnny said to one of his friends in the office afterwards. [...] "If he ever wants any thing really done, I'll do it;--though it should take me twelve hours at a stretch. But I'm not going to pretend to believe all the lies he <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If that is {{to be part of the}} private secretary's business, he had better get somebody else." [...] But now Sir Raffle was very angry, and his countenance was full of wrath as he looked down upon his subordinate minister. [...] "If I had come here, Mr. Eames, and had found you absent, I should have been very much annoyed, very much annoyed indeed, after having written as I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then I {{sets down}} {{and takes off}} a shoe and rubs me foot that is frosted, and the Imperor <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it. It seems that since I passed that way before, the Imperor had mandamused the Impress wid a divorce suit, and Misses Poppæa, a cilibrated lady, was ingaged, widout riferences, as {{housekeeper}} at the palace. 'All in one day,' says the Imperor, 'she puts up new lace windy-curtains in the palace and joins the anti-tobacco society, and whin I feels the need of a smoke I must be after sneakin' out to these piles of lumber in the dark.' So {{there in the dark}} me and the Imperor sat, and I told him of me travels. And when they say the Imperor was an incindiary, they lie. 'Twas that night the fire started that burnt the city. 'Tis my opinion that it began from a stump of segar that he threw down among the boxes. And 'tis a lie that he fiddled. He did all he could for six days to stop it, sir." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2014 {{interview}} with Ireland’s Newstalk radio, Zara further attempted {{to clarify the}} controversy. It’s possible to create art from joy, he said, but it’s art created from adversity that is most often the art worth paying attention to: [...] "You can have that impulse to create whether you’ve been through a tragedy or not, obviously. But to me, it's like, if you don't struggle to create your art in some way, why do I care <b>about</b> it? ...

I mean, that’s what life is." ...|$|R
