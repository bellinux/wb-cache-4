Thiraipadam.com wrote:"Diwaan boasts {{of one of the}} most shoddy screenplays and atrocious editing in recent times. The movie has a lot of things going on, which is usually a good thing since it contributes to the pace of the movie.

5000|$|While not {{reviewed}} by critics in mainstream media, Air Collision {{did have a}} brief theatrical run and did garner some interest from internet bloggers and other film critics. Michael Allen in 28dayslateranalysis.com said, [...] "'Air Collision' {{is not really a}} mockbuster, as director Liz Adams experiments with the disaster genre. The film is pure fantasy. The President of the United States' life is in danger, satellites fall from the sky and special agents fly through the air. This is ridiculous! But, maybe that is the magic that drives The Asylum production machine. 'Air Collision' requires that viewers have fertile imaginations as well. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many strange going-ons to see this film as believable on any level. And, perhaps, therein lies the charm of The Asylum's latest." ...|$|E

[...] However, Brett Todd scored the 2012 Windows version 4 out of 10, criticized the controls, the repetition of tracks, {{the lack of any}} sense of speed and the necessity for grinding. He concluded [...] "Arcade racers generally need to have an on-the-edge atmosphere where death can come at any moment via bullet or screwing up a turn. This new take on Death Rally, however, is more like riding with Miss Daisy, a genteel, distant driver as intense as a late-night cup of chamomile tea. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many flaws here, with the flimsy controls, dreary tracks, and eternal grinding, for even the most desperate arcade gearhead to get anything out of this game." ...|$|E
5000|$|Zuckerman has {{appeared}} before numerous FDA advisory committees to testify {{as a medical}} expert {{on a variety of}} drugs and devices. On December 12, 2013, Zuckerman testified regarding the type-2 diabetes drug dapagliflozin (Farxiga), saying: [...] "My concern about this drug is that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many unanswered questions - and those unanswered questions are frightening ones. That was true when the FDA rejected this application for approval 2 years ago, and it is still true today." [...] She cited studies that highlighted the risks that the drug poses, as well as methodological concerns such as a lack of diversity in clinical trials.On November 14, 2012, Zuckerman made a statement at a Capitol Hill press conference about the VALID Compounding Act. She stated that loopholes in the FDA law, including compounding pharmacies, have allowed hundreds of people to get sick with meningitis and several to die. The VALID Compounding Act is designed to close the loopholes that are so harmful to patients.|$|E
5000|$|PopMatters' Eric Brown, on {{the other}} hand, gave the album a more mixed review, writing [...] "Beirut too often moves away from its world-folk origins into a more generic sound, one that has {{more in common with}} an Apple {{commercial}} than their breakthrough album. It's not necessarily a bad move — the songs are all well-composed and technically challenging — but The Rip Tide lacks an emotional core, or at the very least, an interesting hook in lieu of something more substantial." [...] Brown continued: [...] "I have to think that as an EP, The Rip Tide would be a rousing success. But as it is, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many bland, uninspiring tracks that drag down the whole experience." [...] Benjamin Boles of NOW was also less receptive to the album's sound, writing [...] "Unfortunately, it all feels a bit too manicured and restrained. As easy as it is to hit repeat when the disc ends, trying to remember standout moments is another story. It’s a solid album, but too conservative to make many converts." ...|$|E

This consisted of geometric symbols that identified the parent carrier, not the air group. As <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many carriers and the symbols were hard to remember or to describe over the radio, a single or double letter system was introduced in July 1945.

50|$|The {{rolltop desk}} was the {{mainstay}} of the small or medium-sized office {{at the end of}} the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. It gradually fell out of favor with the introduction of the steel desk and the coming of greater quantities of correspondence and other documents, which made the small stacked drawers and small shelves obsolete. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many letters to bother folding them again and placing them in the proper slot and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> too little time to open and close all the small drawers to look for things.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} no fail {{policy in}} Thailand and often in most schools a {{multiple}} choice marking. This can be for many reasons, such as <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many students in the classroom, and so teachers feel {{no choice but to}} employ multiple choice marking. But even in private schools this can be the case. Few students are taught to read and write on any great level. Thai also as a language does not have any or many spaces or fullstops, and so for students to use them is even a challenge. This added to the feeling that students should not be embarrassed or made to feel bad in the classroom means that many do not understand the importance of trying, getting it wrong and learning from their mistakes. Parents often castigate foreign teachers when their children fare badly and blame the teacher, and so there is little incentive to try and for them to learn complex reading and writing. Instead most of the emphasis is on grammar which few understand or appreciate the importance of it. Because Thai is so different, they feel Thai is easier and rarely do they speak English outside of their lesson.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{refer to}} their style as [...] "Alternative Malayali rock". John commented on their mixture of Malayalam lyrics and rock music, [...] "This {{was a major}} {{challenge}} to us as {{that would not be}} liked by the younger generation {{when it came to the}} language and the old when it came to rock music." [...] Vijayan said, [...] "When we toured worldwide to audiences who knew no Malayalam but loved us, I realised that language wasn't what stopped Malayalam music from becoming mainstream, it was a matter of presenting it right." [...] On alternative rock, Vijayan commented, [...] "...Unlike glam rock, hard rock or heavy metal, it does not begin with an intro, followed by the song, the chorus, the guitar solo and the likes. Avial swears by the mantra of alternative rock which allows us the freedom to gel rustic Malayalam with funky rock." [...] Their influences vary from classic rock band Led Zeppelin to alternative rock band Incubus. John said, [...] "Over the years, we've been listening to everything from the 70s, 80s and 90s, and our music is a mix of everything we've ever heard. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many influences to name." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tech-savvy site Geek.com {{awarded the}} film a decent review. Critic Will Greenwald commented that [...] "It isn't a must-watch, and doesn't {{stand out as}} memorable or terrible, but it's enjoyable enough to at least feel like Hitman... The premise feels like The Professional... And, as stupid as that all sounds, it's {{actually}} very loosely {{the plot of the}} first Hitman game, Hitman: Codename 47... the first hour the film feels like a bizarre take on The Terminator. The action is frantic and creative. Gunplay feels a bit like Equilibrium, which means it's eye-catching, brutal, and incredibly unrealistic... and it's entertaining despite not feeling as genuine and harsh as the action in Dredd or John Wick... I liked Hitman: Agent 47, but it's not a very good movie. It's uneven and weird, and while it's much more enjoyable than the previous Hitman film, it doesn't leave a very lasting impression. It's not Hitman boring and it's not Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li bad or faithless to the source material, but it isn't consistently as strong as it could have been with a bit more logic in the writing and much less reliance on CG and film speed trickery to make the fights seem flashier (and faker). <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many little things that feel off for the big, eye-catching things to really stay with you." ...|$|E

So {{much of the}} episode felt rushed, as we hurried from one {{character}} to the next, and from one quick burst of story to the next, and if given room to breathe, the plot {{might have been better}} served.

[...] She also commented, [...] "Ballad really challenges my vocals' durability because it requires to take long breath perform it.

5000|$|Ben Witherington {{sees the}} concept of {{election}} being inter-connected with the concepts of predestination and perseverance. Ones view of election will affect, if not determine, how one views the saints perseverance. If one believes that God chose some individuals before {{the foundation of the}} world to be saved, then it necessarily follows that one has to believe that apostasy is impossible for a genuine Christian person, someone who is truly one of the elect. But <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many warnings in the New Testament that warn Christians about falling prey to temptation, about making shipwreck of their faith, about grieving or quenching the Holy Spirit in their lives, and about committing apostasy or the unforgivable sin.

For Paul, election is a corporate thing. It was in ethnic Israel, but now it is in union with Christ.
