5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the player {{can choose to}} talk to demons encountered on the field, and attempt to recruit them to their party; {{the success of this}} depends on the player's level, with more powerful demons only being recruitable if the player's level is sufficiently high. In Ronde, the player does not initiate these conversations themselves, however: instead, defeated demons sometimes choose to talk to the player, and sometimes decide to join their party. Like in other Megami Tensei games, the player can fuse multiple allied demons with each other, thereby creating more powerful demons. In Ronde, the player can form contracts with demons, allowing human characters to use demon magic. Demons are fueled by magnetite, so the player needs to manage the supply of this, and thus cannot have too many allied demons on the field at once or take too long to finish a battle. By clearing battles, the player can advance to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>chapter.</b> The games' stories are affected by player choices, and have multiple endings.|$|E

The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous Hungarian State Opera House, the St. Stephen's Basilica and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.|$|E

The player then moves on to wherever that mission takes place, proceeding through nine stages, to the eighth stage which will contain the chapter boss.

25|$|Back when Tokyo Babylon started serialization, Clamp {{was also}} writing RG Veda on the monthly {{magazine}} Wings. While {{the authors found}} this complicated, the series' quarterly publication of sixty pages resulted in the authors making several changes; The length of each chapter made the authors write a darker story {{in contrast to the}} original plans for a soft one. Based on their own experience in Tokyo, Clamp incorporated dark social themes making the series realistic despite its focus on occultism. Ohkawa believes their young age when writing the manga also influenced most of the series' negative messages. Although when the series started the ending was already planned, {{it was not until the}} Tokyo Tower chapter that Clamp set the general atmosphere with the pilot being perceived as a comedy. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>chapter</b> involving Subaru's past meeting with a man later revealed as Seishirō then set the events from the series' future.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>chapter</b> {{after the}} 1993 playoff {{run for the}} Kings was tough for Kings fans, having a {{sluggish}} start on 1993–94 season to cost them a playoff berth, the first absence from the postseason since 1986. At the same time, McNall defaulted on a loan from Bank of America, who threatened to force the Kings into bankruptcy unless he sold the team. McNall sold the team to IDB Communications founder Jeffrey Sudikoff and former Madison Square Garden president Joseph Cohen {{in the wake of}} a federal investigation into his financial practices. It later emerged that McNall's free-spending ways put the Kings in serious financial trouble. At one point, Cohen and Sudikoff were even unable to meet player payroll, and were ultimately forced into bankruptcy in 1995. They were forced to trade many of their stronger players, and the middling results led to Gretzky's departure in 1996 as he requested a trade to a legitimate Stanley Cup contender, and went to the St. Louis Blues.|$|E

This process can also take place automatically by checking the customer configuration in the configuration management system. More information on this system is provided in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>chapter.</b> When it is clear what product the customer needs and the possible modifications to this product it is necessary to determine if the customer current configuration suits the new product. The current configuration is compared to the constraints of the new product. This can also be done automatically by the configuration management system. When the configuration of the customer appears to be insufficient the customer is informed about this. For example the vendor can make clear to the customer that it will need an external product for this new product to run properly. Besides this the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system of the vendor is updated. There is more information about this in the chapter about CRM.|$|E
