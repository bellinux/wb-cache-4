5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting for judicial independence—specifically the right of judges to live outside <b>their</b> <b>districts.</b> In 1881 the BC Supreme Court, including Crease, ruled in the Thrasher case that the province's attempts to regulate judges were unconstitutional. This decision was overturned two years later by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
5|$|During the August 2009 summer congressional recess, {{many members}} {{went back to}} <b>their</b> <b>districts</b> and held town hall {{meetings}} on the proposals. The nascent Tea Party movement organized protests and many conservative groups and individuals attended the meetings to oppose the proposed reforms. Many threats were made against members of Congress {{over the course of}} the debate.|$|E
5|$|In the election, held on September 10, 2013, both Morse and Giron were {{recalled}} by {{the voters}} of <b>their</b> <b>districts</b> and replaced with Republicans George Rivera and Bernie Herpin, respectively. It {{was the first time}} a state legislator in Colorado had been recalled. In the 2014 Senate elections 13 months later, both Rivera and Herpin were defeated by their Democratic opponents.|$|E

5|$|The General Assembly is {{empowered}} {{to regulate the}} state's judiciary system by setting {{the size of the}} courts and the bounds of <b>their</b> <b>districts.</b> The body also has the authority to monitor the activities of the executive branch of the state government, has limited power to regulate the county governments within the state, and has sole power to initiate the process to amend the state constitution.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} November, {{the rebels}} gained control of the towns of Harim and Jisr al-Shughur and the villages of <b>their</b> <b>districts.</b> They then {{prepared}} for offensives to capture the towns and districts of Idlib and Maarrat al-Nu'man. Other major scenes of fighting occurred at Isqat, Jisr al-Hadid, Kafr Takharim, Darkush, Talkalakh and the areas of al-Qusayr and Antioch. At around the same time, Kurdish tribal forces countered the French at Viranşehir, east of Aleppo, and Bedouin forces commanded by ex-Ottoman officer Ramadan al-Shallash, who declared his support for Hananu, began guerrilla actions against French forces in the general vicinity of Raqqa.|$|E
5|$|District councils are chiefly {{responsible}} for waste management and construction projects within their respective districts. They each maintain their own budgets, although the metropolitan mayor reserves {{the right to}} review district decisions. One-fifth of all district council members, including the district mayors, also represent <b>their</b> <b>districts</b> in the Municipal Council. All members of the district councils and the Municipal Council, including the metropolitan mayor, are elected to five-year terms. Representing the Justice and Development Party, Kadir Topbaş has been Mayor of Istanbul since March 2004.|$|E

5|$|The 47 districts {{from which}} Senators are elected are apportioned every ten {{years on the}} basis of population. Maryland's {{constitution}} explicitly defines the process for the drawing of these districts, requiring that the Governor make a recommendation of a new electoral map and submit it for legislative approval. As of 2005, there were approximately 112,000 people in each district. Each Senate district also elects three Delegates, and incumbent Senators and Delegates will often run jointly as members of incumbent slates in <b>their</b> <b>districts.</b> It is rare, however, for an incumbent to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|The PJ won the 2001 midterm {{election}} by 40% to 24%, {{giving it a}} majority in both chambers of the Congress. However, the abstention rate and several forms of protest votes combined reached 41%, the highest in Argentine history, {{as a consequence of}} the popular discontent with the two main parties. Even the few candidates of the Alliance who won at <b>their</b> <b>districts,</b> such as the radical Rodolfo Terragno in Buenos Aires, did so with political platforms against De la Rúa's administration.|$|E
5|$|The Ridwan-Farrukh-Turabay {{alliance}} {{treated the}} territories of Palestine and, at times, Transjordan, as hereditary fiefdoms. During troublesome periods, the three families would unite their forces to confront challenges from rebels or local rivals. The military relationship between them originated with {{the protection of}} the annual hajj caravan. When a particular governor was assigned the role of amir al-hajj, it would require him to depart from his sanjak for extended time periods. In order to protect <b>their</b> <b>districts</b> from Bedouin raids, tax evasion and personal property damage, departing governors normally entrusted their authority with the rulers of the neighboring sanjak. For example, in 1589, Ridwan Pasha requested Assaf ibn Turabay to temporarily replace him as governor of Damascus, beginning a tradition that lasted well into the 17th century.|$|E
5000|$|Skagit County's {{government}} {{is headed by}} three commissioners, in the system {{laid out in the}} state constitution for all counties without charters. Commissioners are [...] "nominated" [...] in the primary by <b>their</b> <b>district,</b> but then are elected in the general by a county-wide vote. Commissioners are therefore said to represent the entire county, and not just <b>their</b> <b>district.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{perfectly}} apportioned {{governing body}} does not ensure good representation; voters {{who did not}} vote for <b>their</b> <b>district's</b> winner might have no representative who is disposed to voice their opinion in the governing body. Conversely, a representative in the governing body may voice the opinions held by a voter who is not actually their constituent, though representatives usually seek to serve their own constituents first and will only voice the interests of an outside group of voters if it pertains to <b>their</b> <b>district</b> as well or is of national importance. In any case, the representative does not technically represent the voter as the elected official from <b>their</b> <b>district.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{center of}} the {{political}} power of the Tang was the capital city of Chang'an (modern Xi'an), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, acrobatic stunts, poetry, paintings, and dramatic theater performances. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese prefectural government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in <b>their</b> <b>districts,</b> Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of municipal construction to build every visiting official his own private mansion in the capital.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{controversy}} of Sampson's administration {{was over the}} selection of the state's highway commissioner. The Highway Department employed over ten thousand people and spent nearly 45% of the state's budget. Legislators' votes could often be bought with promises of new road construction in <b>their</b> <b>districts.</b> Thus, the department became a primary vehicle for dispensing patronage to political supporters. Sampson's predecessor, Governor Fields, had chosen retired congressman and Democratic political boss Ben Johnson to head the department, and Sampson had agreed to retain him in exchange for his support against Beckham. However, Sampson felt that such a powerful position could not be left {{in the hands of a}} Democrat, and he removed Johnson from office in December 1929.|$|E
5|$|Van Roey {{made many}} of the church's {{resources}} available for hiding Jews, but was prevented from publicly condemning {{the treatment of the}} Jews by his peers, who feared a Nazi repression of the Church. German attempts to involve the Belgian authorities and local government in its implementation began to arouse protest from 1942. The Committee of Secretary-Generals, a panel of Belgian senior civil servants tasked with implementing German demands, refused from the outset to enforce anti-Jewish legislation. In June 1942, a conference of the 19 mayors of the Greater Brussels region refused to allow its officials to distribute yellow badges to Jews in <b>their</b> <b>districts.</b> At great personal risk, the mayors, led by Joseph Van De Meulebroeck, sent a letter protesting the decree to the German authorities on 5 June. The refusal of Brussels' council, and later that of the city of Liège, to distribute badges allowed many Jews to go into hiding before the deportations began.|$|E

25|$|Some {{changes were}} unpopular, and a {{provision}} of the 1972 act allowed district councils to change the names of <b>their</b> <b>districts.</b> Within Humberside, the Borough of Beverley was changed to East Yorkshire Borough of Bevereley and North Wolds district was changed to East Yorkshire in 1981, reflecting their historic association with Yorkshire.|$|E
