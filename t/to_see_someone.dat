25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

500|$|With {{the episode}} {{exploring}} the new clairvoyant abilities of Negga's Raina, executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen noted {{the irony of}} this, as Raina {{had spent much of}} her time on the series obsessed with another character who she believed was clairvoyant. On the death of his character in the episode, Kassianides said, [...] "I'm sad to see him go, [...] I'm happy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> like that get their comeuppance". Noting that the character was originally intended to be killed off in [...] "A Hen in the Wolf House", Kassianides felt that the way Bakshi and his relationships had developed throughout the season was [...] "fantastic" [...] and made the character's final sacrifice a much more [...] "beautiful" [...] death.|$|E

It's not just being Declan at the studio, I get 'Declan' on the street, at restaurants, everywhere. Declan is me so to hand it over is difficult." [...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled {{that a lot of people}} think that – I can understand why fans would feel that way because I starred as Declan for the past three years and that's all anyone knows." ...|$|E

[...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other.

500|$|An initial {{pilot of}} the show was ordered in 2003 by ITV, from {{production}} company FremantleMedia, and was commissioned by Claudia Rosencrantz, who was the controller of entertainment at ITV at the time. It was presented by Brian Conley, but was not broadcast; a series was not produced. Rosencrantz spoke of the pilot in 2011, [...] "I didn't believe people would like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> win a vast sum of money, with no skills at all involved. Second, gambling is not a spectator sport, you get an adrenaline rush from participating in it." [...] Richard Holloway, who worked with FremantleMedia {{at the time of}} producing the pilot, said, [...] "It was a novel idea, you could win a million pounds eventually, I was surprised it didn't go to series." [...] Rosencrantz left ITV in 2006, {{and there has been a}} significant turnover in staff since the pilot was originally put together.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a largely}} {{successful}} Australian {{tour in the}} spring, Hoppus and DeLonge presented an ultimatum: quit drinking or go to an in-patient rehab. Raynor agreed to both and informed the band of his decision after taking the weekend to mull options. According to Raynor, he was fired through a phone call despite his agreement to rehab. Despite this, he felt no malice toward his former bandmates and later conceded they were [...] "right" [...] to fire him. The band would minimize {{the impact of the}} situation in future interviews and remained vague regarding his departure. Initial news reports explained that Raynor had [...] "reportedly returned to school." [...] DeLonge would later explain the drinking problem that led to his expulsion: [...] "One show he dropped his sticks 10 times.

500|$|U2's {{decision}} to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason.

It's easy {{to do that when}} you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't really something that you worry about, but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> do that." [...] The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: [...] "This vindicates our view that giving away hundreds of millions of albums simply devalues music and runs the risk of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy." ...|$|E

In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential he characterised Adam as [...] "a little bit ambitious and [...] "a little bit too clever for his own good." [...] Langley added that the character ends up [...] "on {{the wrong side of the}} tracks" [...] because he likes [...] "meddling with things" [...] and that [...] "him thinking he's a genius gets him into bother". Explaining Adam's downfall, Davies states that he [...] "doesn't realize he's out for his own good until he's put in a situation of temptation, where knowledge, information and power are put in front of him."

Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career [...] "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now {{you see a lot of}} artists doing that and finding success," [...] her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was [...] "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which [...] "really stood out" [...] at its time, was being replicated.|$|E

Ali adopted the latter practice from [...] "Gorgeous" [...] George Wagner, a professional wrestling champion who drew thousands of fans to his matches as [...] "the man you love to hate".
