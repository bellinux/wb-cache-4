40|$|Geomagnetic field time {{variations}} can be analysed {{by means}} of fractal and chaotic techniques. <b>This</b> new <b>kind</b> of analysis can definitely help in studying geophysical signals even when their chaotic and/or fractal aspects are not so obvious.

5|$|In <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of system, the {{developers}} set {{the properties of}} the camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views will not change dynamically, so the same place will always be shown under the same set of views. An early example of <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of camera system can be seen in Alone in the Dark. While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E
5|$|Marilena from P7 also {{attracted}} the critics' attention {{due to its}} use of explicit verbal and visual content. Cristian Nemescu said that <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of scenes were a necessarily element for the realism of the movie, declaring himself a partisan of explicit content.|$|E
5|$|Several {{historical}} figures may {{have died from}} A.phalloides poisoning (or other similar, toxic Amanita species). These were either accidental poisonings or assassination plots.

5|$|A {{physical}} USB device may {{consist of}} several logical sub-devices that {{are referred to}} as device functions. A single device may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video device function) with a built-in microphone (audio device function). <b>This</b> <b>kind</b> of device is called a composite device. An alternative to this is compound device, in which the host assigns each logical device a distinctive address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{anticyclonic}} multivortex satellite tornado also formed {{southeast of}} the primary tornado at approximately 6:28pmCDT (2328UTC), and remained {{on the ground for}} 15 minutes before lifting at 6:43 (2343UTC). Such companion tornadoes tend to be observed with especially large and intense tornadoes, although this was the first documented multiple-vortex anticyclonic tornado of <b>this</b> <b>kind.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the Great Vowel Shift in English, which {{is the reason that}} the {{spelling}} of English vowels do not correspond well to their current pronunciation. This is because the vowel shift brought the already established orthography out of synchronization with pronunciation. Another source of sound change is the erosion of words as pronunciation gradually becomes increasingly indistinct and shortens words, leaving out syllables or sounds. <b>This</b> <b>kind</b> of change caused Latin mea domina to eventually become the French madame and American English ma'am.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was fond}} of the music of Northumberland, and of the Northumbrian smallpipes in particular.

40|$|At present, {{optical fibre}} {{are used for}} local area {{networks}} interconnection. As fibre based LANs and sensor networks share the same topology, {{it is possible to}} hybridize data networks with <b>this</b> <b>kinds</b> of sensor networks. In this paper a passive optical fibre network is presented where each terminal represents an electronic sensor attached to an optical coupler and whose measurement is introduced to the fiber bus by LEDs at the first window...|$|R
5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. <b>This</b> <b>kind</b> of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Harmonic {{manipulations}} of <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> {{create a sense}} of standstill, of arrest of time and motion; they often suggest a feeling of detachment, of entering a new dimension, independent of the preceding material, such as the realm of dreams and memories (if the preceding material is conceived as reality); some tonally detached passages may convey a feeling of an alienated, inhospitable environment, an exile (if the preceding material is conceived as home).|$|E
