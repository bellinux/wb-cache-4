The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the development of purebred and crossbred embryos through the time lapse of their development. Material and methods: The embryos were produced in vitro from bovine slaughterhouse oocytes and frozen thawed semen. Purebred Embryos (PE) were produced from Holstein (H) and Montbeliard (M) oocytes inseminated with Holstein (H) or Montbeliard (M) semen (PE = <b>HH</b> and <b>MM</b> embryos). Crossbred Embryos (CE) were produced from Holstein (H) and Montbeliard (M) oocytes inseminated with Montbeliard (M) or Holstein (H) semen (CE = HM and MH embryos). Semen of 3 bulls of each breed were used. We performed four sessions of 32 embryos (8 <b>HH,</b> 8 <b>MM,</b> 8 HM, 8 MH) incubated individually in microwells placed under a microcamera (PrimovisionTM). Pictures were taken every 15 minutes until 192 h of development. The media and atmospheric conditions were previously described (Grimard et al., 2013). Development rates and the timing of reaching the 2, 4, 8 cells, morula and blastocyst stages were registered. Development rates of CE and PE groups were compared using the X 2 test. Fixed effects of oocyte and semen breed and crossbreeding on embryo kinetic parameters were tested by multivariate analysis taking into account the random effect of IVF session. Results and conclusion: 128 embryos were produced. The 2 cells development rate was significantly lower in the CE than in the PE group. No differences were observed for 4, 8 cells, morula and blastocyst rates (78, 1 vs 92, 2 %; 67, 2 vs 75 %; 53, 1 vs 46, 9 %; 45, 3 vs 40, 6 %; 31, 3 vs 35, 9 %, CE vs PE, respectively, p> 0, 05). The timing of development was similar in both groups (p> 0, 05). On average, CE and PE groups reached 2, 4, 8 cells, morula and blastocyst stages at 31, 8 h + 5, 9 and 31, 6 h + 6, 0; 42, 9 h + 6, 7 and 43, 2 h + 7, 8; 63, 9 h + 19, 9 and 59, 9 h + 18, 6; 109, 3 h + 10, 4 and 108, 4 + 11, 3; 152, 3 h + 17, 7 and 150, 6 h + 15, 1; respectively.

40|$|Introduction: Retrograde trans-synaptic {{degeneration}} (RTSD) in {{the human}} visual pathway has not been well clarified. Aims 1. To confirm the RTSD in human visual pathway. 2. To study the rate of RTSD. 3. To study the pupil function in the RTSD. Methods: 1. The peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness measured with optical coherence tomography was compared among patients with acquired and congenital retrogeniculate lesions and normal subjects. Humphrey perimetry and brain imaging were performed. 2. A relationship between {{the duration of the}} disease and the RNFL thickness measured at a single time point was evaluated. Additionally the RNFL thickness was measured in patients with homonymous hemianopia (HH) and smaller homonymous visual field defect serially following stroke. 3. Pupil responses were measured in HH patients and normal subjects, using achromatic and chromatic stimuli localised to the blind hemifield and compared with responses obtained in the sighted hemifield. Results: 1. The overall mean RNFL thickness of the patient groups was significantly less than that of the controls. The affected sectors respected the retinotopic organization. 2. There was a negative straight line relationship between the duration of disease (log years) and the mean thickness measured at a single point in <b>time</b> in <b>HH</b> patients. In the serial measurements the mean thickness had a decreasing trend over <b>time</b> in all <b>HH</b> cases in contrast to the small visual field defect group. The thinning occurred early in the first few months after the stroke. 3. In the acquired group, pupil responses from the blind hemifield were reduced in comparison with controls to all stimuli employed. However there was a greater deficit to the chromatic stimuli than to the luminance contrast stimuli. Discussions: We showed the RTSD in patients with acquired and congenital retrogeniculate lesion by using OCT. The degeneration was correlated to the duration and occurred early after stroke.

At one week prior to parturition, the ewes {{in each of the four}} treatment groups (HH, HL, LH, LL) were then placed onto good pasture for lambing. Differential nutrition during pregnancy significantly affected gestation length of the ewes, with HH ewes having the shortest gestation.

Significant differences were observed in lamb birth weight 5 with nutrition in the last trimester (15 - 20 weeks) having a greater influence on birth weight. This was particularly so for twins. There was no significant difference in the survival of the single lambs, but for twin lambs survival was lowest with the LL ewes. These results show the consequences of maintaining or altering nutrition of single- and twin-bearing ewes during pregnancy. Birth weight of twin-born lambs was most responsive.

A total of 1, 964 VLBW infants admitted between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2011, were studied. The proportion of infants with ≥ 1 NBSI decreased from 47. 6 %- 21. 2 % (P <. 01); the number of NBSIs per 1, 000 patient days decreased from 16. 8 - 8. 9 (P <. 01).

5000|$|With [...] "ə" [...] as a vowel and the vowels [...] "e" [...] and [...] "u" [...] {{introduced}} by the Spaniards to [...] "enrich" [...] the indigenous Philippine languages, the following are the Kinaray-a letters in their suggested alphabetical order: Aa, Bb, Kk, Dd, Ee, Gg, <b>Hh,</b> Ii, Ll, <b>Mm,</b> Nn, NG ng, Oo, Əə, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Uu, Ww, and Yy. The Spaniards placed [...] "ə" [...] after letter [...] "o" [...] because when ә was not yet in use, writers used the letter [...] "o" [...] in place of [...] "ə". This results to a wrong translation and interpretation of the word especially if there are words with the same spelling and words that are cognates.The suggested alphabetical order follows that of the Roman alphabet. Philippine indigenous scripts presumably including Kinaray-a are syllabic. There is no record {{on the order of}} precedence of the syllables. Even the Tagalog Baybayin that the Spaniards used in writing the first book published in the Philippines, did not define the order of precedence of the syllabic script. It was only when the alphabet was Romanized that the alphabetical order was established.|$|R
