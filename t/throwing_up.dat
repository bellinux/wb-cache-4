5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E

25|$|On 4 May {{after the}} failure of the attack on Schenkenschanz the Spanish moved around the fort and thus crossed the Maas between Kessel and Theren, and invaded the island of Bommelerwaard.Upon the arrival of more troops at Tieler and Bommelerwaard, Spanish troops focused first on Fort Crèvecoeur which barred the way; this was taken quickly and the siege of Zaltbommel began. Maurice rapidly {{concentrated}} his forces in and around the city of Zaltbommel, <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> entrenchments, while he sent a detached force to hold the town of Alst. Two days later the Spanish under Mendoza delivered a furious assault along the lines round Zaltbommel, which was repulsed with heavy losses. Despite this Mendoza continued his approaches, and planted guns and dug trenches, while skirmishes were of a daily occurrence. The Anglo-Dutch force were fully prepared however using the river to its maximum potential. They sent 280 vessels, several mounted with guns; meanwhile on land 379 wagons were dispatched with provisions, and 356 horses were collected for dragging the guns.|$|E

25|$|Sir John Thomas Jones was {{eldest of}} five sons of John Jones, esq., general {{superintendent}} at Landguard Fort, Felixstowe, Suffolk, and of Cranmer Hall, Fakenham, Norfolk, {{by his wife}} Mary, daughter of John Roberts of the 29th foot. He was born at Landguard Fort on 25 March 1783. Sir Harry David Jones was his brother. He was educated at the grammar school at Ipswich, joined the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich {{in the spring of}} 1797, received a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 30 August 1798, and embarked in October for Gibraltar. Jones advised on improvements for Gibraltar's fortifications including Parson's Lodge Battery and Wellington Front. He was appointed adjutant of the corps, and remained at Gibraltar four years. While at Gibraltar he was employed on the defences of the north front and in constructing the famous galleries; he also studied seriously, and became a good French and Spanish scholar. He was promoted lieutenant on 14 September 1800 and in 1803 he returned to England. There he was employed on the eastern coast in constructing defence works to oppose the threatened invasion, and in the following year in <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> field-works from Widford to Galleywood Common (known as the Chelmsford lines), to cover London on that side.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contained}} several {{sequences of}} Josef Kobold <b>throwing</b> <b>up.</b> Spotnitz had not intended {{the finished product}} to feature all the shots but the editor at that time, Chris Cooke, [...] "cut it that way." [...] Spotnitz felt that it [...] "was so completely over the top." [...] To create the shots, the production crew used tubes which supplied the faux vomit. The tubes were discreetly fitted to actor James Remar's mouth. Remar, in turn, only had to open his mouth during the shooting of the sequence. Spotnitz later joked that he had [...] "a thing for vomiting".|$|E
500|$|Since {{the sides}} of the pit consist of loose sand at its angle of repose, they afford an {{insecure}} foothold to any small insects that inadvertently venture over the edge, such as ants. Slipping to the bottom, the prey is immediately seized by the lurking antlion; if it attempts to scramble up the treacherous walls of the pit, it is speedily checked in its efforts and brought down by showers of loose sand which are thrown at it from below by the larva. By <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> loose sand {{from the bottom of the}} pit, the larva also undermines {{the sides of}} the pit, causing them to collapse and bring the prey with them. Thus, it does not matter whether the larva actually strikes the prey with the sand showers.|$|E

500|$|Sir Richard Francis Burton, {{who first}} saw the falls in 1863, wrote a {{description}} of the great Yellala. Waves developed {{in the course of the}} river [...] "for a mile and a half above". Afterwards, the water heads down a slope of around thirty feet [...] "in 300 yards, spuming, colliding and <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> foam, which looks dingy white against the dull yellow-brown of the less disturbed channel - the movement is that of waves dashing upon a pier". He went on: [...] "The old river-valley, shown by the scarp of the rocks, must have presented gigantic features, and the height of the trough-walls, at least a thousand feet, gives the Yellala a certain beauty and grandeur. The site is apparently the highest axis of the dividing ridge separating the maritime lowlands from the inner plateau".|$|E
500|$|Cardiff Castle was a motte-and-bailey design. The old Roman walls had {{collapsed}} and the Normans used their remains {{as the basis}} for the outer castle perimeter, digging a defensive trench and <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> a [...] high bank of earth over the Roman fortifications. The Normans further divided the castle with an internal wall to form an inner and an outer bailey. In the north-west corner of the castle a wooden keep was constructed on top of a [...] tall earth motte, surrounded by a [...] wide moat. The motte was the largest built in Wales. The overall area of the castle was around the inner bailey was around [...] in area. Mills were essential to local communities during this period, and the castle mill was located outside the west side of the castle, fed by the River Taff; under local feudal law, the residents of Cardiff were required to use this mill to grind their own grain.|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{delve into}} Lo's hedonistic {{attempts}} to forget her former boyfriend. According to Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal, the narrator describes her attempts {{to overcome a}} failed relationship through binge eating and alcohol, as indicated in the lyrics about having the munchies, eating Twinkies, and <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> during the first verse. In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, to keep you off my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", as she talks about needing to take someone home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her {{favorite part of the}} track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Jillian was altered several {{times by the}} show producers before its original airing; however, the final character personality {{was designed to be}} that of [...] "a bulimic cheerleader." [...] The {{character of}} Jillian was also designed to be [...] "not the brightest bauble on the tree," [...] but this too was repeatedly changed. The description of Jillian's voice being that of a bulimic cheerleader somewhat relates to a future episode plot, where Stewie calls Jillian fat, to which she responds by leaving the room and <b>throwing</b> <b>up.</b> When Stewie exclaims [...] "it's like she's fucking five," [...] this was not set to broadcast at its original air date, but rather added in at a later date for unknown reasons. When Stewie is entertaining the elderly citizens by singing a song entitled [...] "there's a hole {{in the bottom of the}} sea," [...] this is actually Seth MacFarlane's father playing the guitar, as he used to sing it to Seth when he was a child. During the making of this episode, not much thought was put into the character of Jillian, despite the fact she was always meant to be recurring character; although her regular appearances throughout season 5 were described as [...] "a big thing for Family Guy." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Spring {{was once}} again in Byrne's corner, as was Jem Ward. In true Burke style the match lasted for 3hours and 6minutes, during which time 99rounds were fought the longest ever {{recorded}} prize fight. For the most part Byrne {{seemed to be in}} control {{in the early stages of}} the fight; in the 30th round he trapped Burke against the ropes and battered him severely around the body before throwing him to the ground. Burke fell on his face, vomiting and <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> blood, and for the next few rounds Byrne looked the more likely winner. By the 49th round however, Burke had recovered sufficiently to knock Byrne to the ground, whose hands by then were so swollen that he was unable to deliver a finishing blow. By the 93rd round Byrne was [...] "scarcely able to stand, and rolled before the Deaf'un like a ship in a storm". Although both men were utterly exhausted Burke continued to [...] "pepper away at [...] body and head", until in the 99th round Byrne collapsed unconscious and could not be revived to take his place once again at the scratch. A contemporary newspaper report of the day describes a blow-by-blow account of a fair match.|$|E
500|$|An {{addition}} {{was made}} to the law in 1950 to allow umpires to give a batsman not out if the ball should strike the hand after [...] "an involuntary action by the striker in the <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> of a hand to protect his person". For a time, the act of handing the ball back to the fielding side was listed as not out under Law 33, and instead {{was considered to be}} part of a different method of dismissal: obstructing the field, covered in Law 37. The illegal nature of this offence was later returned to Law 33, but reverted to Law 37 in 2013. In 1948 the MCC issued a reminder to batsman, advising them not to handle the ball for any reason at any point during a cricket match, but it is relatively common for batsmen to pick the ball up and return it to the fielding side. Charles Wright was the first player to be dismissed for returning the ball to a fielder in first-class cricket; albeit wrongly. Brodribb relates that in an 1893 match, W. G. Grace influenced Wright to return the ball to him, and upon doing so, appealed. The umpire dismissed Wright, despite a clause added to the law nine years previous stating that a batsman would not be ruled out if they were returning the ball at the request of the fielding side.|$|E

500|$|... "Tuvix" [...] was {{formerly}} known as [...] "Untitled Tuvok/Neelix", [...] "One", and [...] "Symbiogenesis", with the third of these persisting through the episode's development and shooting. [...] The episode and its teleplay were written by Kenneth Biller; the story is credited to Andrew Shepard Price and Mark Gaberman. [...] Though described by Biller as [...] "high-concept", the original story by Price and Gaberman was much more light-hearted and tended more towards slapstick. [...] Biller and Brannon Braga felt {{the tone of the}} episode was so akin to a 1960s sitcom, the two of them even wrote a theme song for it. [...] Biller re-wrote the episode to focus more on the serious philosophical questions raised by the episode and especially the inevitable separation of Tuvix back into the series regulars.

500|$|In {{the areas}} of the mine explosions, the British {{infantry}} found dead, wounded and stunned German soldiers. The attackers swept through the gaps in the German defences as Germans further back hurriedly withdrew. About [...] British troops advanced up the slope, the creeping bombardment <b>throwing</b> <b>up</b> lots of smoke and dust, which blocked the view of the German defenders. The barrage moved at [...] in two minutes, which allowed the leading troops to rush or outflank German strong points and machine-gun nests. Where the Germans were able to resist, they were engaged with rifle-grenades, Lewis guns and trench mortars, while riflemen and bombers worked behind them. Pillbox fighting tactics had been a great success at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April and in training for the attack at Messines, the same methods were adopted along with emphasis on mopping-up captured ground, to ensure that bypassed German troops could not engage advancing troops from behind. In the smoke and dust, direction was kept by compass and the German forward zone was easily overrun in the [...] allotted, as was the [...] line, half way to the German [...] (second) line on the ridge. The two supporting battalions of the attacking brigades leap-frogged through, to advance to the second objective on the near crest of the ridge [...] further on. The accuracy of the British barrage was maintained and local German counter-attack attempts were stifled. As the infantry approached the German second line, resistance increased.|$|E
