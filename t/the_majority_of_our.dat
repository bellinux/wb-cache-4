2500|$|In March 1914, Hungarian prime {{minister}} István Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown [...] "Weltkrieg" [...] (which means [...] "World War") phrase in his letter. [...] "It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [...] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, {{but will not}} start the war {{so long as they}} have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> forces on our eastern and southern front."

2500|$|Our {{relationship}} with the natural environment can be understood through the concept of biophilia and the biophilia hypothesis. This term is defined as humans' innate need to affiliate with other life such as plants and animals. This essentially means that humans have {{a desire to be}} near nature. This built in desire {{may be the result of}} spending <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> evolutionary history (over 99%) closely connected to nature. Biophilia is genetic meaning those humans who were closely connected to nature throughout history would, presumably, have had better access to food and fresh water. For example, someone who lived close to water, near vegetation, or with a pet as a protector (e.g. dog) would have had survival advantages. Although evolutionary theory is difficult to test, the popularity of camping, hiking, and visiting the zoo, provide support for this theory. In his 1997 book, Kellert proposed that biophilia (or being close to nature) also provides us benefits such as an increase in well-being. Thus, being disconnected from the natural environment should have negative effects on humans' well-being.|$|E

2500|$|Turner Field was a {{relatively}} new facility, being younger than 14 of Major League Baseball's other 29 stadiums {{at the time of}} the Braves' last game there. However, the Braves executives complained that its downtown location restricted game attendance because of traffic into the city and a shortage of on-site parking. [...] The stadium was ¾ mile (1200 m) from the nearest Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) stop, and many fans were unwilling to brave Atlanta's infamous congestion to attend games; plus, the team could not secure more parking spaces. In addition, team VP for business operations Mike Plant said the site [...] "doesn't match up with where <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> fans come from", as the stadium is near some of Atlanta's poorest neighborhoods. Plant also said that while the Braves operated Turner Field, they had no control over the commercial development around the stadium. [...] Other stadiums built in recent years have been accompanied by shopping and entertainment facilities in the surrounding area (as SunTrust Park later would be).|$|E
