40|$|Milk is a {{food with}} high {{nutritional}} value as it contains abundant water, proteins, vitamins, lactose, fat, minerals, enzymes, etc. However, {{in order to}} make milk suitable for intake, it should be thermally treated to eliminate microbiologically hazardous factors. Heat treatment is an essential sanitation process for milk, but various precautions must be taken in order to process and preserve it. Therefore, various techniques should be developed to minimize the nutrient loss and to ensure that milk is safe for consumption, conservation, and distribution. However, the existing <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization</b> methods are harmful and increase the nutrient loss; moreover, no new <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization</b> methods are being researched that are safe for the human health and minimize the nutrient loss.

40|$|Abstract It {{is widely}} {{considered}} that high pressure processing (HPP) results in better retention of micronutrients and phytochemicals compared to <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization</b> (TP), although some studies indicate that {{this may not be}} true in all cases. The aims of this study were (1) to objectively compare the effects of HPP under commercial processing conditions with <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization</b> (TP) on the stability of phenolic antioxidants in strawberries following processing and during storage and (2) to evaluate the influence of varietal differences and hence differences in biochemical composition of strawberries on the stability of phenolic antioxidants. Strawberry puree samples from cultivars Camarosa, Rubygem, and Festival were subjected to HPP (600 MPa/ 20 Â°C/ 5 min) and TP (88 Â°C/ 2 min). The activities of oxidative enzymes were evaluated before and after processing. Furthermore, the antioxidant capacity (total phenolic content (TPC), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)) and individual anthocyanins (by HPLC) were determined prior to and following processing and after three months of refrigerated storage (4 Â°C). Depending on the cultivar, HPP caused 15 â€“ 38 % and 20 â€“ 33 % inactivation of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase, respectively, compared to almost complete inactivation of these enzymes by TP. Significant decreases (p < 0. 05) in ORAC, FRAP, TPC and anthocyanin contents were observed during processing and storage of both HPP and TP samples. Anthocyanins were the most affected with only 19 â€“ 25 % retention after three months of refrigerated storage (4 Â°C). Slightly higher (p < 0. 05) loss of TPC and antioxidant capacity were observed during storage of HPP samples compared to TP. Industrial Relevance: The results of the study demonstrated that both high pressure processing and <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization</b> result in high retention of phenolic phytochemicals in strawberry products. Under the conditions investigated, high pressure processing did not result in a better retention of phenolic phytochemicals compared to <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization.</b> In fact, a slightly higher loss of total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity were observed during refrigerated storage of HPP processed samples. Our results showed that, high pressure processing may not always be a better alternative to thermal processing for strawberry puree processing if the main objective is better retention of phenolic antioxidants. However, {{it should be noted that}} other quality attributes such as sensory properties, where distinct advantages of HPP are expected, were outside the scope of this study...|$|E
40|$|Four cruciferous seeds (small radish, radish, {{white mustard}} and rapeseed) were germinated {{in order to}} study the fate of {{inositol}} hexaphosphate (IP- 6, phytic acid) and activity of trypsin inhibitor (TIA). Reduction {{in the content of}} phytic acid depended on the time of germination. After four days of germination, when sprouts were ready-to-eat, the amount of this compound was about 50 % lower in three out of the four seeds evaluated. Next, a sharp reduction in phytic acid occurred during <b>thermal</b> treatments (<b>pasteurization</b> and sterilization) of germinated rapeseed and radish sprouts. In thermal processes, a decrease in inositol hexaphosphate content was accompanied by the appearance of lower forms of inositol phosphates: IP- 5, IP- 4 and IP- 3.

Experiments were carried out in vintage 2016 with Riesling musts of different quality containing their natural microflora. Yeasts were tested more resistant to UV-C energy than bacteria. Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed higher tolerance against UV-C irradiation than Hanseniaspora uvarum facilitating new opportunities to control spontaneous fermentations. However, inactivation efficacy was strongly dependent on turbidity of musts and the initial degree of contamination suggesting a shadowing effect of individual germs. Compared with <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization,</b> UV-C treatment of must with 1  kJ/L showed similar effects in germ-reduction. While <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization</b> significantly decreased aroma precursors in musts, UV-C treatment did not change concentrations of glycosidically-bound C 6 -alcohols, monoterpenes and C 13 -norisoprenoids as shown by GC-MS analysis.

It was found that anthocyanin content after sterilization was reduced by 51. 35 % compared to untreated juice. Pasteurization (80 °C for 5 min) reduced anthocyanin by 34 % when compared to untreated jamun fruit juice. It was found that anthocyanin degradation increases with increase in temperature and time of pasteurization.

Elías-Argote The {{milk fat}} globule {{membrane}} (MFGM) is avidly studied by many groups of scientists {{around the world}} due to its unprecedented nutritional and functional properties; however, limited research has been performed {{on the effects of}} milk processing on the chemical changes of the MFGM. Thus, this study highlights the changes that lipids and proteins undergo from the time milk leaves cow’s udders. Cooling (4 °C) was included along with subsequent pasteurization by different traditional thermal processes and cold pasteurization by pulse light ultra violet treatment. Cooling milk to 4 °C had a measureable effect on the MFGM composition, resulting in protein alterations, particularly to butyrophilin and adipophilin. Thermal treatments disturbed the native structures of molecules and increased the adsorption of milk and whey proteins on the globules, especially a-lactalbumin and b-lactoglobulin. As the heat intensity increased, the aggregation of fat globules became more pronounced due to protein interactions. Intrinsic MFGM proteins also varied in relative abundance during the processing steps. The concentrations of polar lipids did not change during processing, with the exception of phosphatidylserine, which decreased during the cooling and <b>thermal</b> treatments. Cold <b>pasteurization</b> (UV treatment) had a minimal effect on fat globules and MFGM proteins. Since the MFGM promises to deliver nutritional effects and more when included in food products, currently HTST pasteurization was shown to be the best method to process milk and obtain MFGM isolates for further supplementation...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} UV-C {{irradiation}} on the inactivation of Escherichia coli K- 12 (ATCC 25253), a surrogate of E. coli O 157 :H 7, {{and on the}} shelf life of freshly squeezed turbid white grape juice (FSWGJ) were investigated. FSWGJ samples were processed at 0. 90 mL/s for 32 min by circulating 8 times in an annular flow UV system. The UV exposure time was 244 s per cycle. The population of E. coli K- 12 was reduced by 5. 34 log cycles after exposure to a total UV dosage of 9. 92 J/cm 2 (1. 24 J/cm 2 per cycle) at 0. 90 mL/s flow rate. The microbial shelf life of UV-C treated FSWGJ was extended up to 14 d at 4 °C. UV exposure was not found to alter pH, total soluble solid, and titratable acidity of juice. There was a significant effect (P < 0. 05) on turbidity, absorbance coefficient, color, and ascorbic acid content. Furthermore, all physicochemical properties were altered during refrigerated storage. The microbial shelf life of FSWGJ was doubled after UV-C treatment, whereas the quality of juice was adversely affected similarly observed in the control samples. Practical Applications: UV-C irradiation is a non-thermal method used for processing of fruit juices with a minimal or no changes in flavor, essential nutrients, and vitamins. Fresh grape juice is a popular drink, usually consumed at summer time due to many beneficial health effects. Although <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization</b> is widely used for extending the shelf life of fruit juices, it causes a "cook taste" in grape juice. The applicability of UV-C irradiation {{as an alternative to}} <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization</b> was investigated. It is concluded that UV-C treatment can be used for extending the shelf life of fresh grape juice. Dept. of Food Engineering, Izmir Inst. of Technology, Izmir, Turkey (2010 IYTE 09...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} sterilization methods (thermal, microwave, and ultrasonic processing) {{on the main}} bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of black mulberry juice during selected storage time (8 days) and temperatures (5, 15, and 25 C) was investigated. The antioxidant activity of thermal-treated juice depleted with storage time, whilst both ultrasound- and microwave-treated juices showed transient increase in antioxidant activity during the first 2 days that later decreased with storage time. Lower temperature storage preserved more bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity, especially in ultrasound sterilized samples. The activation energy values were 15. 99, 13. 07, and 12. 81 kJ/mol for ultrasonic, microwave, and <b>thermal</b> <b>pasteurization</b> processes, respectively. In general, ultrasound-sterilized samples showed higher total phenolics, anthocyanin, and antioxidant activity compared to the microwave- and thermal-processed juice during the storage time especially at lower temperatures...|$|E
40|$|High {{pressure}} in the food industry, as a new non-thermal method, is applied in many phases of food processing. This new non-thermal technology {{was developed in the}} 1990 s. The main advantages of high-pressure processing are in the short time of processing which is between a few seconds and 30 minutes. Processing of solid or liquid food products with or without packaginghappens in the temperature interval 5 – 90 °C, and pressures 50 – 1000 MPa. The driving pressure is distributed uniformly through the whole product independently of its quantity and shape. These processing characteristics combined with improved food microbiological safety, less energy expenditure, low concentration of waste products and longer shelf life make high-pressure processing a very promising novel food technology. Combined with lower cost of treatment (but unfortunately higher initial cost of equipment) compared to traditional processing technologies, it is also economically profitable. The main purpose of such treated food products are in preservation of sensory, nutritive and textural properties. As the temperature increase is very low, there are no significant changes in sensory properties, in contrast to conventional <b>thermal</b> processing (sterilization, <b>pasteurization).</b> However, with the combination of heating or cooling and high pressure, modification of existing and creation of new food products is possible. Today, high pressure is used for the treatment of meat products (inactivation of microorganisms), freezing and defrosting of foodstuffs, production of fruit juices (pasteurization), processing of oysters, modificationof milk characteristics (foaming) etc. The main purpose of this work is to present the working principle and application of high {{pressure in}} the food industry...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{chemical}} composition of apple purees of four different apple varieties: ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Idared’, ‘Jonagold’ and ‘Cripps Pink’, in the fresh state (FP) and after thermal treatment by process of pasteurization with added green (PG) or white stevia powder (PW) derived from the leaves of the stevia plant. Also, to determine whether there is a significant influence of sweetening with stevia on the change of analyzed nutritional parameters of apple purees based on the results. Significant increase of dry matter content in PG and PW samples of apple purees was determined for approximately 10 %, and also for total soluble solid content for 1 %. High increase of natural invert content, for approximately five times higher, and some lower increase of total invert content of analyzed purees was determined in PG and PW samples in comparison with the FP samples. Total acid content and pH value did not show any significant change during the process of pasteurization and sweetening with stevia. The pasteurization significantly influenced the slight vitamin C reduction as well as the high reduction of total phenols in PG and PW samples. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that the <b>thermal</b> processing by <b>pasteurization</b> significantly affects the degradation of high antioxidant activity compounds. Adding a green and white stevia powder significantly influenced the alterations of some nutritional components analyzed in apple purees: the dry matter content, soluble solids, and natural invert content (sugar glucose). It is important to emphasize, that the main effect of green and white stevia powder was the increase of natural invert content i. e. content of glucose and fructose, thereby increasing the sweetness of product, without increasing the content of “harmful” sugars e. g. sucrose...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years the almond {{beverage}} has experimented an increase on the consume, therefore, the commercialization area has been expanded, almost all around the world. This beverage further than be an alternative to milk for people with lactose intolerance, it is claimed because of its functional qualities that can contribute to reduce or prevent diseases, which are besetting society; this mainly due thanks {{to the content of}} the fatty acids, monounsatured and polyunsatured, and the antioxidants just like E vitamin, phenolic compounds and polyamines. This thesis project was focused on the application of an emerging technology, Ultra High Pressure Homogenization (UHPH), in the production of almond beverage. This non-thermal technology consists of a high pressure machine capable of applying pressures of up to 400 MPa using a special homogenizing system designed to produce a conserving effect, improving the colloidal and microbial stability while maintaining good nutritional and sensory qualities. Considering this hypothesis, UHPH could be an alternative technology to those commonly applied in the food industries. For that, a comparative study of UHPH with <b>thermal</b> treatments (<b>pasteurization)</b> was carried out in this work. This investigation has been conducted through four successive studies. The first study was aimed to optimize processing conditions of the elaboration of a base product of almond beverage for being used in subsequent studies. Moreover, influence of the addition of lecithin as an emulsifier in the stability of pasteurized beverage was studied and the most relevant analytical parameters related to the overall quality of the food were analyzed. In the second study, the influence of the UHPH treatments (200 and 300 MPa, 55, 65 and 75 ºC) were evaluated in the almond beverage characteristics, and they were compared with samples treated with convectional pasteurization, UHT and with based crude product. UHPH at 200 MPa 55 and 75 ºC of inlet temperature were revealed as alternative treatments to pasteurization, and 300 MPa 65 y 75 ºC as alternative to UHT. The UHPH condition of 300 MPa and 65 and 75 ºC inlet temperature was able to produce commercial sterile almond beverages. The third study was the identification of potentially contaminating spoilage microorganisms in treated almond beverage, to evaluate subsequently the lethality produced by UHPH treatments 300 MPa, 55, 65, 75 and 85 °C, in microorganisms with higher resistance to UHPH and most frequently isolated. These microorganisms were Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Lysinibacillus spp. Lethality was complete when treatment was used 300 MPa and 75 and 85 °C inlet temperatures. The second part consisted in the shelf-life evaluation of soymilk treated by UHPH using the selected optimal conditions determined in the previous step Finally, with the selected conditions of UHPH treatments (200 MPa, 55 and 75 ºC), was studied the microbiological, physical and chemical quality of the almond beverage during cold storage time and it was compared with pasteurized almond beverage. Monitoring was conducted every 7 days for 3 weeks. During cold storage, almond beverage samples treated by UHPH at both inlet temperatures had generally better characteristics than pasteurized ones...|$|R
