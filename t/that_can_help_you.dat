5000|$|According to Felix Salmon of Reuters, SPI {{is about}} taking archaeological sites [...] "in poor {{countries}} {{and making them}} generate cash for the locals — thereby giving them a real monetary incentive (rather than a high-minded lecture) aimed at preserving archeological treasures." [...] In an article on job creation, Salmon cites SPI {{as a model for}} maximum job creation through small investments: [...] "In general, if you want to create the maximum number of jobs for the smallest amount of money, the best way of doing so is to provide catalytic capital which helps to give a small business the step-up it needs to sustain new jobs on a permanent basis". In a recent report, the Milken Institute called for the adoption of SPI's model by the state of Israel in order to better protect that country's cultural heritage. Handeye Magazine, an international publication dedicated to culture and commerce, cites the organization as one that [...] "continues to put 'people, not stones' at the forefront, placing equal or greater focus on economic and social investment as opposed to purely preservation."

Having a generous welfare state does two key things to reduce working poverty: it raises the minimum level of wages that {{people are willing to}} accept, and it pulls a large portion of low-wage workers out of poverty by providing them with an array of cash and non-cash government benefits. [...] Many think that increasing the United States' welfare state generosity would lower the working poverty rate. A common critique of this proposal is that a generous welfare state would not work because it would stagnate the economy, raise unemployment, and degrade people's work ethic. [...] However, , most European countries have a lower unemployment rate than the US. Furthermore, although Western European economies' growth rates can be lower than the US's from time to time, their growth rates tend to be more stable, whereas the US's tends to fluctuate relatively severely.
