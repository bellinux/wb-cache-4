5000|$|<b>Trifluralin</b> is a {{commonly}} used pre-emergence herbicide. With about 14 million pounds {{used in the}} United States in 2001, {{it is one of}} the most widely used herbicides. [...] <b>Trifluralin</b> is generally applied to the soil to provide control of a variety of annual grass and broadleaf weed species. It inhibits root development by interrupting mitosis, and thus can control weeds as they germinate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trifluralin</b> {{has been}} {{banned in the}} European Union since 20 March 2008, {{primarily}} due to its high toxicity to fish and other aquatic life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trifluralin</b> {{undergoes}} {{an extremely}} complex fate {{in the environment}} and is transiently transformed into many different products as it degrades, ultimately being incorporated into soil-bound residues or converted to carbon dioxide (mineralized). Among the more unusual behaviors of <b>trifluralin</b> is inactivation in wet soils. This {{has been linked to}} transformation of the herbicide by reduced soil minerals, which in turn had been previously reduced by soil microorganisms as electron acceptors in the absence of oxygen. This environmental process has been reported for many structurally related herbicides (dinitroanilines) as well as a variety of energetic compounds (explosives).|$|E
50|$|Dinitroanilines are {{intermediates}} in {{the preparation}} of various industrially important chemicals including dyes and pesticides. Herbicides which are derivatives of dinitroanilines include benfluralin, butralin, chlornidine, dinitramine, dipropalin, ethalfluralin, fluchloralin, isopropalin, methalpropalin, nitralin, oryzalin, pendimethalin, prodiamine, profluralin, and <b>trifluralin.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{method of}} {{maintaining}} the effectiveness of individual strategies is to combine them with others that work in complete different ways.

The spreader, Dane Lindemeir, remembers objecting to the spreading {{of what he was}} told was a mix of fertilizer, atrazine, and <b>trifluralin,</b> because it didn't look healthy and it didn't make sense to apply both atrazine, which kills beans, and <b>trifluralin,</b> which kills corn, together (28). Later that year, Cenex salesman Nerpel, a friend of DeYoung, tells DeYoung that he should check into the fertilizer. The corn planted hardly grew, and what was grown was sold as animal feed. DeYoung, worried about the liability of the toxic waste, tries to get Cenex to take over the land, which they reluctantly do. Cenex plants Sudan grass, known for soaking up heavy metals, but the [...] "extremely rank stand" [...] of Sudan grass only covers 22 percent of the land (41). Although Cenex claims it will not sell the grass, its Quincy manager John Williams sells it to a neighbor for her horses. Several of the horses die. Meanwhile, DeYoung hires lawyers, but does not make much headway against Cenex, which has the state government on its side (53). Another farmer purchasing from Cenex, Tom Witte, finds that his fields yielded substantially less, and his cows begin getting cancer. His field man gets muscular dystrophy, and in 1991 he files for bankruptcy.|$|E
5000|$|Since organic cotton {{is grown}} {{without the use}} of {{synthetic}} pesticides, it should contain fewer synthetic pesticides than conventional cotton. Pesticides used in the production of conventional cotton include orthophosphates such as phorate and methamidophos, endosulfan (highly toxic to farmers, but not very environmentally persistent) and aldicarb. Other pesticides persisting in cotton fields in the United States include <b>Trifluralin,</b> Toxaphene and DDT. Although the last two chemicals are no longer used in the United States [...] their long breakdown period and difficulty in removal ensures their persistence. Thus even organic cotton fields may contain them since conventional cotton fields can be transitioned to organic fields in 2-3 years. [...] Instead, organic production allows the use of poisons extracted from plants or animals.|$|E
5000|$|Alachlor {{exhibits}} moderate sorption in soil, {{ranging from}} 43-209 mL/g. Photodegradation {{is a minor}} contributor to alachlor fate. Degradation in soil appears to be largely biologically mediated, and produces multiple metabolites. The half life in aerobic soil ranges from about 6 to 15 days and is considerably shorter under anaerobic conditions. One {{possible explanation for the}} short anaerobic half life is the observation that alachlor is rapidly transformed under anoxia to up to 14 degradation products in the presence of iron-bearing ferruginous smectites. The iron in such minerals can be used by certain soil bacteria as an electron acceptor when soils are flooded, thus the process of herbicide transformation by reduced clay is thought to be microbially mediated. [...] Similar observations have been reported for the herbicides <b>trifluralin</b> and atrazine.|$|E
5000|$|Soil applied: Herbicides {{applied to}} the soil are usually {{taken up by the}} root or shoot of the {{emerging}} seedlings and are used as preplant or preemergence treatment. Several factors influence the effectiveness of soil-applied herbicides. Weeds absorb herbicides by both passive and active mechanism. Herbicide adsorption to soil colloids or organic matter often reduces its amount available for weed absorption. Positioning of herbicide in correct layer of soil is very important, which can be achieved mechanically and by rainfall. Herbicides on the soil surface are subjected to several processes that reduce their availability. Volatility and photolysis are two common processes that reduce the availability of herbicides. Many soil applied herbicides are absorbed through plant shoots while they are still underground leading to their death or injury. EPTC and <b>trifluralin</b> are soil applied herbicides.|$|E

5000|$|The {{genes for}} enzymes AtzA-C {{have been found}} to be highly conserved in atrazine-degrading organisms worldwide. In Pseudomonas sp. ADP, the Atz genes are located noncontiguously on a plasmid with the genes for mercury catabolism. AtzA-C genes have also been found in a Gram-positive bacterium, but are chromosomally located. The {{insertion}} elements flanking each gene suggest that they are involved in the assembly of this specialized catabolic pathway. Two options exist for degradation of atrazine using microbes, bioaugmentation or biostimulation. Recent research suggests that microbial adaptation to atrazine has occurred in some fields where the herbicide is used repetitively, resulting in more rapid biodegradation. Like the herbicides <b>trifluralin</b> and alachlor, atrazine is susceptible to rapid transformation in the presence of reduced iron-bearing soil clays, such as ferruginous smectites. In natural environments, some iron-bearing minerals are reduced by specific bacteria in the absence of oxygen, thus the abiotic transformation of herbicides by reduced minerals is viewed as [...] "microbially induced".|$|E
50|$|In surface waters, {{phototransformation}} can substantially {{contribute to}} degradation. In “direct” phototransformation, photons are {{absorbed by the}} contaminant, while in “indirect” phototransformation, reactive species are formed through photon absorption by other substances. Pesticide electronic absorption spectra typically show little overlap with sunlight, such {{that only a few}} (e.g., <b>trifluralin)</b> are affected by direct phototransformation. Various photochemically active light absorbers are present in surface waters, enhancing indirect phototransformation. The most prominent is dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is the precursor of excited triplet states, molecular oxygen, superoxide radical anions, and other radicals. Nitrate and nitrite ions produce hydroxyl radicals under irradiation. Indirect phototransformation is thus the result of parallel reactions with all available reactive species. The transformation rate depends on the concentrations of all relevant reactive species, together with their corresponding second-order rate constants for a given pesticide. These constants are known for hydroxyl radical and molecular oxygen. In the absence of such rate constants, quantitative structure-activity relationships(QSARs) may allow their estimation for a specific pesticide from its chemical structure.|$|E
50|$|When {{resistance}} is first suspected or confirmed, {{the efficacy of}} alternatives {{is likely to be}} the first consideration. The use of alternative herbicides which remain effective on resistant populations can be a successful strategy, at least in the short term. The effectiveness of alternative herbicides will be highly dependent on the extent of cross-resistance. If there is resistance to a single group of herbicides, then the use of herbicides from other groups may provide a simple and effective solution, at least in the short term. For example, many triazine-resistant weeds have been readily controlled by the use of alternative herbicides such as dicamba or glyphosate. If resistance extends to more than one herbicide group, then choices are more limited. It should not be assumed that resistance will automatically extend to all herbicides with the same mode of action, although it is wise to assume this until proved otherwise. In many weeds the degree of cross-resistance between the five groups of ALS inhibitors varies considerably. Much will depend on the resistance mechanisms present, and it should not be assumed that these will necessarily be the same in different populations of the same species. These differences are due, at least in part, to the existence of different mutations conferring target site resistance. Consequently, selection for different mutations may result in different patterns of cross-resistance. Enhanced metabolism can affect even closely related herbicides to differing degrees. For example, populations of Alopecurus myosuroides (blackgrass) with an enhanced metabolism mechanism show resistance to pendimethalin but not to <b>trifluralin,</b> despite both being dinitroanilines. This is due to differences in the vulnerability of these two herbicides to oxidative metabolism. Consequently, care is needed when trying to predict the efficacy of alternative herbicides.|$|E

Pollen size, which is related to pollen DNA content, increased after both N 2 O and <b>trifluralin</b> treatments, but the induction of large pollen was genotype dependent. <b>Trifluralin</b> induced large pollen only in the male fertile species, while N 2 O treatments induced fertile 2 n pollen in the male sterile B. schmidtiana x B. cucullata. Cytological studies showed that <b>trifluralin</b> induced multinuclear monads that resulted in 4 n gametes in stead of 2 n gametes. In general, large pollen obtained after <b>trifluralin</b> treatments showed low germination capability, while large pollen obtained after N 2 O treatments retained high germination capability. Seedlings with raised ploidy level could only be obtained after crosses were performed with large pollen obtained from N 2 O treatments. Hence, N 2 O treatments are preferable {{to the use of}} <b>trifluralin</b> to induce 2 n gametes in Begonia...|$|E
40|$|At the {{recommended}} rates (1. 0 lb/A for <b>trifluralin,</b> ethalfluralin, EL 5261; 0. 75 lb/A for dinitramine; 1. 2 lb/A for nitrofen), {{none of the}} herbicides we evaluated in these studies reduced rapeseed stands, yields, or test weights. However, at higher rates (1. 5, 3. 0 lb A), dinitramine reduced rapeseed stands, but this {{did not result in}} decreased yields. None of the other herbicides reduced rapeseed stand, yield, or test weights when applied at up to four times {{the recommended}} rate. No <b>trifluralin</b> residues were detected in rapeseed whole-plant or seed samples. All of the herbicides provided adequate control of common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.). Corn spurry (Spergula arvensis L.) was controlled by <b>trifluralin.</b> ethalfluralin. EL- 5261, and nitrofen. All of the herbicides except nitrofen controlled chickweed [Stellaria media (L.) Cyrillo]. [...] In 1979, 51 per cent of the <b>trifluralin</b> applied remained {{at the end of the}} growing season in one study while 26 per cent remained in another study. The rate of degradation at three sites in 1979 were as follows (greatest to least); Delta Junction, Matanuska Valley, Fairbanks. Degradation rates of <b>trifluralin</b> were not significantly different in three soil types or at two different application rates. <b>Trifluralin</b> showed no signs of leaching through the soil profile. In 1981, 25 per cent of the <b>trifluralin,</b> 8 per cent of the ethalfluralin, and 24 per cent of the EL- 5261 applied remained at the end of the growing season. Despite the relatively long persistence of these preplant, incorporated herbicides, yields and test weights of barley planted in succeeding years were not reduced. A benefit of these persistent residues was control of broadleaf weeds in the succeeding barley crop...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trifluralin,</b> {{a widely}} used {{herbicide}} (Rahman, 1977), may act via interaction with plant microtubule protein (Hess and Bayer, 1974, 1977). In <b>trifluralin</b> treated seedlings of Trifolium repens, root tips increased {{in diameter and}} decreased in length, cell elongation was decreased, cell wall deposition was abnormal, root hairs were deformed, and a marked reduction {{was seen in the}} number of infection threads induced by the bacterial symbionts. Our observations support the hypothesis that <b>trifluralin</b> (at low concentrations, from 2 x 10 (- 6) M) interferes with microtubule-based morphogenetic processes in developing seedlings and adversely affects the establishment of the bacteria-legume symbiosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between the use of}} herbicides to control Lolium rigidum and herbicide resistance was investigated by surveying 62 growers with properties located in major South Australian grain growing regions during March and April 2003. These growers have relied heavily on a variety of herbicides with different modes of action for weed management. A high percentage of growers reported resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides and consequently relatively few growers proposed to use aryloxyphenoxypropanoate herbicides in 2003. A high percentage of growers also perceived resistance to chlorsulfuron or triasulfuron and <b>trifluralin.</b> Growers planned to use herbicides with modes of action other than ACCase for the control of L. rigidum. The perceived high resistance status of L. rigidum to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides and ALS-inhibiting herbicides is not unexpected; however, the perceived resistance status of <b>trifluralin</b> is controversial. Perception of <b>trifluralin</b> resistance is apparently influencing weed management. Therefore, further investigation of <b>trifluralin</b> resistance is required. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of {{the plant}} uptake of organic {{chemicals}} is essential to assessing contaminant mobility in the eco-system, exposure to humans, and phytoremediation technologies. In this study, we measured the uptake of <b>trifluralin</b> and lindane from water by ryegrass {{as a function of}} uptake time for periods of 96 and 120 h, respectively. <b>Trifluralin</b> concentration in ryegrass increased sharply at the early stage of uptake and reached the maximum at 10 h, and then decreased with uptake time. 14 C-labelled <b>trifluralin</b> uptake displayed a similar trend but a higher 14 C-concentration than that of extracted parent compound, indicating metabolism and formation of bound residues following <b>trifluralin</b> up-take. Lindane concentration in ryegrass slowly increased with uptake time and approached a plateau, indicating minimal metabolism and formation of bound residues. The difference in the uptake characteristics of these two chemicals {{may be related to the}} differences in their lipophilicity, and chemical and biological reactivities. A two-compartment model accounting for the contributions of transpiration, metabolism and formation of bound residues to overall uptake was developed to assess the uptake kinetics. The model adequately described the uptake of <b>trifluralin</b> and lindane into ryegrass by providing the first-order rate constants of uptake, release, transpiration, and metabolism and formation of bound residues. These rate constants are used in calculating plant concentration factor (PCF). The ratios of <b>trifluralin</b> concentrations in ryegrass to its aqueous concentrations are between the PCF at thermodynamic equi...|$|E
40|$|Crops {{resistant}} to glyphosate may mitigate the increasing {{contamination of the}} environment by herbicides, since their weeding requires smaller amounts of herbicides and fewer active ingredients. However, there are few published data comparing the fate of glyphosate with that of substitute herbicides under similar soil and climatic conditions. The objectives of the work reported here were (i) to evaluate and compare the fate in soil in field conditions of glyphosate, as used on glyphosate-resistant oilseed rape, with that of two herbicides frequently used for weed control on the same crop, albeit non-resistant: <b>trifluralin</b> and metazachlor, and (ii) to compare field results with predictions of the pesticide root zone model (PRZM), parameterized with laboratory data. Dissipation and vertical distribution in the soil profile of glyphosate, <b>trifluralin</b> and metazachlor were monitored in an experimental site located in Eastern France for 1 year. Herbicide persistence in the field increased as follows: metazachlor < glyphosate < <b>trifluralin,</b> contrary to laboratory results showing glyphosate to be least persistent. The main metabolite of glyphosate - aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) - was more persistent than glyphosate. AMPA and <b>trifluralin</b> had the largest vertical mobility, followed by metazachlor and glyphosate. PRZM underestimated the dissipation rate of glyphosate in the field and the formation of AMPA, but its predictions for <b>trifluralin</b> and metazachlor were correct. The simulation of herbicides and AMPA distribution in the soil profile was satisfactory, but the mobility of <b>trifluralin</b> and metazachlor was slightly underestimated, probably because PRZM ignores preferential flow. In general, data from the laboratory allowed an acceptable parameterization of the model, as indicated by goodness-of-fit indices. Because of the detection of AMPA in the deep soil layer, the replacement of both <b>trifluralin</b> and metazachlor with glyphosate might not contribute to decreasing environmental contamination by herbicides. PRZM may be used to evaluate and to compare other weed control strategies for herbicide-resistant as well as non-resistant crops...|$|E
