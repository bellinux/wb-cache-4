40|$|On September 30 th 2003 the European Commission {{put forward}} {{proposals}} {{for the reform}} of <b>the</b> EU <b>hop</b> regime. <b>The</b> Commission is proposing a substantial delinking of hop support from production by transferring it to the decoupled single farm payment scheme. Member states, however, {{will be able to}} opt for total or partial decoupling, with the possibility of maintaining a maximum of 25 % of aid linked to production, so as to accommodate the needs of particular regions. The Commission's proposals for reform are based on the report of an assessment of the situation in <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> <b>sector</b> which maintained that future policy should meet three key criteria: it should maintain the viability of production, ensure economic conditions favourable to production and accommodate the market trend. As in other sectors the reform will provide 'aid equivalent to the present aid' but through 'a more efficient and direct transfer of the support'. The Commission's assessment outlines the current system, which is based on: a certification procedure; a forward contract system; rules for recognition and promotion of producer groups; rules for trade with third countries. <b>The</b> <b>hop</b> <b>sector</b> accounts for only € 12. 5 million of EU agricultural expenditures, with hops being cultivated on 22, 000 hectares of land. Production is concentrated in Germany (80 %), with <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> <b>sector</b> shrinking as yields improve, beer-making technology changes, and consumer tastes evolve. The EU is <b>the</b> world's leading <b>hop</b> producer, accounting for 40 % of production, and is a major exporter of hops, with imports around half the level of exports. Comment: Once again the commitment to providing 'aid equivalent to the present aid' shows {{the extent to which the}} EU intends to continue to support EU producers, even in minor crops.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>The</b> one leg <b>hop</b> for {{distance}} {{is one of}} the most commonly employed functional tests utilized in the evaluation of the ACL deficient and reconstructed patient. While the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> test scores has been well established, validity studies have revealed low sensitivity rates in detecting functional limitations using <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> index (<b>the</b> ratio or percentage of limb performance). However, the impact of the inherent limitations associated with <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> index have not been investigated to date. One specific limitation relates to the impact of the differences in <b>the</b> underlying <b>hop</b> distance scores. Therefore, this pilot study set out to determine: 1) the impact that between limb differences in hop distance has on the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> index in detecting functional limitations and; 2) whether a logarithmic transformation of <b>the</b> underlying <b>hop</b> distance scores improves the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> index. Methods A cross sectional design involving the evaluation of one leg hop {{for distance}} performance in a consecutive sample of 10 ACL deficient males with an isolated ACL tear awaiting reconstructive surgery and nine gender, age-matched controls. Results In the ACL deficient, <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> index was associated with <b>the</b> distance <b>hopped</b> on <b>the</b> non-injured limb (r = - 0. 66, p = 0. 04) but not on the injured limb. Transformation (logarithmic) of <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> distance scores and re-calculation of <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> index using <b>the</b> transformed scores increased the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> index in <b>the</b> detection of functional limitations from 20 to 60 % and 50 to 70 % using the normal limb symmetry reference norms of ≥ 85 % and 90 % respectively. Conclusion <b>The</b> distance <b>hopped</b> on <b>the</b> non-injured limb is a critical factor in detecting functional limitations using <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> index in patients with an ACL deficient knee. Logarithmic transformation of <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> distance scores minimizes the effect of the arithmetic differences between limbs however; the sensitivity of <b>the</b> <b>hop</b> index in detecting abnormal limb symmetry remains low. </p...|$|R
