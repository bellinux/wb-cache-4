CNN is {{sometimes referred to}} as CNN/U.S. (or CNN Domestic) to distinguish the American channel from its international sister network, CNN International.

Broadcast coverage of the U.S. channel extends to over 890,000 American hotel rooms, as well as carriage on cable and satellite providers throughout Canada. Globally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> is <b>the</b> world {{headquarters}} of <b>CNN.</b> <b>The</b> main newsrooms and studios for several of CNN's news channels {{are located in}} the building.

5000|$|Talkback Live {{was taped}} {{in an open}} air studio {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> atrium <b>in</b> {{downtown}} Atlanta. Filling the 200 plus seats of the audience was no small task. The show had several staff members dedicated to recruiting audience members for the daily show. Many tourists taking <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> Studio Tour were often persuaded to sit in the audience. The recruiters or [...] "Audience Coordinators" [...] as they were called often solicited people in popular downtown Atlanta spots with the promise of appearing on live television and a 15-minute MCI pre-paid calling card (MCI sponsored the program's call-in comment line).|$|R
50|$|Unable {{to resolve}} the arena situation, Kerner sold the Hawks to Atlanta real estate {{developer}} Tom Cousins and former Georgia governor Carl Sanders, who moved the team to Atlanta in 1968. While a new arena was being constructed, the team spent its first four seasons playing at Alexander Memorial Coliseum {{on the campus of}} Georgia Tech, winning their first Division title in the 1969-70 season with a 48-34 record in the Western Division. Cousins' firm soon developed the Omni Coliseum, a 16,500-seat, state-of-the-art downtown Atlanta arena, for the Hawks and the expansion Atlanta Flames hockey franchise, which opened in 1972 as the first phase of a massive sports, office, hotel and retail complex, most of which is now <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center.</b> Also <b>in</b> 1972, <b>the</b> Hawks debuted a new logo and new colors, trading the green and blue color scheme that the team had used for two years, in favor of white, gold, and red, the same colors the Flames used. The hawk head silhouette inside a circle remained as the team's logo, albeit simplified.|$|R

5000|$|The channel 17 {{transmitter}} {{was originally}} located at 1018 West Peachtree Street Northwest (it {{has since been}} relocated to the Atlanta suburb of North Druid Hills, Georgia), with the antenna located on a large self-supporting tower. The building at this site was once home to the studios of CBS affiliate WAGA-TV (now a Fox owned-and-operated station) and, later, channel 17, during its first three years as WJRJ-TV. Soon after being purchased by Turner, the station moved to new studio facilities a few blocks west at the former site of the Progressive Club, after briefly having had offices on Williams Street, across Interstate 75/85; these facilities now house Adult Swim and Williams Street Productions. It shared the ex-Progressive Club studios with CNN and Headline News until they moved into <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> downtown <b>in</b> 1987. Initially, WTCG was identified as [...] "Channel 17" [...] both locally in Atlanta and on cable providers outside of that area. The same shows that ran on the local Atlanta broadcast were also aired nationally. After the station adopted WTBS as its callsign, Turner branded the station as [...] "Superstation WTBS" [...] with reference within the logo to the channel 17 frequency in Atlanta. Many cable providers throughout the country even carried it on channel 17.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> opened <b>in</b> 1976 as the Omni Complex, {{which was}} a {{development}} by Cousins Properties. The Omni Coliseum, an NBA and NHL arena directly connected to the Omni Complex, opened 3 years earlier, on October 14, 1972. The Omni Complex largely sat vacant until CNN moved its headquarters there in 1987 from its Midtown Atlanta site (old home of the Progressive Club on 1050 Techwood Drive and home to Turner Broadcasting System). The facility originally offered office space to various business tenants, as well as consulates over the years. The main floor featured an indoor ice skating rink, {{as well as a}} small number of restaurants and a Gold Mine video arcade. More famously, Sid and Marty Krofft built an indoor amusement park called The World of Sid and Marty Krofft, inspired by the creations of the popular children's television producers. The park was the first indoor theme park and opened in 1976, but closed within six months. The complex also featured a multi-screen movie theater. For years, the theater offered showings of Gone with the Wind, Ted Turner's favorite movie. The theater was replaced during renovations to put in a new newsroom for <b>CNN's</b> website operations. <b>The</b> ice skating rink was filled in and a mosaic map of the world replaced it (featuring brass markers indicating <b>the</b> locations of <b>CNN</b> bureaux around <b>the</b> world). Prior to moving, CNN and Headline News were based in a former country club on Techwood Drive in Midtown Atlanta, sharing the facility with WTBS, which currently serves as the campus for nearly all other Turner networks and Turner Studios; the mansion facade also served as the logo for Turner's theatrical and home video arms during <b>the</b> 1990s. When <b>CNN</b> networks moved to <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> on July 13, 1987, CNN Headline News (now known as HLN) was the first network to broadcast a show from it at 3.00 ET with its program # 96,915. Their sister channel started live programming at 6.00 p.m. ET of that day.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} widely speculated that in 1993 media mogul Ted Turner, founder of the 24-hour news network CNN, was {{inspired}} to create a talk show after walking through the atrium of the company's headquarters <b>in</b> Atlanta, <b>The</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center.</b> As <b>the</b> story goes, Turner walked through {{the ground floor of}} <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> and saw <b>the</b> sunlight shining down into the atrium. He had a revelation that the side of atrium in front of The Turner Store would be a great place for a talk show. So one year later and after millions of dollars in renovations, a portion of <b>The</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> food court was transformed into a state of the art broadcast studio that seated over two hundred people and Talkback Live was created. One of CNN's top producers was tapped to head up this new concept, Teya Ryan, an award winning producer in charge of CNN's environmental features.|$|R

50|$|On March 24, 1988, Telemundo {{announced}} that it would end its agreement with Hispanic-American Broadcasting and enter into a news sharing partnership with CNN to produce early and late evening national newscasts, an hour-long weekend news review program, Resumen Semanal Telemundo-CNN, and news briefs that aired five times per day for Telemundo. CNN assumed production responsibilities for the network's newscasts, now titled Noticiero Telemundo CNN ("Telemundo CNN News"), on May 31 of that year, with production of the newscasts becoming based at the cable news channel's headquarters at <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> <b>in</b> Atlanta.|$|E
50|$|Effective November 2, 2015, CNN International's Armie Jarin-Bennett {{took over}} as Managing Editor of CNN Philippines, {{replacing}} Magsaysay.

50|$|On March 14, 2008, a EF-2 tornado {{passed through}} {{downtown}} Atlanta, damaging <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> and leaving water and {{dust in the}} upper floors. The ceiling of the atrium was also damaged, causing water to pour in and partially flood <b>the</b> food court. <b>CNN's</b> library was damaged, although it is unknown at the moment how much of its archives were damaged. Numerous injuries and widespread damage were reported overall. The Omni Hotel, attached to <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center,</b> was evacuated as a precaution, and more than 400 rooms had to be emptied of occupancy for two weeks.|$|R

50|$|The name {{originates}} {{from the}} location of the studios (which double as the home office for Adult Swim) at 1065 Williams Street NW in Atlanta, Georgia, near the current offices of TBS and TNT on Techwood Drive. They were the initial base for WTBS when it launched as a superstation in the mid-70s; it and other Turner operations moved into the Techwood campus (which was originally a country club, then the first HQ for CNN soon after CNN moved into <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> <b>Center</b> <b>in</b> downtown Atlanta) in the early 1980s. The street is named for early Atlanta settler Ammi Williams.|$|E
