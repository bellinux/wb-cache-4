The detected signal is inverted by the signal processor and fed to the <b>loud</b> <b>speaker.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS also cover a method of noise attenuation. USE - For a sound system. ADVANTAGE - Reduces interference and improves sound quality...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, model, build, and test a flat panel speaker and frame for a spherical dome {{structure}} being made into a simulator. The simulator will be a test bed for evaluating an immersive environment for human interfaces. This project focused on the <b>loud</b> <b>speakers</b> and a sound diffuser for the dome. The {{rest of the team}} worked on an Ambisonics 3 D sound system, video projection system, and multi-direction treadmill to create the most realistic scene possible. The main programs utilized in this project, were Pro-E and COMSOL. Pro-E was used for creating detailed figures for the fabrication of a frame that held a flat panel <b>loud</b> <b>speaker.</b> The <b>loud</b> <b>speaker</b> was made from a thin sheet of Plexiglas and 4 acoustic exciters. COMSOL, a multiphysics finite analysis simulator, was used to model and evaluate all stages of the <b>loud</b> <b>speaker,</b> frame, and sound diffuser. Acoustical testing measurements were utilized to create polar plots from the working prototype which were then compared to the COMSOL simulations to select the optimal design for the dome. The final goal of the project was to install the flat panel <b>loud</b> <b>speaker</b> design in addition to a sound diffuser on to the wall of the dome. After running tests in COMSOL on various speaker configurations, including a warped Plexiglas version, the optimal speaker design included a flat piece of Plexiglas with a rounded frame to match the curvature of the dome. Eight of these <b>loud</b> <b>speakers</b> will be mounted into {{an inch and a half}} of high performance acoustic insulation, or Thinsulate, that will cover the inside of the dome.

40|$|The {{most common}} method to {{attenuate}} noise in ventilation systems today is passive silencers. For these to efficiently attenuate frequencies below 400 Hz such silencers {{need to be}} large and a more neat solution to attenuate low frequencies is to use active noise control (ANC). The usage of ANC in ventilation systems is well known {{and there are several}} commercial products available. ANC is not, however, used on a wide basis due to its often high price and poor performance. Since the price {{is an important factor in}} ANC systems the expensive laboratory filters and the amplifier that is currently used in the experimental setup at Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH) need to be replaced with cheaper ones, but without too much performance loss. For easier implementation in ventilation systems the placement of the reference microphone is important, the shorter distance from the anti-noise <b>loud</b> <b>speaker</b> the easier the ANC system is to implement. But if the distance is so small that the ANC system is no longer causal the performance will be decreased and if the reference microphone is close enough to pick up acoustic feedback from the anti-noise <b>loud</b> <b>speaker</b> the performance will also be decreased. In this thesis the expensive laboratory filters will be exchanged to cheaper alternatives, power and total harmonic distortion (THD) measurements will be done on the amplifier that is driving the <b>loud</b> <b>speaker</b> and the reference microphones position will be investigated with measurements on the group delay of the system and the acoustic feedback between the <b>loud</b> <b>speaker</b> and the reference microphone...|$|R
