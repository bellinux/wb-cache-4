We tested the hypothesis that, {{in the absence of}} skin cooling, intermittent tactile cues, as coded by low-threshold skin mechanoreceptors, modulate the perception of sweat-induced skin wetness, independently of the level of physical wetness. Ten males (22 yr) performed an incremental exercise protocol during 2 trials designed to induce the same physical skin wetness but to induce lower (<b>TIGHT-FIT)</b> and higher (LOOSE-FIT) wetness perception. In the <b>TIGHT-FIT,</b> a tight fitting clothing ensemble limited intermittent skin-sweat-clothing tactile interactions. In the LOOSE-FIT, a loose fitting ensemble allowed free skin-sweat-clothing interactions. Heart rate, core and skin temperature, skin conductance (GSC), physical (wbody) and perceived skin wetness were recorded. Exercise-induced sweat production and physical wetness increased significantly (GSC: 3. 1 µS, SD 0. 3 to 18. 8 µS, SD 1. 3, p 0. 05). However, the limited intermittent tactile inputs generated by the <b>TIGHT-FIT</b> ensemble reduced significantly whole-body and regional wetness perception (p< 0. 01).

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Skin wetness {{perception}} {{is driven by}} inputs from cold and mechano sensitive skin afferents. We hypothesized that {{in the absence of}} skin cooling, sweat induced wetness perception can be manipulated by altering the mechanical interaction between skin, sweat and clothing. Ten males (22 ± 2 years) performed an incremental walking protocol (5 Km/h; gradient: 2 to 16 %) during two trials designed to produce the same level of physical skin wetness but to induce lower (<b>TIGHT-FIT)</b> and higher (LOOSE-FIT) wetness perception. In the <b>TIGHT-FIT,</b> a tight fitting clothing ensemble was worn to reduce the mechanical interaction between skin, sweat and clothing. In the LOOSE-FIT, a loose fitting ensemble augmented this interaction. To limit sweat evaporation and skin cooling, a vapour impermeable ensemble was also worn during the trials. Heart rate, rectal temperature, mean skin temperature, skin conductance (SC), whole body skin wetness (wbody) and wetness perception were recorded. Exercise induced sweat production and physical skin wetness increased significantly (SC: 3. 1 ± 0. 3 to 18. 8 ± 1. 3 µS, p 0. 05). However, the reduced mechanical interaction generated by the <b>TIGHT-FIT</b> ensemble lowered significantly wetness perception (p< 0. 01).

It provides a practical method for efficiently handling the geometric complexity of <b>tight-fit</b> insertions. The algorithm computes an insertion path consisting of small interference-free body motion steps. It formulates local, linearized configuration space constraints derived from the shapes and computes suc-cessive motion steps by solving a series of linear optimization problems whose solution corresponds to the maximum allowed displacement in a preferred direction satisfying the constraints. It either finds a successful insertion path or a stuck conftgura-tion.

Various parameters of twisted tapes are studied in this paper. Comparisons of the Nusselt number and friction factor of twisted tape with previous correlation {{are made to}} evaluate the turbulence models used. Effects of the clearance ratios (C= 0 (tight fit), 0. 2, 0. 5, 0. 7 and 1) and twist ratios (γ= 2. 5, 5. 0, 12. 5, 15. 6, 25, 41. 7) on heat transfer rate (Nu), friction factor (f) are examined under non-uniform heat flux using molten salt as the testing fluid. Furthermore, the influence of grid generation on prediction results is also reported. Numerical calculations were performed with FLUENT 6. 3. 2 code, {{in the range of}} Reynolds number 7485 - 30553. The results show that the insert twisted tape can significantly improve the uniformity of temperature distribution of tube wall and molten salt. The decreases of clearance rate C and twisted rate γ can enhance the heat transfer effectively. Especially when clearance rate C= 0, that is the heat transfer enhancement effect with <b>tight-fit</b> twisted tape is the most significant. But at the same time, the decreases of clearance rate and twisted rate also lead to increase the friction factor. These methods and results can be extended to the heat transfer enhancement of all the solar concentrated receivers...|$|E
40|$|Gondwana, with East Antarctica as its center, {{began to}} break up during Late Triassic to Early Jurassic time. Use of the {{satellite}} derived gravity map to approximate the ocean-continent boundary allows us to generate a much tighter fit for the reconstructed supercontinent then previously attempted. Major mantle plumes such as the Karoo-Ferrar Plume that first split Gondwana at about 182 Ma, the Parana-Etendeka plume at 132 Ma that split South America and Africa, the Marion plume at 88 Ma that split Madagascar and India and finally the Reunion hotspot that split the Mascarene Plateau from India at 64 Ma, were all critical events in the break-up of Gondwana. Our <b>tight-fit</b> produces overlap between cratonic East Antarctica and the Limpopo Plain of Mozambique {{but there is no}} evidence that the crustal material underlying the Limpopo Plain pre-dates the break-up of Gondwana. Likewise Madagascar has been reconstructed so that it substantially overlies coastal East Africa in the vicinity of the Anza Trough, an early Jurassic rift in Kenya. The western margin of the island of Madagascar may in fact be crustal material that is younger than the break-up. It may have been produced as a result of the Karoo mantle plume or some may have been the result of the Marion hotspot. Between South America and Africa there are three significant overlaps. Two of them are deltaic, and the third is the Abrolhos and Royal Charlotte banks which post-date Gondwanide breakup by 80 to 100 million years...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Overexpression of the {{cytochrome}} P 450 gene Cyp 6 g 1 confers {{resistance against}} DDT {{and a broad}} range of other insecticides in Drosophila melanogaster Meig. In the absence of crystal structures of CYP 6 G 1 or complexes with its substrates, structural studies rely on homology modelling and ligand docking to understand P 450 -substrate interactions. RESULTS: Homology models are presented for CYP 6 G 1, a P 450 associated with resistance to DDT and neonicotinoids, and two other enzymes associated with insecticide resistance in D. melanogaster, CYP 12 D 1 and CYP 6 A 2. The models are based on a template of the X-ray structure of the phylogenetically related human CYP 3 A 4, which is known for its broad substrate specificity. The model of CYP 6 G 1 has a much smaller active site cavity than the template. The cavity is also 'V'-shaped and is lined with hydrophobic residues, showing high shape and chemical complementarity with the molecular characteristics of DDT. Comparison of the DDT-CYP 6 G 1 complex and a non-resistant CYP 6 A 2 homology model implies that <b>tight-fit</b> recognition of this insecticide is important in CYP 6 G 1. The active site can accommodate differently shaped substrates ranging from imidacloprid to malathion but not the pyrethroids permethrin and cyfluthrin. CONCLUSION: The CYP 6 G 1, CYP 12 D 1 and CYP 6 A 2 homology models can provide a structural insight into insecticide resistance in flies overexpressing P 450 enzymes with broad substrate specificities...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a thesis}} {{presents}} a differential gear which {{is found in}} a tracked vehicle called BvS 10. The tracked vehicle is manufactured by BAE Systems Hägglunds AB in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. The differential gear has a bolted house. The differential meets the requirement specifications, {{but the problem is}} that the bolts are sheared off because of the extreme torque that the differential is exposed to resist. Previous report on the differential show pictures of bolts which have been sheared off at the threads. This report is also includes three lists that explain seven different proposals which some are approved and some are not, and the report also presents the force, tensile, and shear stress. In a bolted connection there is both axial tension stress and radial shear stress, which can lead to wear out and broken bolts. To solve the problem, better bolts are need for the differential gear housing halves. The bolts are from M 8 to M 10 and all bolts are not directly compatible, so geometric modifications might have to be done. This reports proposes several solutions to this complex problem and also analyzes the proposed solutions. The report also describes various theories from a technical and a historical point of view. Two flow charts have been created to show the work towards the presented solution. Although the analysis to welded joints and wedge joints have been included in the proposed solution. The report propose a <b>tight-fit</b> bolt with a tolerance specially made for the differential gear, so the shear stress occurs at the non-threaded part of the bolt. The tight-fitted bolt is recommended to be M 8 12. 9 UNB because of it’s safety factor. Larger bolts may not directly fit in the differential housing halves due to there is no enough material...|$|E
40|$|The South Atlantic rift basin {{evolved as}} {{a branch of}} a large Jurassic–Cretaceous intraplate rift zone between the African and South American plates during the final {{break-up}} of western Gondwana. While the relative motions between South America and Africa for post-break-up times are well resolved, many issues pertaining to the fit reconstruction and particularly the relation between kinematics and lithosphere dynamics during pre-break-up remain unclear in currently published plate models. We have compiled and assimilated data from these intraplated rifts and constructed a revised plate kinematic model for the pre-break-up evolution of the South Atlantic. Based on structural restoration of the conjugate South Atlantic margins and intracontinental rift basins in Africa and South America, we achieve a <b>tight-fit</b> reconstruction which {{eliminates the need for}} previously inferred large intracontinental shear zones, in particular in Patagonian South America. By quantitatively accounting for crustal deformation in the Central and West African Rift Zones, {{we have been able to}} indirectly construct the kinematic history of the pre-break-up evolution of the conjugate west African–Brazilian margins. Our model suggests a causal link between changes in extension direction and velocity during continental extension and the generation of marginal structures such as the enigmatic pre-salt sag basin and the São Paulo High. We model an initial E–W-directed extension between South America and Africa (fixed in present-day position) at very low extensional velocities from 140 Ma until late Hauterivian times (≈ 126 Ma) when rift activity along in the equatorial Atlantic domain started to increase significantly. During this initial ≈ 14 Myr-long stretching episode the pre-salt basin width on the conjugate Brazilian and west African margins is generated. An intermediate stage between ≈ 126 Ma and base Aptian is characterised by strain localisation, rapid lithospheric weakening in the equatorial Atlantic domain, resulting in both progressively increasing extensional velocities as well as a significant rotation of the extension direction to NE–SW. From base Aptian onwards diachronous lithospheric break-up occurred along the central South Atlantic rift, first in the Sergipe–Alagoas/Rio Muni margin segment in the northernmost South Atlantic. Final break-up between South America and Africa occurred in the conjugate Santos–Benguela margin segment at around 113 Ma and in the equatorial Atlantic domain between the Ghanaian Ridge and the Piauí-Ceará margin at 103 Ma. We conclude that such a multi-velocity, multi-directional rift history exerts primary control on the evolution of these conjugate passive-margin systems and can explain the first-order tectonic structures along the South Atlantic and possibly other passive margins...|$|E
