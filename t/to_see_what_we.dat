500|$|In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, {{replying}} to {{an interview}} question about what franchises {{he would like to}} work on, said that [...] "if [...] could come across everything that [...] played", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: [...] "You make RPGs, we make RPGs, it would be great <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> could do together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together." [...] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger {{as a starting point for}} that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E
500|$|On April Fools' Day on , Sunsoft {{announced}} that a sequel to the game would be released on the Virtual Console titled Blaster Master: Destination Fred. According to their press release, the game was only purported to be tested on several PlayChoice-10 machines in the Los Angeles area between 1988 and 1989. Upon discovery of copies {{of the game in}} Sunsoft's headquarters in Japan, Gaijinworks' founder Victor Ireland said: [...] "I was blown away when I saw these. When I was going through boxes of stored code, promotional items, and ROMs <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had on hand to release for the U.S. Virtual Console market, finding these nine completely unknown cartridges literally stunned me. I knew it had to be put up on the Virtual Console as fast as we could make it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Mardas {{often said}} that the Abbey Road studio was [...] "no good", much to {{producer}} George Martin's annoyance: [...] "The trouble was that Alex was always coming to the studios <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were doing and to learn from it, {{while at the same}} time saying ‘These people are so out of date.’ But I found it very difficult to chuck him out, because the boys liked him so much. Since it was very obvious that I didn’t, a minor schism developed". Mardas boasted that he could build a much better studio, with a 72-track tape machine, instead of the 4-track at Abbey Road—which was being updated at the time to an 8-track—so he was given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in the basement of Apple headquarters on Savile Row. One of Mardas' more outrageous plans was to replace the acoustic baffles around Starr's drums with an invisible sonic force field. Starr remembered that Mardas bought some [...] "huge" [...] computers from British Aerospace, which were stored in his barn, but [...] "they never left the barn", and were later sold as scrap metal.|$|E

500|$|While Nintendo did not {{formally}} announce {{plans for a}} Metroid title for the Wii U, Animal Crossing producer Katsuya Eguchi mentioned in an interview how such a title could {{make use of the}} console's tablet controller to perform actions such as scanning enemies and retrieving information. A demo program for the Wii U, titled Battle Mii, showed Mii characters dressed in Varia Suits, as well as Samus's gunship from Other M; this was later revealed as a mini-game called [...] "Metroid Blast", which is featured in Nintendo Land. Nintendo Land producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who was also involved with the Prime trilogy, has declared that this minigame reflects his ideas for future Metroid titles, while also displaying the series is [...] "a franchise that we value and we certainly want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can do with it in the future". Miyamoto added that Retro is [...] "a very high priority" [...] in the development of more Metroid games. In 2014, a former artist from Next Level Games revealed his company had interest in developing a 3DS Metroid game, going as far as building a prototype, before Nintendo asked them to do [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|The One Hot Minute tour began {{several days}} {{after the release of}} the album. The band opened the tour with a European leg. Kiedis felt that as a musician, he was {{becoming}} somewhat lackluster. The short European leg ended in early November, and the U.S. portion was scheduled to begin 10 days later; however, it was postponed until early February. A few shows into the commencement of the U.S. leg, Kiedis badly injured his leg while engaging in what he calls [...] "eyes-closed robotic dancing". He tripped over a monitor and fell off the stage, ending up hanging by his calf from his microphone cable, resulting in a cast which he wore for the next two months. Kiedis reflected that it [...] "was nice to see that people were still interested in coming out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do", as there had been a four-year gap since the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Following the conclusion of the U.S. tour, the Chili Peppers took two weeks off before several Australia and New Zealand performances. The band then played at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in San Francisco, before finishing the tour in Europe.|$|E

Director Yoshirou Kimura started work on the project as he helped his colleagues at Love-de-Lic finish that company's final game, [...] Production of Chulip began in the earliest days of the PS2, making it a challenge for the development team who only had experience with the original PlayStation. Kimura valued his team members' opinions and ideas while working on it. [...] "It was challenging and interesting at the same time to program a game for a new console," [...] he stated. [...] "We were definitely eager <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> could do with it." [...] The original idea for Chulip came when Kimura visited Western countries and saw couples kissing in public, a custom not often performed among Japanese people. Kimura came up with game's title after attending a party in Tokyo. As the intoxicated partygoers talked about video games, they began to humorously say [...] "chu-shite" [...] (lit. [...] "kiss me"). The title Chulip is a play on words: a cross between chu (the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound of a kiss) and the English word lip, as well as the Japanese rendering of the word tulip.|$|E

2500|$|Arriving in England for {{the first}} time, the American writer, in Hazlitt's judgement, saw what he {{encountered}} with the eyes of one steeped {{in the writings of}} the previous century. Irving, he notes, has absorbed the refined style of the older writers and writes well: [...] "Mr. Irvine's [...] language is with great taste and felicity modeled on that of Addison, Goldsmith, Sterne, or Mackenzie"; but what he sees might have been seen with their eyes, and are such as are scarcely to be found in modern England. [...] "Instead of looking round <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are, he sets to work to describe us as we were—at second hand. He has Parson Adams, or Sir Roger de Coverley in his mind's eye; and he makes a village curate or a country 'squire sit to these admired models for their portraits {{in the beginning of the}} nineteenth century." [...] As such characters and customs hardly had any actual existence any more, Hazlitt even suggests that they might have been spun out of Irving's imagination, based on his reading of the English authors of the previous century.|$|E
2500|$|According to editor John D. Dunning, {{the first}} {{cut of the}} film was four and {{one-half}} hours long (although a mass media report in March 1959 indicated the running time was closer to five hours). A total of [...] was shot for the film. William Wyler said {{his goal was to}} bring the running time down to three and a half hours. Editors Dunning and Winters saw their job as condensing the picture without losing any information or emotional impact. Dunning later said that he felt some of the leper colony sequence could have been cut. The most difficult editing decisions, he also said, came during scenes which involved Jesus Christ, as these contained almost no dialogue and most of the footage was purely reaction shots by actors. Editing was also complicated by the 70mm footage being printed. [...] Because no editing equipment (such as the Moviola) existed which could handle the 70mm print, the 70mm footage would be reduced to 35mm and then cut. This caused much of the image to be lost, and according to Dunning [...] "you didn't even know what you had until you cut the negative. We'd print up the 70 now and then, and project it <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were getting against what we were seeing in the 35. We really did it blind." [...] When the film was edited into its final form, it ran 213 minutes and included just [...] of film. It was the third-longest motion picture ever made at the time, behind Gone With The Wind and The Ten Commandments.|$|E
