25|$|It is {{also used}} to reduce the {{symptoms}} of peripheral neuropathy such as post-herpetic neuralgia caused by shingles. Capsaicin <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch</b> (Qutenza) for the management of this particular therapeutic indication (pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia) was approved as a therapeutic by the U.S. FDA, but a subsequent application for Qutenza to be used as an analgesic in HIV neuralgia was refused.|$|E
25|$|A {{large area}} of {{interest}} in nanomedicine is the <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch</b> because {{of the possibility of}} a painless application of therapeutic agents with very few side effects. Transdermal patches have been limited to administer a small number of drugs, such as nicotine, because of the limitations in permeability of the skin. Development of techniques that increase skin permeability has led to more drugs that can be applied via transdermal patches and more options for patients.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone is {{included}} in the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines, which are the most important medications needed in a basic health system. It is available as a generic medication. The price depends on the form of testosterone used.

40|$|<b>Transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> are {{now widely}} used as cosmetic, topical and transdermal {{delivery}} systems. These patches represent a key outcome from {{the growth in}} skin science, technology and expertise developed through trial and error, clinical observation and evidence-based studies that {{date back to the}} first existing human records. This review begins with the earliest topical therapies and traces topical delivery to the present-day <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches,</b> describing along the way the initial trials, devices and drug delivery systems that underpin current <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> and their actives. This is followed by consideration of the evolution in the various patch designs and their limitations as well as requirements for actives to be used for transdermal delivery. The properties of and issues {{associated with the use of}} currently marketed products, such as variability, safety and regulatory aspects, are then described. The review concludes by examining future prospects for <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> and drug delivery systems, such as the combination of active delivery systems with patches, minimally invasive microneedle patches and cutaneous solutions, including metered-dose systems...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} {{effort was}} done to formulate <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> (Paranjothi 1998) ofDiltiazem Hydrochloride (DH), a benzothiazepine calcium channel blocker, mainly meantfor the treatment of hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris; by using hydroxy ethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose and Eudragit RLPO. Six batches of <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> wereprepared by solvent casting technique in which the best formulation was found out. Thepolymers HEC, EC and Eudragit RLPO were incorporated with Diltiazem Hydrochloride invarious proportions, out of which the best formulation on the ratio [HEC: EC: EUDRAGITRLPO- 1 : 1 : 2] with the drug was determined. The prepared <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> werespherical, uniform in shape and white in color. The obtained transdermal films wereevaluated for physico-chemical characteristics, in vitro release profile and in vivo evaluationin albino mice.

25|$|Rivastigmine {{tartrate}} is a {{white to}} off-white, fine crystalline powder that is both lipophilic (soluble in fats) and hydrophilic (soluble in water). It comes {{in a variety of}} administrations including a capsule, solution and a <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch.</b> Like other cholinesterase inhibitors, it requires doses to be increased gradually over several weeks; this is usually referred to as the titration phase. Oral doses of rivastigmine should be titrated with a 3mg per day increment every 2 to 4 weeks.|$|E
25|$|For oral dosing, {{an initial}} dose of 1.5mg twice daily is {{recommended}} {{followed by an}} increase by 1.5mg/dose after four weeks. The dose should increase as long as side effects are tolerable. Patients should be reminded to take with food. For the <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch,</b> an initial dose of 4.6mg per day increases to 9.5mg per day after four weeks if the patient is not experiencing any intolerable side effects. Patients or caregivers should be reminded to remove the old patch every day, rotate sites and place a new one. It is recommended that the patch {{be applied to the}} upper back or torso.|$|E
25|$|Comparisons between orally {{administered}} {{pill and}} <b>transdermal</b> <b>patch</b> suggests that when estrogens are taken orally {{the risks of}} thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism are increased, an effect which is not seen with topical administration. Transdermal and transvaginal administration {{are not subject to}} first pass metabolism, and so lack the anabolic effects that oral therapy has on hepatic synthesis of Vitamin K dependent clotting factors. This effect refers only to patches for post menopausal hormone replacement, which contain estradiol, not those used in oral contraceptive therapy, which contain ethinylestradiol. The latter is associated with an increased incidence of venous clot. The WHI also showed an increased incidence arterial disease, namely stroke, in patients who began HRT after the age of 65, although this effect was not significantly present in those who began therapy during their fifth decade.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present study was to develop matrix moderated <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> of Pioglitazone HCl using various ratios of Ficus carica fruit mucilage. Physical {{parameters}} such as moisture content, moisture uptake, tensile strength, elongation and folding endurance were evaluated. The matrix type <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> were prepared using Pioglitazone HCl with Ficus carica fruit mucilage by the solvent evaporation technique. The interactions between Pioglitazone Hcl and Ficus carica fruit mucilage and Pioglitazone HCl were performed. The <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> were subjected to various physicochemical parameters like mechanical properties, permeation studies and skin irritation studies were performed. The prepared patches possessed satisfactory preformulary and formulary characteristics. In vitro permeation studies were performed using a Keshary-Chien diffusion cell across hairless Albino rat skin. The nonionic surfactants Span 80, Glycerin, Propylene glycol in the formulation played a key role as permeability enhancers. The patches were found to seemingly free of potentially hazardous skin irritation. The experimental result shows that the release of drug from the patch was delayed in controlled manner as the proportion of Ficus carica fruit mucilage increased. It was concluded that Pioglitazone HCl can be developed as a <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> with Ficus carica fruit mucilage...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to develop a suitable <b>transdermal</b> matrix <b>patch</b> of ketorolac tromethamine with different proportions of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and ethyl cellulose (EC) using a D-optimal mixture design. The prepared <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> were subjected to different physicochemical evaluation. The surface topography of the patches was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The drug-polymer interaction studies were performed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) technique. A correlation between in-vitro drug-release and in-vitro skin permeation was established and the criterion of desirability was employed to optimize the formulation. The results of the physicochemical characterization and in-vitro permeation of the prepared patches were promising to formulate <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> with PVP/EC combinations...|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of nicotine-replacement therapies {{is very low}} in India, as {{there are only a}} few importers. Currently, negligible forms of <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> are available, they are expensive, and not easily accessible to the common man. In this study, an attempt was made to develop <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> of nicotine, which are cost effective and conducive to the Indian market. Two types of patches, monolayered and bilayered, were prepared. The monolayered patch bore a rate- controlling membrane, whereas the bilayered, served as matrix type. The physical charecteristics of the patches were evaluated by standard techniques. The drug content was found to be uniform in the patches. In vitro release studies of <b>transdermal</b> <b>patches</b> showed a biphasic release pattern, with diffusion as the dominating mechanism of drug release for the matrix type, while the membrane-controlled released nicotine, gradually over the 24 h study...|$|R
