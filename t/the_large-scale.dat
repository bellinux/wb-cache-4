5|$|At {{the time}} Devers took command, the Armored Force had two {{operational}} armored divisions: the 1st Armored Division at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Knox, and one independent tank battalion, the 70th Tank Battalion at Fort George G.

Despite some successes, the maneuvers revealed armored unit and equipment operational deficiencies, plus {{a general lack of}} combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor performance to poorly-trained junior and staff officers, but also saw doctrinal deficiencies that hampered the coordination of tanks, infantry and artillery.|$|E

5|$|By August22, city {{officials}} in Corpus Christi, Texas {{declared a state}} of emergency as Bret was considered a significant threat to the region.

Later that day, Texas State Highway 361 and docks in Port Aransas were shut down.

5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety {{had fallen out}} of favor. According to Adams, <b>the</b> <b>large-scale</b> switch to a non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of a}} death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
