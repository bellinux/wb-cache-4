[...] In 1852, the law was amended, establishing a committee of no more than five persons, with whom {{the chairman of the board}} is established. The amended act also stated, [...] "no certificate issued to a teacher shall be good for a term for more than one year, and shall not be good for any county other than the county that issued the certificate."
