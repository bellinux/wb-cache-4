25|$|The {{cantilever}} gulled wings followed {{normal practice}} with a plywood-covered <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> leading edge, mainspar, ribs and false rear spar {{to support the}} full-span flaps and ailerons. DFS-style airbrakes were fitted {{at the rear of}} the mainspar with the upper plates hinging forwards and the lower plates hinging rearwards. A comprehensive instrument panel was fitted in the cockpit which included:-A large plaque on the instrument panel; AirSpeed Indicator (8), Vertical Speed Indicator to 5m/s, Vertical Speed Indicator to 15m/s, an artificial horizon with slip ball, altimeter, longitudinal clinometer, stopwatch, compass and oxygen pressure gauge (oxygen equipment was housed behind the pilots seat).|$|E

The buckling and post buckling behavior of these <b>torsion</b> <b>boxes</b> demonstrated consistent results. Prior to performing the buckling tests, the initial geometric imperfections of the boxes were scanned and recorded. The tests were complemented by finite element calculations, which were performed for each box. These detailed calculations have also assisted in identifying critical regions of the boxes and the boxes were reinforced accordingly to avoid their premature failure. The tests indicated that: the torsion carrying capacity is laminate lay-up dependent; axial compression results were in very good agreement with previous tests performed with single identical panels; and that the boxes have a very high post-buckling carrying capacity...|$|R
25|$|Another {{example of}} the Bf 109's {{advanced}} design {{was the use of}} a single, I-beam main spar in the wing, positioned more aft than usual (to give enough room for the retracted wheel), thus forming a stiff D-shaped <b>torsion</b> <b>box.</b> Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear edges of the wings, but the D-box was much stiffer torsionally, and eliminated the need for the rear spar. The wing profile was the NACA 2R1 14.2 at the root and NACA 2R1 11.35 at the tip, with a thickness to chord ratio of 14.2% at the root and 11.35% at the tip.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there have}} been no new AV-8B variants, in 1990 McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace began discussions on an interim {{aircraft}} between the AV-8B and the next generation of advanced STOVL aircraft. The Harrier III would have presented an [...] "evolutionary approach to get the most from the existing aircraft", as many of the structures employed on the Sea Harrier and AV-8B would be used. The wing and the <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> were to be enlarged to accommodate extra fuel and hardpoints to improve the aircraft's endurance. Due to the increase in size, the wing would have had folding wingtips. To meet the heavier weight of the aircraft, Rolls-Royce was expected to design a Pegasus engine variant that would have produced [...] more thrust than the latest production variant at the time. The Harrier III would have carried weapons such as AIM-120 AMRAAM and AIM-132 ASRAAM missiles. Boeing and BAE Systems continued studying the design until the early 2000s, when the project was abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|Breguet's first sailplane, the Type 900 {{had some}} success in {{national}} competitions but failed to impress at the two World Championships of 1950 and 1952, partly because of its short wingspan. [...] The 901 is a development of this aircraft, retaining its mid wing layout and largely wooden construction. The wing of the 901 is straight tapered and built around a single spar, with a leading edge <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> and fabric covered aft of the spar. On the 901 the <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> was skinned with a plywood-klegecell (a plastic foam) sandwich rather than the ply of the 900. At 17.32m (57ft8in), its span is 2.97m (9ft9in) greater than the 900, raising the aspect ratio from 12.9 to 20. [...] There are long span, short chord slotted flaps inboard, mid-chord airbrakes and tips finished with small [...] "salmon" [...] fairings. Both designs have plywood skinned fuselages, though that of the 901 is longer in the nose where the cockpit has an extended, single piece canopy.|$|E

The tests indicated that the torsion-carrying capacity was dependent on stringer geometry and layup; axial compression results were in very good agreement with previous tests carried out with single identical panels; and the boxes have a very high postbuckling-carrying capacity. Comparisons of the experimentally experienced first (skin) buckling loads and collapse torques with finite element analyses predictions were found to be in good agreement for torsion and for axial compression. The experimental results under combined loading were consistently lower than with the numerical results. This might have stemmed from repeated buckling tests used in the present test program to generate the experimental interaction curve, which could have introduced residual strains/deformations in the skin that influenced the skin buckling load capacity, thus yielding a lower first skin buckling load in the subsequent loading stages...|$|R
2500|$|The Dart was {{originally}} a 15 m sailplane, aimed immediately at the 1964 UK Gliding Championships and beyond at the 1965 World Championships. Its wings were shoulder mounted, with 2o dihedral and about 0.75o forward sweep at quarter chord. [...] They were built around spruce spars with a plywood covered <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> {{ahead to the}} leading edge, [...] fabric covered behind and with plywood covered ailerons. The mid-chord airbrakes were arranged as pairs {{above and below the}} wings.|$|E
2500|$|The Slingsby Swallow was a wooden-framed aircraft, {{covered in}} a mixture of plywood and fabric.

2500|$|Following Breguet's {{success in}} the 1954 and 1956 World Gliding Championships with the Type901, Jean Cayla {{designed}} the Type905 for the 1958 event. It is a Standard Class sailplane with a 15m (49ft3in) span. Like its predecessor, the 905 is a cantilever mid-wing monoplane but the its structure contains glass reinforced plastic, more plastic foam and less fabric. It also has a butterfly tail. It has a wing of straight tapered planform, terminated with small [...] "salmon" [...] fairings at the squared-off wingtips. [...] The major structural component is the main spar plus nose D-box unit, skinned with a plastic foam-filled ("Klegecel") sandwich with 0.6mm (0.024in)-ply outer layers. Ribs, ailerons and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are attached to this <b>torsion</b> <b>box.</b> [...] The whole upper wing surface and outboard lower surface is ply, supported by an internal Klegecell lining, with fabric below, aft of the spar. [...] Slotted ailerons occupy the outer 45% of the trailing edge; there are no flaps. [...] Each complete wing weighs just 34kg (75lb).|$|E
50|$|The Bąk {{was built}} {{primarily}} of wood with plywood in a semi-monocoque fuselage and cantilevered single spar wooden wings, with plywood skinned leading edge <b>torsion</b> <b>boxes</b> and wing roots, mid {{set on the}} fuselage with marked dihedral. The tail unit comprised a fin, with rudder, integral with the fuselage and a cantilever ply and fabric covered all-flying tailplane, all control surfaces were statically balanced and mounted on ball bearings. Various engines of 16 to 32 hp could be fitted, {{with the majority of}} the production Bąk II's was the 32 hp Sarolea Albatros engine driving a twoblade fixed pitch Szomański propeller.|$|R
50|$|The {{cantilever}} two-part wing had {{a rectangular}} centre section and tapering outer sections from approximately ⅓-span.

Large DFS-style airbrakes opening from {{the top and bottom}} surfaces aft of the main spar provided adequate approach control. Ailerons were fitted to the trailing edge over the outer ⅓-span. Constructed entirely of wood with steel fittings the single-spar wings had plywood-covered <b>torsion</b> <b>boxes</b> forming the leading edges, and fabric covering aft of the mainspars.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} WA 20 Javelot, later {{known as}} the Javelot I and first flown in August 1956, has an all wood wing of 16.08 m (52 ft 9 in) span and a wing area of 15.5 m² (199.6 sq ft) giving it an aspect ratio of 16.7. It is shoulder mounted and is in two pieces built around single box spars with leading edge D-shaped, plywood skinned <b>torsion</b> <b>boxes.</b> The wing is fabric covered aft of the spar. There are small endplates at the wing tips, partly to protect them on the ground. The airbrakes deploy both {{above and below the}} wing.|$|R
2500|$|The wing was tapered in {{planform}} and {{was built}} around two spars, {{though there were}} two variants of the internal wing structure. [...] The first three aircraft, type L20 A1, had wings stiffened against torsion by internal wire bracing but later aircraft, type L20 B1, used a <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> formed by plywood skin ahead of the rear spar. [...] Like the later version of the L15, the L20 used a combination of conventional ailerons and unusual wingtip flaps, rotating about an axis well ahead of mid-chord. [...] The ailerons were directly controlled from the cockpit as normal and the tip flaps were linked to them with external rods and cranks. [...] On early examples these flaps were roughly square, with a side less than a half of the chord at the tip, but at some later time they were reshaped to produce wing curved tips. The wings could be detached at the root in about five minutes, reducing {{the width of the}} L20 to [...] for road transport on a trailer pulled by a car.|$|E
2500|$|The Sky is {{a wooden}} aircraft, using the {{traditional}} spruce for stressed members and birch ply elsewhere. [...] Its wing has a constant chord inner section {{over the first}} 30% of span, then tapers on both edges to a rounded tip. [...] The 20% increase in span over the Gull IV was achieved with two extra rib bays in the inner part and a 2 in (51mm) increase in rib separation outboard. [...] The Sky was designed to meet semi-aerobatic requirements which together with an aspect ratio of 18.7, which was high for the time, required the single box spars, 6 in (152mm) wide at their greatest, to be massive. Their weight is 25% of that of the whole aircraft. [...] The wing ahead of this spar, positioned at 30% chord, forms a plywood covered <b>torsion</b> <b>box.</b> [...] Behind it, the wing is fabric covered. Ailerons, divided to allow for wing flexure, fill the tapered trailing edges. Air brakes are mounted on the spars as aerodynamically balanced pairs above and below wing; the lower panel open into the airstream and lever the upper ones against it. [...] There were no flaps.|$|E
50|$|A <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> {{consists}} of two thin layers of material (skins) {{on either side of}} a lightweight core, usually a grid of beams. It is designed to resist torsion under an applied load. A hollow core door is probably the most common example of a <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> (stressed skin) structure. The principle is to use less material more efficiently. The <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> uses the properties of its thin surfaces to carry the imposed loads primarily through tension while the close proximity of the enclosed core material compensates for the tendency of the opposite side to buckle under compression.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the Gull {{aircraft}} was of semi-monocoque wood and plywood throughout, {{with a mixture}} of plywood and fabric skinning and covering. The wings were skinned with plywood forward of the main spar to form <b>torsion</b> <b>boxes</b> which increased their rigidity. They had a distinctive gull wing form, as the inner 2 metres carried marked dihedral out to the attachment points of the lift struts to the wing spars. Beyond, the wings lacked dihedral. The rectangular planform of the inner wings included the gulled portion and 2 metres beyond, with spoilers in the upper surface outboard of the gull joint in some later aircraft. Ailerons filled the trailing edge of the tapered outer wings.|$|R
50|$|The Amiot 110-S had a thick-section wing with a constant-chord centre section, occupying {{about one-third}} of the span, and tapered, blunt-tipped outer sections. They were mounted {{on the top of the}} {{fuselage}} with about 4° of dihedral. The wing structure was a development of the torsion-resistant box spars used in high-performance gliders, with three spars, built out of interconnected steel tubes, forming the central <b>torsion</b> <b>boxes.</b> The wings were duralumin-skinned, riveted to the substructure with separate enclosed leading edge sections which were bolted onto the central box, and the rear parts of the wing were similarly constructed. All sections were individually watertight with the leading edges housing the fuel tanks. The outer sections had high-aspect-ratio ailerons along their trailing edges.|$|R
50|$|Realising that {{aircraft}} {{form drag}} {{is directly related}} to cross-sectional area of bodies moving through the air, the students of Akaflieg Stuttgart (Akademische Fliegergruppe - academic flying group) investigated methods of reducing the cross-sectional area of fuselage bodies, including the prone-position pilot, where the pilot lies horizontally with his body roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fuselage. They noted an additional benefit of such a configuration is the pilot's increased resistance to the effects of 'g'. With very little previous research to take advantage of Akaflieg Stuttgart designed the FS 17 glider for flight trials of prone position cockpits.The FS-17 was an all-wood low-wing cantilever monoplane with emphasis on good low-speed flight characteristics, to reduce the risk to the pilot in stalling accidents, and a maximum load factor of 14g. The fuselage was designed with increased stiffness, to provide increased crash protection for the pilot, and the wing leading edges formed <b>torsion</b> <b>boxes.</b> The pilot lay above the wing centre section under an extensively glazed canopy.|$|R

50|$|The Dynamic VR7 {{introduced}} a new construction method in which a smaller wooden core was wrapped in wet fibreglass, as opposed to pre-dried sheets of fibreglass being glued to the core (essentially replacing metal sheets). The result was a <b>torsion</b> <b>box,</b> which made the ski much stronger. The VR7, and its more famous follow-on VR17, was the first fibreglass ski {{that could be used}} for men's racing, and quickly took over that market. Over time, materials for both the core and <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> have changed, with wood, various plastic foams, fibreglass, kevlar and carbon fiber all being used in different designs. <b>Torsion</b> <b>box</b> designs continue to dominate cross-country ski designs, but is less common for alpine and ski touring.|$|E

50|$|Another {{manifestation of}} the DLR's wheel {{geometry}} and tight rail curves is that this setup generates noise. This noise is amplified {{by the use of}} steel <b>box</b> <b>torsion</b> girders (e.g. Marsh Wall elevated road crossing adjacent to South Quay DLR Station).|$|R
40|$|The <b>torsion</b> of <b>box</b> {{beams of}} {{rectangular}} section, {{the edges of}} which are strengthened by flanges, and of which one side is lacking, is analyzed by the energy method.

The result was checked experimentally on duralumin and plywood <b>boxes.</b> The <b>torsion</b> recorded was 10 to 30 percent less than that given by the calculation, owing to self-stiffening...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} gives {{a method for}} {{computing}} the <b>torsion</b> of <b>boxes</b> with thin shear-resistant or simply tension-resistant walls under any torsional load, support and dimension. The final stress condition is developed {{from that of a}} principal system with unconstrained sectional warping corresponding to Bredt's formula and an additional stress condition due to constrained cross-sectional warping. This is computed by means of the deflection condition of the principal system from a statically indeterminate calculation. Conformably, the torsional rigidity of the final system is derived from that of the principal system with unconstrained sectional buckling...|$|R
50|$|The {{cantilever}} gull wings {{were constructed}} as a divided pair, with diagonal supplementary spars and plywood skinned leading edge D <b>torsion</b> <b>box.</b> The fuselage was constructed as a semi-monocoque shell, with integral fin carrying the rudder and all-flying tailplane.

50|$|It had a one piece, {{cantilever}} {{high wing}} which was straight edged and strongly tapered (taper ratio 0.37) to roughly semi-elliptical tips.

50|$|The A2 is a single-seat {{cantilever}} mid-wing monoplane, its high-aspect-ratio wing {{built around}} an all-metal <b>torsion</b> <b>box</b> and spar.

50|$|The Ruhrtaler Ru.3 was {{a single}} engine, parasol wing {{aircraft}} of mixed construction. Its one piece wing was built around a single wooden spar, with a plywood covering forward of it forming a <b>torsion</b> resistant <b>box.</b> Elsewhere the wing was fabric covered. Broad, short ailerons were hinged on an auxiliary spar and extended to the wing tips. In plan the leading edge was swept back at about 9° but the trailing edge was unswept. The tips were elliptical {{and there was a}} wide but shallow cut-out to assist the pilot's upward view.|$|R
50|$|Though I-beams are {{excellent}} for unidirectional bending {{in a plane}} parallel to the web, they do not perform as well in bidirectional bending.

It had a high cantilever wing with a single spar, ahead of which ply covering formed a <b>torsion</b> resisting <b>box.</b> Behind the spar it was fabric covered. The leading edge was straight and unswept but forward sweep on the trailing edge both tapered the wing in plan and resulted in a forward sweep of 1° at the spar.
