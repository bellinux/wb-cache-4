25|$|Räikkönen {{qualified}} on {{the front}} row for Ferrari's home race at Monza, but a complete lack of movement {{for a few seconds}} at the start saw him drop down the order. Showing good pace however, he managed to pick his way {{from the back of the}} field to fifth. Räikkönen blamed a 'clutch positioning' problem, whilst team boss Arrivabene suggested Räikkönen had caused the anti-stall <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> himself due to 'messing with his fingers' although he clarified it saying he did not fully know at the time. Nevertheless, he remained at one podium of the season, as team mate Vettel finished second to take his tally to eight in twelve races. At the Singapore Grand Prix, Räikkönen showed consistent performances in the practice sessions and qualified in 3rd, behind Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo. Räikkönen maintained the position through the race despite being uncomfortable with the car, to take his second podium finish of the season. Räikkönen ended the season by finishing third in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to take his third podium of the year and securing fourth place in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
500|$|Entering {{their second}} {{game of the}} season against Baltimore, the Steelers' defense ranked first in the league, while the Ravens' defense ranked second. [...] "We're going to win by any means necessary. If the defense has to score, if the special teams have <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> a score, or if the offense has to score 50 points – {{whatever}} it takes to win," [...] stated James Harrison prior to the game.|$|E
500|$|David Blackwell of Enterline Media {{thought that}} Sanctuary was an [...] "interesting concept", but felt {{the first six}} episodes were [...] "hit-or-miss". Of the series' use of green screen for sets, Blackwell stated [...] "{{sometimes}} it really works and sometimes the CGI sets could use improvement". He also felt that Amanda Tapping was convincing as a British scientist. In conclusion, Blackwell stated [...] "Sanctuary does take a while <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in,</b> {{but it is a}} very good series once the writers actually write something with depth." [...] Alex Walker of Den of Geek rated the first season three stars out of five, stating [...] "the acting and scripting is good, but Sanctuary lacks the wit and charm of the genre's top shows like Doctor Who and Battlestar Galactica. Also, the way some episodes alternate between fighting and exposition gives the impression of watching someone else play a videogame." [...] Walker also dubbed it a [...] "poor man's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, but said that it [...] "makes for [...] "agreeable early-evening viewing". Walker also believed that the DVD of the first season should really be for [...] "die-hard fans only".|$|E

500|$|The {{weather and}} {{conditions}} on the grid were before dry for the race. The air temperature was [...] with signs of a breeze which could blow sand onto the track and impede the cars' grip. Massa got the best start of the frontrunners off the line, as he passed Kubica into the first corner to take the lead. Hamilton's poor start caused his anti-stall system <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in,</b> and he was passed by six drivers to fall back to ninth. Räikkönen benefited from Hamilton's start by moving up to third, ahead of Kovalainen, Trulli and Heidfeld. As Massa extended his lead {{at the front of}} the race, Hamilton, who trailed Alonso, collided with the back of the Renault, knocking the McLaren's front wing off the car. Suffering handling difficulties, Hamilton returned to the pit-lane for a new nose section, and rejoined in 18th place. Räikkönen took second place when he passed Kubica on lap three; Heidfeld took fourth when he passed Trulli and Kovalainen in separate manoeuvres. Further down the field, Vettel retired from the race on the first lap after twice colliding with other cars; Button, Sutil and Coulthard pitted to repair early damage.|$|E

2500|$|Fat Joe {{was born}} on August 19, 1970, in the South Bronx area of New York City, where he was raised by parents of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. He lived in public housing and began {{stealing}} {{at a young age}} to support his family. He also admits that he was a bully in his childhood. His brother introduced him to rap music. [...] As a teenager, he was highly influenced by fellow Latino rapper Big Pun. [...] Fat Joe explained the rapper's influence on him by saying [...] "Latinos before us who had the opportunity to do it just didn't know how to do it. They came in trying to do this black music, waving flags. [...] we're trying <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> the doors for other Latinos and represent our people, and it shows." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rundstedt, {{like most}} German officers, had favoured {{the policy of}} good {{relations}} with the Soviets followed by the Reichswehr commander General Hans von Seekt during the Weimar Republic years, when the Soviet connection was seen as a counter to the threat from Poland. He was also apprehensive about launching a new war in the east while Britain was undefeated. If so, he did nothing to oppose them, and in this he was in company even with officers who disliked and opposed Hitler's regime, such as Halder, who threw themselves into planning the invasion, and believed it would succeed. Even the most experienced officers shared Hitler's contempt for the Soviet state and army. [...] "You have only <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> the door," [...] Hitler told Rundstedt, [...] "and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down." ...|$|E

50|$|During {{his time}} at Hull, McKechnie was the first goalkeeper ever to save a penalty in a {{competitive}} penalty shootout, against Manchester United in the semi-finals of the Watney Cup in August 1970; he saved from Denis Law. He subsequently took the deciding <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> take the penalty shootout <b>to</b> further five <b>kicks</b> from each side, but his kick flew over the bar and put Hull City out of the competition. He therefore was the first goalkeeper <b>to</b> concede a <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> a shootout (<b>to</b> George Best), the first goalkeeper <b>to</b> save a <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> a shootout (from Denis Law), the first goalkeeper <b>to</b> take a <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> a shootout, and {{the first player to}} miss the deciding kick.|$|R

2500|$|... "The try Australia scored {{towards the}} end of the first half was relayed {{endlessly}} on television and, I predict, will be shown again and again in years to come. It was Lynagh, running towards the blind side, who set things in motion. Noticing that the New Zealand backs were lined up flat, he chipped the ball into the gap behind the winger. The New Zealand fullback, Kieran Crowley, was regarded by the Australians as being a little slow off the mark, and no doubt Lynagh had this in mind when he chose <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> front of him. Campese was bearing down on the ball, and I think Crowley was undecided whether to go in for the ball or wait for the bounce and try to stop Campese. His slight hesitation gave Campese the fraction of a second he needed to scoop up the ball and flash past him. Campese's running then was superb. He drew two defenders and had a third one chasing him, all of whom thought he was a threat. Campese saw Tim Horan behind him out of the corner of his eye and flipped the ball back over his shoulder. Horan did well to catch it before going on to score." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Nancy is with Mitzeee, {{she gets}} [...] "sudden twinges" [...] which {{she does not}} worry about until [...] "the contractions really start <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in.</b> She's only 26 weeks' {{pregnant}} and she's totally terrified". Nancy calls Darren who takes her to hospital where she is [...] "doubled over in agony". The doctors try giving Nancy medication to stop the contractions which fails. Nancy has an emergency Caesarean and gives birth to a boy who the doctors are unsure if he will [...] "make it through the night" [...] which Fox said is a [...] "terrible time for Nancy and Darren". Darren blames Nancy for their babies premature birth, Dawson explained that this is because he believes that Nancy did not [...] "take proper care of herself during her pregnancy". He said that Nancy seemed to be preoccupied with Mitzeee and [...] "wouldn't listen {{to him when he}} told her to back off. In his heart of hearts, Darren feels she's responsible for all of this". Fox revealed that she researched premature births, reading up on the subject and attending a meeting at the Liverpool Women's Hospital along with a writer for the serial. There, Fox spoke to a midwife who deals specifically with premature babies, which she found [...] "really helpful". The actress added that although the serial tried to stay true to life there is [...] "a bit of artistic licence that goes into the scripts, to make things more dramatic or to let the story flow better". On how Nancy would behave as a mother, Fox said: [...] "I imagine that she'll {{be a bit of a}} neurotic mother, particularly as the baby has arrived so early. I think she'd want to wrap him up in cotton wool and not let him out of her sight".|$|E

60|$|Going {{out with}} him she saw two rough-coated horses {{apparently}} endeavoring <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> {{the front of a}} high, four-wheeled vehicle, until they desisted and backed it violently {{into the side of the}} hotel. There are various rigs, as they term them--buckboards, sulkies and the humble bob-sleds--in use in that country, but the favorite one is the narrow, general-purpose wagon mounted on tall slender wheels, which will carry a moderate load though light enough to go reasonably fast.|$|E

60|$|After a {{while the}} Colonel called me in, and sent me {{speeding}} across the little river with a note to a certain Mr. Brady, whose house was not far away. Like many another citizen of Cahokia, Mr. Brady was terror-ridden. A party of young Puan bucks had decreed it to be their pleasure to encamp in Mr. Brady's yard, to peer through the shutters into Mr. Brady's house, to enjoy themselves by annoying Mr. Brady's family and others as much as possible. During the Indian occupation of Cahokia this band had gained a well-deserved reputation for mischief; and chief among them was the North Wind himself, whom I had done the honor <b>to</b> <b>kick</b> <b>in</b> the stomach. To-night they had made a fire in this Mr. Brady's flower-garden, over which they were cooking venison steaks. And, as I reached the door, the North Wind spied me, grinned, rubbed his stomach, made a false dash at me that frightened {{me out of my}} wits, and finally went through the pantomime of scalping me. I stood looking at him with my legs apart, for the son of the Great Chief must not run away. And I marked that the North Wind had two great ornamental daubs like shutter-fastenings painted on his cheeks. I sniffed preparation, too, on his followers, and I was sure they were getting ready for some new deviltry. I handed the note to Mr. Brady through the crack of the door that he vouchsafed to me, and when he had slammed and bolted me out, I ran into the street and stood for some time behind the trunk of a big hickory, watching the followers of the North Wind. Some were painting themselves, others cleaning their rifles and sharpening their scalping knives. All jabbered unceasingly. Now and again a silent brave passed, paused a moment to survey them gravely, grunted an answer to something they would fling at him, and went on. At length arrived three chiefs whom I knew to be high in the councils. The North Wind came out to them, and the four blanketed forms stood silhouetted between me and the fire for a quarter of an hour. By this time I was sure of a plot, and fled away to another tree for fear of detection. At length stalked through the street the Hungry Wolf, the interpreter. I knew this man to be friendly to Clark, and I acted on impulse. He gave a grunt of surprise when I halted before him. I made up my mind.|$|E
