40|$|The Act {{primarily}} clarifies terminology {{and procedures}} relating to guardianship of a {{beneficiary of the}} United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). First, the Act redefines a few key definitions used throughout chapter six of or title 29. Second, the Act adds a requirement of notice to the VA and also to the proposed ward 2 ̆ 7 s relatives when an application for guardianship is filed. Third, the Act establishes a preference for vesting guardianship in a relative of the ward and imposes a maximum number of wards for guardians who {{are not related to}} their wards. Fourth, the Act restricts the guardian from being named as a beneficiary in the ward 2 ̆ 7 s will or life insurance policy. Fifth, the Act revises guardian compensation, mandates that guardians submit periodic accountings to the court, and sets forth ramifications for failure to follow these provisions. Lastly, the Act provides that the VA shall be a party in interest in any proceeding <b>to</b> appoint of <b>discharge</b> <b>a</b> <b>guardian,</b> and further provides that the VA may become a party in interest in any other proceeding of guardianship established pursuant to any other chapter of title 29...|$|R

The first nozzle has an inner orifice adapted <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>a</b> first filler material and an outer annular orifice separated from and defined in concentric relation about the inner orifice and adapted <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>a</b> first shell material. The second nozzle has an inner orifice adapted <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>a</b> second filler material and an outer annular orifice separated from and defined in concentric relation about the inner orifice and adapted <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>a</b> second shell material. A multi-element spherical shell can be formed through employment of the {{nozzle assembly}} by merger with one another after discharge from the outer orifices of the nozzles {{of a pair of}} adjacent annular streams of liquid or molten shell wall material of different compositions and encapsulation by the mixed shell wall materials of a common encapsulated core fluids also simultaneously discharged by the inner orifices nozzles. On the other hand, the pair of encapsulating streams of shell wall material can be of the same materials which merge together and encapsulate core fluids of different compositions which will merge together after discharge from the nozzles...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{importance}} of consistency, most companies set standards unifying their various restaurant locations with a set of common rules and regulations. Parent companies often rely on field representatives to ensure that the practices of franchised locations are consistent with the company's standards. However, the more locations a fast food chain has, the harder it is for the parent company to guarantee that these standards are being followed. Moreover, it is much more expensive <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>a</b> franchisee for noncompliance with company standards, than it is <b>to</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>an</b> employee for that same reason. As a consequence, parent companies tend to deal with franchisee violations in a more relaxed manner.|$|R
