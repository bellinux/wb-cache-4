5|$|When Gilda was {{forecast}} to move near southeastern Florida, gale warnings {{were issued}} from North Key Largo to Fort Lauderdale. Rough seas affected the Florida coastline for about 72hours, causing moderate coastal property damage and beach erosion. After becoming a large subtropical cyclone, gale warnings were issued {{at various times}} from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina {{to the mouth of}} the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. High surf and minor beach erosion were reported along the coastline, and gale force winds were observed from North Carolina to New Jersey. Over the western Atlantic Ocean, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas. One ship reported a wave height of 28ft (8.5m), though no significant marine losses were reported. Around the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> becoming extratropical, Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia recorded a wind gust of 74mph (119km/h).|$|E
5|$|After re-attaining {{tropical}} storm status, Kyle turned {{more to the}} northeast and parallel to the coastline, making landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina as a minimal {{tropical storm}}. The storm briefly moved over open waters before again making landfall near Long Beach, North Carolina late on October 11. By early on October 12, the storm had weakened to tropical depression status. At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> moving ashore, there was a separate non-tropical low to the northeast of the depression, and shear had greatly increased, which made re-intensification unlikely. However, convection redeveloped baroclinically with the approaching cold front, and Kyle attained tropical storm status {{for the fifth time}} over the eastern Pamlico Sound. The restrengthening was short-lived, as the wind field expanded while the convection transitioned into that of a frontal band. After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Kyle merged with a cold front late on October 12. The remnants of Kyle continued eastward, executing a loop on October 14 before turning northeastward and impacting the Azores on October 17. The next day, the remnants of Kyle were absorbed by an extratropical cyclone to its northwest, which continued northeastward and moved near the British Isles on October 23.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, the United States went to {{war against}} Mexico and sent a naval and land {{expedition}} to conquer Alta California. At first they had an easy <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For {{the next several months}} the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner's Ranch. Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico. In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Mireille {{were from a}} poorly-organized area of convection, or thunderstorms, {{associated}} with the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands on September13. That day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began tracking {{the system as a}} tropical depression. The system moved westward, developing a large increase in thunderstorms over the center on September15. That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 21W at 00:00UTC, estimating 1‑minute sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph). About six hours later, the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Mireille, after satellite imagery indicated the storm was very compact and intensifying quickly. The JTWC later determined in a post-storm analysis that Mireille had attained tropical storm status 12hours earlier on the previous day. Also at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> attaining tropical storm status, Mireille was one of three storms in the basin, along with Tropical Storm Luke to the northwest and Typhoon Nat to the west in the South China Sea.|$|E

They went on to lose in straight sets to the Wanneroo Wolves in the semi-finals; the Wolves prevailed 107–91 in Game 1 in Joondalup before winning the series with a 104–98 victory in Game 2, with the Hawks bowing out of the finals at home. Purser was again a dominant force during the 2013 season, recording six double-doubles and scoring three 30+ point games. On July 26, he scored a career-high 34 points in a 104–97 win over the Perth Redbacks.

2500|$|The MCC team left {{austerity}} Britain on 31 August 1946 on the SS Stirling Castle {{and sailed}} to Australia, arriving in Perth, Western Australia in September 1946, {{three weeks before}} their first scheduled match. They used this time to acclimatise and practice in the nets, but also to put on weight. Having arrived from a country that had had seven years of rationing Australia was a 'land flowing with milk and honey' and Hammond promised his men [...] "the happiest six months of their lives". Everyone in the team put on weight, one [...] "consuming more in one day in Perth than his full weekly ration in London" [...] and the big bowlers Bill Voce and Dick Pollard adding up to two stone (28 lbs) in weight. [...] The team sent home food parcels from each city they visited and in general took an easy <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> A Saturday Night Club was organised in which the team would don bow-ties in MCC colours and sit down to a full dinner together. Aware that this would affect their mobility in the field physical training was organised, {{but it was not}} kept up. In general the atmosphere was that of a holiday, with the feeling that this was a goodwill tour to re-establish cricketing relations ten years after the last tour of Australia, and that a serious cricket would not begin until the 1948 Ashes series. The English and Australian press praised them for their sporting attitude and dwelt on the batting prowess of Wally Hammond, Len Hutton, Denis Compton and the bowling abilities of Alec Bedser and Doug Wright.|$|E

Lawry was bowled for a duck by John Snow, but Ian Redpath (68) and Paul Sheahan (71) added 89 for the third wicket before Sheadon ran out his partner and then himself. All the other batsmen got into double figures and Victoria declared for 304/8 {{at the end of}} the second day. Geoff Boycott and Brian Luckhurst both made 40 as they put on 79 for the first wicket, and Edrich 42. Colin Cowdrey made a slow 101 (he was likened to a beached whale), his only century of the tour. They reached 327/5, but the Victorian all-rounder Alan Sieler took his best first class haul of 4/18 with his slow left arm bowling and the MCC collapsed to 341 all out.
