After conceding four goals against Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace in September, Given lost his place in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> Lee Grant. He was {{released}} by Stoke {{at the end of}} the 2016–17 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Arsenal {{travelled}} to The Hawthorns to play West Bromwich Albion. Wenger added experience to <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> complement youth, with Parlour, Edu, Kanu and Keown all featuring. Arsenal {{took the lead}} in the 25th minute through Kanu. Lauren's cross from the right-hand side deflected {{in the direction of the}} striker. His header was saved by goalkeeper Russell Hoult, who was unable to deny Kanu shooting the rebounded ball into the net. Aliadière scored Arsenal's second goal of the match following Hoult's poor clearance.|$|E

5|$|Dolan {{brought in}} Paul Tomlinson, Brian Mitchell and Lee Sinnott {{in a bid}} to help McCall and Hendrie realise their dreams with City. They mounted a {{promotion}} challenge in 1987–88 and were top for much of the season until they faltered in the New Year. When promotion was missed initially by one point {{on the last day of}} the season after a 3–2 defeat against Ipswich Town and then through play-off defeat to Middlesbrough, McCall left the club, signing for Everton for £850,000 in June 1988. He had played 238 league games for the club, scoring 37 goals, and in total played 285 games, scoring 46 goals. McCall was later outspoken in his autobiography, The Real McCall, about City's failure to strengthen <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> secure promotion.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008–09 season, Roberts {{attracted}} the attention of Stevenage — and joined the Hertfordshire side on an initial one-month loan deal, before signing permanently in January 2009 for an undisclosed fee. He was made team captain ahead of the 2009–10 season, a campaign in which Roberts would help lead <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the Football League {{for the first time in}} the club's history. The following season, Roberts helped guide the club to back-to-back promotions following their sixth-place finish and subsequent League Two play-off victory in May 2011. He has also spent two spells as caretaker manager of the club, once in January 2012 and again in March 2013. After a successful four-and-a-half year spell at Stevenage, Roberts joined Fleetwood Town on a free transfer in July 2013. He captained Fleetwood to promotion via the play-offs during his first season with the club. After two seasons at Fleetwood, Roberts joined League Two side Cambridge United in May 2015, where he spent two seasons. In August 2017, he signed for fellow League Two club Forest Green Rovers.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Southern and Northern Dynasties (420–589), {{painting}} {{had become an}} art of high sophistication that {{was associated with the}} gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry. During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) and his accomplice Mi Fu (1051–1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed. The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> match the theme and mood of the painting.|$|E

In the chaos that ensued as people attempting to grab the ropes, Omar was knocked into the sea, where witnesses saw her treading water for a while, but eventually drowned.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, Malaysian Datuk Chan Tien Ghee {{took over}} as club chairman, with Vincent Tan also {{investing}} and joining the board. The following year, the club appointed Malky Mackay as manager, who took <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the League Cup final {{for the first time}} in the club's history during his first season. The following season, Cardiff won the 2012–13 Championship title and with it gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time, returning to the first-tier {{for the first time in}} 52 years. On 18 August 2013, Cardiff played their first ever Premier League match away to West Ham United, losing 2–0. Cardiff won only three games in the first half of the season and, on 27 December 2013, Mackay was sacked by Vincent Tan following showdown talks and replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Despite the change, Cardiff were relegated to the Championship after a single season following a 3–0 away defeat to Newcastle United. Solskjær himself was sacked on 18 September 2014 after a disappointing start to the following Championship season, and replaced by Leyton Orient manager Russell Slade.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} season since {{the return of}} the Football League, Cardiff {{finished}} the 1946–47 season as champions of the Third Division South under new manager Billy McCandless and returned to the Second Division. McCandless left the club soon after and was replaced by Cyril Spiers who led <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> promotion in the 1951–52 season, returning to the top tier of English football {{for the first time in}} 23 years. However, despite spending five seasons in the First Division, the team continually struggled in the bottom half of the table and were eventually relegated in 1957. They returned to the First Division for two seasons between 1960 and 1962 before again suffering relegation.|$|E

5|$|Milne {{featured}} in a further two Cup finals for United, losing 1–0 to Rangers in October 1984 in the Scottish League Cup Final and losing 2–1 to Celtic in May 1985 in the Scottish Cup Final. He aggravated a hamstring injury in the final against Rangers and was out of action for three months. In 1986–87, {{he played in the}} first three rounds of the UEFA Cup run (scoring once, against RC Lens in the first round) which eventually saw the team beat Barcelona and Borussia Mönchengladbach {{on their way to the}} final. However Milne had left in January 1987 before these high-profile games took place, sold to Charlton Athletic, having lost his place in <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the up-and-coming Kevin Gallacher. He made a total of 285 appearances for Dundee United in major competitions and is the club's all-time top scorer in Europe (UEFA Cup and European Cup) with a tally of 15 goals.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} {{the debut of}} the TerrorDome and {{involved}} Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. Before the match, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the winner would take Kurt Angle's place in the main event, {{in addition to being}} the TNA X Division Championship number one contender. In this match, the ring was surrounded by a giant red steel barred cage with a domed roof. The wrestlers were to compete as they climbed up <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling; the first to escape the cage would win. While Devine was attempting to escape, Kaz intervened and caused Devine to fall from the ceiling into a group of wrestlers huddled in the center of the ring.

5|$|The {{following}} season, Smith's run of {{consecutive games}} {{came to an}} end against Reading in October 1958, with Jim McCusker coming into <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> replace him for two games. Smith's number of consecutive appearances is third on the club's list behind Mulholland's 231 games and Charlie Bicknell. He played 26 further games in the 1958–59 season, in which the club finished 11th in the newy-formed Third Division. The season proved to be Smith's final season for City as he decided to retire aged 31. His last game was a 2–1 defeat, once again versus Reading, on 28 February 1959. When the season finished, Smith had played a total of 270 games for the club, 253 of which came in the league, keeping a club record 70 clean sheets. His record stood until it was broken by Paul Tomlinson in the 1990s. When Smith retired, the club granted him and Mulholland each a sum of money rather than the proceeds of a benefit match.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Roberts {{scored in}} a {{pre-season}} friendly victory over Hitchin Town. He captained the {{side in the}} club's first ever Football League fixture, playing the whole game in a 2–2 home draw with Macclesfield Town. Roberts scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season in Stevenage's 3–0 away win at local rivals Barnet in November 2010. His second goal of the season came in the reverse fixture against Barnet in January 2011, this time scoring the fourth in a 4–2 win at Broadhall Way, as well as netting in a 4–0 win against Cheltenham Town on 26 February. A week later, Roberts was given a straight red card for bringing down Torquay United striker Chris Zebroski when he had rounded the goalkeeper, a match that Torquay {{would go on to}} win 2–0. He scored twice against Macclesfield Town on 26 March 2011, taking his goal tally for the 2010–11 campaign to five goals. Roberts scored his sixth goal of the season, his highest seasonal goal tally during his three years at Stevenage, in the club's 2–2 draw at Stockport County on 9 April 2011. The goal, a half-volley at the back post, gave Stevenage a brief lead in the match just after half-time. Stevenage faced one of Roberts' former employers, Accrington Stanley, in the 2010–11 League Two play-off semi-finals {{as a result of the}} club's sixth-place finish. Roberts played in both games, which Stevenage won by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. He led the side out at Old Trafford for the final against Torquay United on 28 May 2011, playing the whole match as Stevenage went on to win 1–0. This meant that Roberts had captained <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> back-to-back promotions, earning a place in League One for the first time in their history. Stevenage also had the best defensive record in League Two during the 2010–11 campaign, conceding 45 goals. The campaign was also notable for Stevenage's FA Cup run into the Fourth Round, with Roberts playing in all five matches, including the club's 3–1 home victory over Premier League opposition in the form of Newcastle United. Roberts made 52 appearances in all competitions throughout the season, scoring six times.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{then joined}} Kettering Town {{ahead of the}} 2007–08 season, playing an {{important}} part in the club achieving promotion from the Conference North to the Conference National in his first season at the club. At {{the end of the season}} he rejected a contract offer from Kettering and joined Stevenage on a free transfer. In his first season at the Hertfordshire club, he helped <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> FA Trophy success, as well as helping the club earn promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history the following season. He was also part of the squad that helped Stevenage earn back-to-back promotions during the 2010–11 season. Ahead of the 2011–12 campaign, Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town. He left the club after one season, and spent a year at Chelmsford City, before signing for Bury Town in May 2013. He had a brief spell at Brackley Town, before spending two seasons combining playing and coaching at King's Lynn Town. He retired from playing in May 2016 before joining St Neots Town as first-team coach a year later. Bridges has also earned one cap for the England C team, playing in a game against Italy C in January 2006.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} Test as captain, Jardine clashed with several players. Frank Woolley {{was unhappy with}} his captain's manner, feeling humiliated at his {{treatment}} in the field at one point. He also rebuked Ian Peebles and Walter Robins, two young amateur bowlers, for their amusement over an incident in the match. The home team's fortunes were mixed, as New Zealand put up a very good fight in their first Test in England, and both sides could have won. The New Zealanders were so successful that a further two Tests were arranged. Jardine was criticised in the press for not instructing his batsmen to score quickly enough {{to win in the}} fourth innings, although this strategy was unlikely to succeed, and the match was drawn. England won the second Test by an innings and the third Test was drawn, sealing the series 1–0. Jardine had a top score of just 38 in the series, but only batted four times and was not out in three of the innings. At the beginning of the following season, Wisden's editor believed that, as Jardine had failed to impress (unspecified) people with his captaincy, he was no longer a certainty to lead <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> Australia, and only Percy Chapman's lack of form prevented his reinstatement at Jardine's expense. As a batsman, Jardine was more impressive in Wisden's opinion, showing himself to be good in defence despite his lack of cricket in the past two seasons. A notable innings was his 104 for The Rest to prevent defeat against champion county Yorkshire. The opposition bowling, particularly from Bill Bowes, was short and hostile, but Jardine survived for over four hours. He scored 1,104 first-class runs for the season at an average of 64.94.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{continued}} to make progress in his batting in 1937. For Cambridge, he scored fifties against the Army and Surrey. Against Hampshire he took four for 47 and five for 41, and when Cambridge collapsed to 35 for six chasing a victory target of 141, he scored 64 not out to take <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> a win. Playing Sussex, he scored a century and took four for 36, while in the University match, he scored 101 in {{two and a half}} hours. Yardley's form saw him selected for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, although he scored only 7 and 4, and when he joined Yorkshire after the Cambridge season, he made his first century for the county against Surrey, as well as three other fifties. His overall first-class figures were 1,472 runs at an average of 33.45 and 31 wickets at an average of 21.87. He was picked for the winter MCC tour of India, under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson, where he scored 519 runs at an average 25.95 but only took one wicket. No official Tests were played on the tour, but Yardley played in the representative matches which took place, scoring 96 in the first game, but his highest score in four other innings was 31.|$|E
