5|$|The Christian Scientists came in. Before <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> {{they stood}} on chairs {{and closed the}} transoms over the two doors to the rooms. Then they made their demand: the series must not be published. S.S. scowled at them and said nothing. To fill the silence, Brynner began rather nervously to assure the Scientists that the {{articles}} were not sensational, not offensive; {{that there was no}} cause for apprehension; that all the facts had been most carefully verified.One of the Scientists cut in to suggest that perhaps there would be no objection to publication of the material if the Scientists were permitted to edit it as they might please.|$|E
5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
25|$|Anzhel Vagenshtain {{was their}} {{discoverer}} for the cinema. After reading their feuilletons in Starshel, {{he told them}} that they should write a comedy. As a joke, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and wrote the screenplay for The Ancient Coin. This led to the first Bulgarian musical film, a 1965 co-production with East Germany. The then-fashionable Bulgarian singer Liana Antonova and the East German film star Manfred Krug appeared in the film. The music was by Bulgarian composer Petar Stupel.|$|E

25|$|In Manchester, 300 (eye-witness Stop the War estimate) {{secondary}} school children, Further Education students and university students met at Albert Square at 12 noon. They {{marched to the}} BBC studios where <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in the road at around 1pm and blocked the traffic {{for over an hour}} where their numbers grew to around 1000 demonstrators. They were filmed by anti-war activists and video clips were distributed. The students then marched around the city centre and ended up back at Albert Square at about 4pm where they remained demonstrating in front of the Town Hall for some hours. The whole of this event was filmed by anti-war activists accumulating two hours of footage.|$|E
500|$|Other couples {{refused to}} be separated. Ida Straus, the wife of Macy's {{department}} store co-owner and {{former member of the}} United States House of Representatives Isidor Straus, told her husband: [...] "We have been living together for many years. Where you go, I go." [...] <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> in a pair of deck chairs and waited for the end. The industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim changed out of his life vest and sweater into top hat and evening dress and declared his wish to go down with the ship like a gentleman.|$|E
500|$|According to John Brousseau, the bad {{publicity}} led to {{reforms of the}} Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the [...] "Berthing" [...] quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when [...] "they got up, showered, {{then went to the}} dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at desks. I have no clue what work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm." [...] After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there [...] "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing." [...] Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't talk to them, you looked the other way, you'd leave the area if you saw them, it's like the black plague." [...] Brousseau commented: [...] "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1990s the Franklin Avenue Shuttle {{was known}} as the [...] "ghost train". It was shrunk in size to only two cars, and the Dean Street station, which had 50 paying riders per day, was closed in 1995. The entire line was under {{consideration}} for abandonment, and community leaders were opposed to the move. They showed up to town hall meetings, news conferences and <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with transit officials. They also formed the Committee to Save the Franklin Avenue Shuttle. The coalition included the Straphangers Campaign, a local church, local community boards and the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance. They argued that subway station repair work occurred elsewhere, when no attention was paid to the Franklin Avenue Shuttle.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Joseph's {{brothers}} stripped {{him of his}} coat of many colors and cast him into an empty pit. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to eat, and when they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites from Gilead bringing spices and balm to Egypt, Judah persuaded the brothers to sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites. Passing Midianite merchants drew Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 shekels of silver, and they brought him to Egypt. When Reuben returned to the pit and Joseph was gone, he rent his clothes and asked his brothers where he could go now. They took Joseph's coat of many colors, dipped it in goat's blood, {{and sent it to}} Jacob to identify. Jacob concluded that a beast had devoured Joseph, and rent his garments, put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son. All his sons and daughters tried in vain to comfort him. And the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, Pharaoh's captain of the guard. The third reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the first open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here with the end of chapter ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{follow up}} report was {{published}} on February 18, 1890 with the title, [...] "A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station." [...] In the late 19th century, Joseph Mulhattan was a known hoaxer of newspaper articles. The article was republished {{a few days}} later with the subtitle [...] "More Tales of a Fishy Flavor." [...] In the account, the entity was referred to only as the witch. The article reports that a Mr. Johnson was visiting Buck Smith and were discussing a recent visitation of the ghost at his home. They heard a knocking at the door, and when they opened the door, the knocking began at another door. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and the dog began to fight with something invisible. Two minutes later, the door flew open and fire spread across the room blown by a cyclonic wind with the coals disappearing as they tried to put it out. That evening Mr. Johnson started home on his horse and something jumped on the back grabbing his shoulder as he tried to restrain the horse. He felt it jump off as he neared his home and move in the leaves into the woods.|$|E
2500|$|King's parents {{visited him}} {{in the fall and}} had suspicions about Coretta Scott after seeing how clean his {{apartment}} was. While the Kings had tea and meals with their son and Scott, Martin, Sr. turned his attention to her and insinuated that her plans of a career in music were not fitting for a Baptist minister's wife. After Coretta did not respond to his questioning of their romance being serious, Martin, Sr. asked if she took his son [...] "seriously". King's father also told her that there were many other women his son was interested in, and had [...] "a lot to offer." [...] After telling him that she had [...] "a lot to offer" [...] as well, Martin Luther King, Sr. and his wife went on to try and meet with members of Coretta's family. Once the two obtained Edythe's number from Coretta, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with her and had lunch with her. During their time together, Martin Luther King, Sr. tried to ask Edythe about the relationship between her sister and his son. Edythe insisted that her sister was an excellent choice for Martin Luther King, Jr., but also felt that Coretta did not need to bargain for a husband.|$|E
