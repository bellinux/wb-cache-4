She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E
25|$|Highlander Scoring: The points awarded {{function}} slightly {{differently than}} in conventional Spades. Highlander Scoring merges partnership playing with individual team effort. Sandbagging {{does not apply}} {{with this type of}} game play, although sandbagging could be included. Each partner makes a bid of the tricks they <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> win. Each partner must win the total they individually bid; if not, that player's bid value is deducted from the team's score even if their partner took enough trick to make up the difference. :For example, if Tom bids 5 tricks and wins 4 tricks, and Harry (his partner) bids 3 tricks and wins 4 tricks, 80 points is deducted from the partnership's total score even though the team won their promised 8 tricks, because Tom did not make his bid. However, Harry is awarded five points per overtrick, so they are −75 points instead of −80 points. If the contract is broken and no overtricks were taken, the team is down the full amount of the bid. If both made their contract and have won overtricks, they are awarded five extra points per overtrick. Team that wins seven or more tricks per round is given 10 points the first time, 20 points the second, and each time thereafter the points increase by 10. This encourages race-style play where players set out to take as many tricks as they can {{as long as they do}} not steal tricks their partner needs.|$|E

That same month, Beatty filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles, California Superior Court seeking $30 million in damages against the Tribune and a declaration over the rights. Bertram Fields, Beatty's lawyer, said the original 1985 agreement with the Tribune was negotiated specifically to allow Beatty a chance to make another Dick Tracy film.

500|$|While experts found Bundy's precise {{diagnosis}} elusive, {{the majority}} of evidence pointed away from bipolar disorder or other psychoses, and toward antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). [...] Bundy displayed many personality traits typically found in ASPD patients (who are often identified as [...] "sociopaths" [...] or [...] "psychopaths"), such as outward charm and charisma with little true personality or genuine insight beneath the facade; the ability to distinguish right from wrong, but with minimal effect on behavior; and an absence of guilt or remorse. [...] "Guilt doesn't solve anything, really", Bundy said, in 1981. [...] "It hurts you ... I guess I am in the enviable position of not {{having to deal with}} guilt." [...] There was also evidence of narcissism, poor judgment, and manipulative behavior. [...] "Sociopaths", prosecutor George Dekle wrote, [...] "are egotistical manipulators who <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> con anybody." [...] "Sometimes he manipulates even me", admitted one psychiatrist. In the end, Lewis agreed with the majority: [...] "I always tell my graduate students that if they can find me a real, true psychopath, I'll buy them dinner", she told Nelson. [...] "I never thought they existed ... but I think Ted may have been one, a true psychopath, without any remorse or empathy at all." [...] Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) has been proposed as an alternative diagnosis in at least one subsequent retrospective analysis.|$|E
500|$|The album's release {{generated}} much publicity over a sales {{competition with}} 50 Cent's Curtis. Three months that were {{prior to the}} September 11 release date, West extended his gratitude towards 50 Cent for the enthusiasm and excitement the friendly competition had produced. Though confident that he would emerge victorious, West {{said that he would}} be perfectly fine with losing to 50 Cent, saying that he'd rather, [...] "be #2 on that day rather than come out and be #1 on a day nobody cares about." [...] In an interview for USA Today, 50 Cent expressed his view on the idea of a sales competition, stating [...] "It's great marketing — for Kanye West. But I sell way more records than Kanye West, and I generate way more interest than Kanye West.

On August 10, 50 Cent confirmed during an interview with SOHH that he would end his career as a solo recording artist if Graduation were to sell more copies than Curtis in the United States. However, 50 Cent later retracted his statement within an MTV interview due to his contract agreements with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.

500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E
