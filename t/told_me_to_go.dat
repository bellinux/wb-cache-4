The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, [...] "I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [...] I told him I could write one that was better and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for it. And I did.

500|$|In 2004, OutKast's {{original}} {{record label}} Arista Records was restructured under the Jive label group. During their hiatus, Big Boi and André 3000 were pressured by Jive {{to produce an}} OutKast album {{instead of focusing on}} their solo work. In July 2009, Big Boi left Jive Records, following creative differences and the label's unwillingness to release and promote his solo album. According to Big Boi, Jive gave him an ultimatum to shop the album elsewhere. In an interview for GQ, he discussed his release from Jive and his discontent with the label for proposing he record a cover of rapper Lil Wayne's [...] "Lollipop", stating [...] "They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in and make my version of Lil Wayne's Lollipop! I love that song... But how you gonna tell me to go bite another MCs style?... That's the highest form of disrespect ever. So that's when I wanted to get off Jive. And the only honorable thing they've done is allow me to do that". Big Boi expressed that Jive viewed its intended singles as not [...] "radio-friendly" [...] and the album as [...] "a piece of art, and they didn't {{know what to do with}} it".|$|E

2500|$|For 1932, Grands Prix had to {{be between}} five and ten hours long. It was the only season in which Nuvolari {{regularly}} drove {{one of the fastest}} cars, the Alfa Romeo P3, and he took two wins and a second place from the three European Championship Grands Prix, plus victory in the championship by four points from Borzacchini. He achieved four other race wins that year, including the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix and a second Targa Florio. Of the latter, his mechanic Mabelli said: [...] "Before the start, Nuvolari <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down {{on the floor of the}} car every time he shouts, which was a signal that he went to a curve too fast and that we need to lower the car´s center of mass. I spent the whole race on the floor. Nuvolari started to shout in the first curve and wouldn't stop until the last one." ...|$|E

He {{always wanted to be}} an architect or least [...] "pretend to be an architect". [...] He first mentions this desire in [...] "The Stake Out", and claims in [...] "The Race" [...] that he'd designed [...] "the new addition to the Guggenheim". In [...] "The Van Buren Boys", he denies his young protégé a scholarship from the Susan Ross Foundation when the young man decides he no longer wants to be an architect and wants to become a city planner instead. In [...] "The Marine Biologist", Jerry tells a woman who George wanted to impress that George is a marine biologist. The plan backfires when George is called on to save a beached whale with a Titleist golf ball in its blowhole. He saves the whale, but the woman tells him off when he confesses that he's not, in fact, a marine biologist: [...] "She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to hell, and I took the bus home." [...] He then gets a job working for the Yankees, where he frequently encounters a fictionalized version of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner (the voice of Steinbrenner is made by Larry David).|$|E

2500|$|On 14 September Mr Dinos was one {{of eight}} three-year-olds to contest the classic St Leger over {{fourteen}} and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. He took the lead after a quarter mile and led the field until the final turn but faded in the closing stages and finished fifth behind Bollin Eric, Highest, Bandari and Mamool. Cole later commented that the colt [...] "went too fast" [...] in the race. On 27 October the colt returned to France for the Group One Prix Royal-Oak over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse {{in which he was}} ridden by the French jockey Dominique Boeuf. He was made the 3.6/1 third choice in the betting behind the Andre Fabre-trained pair Morozov (Prix Hubert de Chaudenay) and Bernimixa (Prix de Pomone) whilst the other runners included Sulk and Cut Quartz (Prix Kergorlay). As in his previous French race he took the lead from the start and soon opened up a clear lead. He kept on well in the straight and won by two lengths from Sulk with a gap of four lengths back to Morozov in third. His victory made him the first British-trained winner of the race since Moonax triumphed in 1994. After the race Boeuf commented [...] "I controlled the race from start to finish. Mr Cole <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on if no-one else did, but not to make the pace too quick... he ran on again in the final furlong".|$|E

According to the report, Martin Kirsten, Cornell's bodyguard, was at the singer's hotel room at 11:30p.m. {{to help him with}} his computer, [...] "which was not working at that time." [...] It also says that Cornell's wife, Vicky, talked to her husband at 11:35p.m., and alarmed by what she heard, she phoned the bodyguard to ask him to check on her husband [...] "because he did not sound like he was OK." [...] A call from Cornell's wife at 12:15a.m. prompted his bodyguard to go to the singer's suite to check on him.

2500|$|Fattouma Khefacha, {{was born}} in 1861 to Khadouja Mzali and Ahmed Khefacha. When she was very young, her parents divorced. Bourguiba, who had always criticized {{repudiation}} in Islam, stated in 1973, that the reason of the divorce was [...] "futile". Indeed, the divorce took place because Khadouja presented a cold meal to her husband. Once separated, Ahmed married another woman and founded a new family. Khadouja then, {{had no choice but}} to get back to her parent's place, in the [...] "Tripolitanian quarter". It was in that house that Fattouma was raised, her mother refusing to remarry. In 1880, at the age of 15 or 16 years old, Fattouma married Ali Bourguiba, and upon the instance of her mother, wedded in her father's house, before parting for that of her groom. Khadouja, whose father died in 1884, moved into her daughter's house where they cohabited. Therefore, she helped with house chores, participating in supplies preparations and wool washing, at the seaside. She had a good relationship with her sister, Aïchoucha Mzali, mother of the famous Abelaziz al-Aroui, who lived at the end of the same street. Despite that, Bourguiba stated that [...] "in reality, there wasn't much of a relationship between my family and that of mother, that it to say, that of Ahmed Khefacha, who, as I said, had remarried. However, one day, when going across a nearby square, known today as independence square, where there had been a grand café, my father, who held my hand, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> kiss my grandfather, while designating a ruddy faced old man.
