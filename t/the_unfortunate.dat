5|$|Just {{prior to}} the next day's game, a tearful Joyce met Galarraga at home plate to receive the Tigers' lineup card. The two shook hands and Joyce gave the pitcher {{a pat on the}} shoulder, with a warm {{reception}} from the audience. Joyce's accountability and regret, and Galarraga's sportsmanship were widely praised for turning <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> situation into a positive.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>unfortunate</b> Guillaume Le Gentil {{spent eight}} years {{travelling}} {{in an attempt to}} observe either of the transits. His unsuccessful journey led to him losing his wife and possessions and being declared dead (his efforts became the basis of the play Transit of Venus by Maureen Hunter). Under the influence of the Royal Society Ruđer Bošković travelled to Istanbul, but arrived too late.|$|E

50|$|The Voice starts (and ends) the challenges, decides the Saboteur (see below), and traps <b>the</b> <b>Unfortunates.</b> <b>The</b> Voice is {{depicted}} {{only as a}} spooky head with a nose, and a mouth with a pink-red tongue, some yellow teeth and a purple lipstick. She speaks to <b>the</b> <b>Unfortunates</b> through a device attached {{to one of their}} ears called a Whisper Clip. Played by Eve Karpf for Series 1, then Faith Brown from Series 2, Series 3, and Series 4.|$|R
5|$|They {{hold that}} we are guilty of murder, and with their {{aldermanic}} jury's verdict to back them, they would hold a court of Judge Lynch and hang <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> one of us who got into their clutches without an hour's delay, providing they didn't first tear him to pieces...|$|E
5|$|Traversing a {{crossroads}} at night was considered dangerous {{because it was}} the place and time of the ala’s supper; <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> person who stepped on an “ala’s table” could become blind, deaf, or lame. Ale gather at night on the eves of greater holidays, divert men from their ways into gullies, and torture them there by riding them like horses.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{ceremony was}} held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H. Wright, Commander, 12th Naval District, spoke of <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> deaths {{and the need to}} keep the base operating during a time of war. He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier. The remains of 44 of the victims were interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Alpine spaniels {{were kept}} by the canons of the monasteries in the Alps in order to search for {{travellers}} during heavy snow storms, including the Great St. Bernard Hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland. The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers, and were trained so that upon finding them {{would return to the}} canons in order to lead rescuers back to <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> individuals. The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|It {{is used in}} {{external}} beam radiotherapy, sterilization of medical supplies and medical waste, radiation treatment of foods for sterilization (cold pasteurization), industrial radiography (e.g. weld integrity radiographs), density measurements (e.g. concrete density measurements), and tank fill height switches. The metal has <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> property of producing a fine dust, causing problems with radiation protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, {{and one of the}} worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|King Coenwulf of Mercia {{may have}} {{supported}} <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> Ealhmund, and Symeon of Durham wrote that in 801:Eardwulf, {{king of the}} Northumbrians, led an army against Coenwulf, king of Mercians, because he had given asylum to his enemies. He also, collecting an army, obtained very many auxiliaries from other provinces, having made a long expedition among them. At length, with {{the advice of the}} bishops and chiefs of the Angles on either side, they made peace through the kindness of the king of the Angles.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan Martin {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>unfortunates</b> who {{contracted}} <b>the</b> Theta Virus, {{which provided}} superhuman powers, but also killed its host. In Jonathan' case, both outcomes occurred; he became an undead being, neither truly alive nor dead.|$|R
60|$|Now, Ozma {{had seen}} in her Magic Picture all that had {{happened}} in the forest, so she sent the little Wizard, mounted upon the Cowardly Lion, to save <b>the</b> <b>unfortunates.</b> <b>The</b> Lion knew the forest well and when he reached it he bounded straight through the tangled paths to where the Sawhorse was wandering, with Jack and the two children on his back.|$|R
50|$|Ballou took {{an active}} part in the Spiritualist {{movement}} as a writer and lecturer. Her reform and philanthropy interests included prisons, <b>the</b> <b>unfortunates,</b> and fallen women. She supported Victoria Woodhull in her campaign for President of the United States in 1872.|$|R
5|$|Lucy {{is invited}} to stay with John and Fanny, {{as a way for}} Fanny to avoid {{inviting}} the Dashwood sisters to visit them. Lucy, falsely believing that she has a friend in Fanny, confides her clandestine engagement to Edward and is thrown out of the house. Edward's mother demands that he break off the engagement. When he refuses, she arranges to have his fortune transferred to his younger brother, Robert. On hearing this, Colonel Brandon offers Edward the parish on his estate, feeling sympathy for <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> but honorable Edward.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack of}} Frederick III of Denmark in June 1657, aimed at regaining the territories lost in 1645, {{provided}} an opportunity for Charles X Gustav to abandon <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> Polish–Lithuanian battlefields. With 9,950 horse and 2,800 foot, he marched through Pomerania and Mecklenburg. In Holstein, the Swedish force was split with Carl Gustaf Wrangel heading west to clear Bremen-Verden and Charles X Gustav heading north to clear Jutland. When these aims were achieved, Charles X Gustav in September moved to the Swedish port of Wismar and ordered his navy into the inconclusive Battle of Møn.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{continued}} working, even at her wealthiest. Perhaps {{driven to}} express herself by <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> circumstances in her life, {{along with the}} needs of her family, she delved into different types of art. She learned sculpture at the hand of Auguste Rodin and had several exhibitions of sculptures and paintings in Paris and the United States. These works were more experimental in nature, and largely influenced by dreams and mythology. O'Neill spent 1921 to 1926 living in Paris. While there, she was elected to the Société Coloniale des Artistes Français in 1921, and had exhibitions of her sculptures at the Galerie Devambez in Paris and the Wildenstein Galleries in New York in 1921 and 1922, respectively.|$|E
60|$|And {{well was}} it for him that he came by so fine and merciful an end, thought I, when I had heard the tale of horrors that had been {{undergone}} by <b>the</b> <b>unfortunates</b> who {{had fallen into the}} hands of Farnese.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, Otto, {{it is too}} bad of you to {{take one}} by {{surprise}} so. Excuse me, sir,--no doubt {{you are one of}} <b>the</b> <b>unfortunates</b> who have been wrecked. I have much pleasure in offering you the hospitality of our humble home!" ...|$|R
60|$|Both {{worked with}} a will, doing {{whatever}} they thought was best. Barringford held Dave up by the ankles and allowed much of the water to run from <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate's</b> mouth, and then they rolled the youth and worked his arms and rubbed him.|$|R
5|$|Smetana's first {{noteworthy}} public {{success was}} his initial opera The Brandenburgers in Bohemia, in 1866 {{when he was}} already 42 years old. His second opera, The Bartered Bride, survived <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, Dalibor, closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera {{should be based on}} folk-song. It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances. Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874.|$|E
5|$|Some Scottish kings {{were very}} {{interested}} in the development of cannon, including <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> James II, who was killed by the accidental explosion of one of his own cannon besieging Roxburgh Castle in 1460. Mons Meg, which dates from about the same time, is perhaps the most famous example of a Scottish cannon. James IV was Scotland's first Renaissance figure, who also had a fascination with cannon, both at land and at sea. By 1502, he was able to invest in a Scottish navy, which was to have a large number of cannon — his flagship, the Great Michael, was launched in 1511, with 36 great guns, 300 lesser pieces and 120 gunners.|$|E
5|$|The Suvla landing was {{reinforced}} {{by the arrival of}} the British 53rd and 54th Divisions along with the British 10th Division from Kitchener's New Army divisions plus the dismounted yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Division. <b>The</b> <b>unfortunate</b> 29th Division was also shifted from Helles to Suvla for one more push. The final British attempt to resuscitate the offensive came on 21 August with attacks at Scimitar Hill and Hill 60. Control of these hills would have united the Anzac and Suvla fronts, but neither battle achieved success. When fighting at Hill 60 ceased on 29 August, the battle for the Sari Bair heights, and indeed the battle for the peninsula, was effectively over.|$|E
60|$|There {{was little}} {{opportunity}} allowed, however, for intercourse among <b>the</b> <b>unfortunates.</b> One or two who, judging from their faces, showed sympathetic leanings towards each other, were immediately observed and separated. This {{had the effect}} of hardening some, while it drove others to despair.|$|R
6000|$|Dismay {{fell upon}} <b>the</b> <b>unfortunates</b> who remained, but their {{confusion}} was soon ended, for Rose, {{with a look}} which {{they had never seen}} upon her face before, dismissed them with the brief command, [...] "Break ranks the review is over," [...] and walked away to Phebe.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, Five Leaves Bookshop in Nottingham held {{an event}} called [...] "But I Know This City!" [...] based around Johnson's novel <b>The</b> <b>Unfortunates,</b> set in Nottingham, which allowed {{participants}} to {{travel around the}} city and listen to live readings of the novel's sections in whichever order they chose.|$|R
5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. <b>The</b> <b>unfortunate</b> officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Statement that {{eventually}} became the Forty-Two Articles are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles. In 1551 Cranmer presented a version of {{a statement to the}} bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort into developing the articles, most likely due to work on the canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade. By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and John Cheke, his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the Forty-Two Articles were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the articles were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king. This was not in fact the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the articles were developed {{during the time of the}} Convocation—hence evading a direct answer. The council gave Cranmer <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> task of requiring subscription to the articles from the bishops, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title-page. It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render the subscriptions futile.|$|E
5|$|Mercator's {{editions of}} Ptolemy and his {{theological}} writings were in print {{for many years}} after {{the demise of the}} atlas but they too eventually disappeared and it was the Mercator projection which emerged as his sole and greatest legacy. His construction of a chart on which the courses of constant bearing favoured by mariners appeared as straight lines ultimately revolutionised the art of navigation, making it simpler and therefore safer. Mercator left no hints to his method of construction and it was Edward Wright who first clarified the method in his book Certaine Errors (1599)—the relevant error being the erroneous belief that straight lines on conventional charts corresponded to constant courses. Wright's solution was a numerical approximation and it was another 70 years before the projection formula was derived analytically. Wright published a new world map based on the Mercator projection, also in 1599. Slowly, but steadily, charts using the projection appeared throughout {{the first half of the}} seventeenth century and by the end of that century chart makers all over the world were using nothing but the Mercator projection, with the aim of showing the oceans and the coastlines in detail without concern for the continental interiors. At some stage the projection made <b>the</b> <b>unfortunate</b> leap to portrayal of the continents and it eventually became the canonical description of the world, despite its manifest distortions at high latitudes. Recently Mercator's projection has been rejected for representations of the world but it remains paramount for nautical charts and its use stands as his enduring legacy.|$|E
60|$|By {{that time}} {{most of the}} men of the hamlet had returned, and a rig out of fisher clothes was lent to each of <b>the</b> <b>unfortunates,</b> so that they were enabled to pass the night in comfort while their own {{garments}} were in front of a good fire.|$|R
60|$|During {{the brief}} period of {{lighting}} up I caught a good glance at his face, and fancied that I saw {{beneath the surface of}} dirt and dissipation a look of shrewdness and intelligence. Evidently he was one of <b>the</b> <b>unfortunates</b> who allowed drink to make off with their brains.|$|R
