5|$|Furthermore, South Vietnamese commanders never {{realized}} that Hanoi had given its field commanders the full flexibility {{to respond to}} the changing circumstances on the battlefield and had supplied North Vietnamese units with weaponry that was required to achieve <b>their</b> <b>objectives.</b> Ultimately, the average South Vietnamese soldiers would {{have to pay for the}} miscalculation of their commanders.|$|E

5|$|John, like Basil II before him, was a {{slow but}} steady campaigner. His armies made careful, {{measured}} gains over time, rarely exposing themselves to excessive risks, but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards <b>their</b> <b>objectives.</b> However, the Turks were resilient, {{and they did not}} allow themselves to be decisively defeated in any one engagement. They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May 1944, the 500th SS Parachute Battalion {{were transported}} to airfields at Nagy-Betskerek, Zagreb and Banja Luka, dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for {{security}} reasons.

After securing <b>their</b> <b>objectives</b> on or near Velebit, the special police was deployed on foot behind ARSK lines to hinder movement of ARSK troops there, capturing strategic intersections in the villages of Bruvno at 7a.m. and Otrić at 11a.m.|$|E
5|$|Roads {{offered the}} enemy fast routes to <b>their</b> <b>objectives</b> and {{consequently}} they were blocked at strategic points.

5|$|The {{attack was}} a success with the brigades taking all <b>their</b> <b>objectives</b> on schedule. The 4th Brigade {{captured}} 700 prisoners of war, {{for the loss of}} 130 men killed, and over 600 wounded. In the 1st Brigade, 192 were killed along with 700 wounded. From its starting positions, the division made gains of around 1,000 metres. Both Godley and Russell were pleased with the outcome and pushed for further involvement by the New Zealand Division in the ongoing offensive.|$|E
5|$|The division's two {{parachute}} brigades, {{landing in}} the early hours of 6June, were scattered across the countryside during the parachute drop. Most of the battalions could only muster around sixty per cent or less of their total strength on the drop zones (DZ). They did carry out all of <b>their</b> <b>objectives,</b> however, before the 6th Airlanding Brigade arrived by gliders to reinforce them at 21:00 that evening.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight at}} P'ohang-dong {{was the final}} {{breaking}} point for North Korean units already {{on the verge of}} exhaustion from continuous combat. North Korean supply lines were overextended to the point of breaking down, causing a collapse in resupply that is seen as a primary factor in turning the tide of the battle. Moreover, U.S. air superiority was also crucial to the engagement, since repeated bombing runs by U.S. aircraft prevented North Korean ground forces from reaching and holding <b>their</b> <b>objectives.</b>|$|E

5|$|After a {{brief period}} of rest, they {{returned}} to the line near Broodseinde on 1 October, taking up a position near Molenaarelsthoek, on the right of I Anzac's position for the upcoming battle. The attack went in on 4 October, and after overcoming an encounter with a German infantry regiment, the 212th, in no man's land, the Australians successfully managed to capture <b>their</b> <b>objectives.</b> During the battle, the 2nd Battalion lost 10 officers and 144 other ranks killed or wounded, some of which were suffered after an intense German mortar barrage had fallen upon the troops in their form-up point prior to the attack, killing or wounding up to one seventh of the assault force.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they failed}} to achieve <b>their</b> <b>objectives,</b> by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In places they were {{clinging}} onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day's casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded, together {{with at least a}} similar number of Turkish casualties.|$|E
5|$|As in Normandy, the division's two {{parachute}} brigades {{were already}} on the ground before the 6th Airlanding Brigade started landing at 10:30 24March1945. The German defenders had been alerted, and the gliders were met by a concentrated anti-aircraft barrage. This caused the brigade around 40 per cent casualties in men and 50 per cent in equipment. Nevertheless, by 11:00 the 2nd OBLI and 1st RUR had captured <b>their</b> <b>objectives.</b> The 12th Devons landed amongst a German armoured formation, but managed to gather enough men together to begin their attack on Hamminkeln at 11:35, and had secured the town by 12:00.|$|E
