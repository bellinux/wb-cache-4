5|$|This {{is a list}} of its notable players, {{generally}} {{this means}} players that have played 100 or more first-class matches for the club. However, some players who have played fewer matches are also included; players from the club's pre-Football League days, when they played fewer matches in a season <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> day, and club captains are included. Players who hold club records have footnotes describing the record. Players are listed according to the date of their first-team debut for the club. Appearances are for first-team competitive matches only including those as a substitute; wartime matches are excluded.|$|E
5|$|The A1 {{motorway}} {{was originally}} {{designed in the}} early 1970s, albeit along a different route <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> Zagreb–Split motorway route. After suppression of the Croatian Spring and removal of the Croatian leadership that proposed and adopted the construction plan in 1971, all the work related to the Zagreb–Split motorway was cancelled. The plans were revived in the 1990s and new designs were developed to include a motorway section built between Zagreb and Karlovac into the design so that the section could be shared between Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways. Construction work started in 2000 and the motorway reached Split by 2005 and was extended towards Dubrovnik later on. Both in the 1970s and in the 2000s, construction of the Zagreb–Split motorway was perceived to symbolize rebuilding of national unity.|$|E
5|$|The first {{church was}} {{markedly}} cruciform {{in shape and}} smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> floor plan. This early structure had a choir without aisles and more truncated, and a nave with only a single aisle on its north and south sides (Fig. 4). The central tower rose above the crossing {{between the north and}} south transepts and may have held bells in its upper storey. The north wall of the choir is the earliest extant structure, dating to the years immediately after the church's 1224 foundation; the clerestory windows on top of it are from the later post-1270 reconstruction. This wall has blocked up windows extending to a low level above ground, indicating that it was an external wall and proving that the eastern limb then had no aisle (Fig. 5).|$|E

25|$|Galileo is {{believed}} to have formulated his theory about the movement of a pendulum by watching the swinging of the incense lamp (not the present one) hanging from the ceiling of the nave.

25|$|Journal des sçavans: {{the first}} {{academic}} journal (started {{two months earlier}} <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> one), {{although it is not}} the longest-running journal because publication was interrupted for 24 years (between 1792 and 1816); it published some science, but also contained subject matter from other fields of learning, and its main content type was book reviews.|$|E
25|$|The National Stadium hosts Dar es Salaam's Young Africans Sports Club, Simba Sports Club, Azam F.C. {{and other}} Tanzanian {{football}} clubs, and international matches.

25|$|In 1788, Washington County {{was reduced}} in size by the splitting-off of Clinton County. This {{was a much}} larger area <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> Clinton County, {{including}} several other counties or county parts of the present New York State. Washington County was slightly enlarged by {{the transfer of the}} Town of Cambridge from Albany County to Washington County in 1791.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{migrants}} therefore {{depends on the}} variable of population increase, if the population rose by 1 per cent per year (which is slightly less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> world population) this would suggest a population of 30,000 migrants. However, if the population rose by 2 percent per year (which is similar to India in the last 20 years) this would suggest a population of 5,000 migrants.|$|E
25|$|By the 1920s, Casas {{had fallen}} {{far away from}} the avant-gardiste tendencies of his youth. If anything, his work from this period looks like it came from an {{academic}} painter of an earlier time than his work of the 1890s. He continued painting landscapes and portraits, as well as anti-tuberculosis posters and the like, but by {{the time of his death}} in 1932, shortly after the emergence of the Second Spanish Republic, he was already more a figure of the past <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present.</b>|$|E

40|$|In <b>the</b> <b>present</b> article, {{we discuss}} {{one of the}} basic {{relations}} of Quantum Mechanics - the Uncertainty Relation (UR). In 1930, few years after Heisenberg, Erwin Schrodinger generalized the famous Uncertainty Relation in Quantum Mechanics, making it more precise <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> study discusses recent generalizations of Schrodinger's work and explains why his paper remains almost forgotten in the last century.

40|$|We {{consider}} a regularization proximal method with variable met-ric {{to solve the}} nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) for P 0 -functions. We establish global convergence properties when the solu-tion set is non empty and bounded. Furthermore, we prove, without boundedness of the solution set, that the sequence generated by the algorithm is a minimizing sequence for the implicit Lagrangian func-tion, as defined by Mangasarian and Solodov, [18]. Those results are stronger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>presented</b> in a previous paper [7]...|$|R
25|$|In Paleozoic, 300–400 {{million years}} ago, the entire {{territory}} of the modern Gulf of Finland was covered by a sea. Modern relief was formed {{as a result of}} the glacier activities. Its retreat formed Littorina Sea, which water level was some 7–9 metres higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> level of the Baltic Sea. Some 4,000 years ago the sea receded and shoals in the gulf have become its islands. Later uplifting of the Baltic Shield skewed the surface of the gulf; for this reason, its ancient northern shores are significantly higher than the southern ones.|$|E
25|$|Wurtz {{measured}} {{the boiling point}} of ethylene oxide as 13.5°C, slightly higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> value, and discovered the ability of ethylene oxide to react with acids and salts of metals. Wurtz mistakenly assumed that ethylene oxide has the properties of an organic base. This misconception persisted until 1896 when Georg Bredig found that ethylene oxide is not an electrolyte. That it differed from other ethers — particularly by its propensity to engage in addition reactions, which are typical of unsaturated compounds — had long {{been a matter of}} debate. The heterocyclic triangular structure of ethylene oxide was proposed by 1868 or earlier.|$|E
25|$|Global {{sea level}} change {{for much of}} the last century has {{generally}} been estimated using tide gauge measurements collated {{over long periods of time}} to give a long-term average. More recently, altimeter measurementsnbsp&— in combination with accurately determined satellite orbitsnbsp&— have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change. To measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements, scientists have dated coral reefs that grow near the surface of the ocean, coastal sediments, marine terraces, ooids in limestones, and nearshore archaeological remains. The predominant dating methods used are uranium series and radiocarbon, with cosmogenic radionuclides being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level fall. In the early Pliocene, global temperatures were 1–2˚C warmer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> temperature, yet sea level was 15–25 meters higher than today.|$|E

60|$|Few things {{discover}} {{the state of}} the arts amongst people more certainly <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>presents</b> that are made to them by foreigners. The Pope, on his first mission into Northumberland, sent to the queen of that country some stuffs with ornaments of gold, an ivory comb inlaid with the same metal, and a silver mirror. A queen's want of such female ornaments and utensils shows that the arts were at this time little cultivated amongst the Saxons. These are <b>the</b> sort of <b>presents</b> commonly sent to a barbarous people.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>present</b> {{church was}} built from 1716 to 1718 in Baroque style. The tower was first only {{slightly}} higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> church. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> tower was built from 1894 to 1896 after designs by Johannes Otzen. It is 79.45 m high, crowned with an onion dome and four corner towers, and {{was equipped with}} a viewing platform. The tower was severely damaged by a storm on 8 January 2002. The restoration was completed in 2005.|$|R
25|$|The growing populace of Oregon Territory {{north of}} the Columbia River {{formally}} requested a new territory, which was granted by the U.S. government in 1853. The boundary of Washington Territory initially extended farther east <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> state's, including {{what is now the}} Idaho Panhandle and parts of western Montana, and picked up more land to the southeast that was left behind when Oregon was admitted as a state. The creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 established the final eastern border. A Washington State constitution was drafted and ratified in 1878, but it was never officially adopted. Although never approved by Congress, the 1878 constitution is an important historical document which shows the political thinking of the time. It was used extensively during the drafting of Washington State's 1889 constitution, the one and only official Constitution of the State of Washington. Washington became the 42nd state in the United States on November 11, 1889.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan {{published}} its {{views on}} the evacuation zones around nuclear plants in case of accidents. Instead of the 10-kilometer evacuation-zone previously thought to be sufficient to protect inhabitants, a circle of 30 kilometer was proposed as Urgent Protective Action Planning Zones, or UPZ. This definition was {{in line with the}} emergency response requirements proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. This draft plan included the designation of areas within 5 kilometers of plants as precautionary action zones, where residents would immediately evacuate {{in the event of an}} accident. Residents within a radius of about 50 kilometers would be prepared to take immediately action to prevent internal exposure to their thyroid glands by taking iodine tablets. Further studies were planned with experts and municipalities. Implementation of this plan would mean a major review of all anti-nuclear disaster programs by local governments, and it would increase the number of municipalities involved up to around 130, about three times more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> figure.|$|E
25|$|Zafrullah Khan states that, {{in actual}} fact, {{adopting}} the tehsil {{as a unit}} would have given Pakistan the Ferozepur and Zira tehsils of the Ferozpur District, the Jullundur and Rahon tehsils of Jullundur district and the Dasuya tehsil of the Hoshiarpur district. The line so drawn would also give Pakistan the State of Kapurthala (which had a Muslim majority) and would enclose within Pakistan {{the whole of the}} Amritsar district of which only one tehsil, Ajnala, had a Muslim majority. It would also give Pakistan the Shakargarh, Batala and Gurdaspur tehsils of the Gurdaspur district. If the boundary went by Doabs, Pakistan could get not only the 16 districts which had already under the notional partition been put into West Punjab, including the Gurdaspur District, but also get the Kangra District in the mountains, to the north and east of Gurdaspur. Or one could go by Commissioners' divisions. Any of these units being adopted would have been more favourable to Pakistan <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> boundary line. The tehsil was the most favourable unit. But all of the aforementioned Muslim majority tehsils, with the exception of Shakargarh, were handed over to India while Pakistan didn't receive any Non-Muslim majority district or tehsil in Punjab. Zafruallh Khan states that Radcliffe used district, tehsil, thana, and even village boundaries to divide Punjab {{in such a way that}} the boundary line was drawn much to the prejudice of Pakistan.|$|E
