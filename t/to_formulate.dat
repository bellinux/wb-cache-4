5|$|Although a {{complete}} formulation of M-theory is not known, the theory should describe two- and five-dimensional objects called branes {{and should be}} approximated by eleven-dimensional supergravity at low energies.

5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> what later {{came to be known}} as the {{continuum}} hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E

5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 1872 election, Macdonald had yet <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> a railway policy, or to devise the loan {{guarantees}} that would be needed to secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|String theory extends {{ordinary}} {{particle physics}} by replacing zero-dimensional point particles by one-dimensional objects called strings. In the late 1980s, {{it was natural}} for theorists to attempt <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> other extensions in which particles are replaced by two-dimensional supermembranes or by higher-dimensional objects called branes. Such objects had been considered as early as 1962 by Paul Dirac, and they were reconsidered by a small but enthusiastic group of physicists in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|After {{four years}} in Charlottesville, Scalia entered public service in 1971. President Richard Nixon {{appointed}} him {{general counsel for the}} Office of Telecommunications Policy, where one of his principal assignments was <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> federal policy for the growth of cable television. From 1972 to 1974, he was chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, a small independent agency that sought to improve the functioning of the federal bureaucracy. In mid-1974, Nixon nominated him as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. After Nixon's resignation, the nomination was continued by President Gerald Ford, and Scalia was confirmed by the Senate on August 22, 1974.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with ten}} other former senior officers, Manstein was called on in 1955 by the Amt Blank <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> {{plans for the}} re-founding of the German army. On 20 June 1953, {{he spoke to the}} Bundestag, giving his {{analysis}} of strategic power considerations and the country's defence and spoke about whether the country should have a professional army or a conscripted army. His opinion was that the length of service for Bundeswehr conscripts should be at least 18 months, preferably 24 months. His idea to form a reserve force was later implemented.|$|E
5|$|Because male-female {{relationships}} are inherently unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> {{a new kind}} of friendship in The Wrongs of Woman: motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's pathetic story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not end with a marriage, but rather with the creation of {{a new kind of}} family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and invent a new one, necessitated by the failure of society to grant women their natural rights.|$|E
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled his intention <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> {{the strategy of}} his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E

5|$|In December 1941 the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force) {{was ordered}} <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> an air superiority {{plan for the}} {{protection}} of three German capital ships to escape from France to Germany through the English Channel. General der Jagdflieger (General of the Fighter Force) Adolf Galland prepared the aerial assets for the operation. Both Cerberus and its supporting operation, Donnerkeil, were launched on 11 February 1942. During {{the first phase of the}} operation the Germans achieved surprise. The German ships reached Germany on 13 February 1942, just two days after the start of Cerberus and Donnerkeil.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Belgian {{physicist}} Joseph Plateau examined soap films, {{leading him}} <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> {{the concept of}} a minimal surface. German biologist and artist Ernst Haeckel painted hundreds of marine organisms to emphasise their symmetry. Scottish biologist D'Arcy Thompson pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician Alan Turing predicted mechanisms of morphogenesis which give rise to patterns of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer and French American mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot showed how the mathematics of fractals could create plant growth patterns.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, as General William C. Westmoreland {{learned of}} the North Vietnamese attack on Lang Vei and Lownd’s refusal to send a relief force, he ordered the U.S. Marines to supply enough {{helicopters}} to airlift a 50-man strike force {{with the aim of}} rescuing the survivors. Subsequently, Colonel Jonathan F. Ladd—commanding officer of the 5th Special Forces Group — and Major General Norman J. Anderson, commander of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing — were directed <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> a rescue plan. While Willoughby and his men waited for help in the command bunker, Ashley and his Laotian contingent cautiously entered the Special Forces Camp.|$|E

Rahul had earlier been the party's general secretary, the chief of Indian Youth Congress, and National Students Union of India. The party decided not to announce a prime ministerial candidate. The members of the party's pre-poll alliance committee were M. Veerappa Moily, A. K. Antony, Jitender Singh, and Suresh Pachauri.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the U.S. Army started <b>to</b> <b>formulate</b> {{requirements}} for the replacement of its helicopters then in service, {{which resulted in the}} launch of the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program. Nearly a decade later, following the refinement of requirements, evaluation of submissions, and the rebranding of the programme as the Light Helicopter (LX) program, during April 1991, the Army announced the selection of the Boeing–Sikorsky team's design as the contest winner, shortly after which a contract for construction of prototypes was awarded. The Comanche was to incorporate several advanced elements, such as stealth technologies, and a number of previously untried design features. Operationally, it was to employ advanced sensors in its reconnaissance role, where it was intended to designate targets for the AH-64 Apache. It was also armed with a single Gatling gun and a limited number of missiles and rockets for light attack duties.|$|E
