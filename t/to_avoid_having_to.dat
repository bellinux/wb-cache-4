Darwin was very aware of Wallace's financial difficulties and lobbied long and hard to get Wallace awarded a government pension for his lifetime contributions to science. When the £200 annual pension was awarded in 1881, it helped to stabilise Wallace's financial position by supplementing the income from his writings.|$|E
5|$|Since Belgium had officially {{surrendered}} on 28 May and {{no official}} Belgian government yet existed in England, {{the crew of}} A4 took their ship to Bilbao in neutral Spain <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> return to Belgium and become German prisoners of war. They arrived in Spain on 26 June and {{spent the rest of}} the war interned. Control of the ship was returned to Belgium in 1946 and it was scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Storhamar {{traditionally}} played {{ice hockey}} on natural ice. In 1977, {{the club was}} promoted to the First Division, where the regulations required that the team play on artificial ice. <b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> play all their games on the road, the municipality agreed to finance an outdoor artificial rink at Storhamar. With the increased attendance and interest for hockey following the town's team playing in the top league, Storhamar started planning an indoor venue.|$|E

5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as {{the companion}} play to The Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man {{pretending to be a}} doctor to con the other characters.|$|E
5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, {{having just}} given birth, {{was too weak}} to take on the role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired to care for the infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so upset by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E

5|$|On 23 September 1896, Victoria surpassed her {{grandfather}} George III as the longest-reigning monarch in English, Scottish, and British history. The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897, {{to coincide with}} her Diamond Jubilee, which was made a festival of the British Empire {{at the suggestion of}} Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. The prime ministers of all the self-governing dominions were invited to London for the festivities. One reason for including the prime ministers of the dominions and excluding foreign heads of state was <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> invite Victoria's grandson, Wilhelm II of Germany who, it was feared, might cause trouble at the event.|$|E
5|$|There was {{initially}} confusion as various conflicting reports of Nhung's demise surfaced, one source telling journalists that Nhung {{lived in a}} cottage within the grounds of Minh's villa and shot himself outside his house. These informants speculated that Nhung committed suicide <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> live to see Minh being demoted or humiliated. The time of this incident {{was reported to be}} 21:00. Other reports at the time said that Nhung was found dead as a result of strangulation at the Joint General Staff headquarters. According to variations of this line, Nhung either hanged himself in custody or was murdered by an unknown hand.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was {{in need of}} major improvements. Before preservation, the station had {{contained}} only a fan of sidings, which meant {{that there was no way}} for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A loop was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> propel trains to Pendre, but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.|$|E

Bubblegum considers its impact {{an attack on}} her kingdom and tells Johnnie to hide {{at the foot of}} their desk. When Lumpy finds Johnnie, she uses the device on him, attempting to revert him to when he loved her. Johnnie disappears; when Bubblegum figures out what has happened, she informs Lumpy that by failing to log his molecules, he no longer exists as part of their universe. <b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> grieve, Lumpy asks Bubblegum to use the device, properly, on her.

5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. <b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Hastings became {{involved}} in the Savidge Inquiry. Sir Leo Chiozza Money was a noted journalist, economist and former Liberal MP. On 23 April 1928, he and Miss Irene Savidge were sitting in Hyde Park in London when they were arrested by two plain-clothes police officers and taken to the nearest police station, where they were charged under the Parks Regulation Act 1872 with committing an indecent offence. The next morning, they were remanded for a week at Great Marlborough Street Police Court. At the next hearing a week later, the case was dismissed by the magistrate, who criticised the police for failing to contact a man seen running through the park to establish some kind of corroborative evidence, and failing to report at once to Scotland Yard <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> charge the defendants immediately.|$|E

Medicare clients should not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> buy supplemental insurance <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> that risk. But copayments should be low for services that are effective at improving health.|$|R

It was only years later, after several other madrigal ensembles had adopted {{the practice in}} the belief it was authentic, that Wilson admitted that the group's practice simply was expediency <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> his <b>having</b> <b>to</b> carry six music stands on public transport across London for rehearsals.|$|R
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had {{reduced the number of}} seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> scrap Hiei {{under the}} terms of the Washington Treaty, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to convert her into a demilitarized {{training}} ship. On 15 October 1929, she went into drydock at Kure Naval Arsenal. Her aft 14-inch gun turrets were removed, and she was stripped of all eight of her submerged torpedo tubes, as well as her 6-inch guns and armor belt. All but nine of her boilers were taken out, reducing her speed to , and one of her three funnels was removed. She was reclassified as a reserve ship at the end of November 1929. On 24 April 1930, reconstruction was halted due to the signing of the London Naval Treaty, which further restricted battleship construction and possession amongst the great naval powers, and preservation work was begun at Sasebo. Reconstruction would not resume until July 1931.|$|E
5|$|Although {{enjoyment}} {{factored into}} Culverhouse's {{purchase of the}} Buccaneers, it was {{first and foremost a}} business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his frugality, due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> spend money on projection screens. This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let go or traded away many of its players who were highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft choices were frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. Frustration over being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.|$|E

5000|$|Each of {{the words}} {{programmed}} into the game has associated art with it led by 5th Cell artist Edison Yan. The task of creating the art was simplified through the [...] "minimal" [...] design style of 5th Cell's previous games. Each object is rendered as in 3D with objects acting as doll on a 2D plane. This was chosen <b>to</b> <b>avoiding</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> create {{a large number of}} animations for 2D. [...] The development team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> design each AI-controlled object by hand, according to Slaczka, describing how the objects moves, and what it likes and dislikes, how much health it has, and other possible characteristics. Level design focused on providing a large variety of situations, including splitting levels between Puzzle and Action types, <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> the player develop a limited toolbox of common words and not exploring other possible solutions. Much of the initial level development was done on paper and to explore situations not commonly found in video games, due to their vocabulary system. They ended up selecting more than a hundred levels out of over seven hundred they had generated internally for the game. Both Merits and Ollars were added to reward the player for completion, with Slaczka comparing these to Xbox Live Achievements.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1915, Bayer set up {{a number}} of shell {{corporations}} and subsidiaries in the United States, to hedge against the possibility of losing control of its American assets if the U.S. should enter the war and to allow Bayer to enter other markets (e.g., army uniforms). After the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917, alien property custodian A. Mitchell Palmer began investigating German-owned businesses, and soon {{turned his attention to}} Bayer. <b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> surrender all profits and assets to the government, Bayer's management shifted the stock to a new company, nominally owned by Americans but controlled by the German-American Bayer leaders. Palmer, however, soon uncovered this scheme and seized all of Bayer's American holdings. After the Trading with the Enemy Act was amended to allow sale of these holdings, the government auctioned off the Rensselaer plant and all Bayer's American patents and trademarks, including even the Bayer brand name and the Bayer cross logo. It was bought by a patent medicine company, Sterling Products, Inc.. The rights to Bayer Aspirin and the U.S. rights to the Bayer name and trademarks were sold back to Bayer AG in 1994 for US$1 billion.|$|E
5|$|Development on Crash: Mind over Mutant began {{immediately}} {{after the completion of}} Crash of the Titans. The idea of preserving a titan for later use came from the play testing sessions of Crash of the Titans, in which the testers were found to be reluctant to leave the titans behind after an epic battle was won. Fans of the series were also a source of inspiration for Crash: Mind over Mutant, having such wishes as a free-roaming environment, Coco Bandicoot being a playable character and the return of the character Doctor Nitrus Brio. Full camera control was considered for the game, but was rejected for graphical reasons and <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> insert a split-screen view in the cooperation mode. Online gameplay was also considered as a feature in the finished game, but was omitted due to the brief development schedule. Coco Bandicoot as a playable character was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. The Wii version of Crash: Mind over Mutant was created first, with the graphics scaled up for the Xbox 360, and scaled down for the PlayStation 2. A PlayStation 3 version of the game was rumored, but was promptly debunked by Radical Entertainment as a mistake on many press sites' behalf.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 a {{commission}} {{was created to}} look into issues with the central courts, and the outcome were the Judicature Acts, under which all the central courts were made part of a single Supreme Court of Judicature, with the three central common law courts becoming {{three of the five}} divisions of the Supreme Court; this was not designed to be permanent, but rather <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> retire or demote two of the three Chief Justices to allow a single head of the Supreme Court, as this would have violated the constitutional principle that senior justices were irremovable. By sheer chance Fitzroy Kelly and Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice of England respectively both died in 1880, allowing the merger of the common law divisions of the Supreme Court into a single division, the Queen's Bench Division, under John Coleridge, who had been Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and became Lord Chief Justice of England, by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880. At this point, the Exchequer of Pleas formally ceased to exist.|$|E
