Multiple politicians of the opposition parties criticized the US-instigated fossil-fuel sanctions {{in the midst of a}} cold 1992-93 winter, saying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> further helped sympathy for Milošević and not against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of this}} group is not well documented, but the known fossils allow some preliminary conclusions: the earliest known modern picids were piculet-like forms of the Late Oligocene, about 25 million years ago (mya). By that time, however, the group was already present in the Americas and Europe, and it is hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> evolved much earlier, maybe {{as early as the}} Early Eocene (50 mya). The modern subfamilies appear to be rather young by comparison; until the mid-Miocene (10–15 mya), all picids seem to have been small or mid-sized birds similar to a mixture between a piculet and a wryneck. On the other hand, there exists a feather enclosed in fossil amber from the Dominican Republic, dated to about 25 mya, which seems to indicate that the Nesoctitinae were already a distinct lineage by then.|$|E

25|$|The Cucuteni-Trypillia {{culture was}} {{a society of}} {{subsistence}} farmers. Cultivating the soil (using an ard or scratch plough), harvesting crops and tending livestock was probably the main occupation for most people. Typically for a Neolithic culture, {{the vast majority of}} their diet consisted of cereal grains. They cultivated club wheat, oats, rye, proso millet, barley and hemp, which were probably ground and baked as unleavened bread in clay ovens or on heated stones in the home. They also grew peas and beans, apricot, cherry plum and wine grapes – though there is no solid evidence <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> made wine.

25|$|The {{common name}} {{alludes to the}} {{supposed}} ability these snakes have to launch themselves at an attacker during a strike, thereby bridging a distance that is {{equal to or greater}} than the length of the body. Mehrtens (1987) states that they live up to their name, striking at their assailants with such force <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> leave the ground. Campbell and Lamar (2004), on the other hand, describe this as greatly exaggerated, saying that actually these snakes are only able to strike about half of their own body length. In addition, they describe them as slow moving and non-aggressive. However, when provoked all species will put on a rather dramatic open-mouthed threat display.|$|E

25|$|The {{remainder}} of Egyptians, numbering between 10% and 15% of the population, mostly {{belong to the}} native Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, an Oriental Orthodox Christian Church. The most recent declarations, made by Pope Shenouda III and bishop Morkos of Shubra in 2008, put forward the number of Orthodox Copts in Egypt as being over 12 million. Other estimates made by church officials estimate this number to be 16 million. Protestant churches claim a membership of about 300,000 Egyptians, and the Coptic Catholic Church is estimated to have a similar membership among Egyptians. Based on these estimates, {{the total number of}} Christians in Egypt is between 5% and 20% of a total population of 80 million Egyptians. While some government sources have claimed a percentage of around 6 to 10%, a number of published sources such as the Washington Institute, in addition to some of the Coptic sources, uphold that Christians represent more than 10% of the total population and claim <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> still compose up to 15 or even 20% of the Egyptian population.|$|E

25|$|Harry Johnston was {{appointed}} {{as the first}} Commissioner of the British Central Africa Protectorate in July 1891. Johnston did not consider that the Crown had a general claim to sovereignty over any land unless it had been expressly transferred by cession. Without sovereignty, the Crown {{had no right to}} alienate that land. However, some treaties made after July 1891 did cede sovereignty over land, but granted the communities involved the right to retain any land <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> occupied as Crown tenants, leaving any vacant land free for the Crown to alienate. He also accepted that the treaties and agreements made {{before the start of the}} protectorate might be evidence of sales of land. Even though he accepted that the land belonged to its African communities, not the chiefs, Johnston proposed the legal fiction that the people had given their chiefs the right to sell it. This interpretation validated the chiefs’ sales and grants of unused land to Europeans. He also claimed that he was entitled to investigate whether these sales were valid and, if they were, to issue Certificates of Claim (in effect a registration of freehold title over the land to the new owners.|$|E
25|$|Experts have {{tremendous}} experience through practice and {{education in a}} particular field. Musical experts {{use some of the}} same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice. For example, musical experts may organize notes into scales or create a hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin & Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease. This expert used auditory and motor memory along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> use a mental map of the piece allowing them {{to keep track of the}} progression of the piece. Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.|$|E

500|$|Several small {{passerine}} species survive freezing winter nights by inducing a lower {{metabolic rate}} and hypothermia, of {{a maximum of}} [...] below normal body temperature, {{in order to reduce}} energy consumption overnight. However, in freezing conditions, it may be that for very small birds, including the tiny goldcrest, the energy economies of induced hypothermia may be insufficient to counterbalance the negative effects of hypothermia including the energy required to raise body temperature back to normal at dawn. Observations of five well-fed birds suggest that they maintain normal body temperatures during cold nights by metabolising fat laid down during the day, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> use behavioural thermoregulation strategies, such as collective roosting in dense foliage or snow holes to survive winter nights.

500|$|One {{interpretation}} of the perspective of Rix {{is that she was}} an orientalist, in the sense used by academic Edward Said. However, Hoorn argues that she and her sister were to a significant extent counter-orientalist: they focussed on the common nature of human experience rather than cultural expressions of difference and they sought to portray everyday life in Tangier as they found it, rather than presenting generalised views of the orient. Her works also reflected the modernist interest in the empirical: in using the bright light of north Africa to help bring out the structures and shapes that made up visual impressions. Stylistically, Rix's Moroccan paintings have been characterised as the [...] "most abstract, flat and post-impressionistic of her career". Whether this reflected the influence of Matisse is not known – despite the coincidences of their Tangier visits, it is not certain <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>actually</b> met. Rix {{was one of the first}} Australians to paint post-impressionist landscapes, represented by works such as Men in the Market Place, Tangier (1914) and View of Tangier (1914), produced at the time of a second visit to the city. Such works demonstrated the development of Rix's style at the time: loose brush strokes, a palette confined to a few low-keyed colours, and an emphasis on shadow and light, affecting both the overall impression made by the picture and the treatment of individual figures.|$|E
