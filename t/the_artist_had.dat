5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> helped found.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Miloš's {{descendant}} King Alexander visited Jovanović at his Vienna {{studio and}} requested {{a painting of}} the revolt to commemorate its 75th anniversary. With his rise in stature, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> found himself producing numerous replicas of his earlier Orientalist works. According to biographer Nikola Kusovac, Jovanović grew bored with painting replicas and considered taking up a different genre. Alexander's request presented Jovanović {{with an opportunity to}} deviate from Orientalism and try his hand at history painting. The Takovo Uprising was his first historical composition.|$|E
5|$|The realist Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} 19th- and 20th-century Serbian painters. He was a native of the town of Vršac, then part of the Hungarian-administered Banat region of Austria-Hungary, which had a mixed population of Serbs, Hungarians and Germans. Most of the Serbs were descended from 14th-century migrants fleeing the Ottoman advance following the Battle of Kosovo in June 1389. Such diversity and multiculturalism ensured the town's reputation for prosperity and cultural enlightenment. Jovanović's artistic abilities were noticed at an early age, and nourished by his father, a professional photographer. His early development was informed by the portraits and religious paintings of artists such as Pavel Đurković, Jovan Popović and Arsenije Teodorović. Jovanović's early copies of the artworks available to him in Vršac brought him instant recognition and steered him towards a career in the arts. In his adolescence, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> observed people from the Vršac countryside and their customs, and compiled sketches of natural and man-made structures in and around the town. While a student, he was commissioned to draw a series of preparatory sketches for the bell tower of his hometown's main church.|$|E

25|$|December 2006: German comedian Atze Schröder sued Arne Klempert, {{secretary}} of Wikimedia Deutschland, {{because he did}} not want his real name published in Wikipedia. Schröder later withdrew his complaint, but wanted his attorney's costs to be paid by Klempert. A court decided that <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> to cover those costs by himself.|$|E
25|$|The crown {{is wrong}} in the Queen's {{portrait}}. When the new coin portrait was first issued in 1990 (see above), a legend surfaced that <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> simply added {{the image of a}} crown to a portrait of the Queen, and that she was never meant to be seen wearing that headgear. This is patently false; she posed personally for the portrait wearing one of her usual crowns.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{her work}} Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995, a tent appliquéd {{with the names}} of {{everyone}} <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> ever shared a bed with was shown at Charles Saatchi's Sensation exhibition held at the Royal Academy in London.

25|$|Van Gogh {{also wrote}} to Wilhelmina {{regarding}} the Portraits of Madame Ginoux he painted first in Arles in 1888 {{and again in}} February 1890 while at the hospital in Saint-Rémy. The second set were styled after the portrait of the same figure by Gauguin, and Van Gogh described Gachet's enthusiasm upon viewing the version painted earlier that year, which <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> carried {{with him to the}} home in Auvers. Van Gogh subsequently carried compositional elements from this portrait to that of Dr. Gachet, including the table-top with two books and pose of the figure with head leaning on one hand.|$|E
25|$|Cassatt {{saw that}} works by female artists were often {{dismissed}} with contempt unless <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> {{a friend or}} protector on the jury, {{and she would not}} flirt with jurors to curry favor. Her cynicism grew when one of the two pictures she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided that she needed to move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.|$|E
25|$|The {{paintings}} {{from this period}} are most remarkable for the vividness of the extreme violence and even the human denigration that is often depicted. Such representations are however, also rich in a lyrical content that was to characterise the artist from then on. The juxtaposition of the international tendencies that formed Orellana took a more definite form in this period: his old Spanish inheritance, the input from America, the wealth of archaeological culture and Italy with Conceptualism and Arte Povera. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> a solo show at the stand of Juana Mordo at the FIAC 1978, Paris, France. These amalgamated into a whole that {{paved the way for}} new developments in Orellana's work.|$|E

25|$|He {{also contributed}} a {{portrait}} of the then-still-living Robert E. Lee to the gallery. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> not known any of these men personally, and thus had to rely on photographs and descriptions from their colleagues to complete their likenesses. Many of Washington's portraits are still on display in Preston Library on the VMI campus. Also in the Institute's collections are a number of landscapes and genre paintings he completed after poems by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Washington was also active in promoting the Institute's cultural life; he founded an art gallery on campus, for which he secured funding from William Wilson Corcoran, and taught fine arts to those students who desired such instruction. Among his pupils was Richard Norris Brooke.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example for}} Koon's early work is The Equilibrium Series (1983), {{consisting}} {{of one to}} three basketballs floating in distilled water, a project <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> researched {{with the help of}} Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. The Total Equilibrium Tanks are completely filled with distilled water and a small amount of ordinary salt, to assist the hollow balls in remaining suspended in the centre of the liquid. In a second version, the 50/50 Tanks, only half the tank is filled with distilled water, with the result that the balls float half in and half out of the water. In addition, Koons conceived and fabricated five unique works for the Encased series (1983–1993/98), sculptures consisting of stacked sporting balls with their original cardboard packaging in glass display case. Also part of the Equilibrium series are posters featuring basketball stars in Nike advertisements and 10 bronze objects, representing lifesaving gear.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{mentioned}} that the first certain historical record dates from 1353 or 1357. However {{the presence of the}} Turin Shroud in Lirey, France, is only undoubtedly attested in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a memorandum to Antipope Clement VII, stating that the shroud was a forgery and that <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> confessed. Historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man existed {{in the small town of}} Lirey around the years 1353 to 1357 in the possession of a French Knight, Geoffroi de Charny, who died at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. However the correspondence of this shroud in Lirey with the shroud in Turin, and its origin has been debated by scholars and lay authors, with statements of forgery attributed to artists born a century apart. Some contend that the Lirey shroud was the work of a confessed forger and murderer.|$|E

25|$|While on {{a hunting}} trip in 1989 at Taylor Ranch in Colorado, Parker met Oklahoma City {{businessman}} Robert A. Funk. After Funk discovered that Parker was a wildlife artist, he asked Parker {{if he had}} any examples of his work to show him. It just so happened that <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> an elk bust sculpture called Perfection in his truck and, after showing it to Funk, a sale was consummated on the spot for the sculpture. Parker would meet Funk again at the C. M. Russell Art Show in 1999 and some years later he suggested to Funk that he could design a sculpture of a Clydesdale horse to be given as an award to exemplary employees of Funk's Express Employment Professionals company in Oklahoma City. A deal was struck between the two that resulted in Parker casting a now sold out 50-piece edition called Express Ranch Clydesdale. Over time, Funk has added several more Parker sculptures to his collection, including a monumental bronze elk sculpture for the entrance to his New Mexico ranch.|$|E
25|$|In this performance, Abramović {{sought to}} re-evoke {{the energy of}} extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire {{at the start of}} the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramović cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When {{finished}} with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramović leapt across the flames, propelling herself into the center of the large star. Due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that, once inside the star, <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> lost consciousness from lack of oxygen. Some members of the audience realized what had occurred only when the flames came very near to her body and she remained inert. A doctor and several members of the audience intervened and extricated her from the star.|$|E

500|$|In late 1908, Roosevelt sat for {{sculptor}} Victor David Brenner, who was {{designing a}} medal for the Panama Canal Commission. [...] While {{the contents of}} their conversations were never recorded, it appears they discussed Roosevelt's plans for coinage redesign. [...] Roosevelt had admired a 1907 plaque of Lincoln which <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> produced. [...] It is uncertain how Brenner was selected to design the cent, but in , Mint Director Frank A. Leach contacted Brenner to ask his fee for designing the coin.

500|$|Rather than reprint {{material}} cut-and-pasted to fit {{the narrow}} pages of the paperback format as had been done with Ballantine's Mad books, Kurtzman wanted to create new material designed {{to fit the}} page dimensions.

500|$|Kove {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make the film biographical, based on a story her father told her: he had dreamed of being an artist, and made an appointment with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough {{to make it in the}} art world. However, he stood at the top of the stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> <b>had</b> said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood he would never have met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E
