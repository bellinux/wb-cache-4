We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile on my face, too.|$|E
500|$|AOL TV writer Jane Boursaw wrote, [...] "The whole storyline {{with the}} creepy dual-personality doc and the mind-control-dreams was good, though I sort of knew the doc must be {{involved}} from the beginning. I also wonder how it {{fits in with}} the alternate universe." [...] The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen graded the episode with a B-. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly believed that [...] "in some ways, {{this was one of}} the less-distinctive, more X-Files-ish episodes of Fringe on Thursday night... But as usual, there was another narrative layer at work here" [...] involving a grieving Olivia. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 7.4/10, explaining the case-of-the-week failed to have [...] "excitement, surprise, and suspense" [...] and lacked [...] "what makes a typical Fringe episode unique and intriguing". While calling certain parts [...] "kind of boring", Isler did however praise the episode's directing, acting, sets, and other technical aspects. He concluded his review by noting the best part of [...] "Dream Logic" [...] was the ending depicting a young Peter, [...] "It's a haunting scene, and it adds yet another stone in this long pathway to revelation that the Fringe team is building up to... But besides that great little scene at the end, I thought this was an average episode. Granted, Fringes 'average' episodes are still better than a lot of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Coexist {{deals with}} themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. Croft and Sim share lead vocals, which {{occasionally}} overlap in call and response interplay and slow crescendos. Sim, who cites Sade as an influence, has more assured vocals, while Croft sings in a shyer style and exhibits [...] in her voice. The lyrics {{focus on a}} failing relationship and changes in a romance. Will Ryan of Beats Per Minute writes that they follow [...] "the back-and-forth complexities of a fractured relationship that ... explores a wilderness of residual feelings left over after said relationship has collapsed." [...] Garry Mulholland of Uncut interprets the album to be [...] "the story of a relationship broken by the protagonists' tendency to love too much while being unable to express their need to each other." [...] Eric Sundermann of The A.V. Club views that the album's songs [...] "all focus on different stages of romantic love, from infatuation to frustration to all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> that falls in between." [...] Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine felt that the songs follow-up on the [...] "lovebirds" [...] from the xx's debut album, [...] "now separated and devastated ... mus on what went wrong". Puja Patel of Spin remarks that the band's [...] "fantastical, elemental star-crossed-lover talk {{has been replaced by}} evocations of a harder, more aggressively worked-at love". Most of the songs have single-word titles that evoke long sentiments.|$|E

I think it’s this melamine with other compounds that is toxic.” The composition of the crystals analyzed in contaminated pet food ingredients is similar to the composition of a waste product produced in cyanuric acid production.|$|E

At E3 2013, Ubisoft revealed that it was not going to make any more exclusives for the Wii U until sales of the console improved, though it stated shortly after that it was still a [...] "big supporter" [...] of the Wii U, and planned to release as many Wii U games in 2013 as it did in 2012. In July 2013, Bethesda Softworks {{announced that}} it had no games in development for the Wii U, with Bethesda VP of PR and marketing Pete Hines explaining: [...] "It depends on the games that we are making and how we think it aligns with that console, and how the hardware aligns with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> we are making". This explanation was later refined to being largely due to the hardware. Contrarily, Activision has stated that it will [...] "do everything they can" [...] to support the system.|$|E
