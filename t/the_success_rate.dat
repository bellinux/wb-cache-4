5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> of capture is.

5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To compare <b>the</b> {{surgical}} <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> of {{silicone tube}} intubation {{according to the}} preoperative lacrimal syringing test and dacryocystography (DCG) in adult patients with epiphora. Methods: Medical records of 142 patients who underwent silicone tube intubation were retrospectively reviewed. The surgical re-sults were divided into 3 groups based on postoperative symptoms and the syringing test results: Good, Fair, and Fail. Good and Fair were classified into <b>the</b> surgical <b>success</b> groups. We compared <b>the</b> surgical <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> according to <b>the</b> preoperative sy-ringing test and stenosis site observed on dacryocystography. Results: <b>The</b> <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> of silicone tube intubation were 88. 4 % and 87. 4 % in eyes with preoperative syringing results of to-tally-passed and partially-passed syringing tests, respectively, revealing {{no statistically significant differences}} (p = 0. 838, chi-square test).

5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication.

5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. <b>The</b> <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} 20thcentury, when Swan Falls Dam was {{constructed}} {{on the middle}} Snake River upstream of Hells Canyon, the fifteen dams and reservoirs on the river have posed an increasing problem for migrating salmon. Agricultural lands and their resulting runoff have also {{had a significant impact}} on <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> of migrating fish. Salmon can travel up the Snake River as far as Hells Canyon Dam, using the fish passage facilities of the four lower Snake River dams, leaving the Clearwater, Grande Ronde and Salmon river to sustain spawning salmon. Rising in several forks in the Clearwater Mountains of central Idaho, the Clearwater and Salmon River watersheds are nearly undeveloped with the enormous exception of Dworshak Dam on the North Fork Clearwater River. The watershed of the Grande Ronde in northeastern Oregon is also largely undeveloped. The four reservoirs formed by the lower Snake River dams—Lake Sacagawea, Lake Herbert G. West, Lake Bryan, and Lower Granite Lake—have also formed problems, as the downstream current in the pools is often not enough for the fish to sense, confusing their migration routes.|$|E
30|$|The result {{reveals that}} (1) <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> of dual-frequency are {{significantly}} improved by triple-frequency and the improvement becomes more remarkable when the ionospheric constraint becomes weaker; (2) since triple-frequency geometry-based model is already very strong, <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> of different ionospheric constraints are very similar. It is however {{not the case}} for <b>the</b> dual-frequency, its <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> becomes smaller for the weaker ionospheric constraint; (3) it is noted that <b>the</b> triple-frequency <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> is still very large in case of ionosphere-float model. This result is very promising, meaning that the AR over long baselines will be applicable with triple-frequency signals. For more information about the improved AR, one can refer to Teunissen et al.

40|$|Choosing the {{equivalence}} {{margin for}} a non-inferiority trial of an anti-infective medication involves both clinical and statistical considerations. This paper argues {{that for some}} trials the equivalence margin should depend on <b>the</b> underlying <b>success</b> <b>rates,</b> rather than being set in advance at a fixed level d. A valid statistical test that adapts d to <b>the</b> underlying <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> is described. When <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> for comparator drugs are well-established, a test of non-inferiority with a fixed d is appropriate. However, a fixed d may not be justifiable in {{a situation in which}} <b>the</b> expected <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> are difficult to estimate, such as for a new indication or for an unusual study design. As elucidated by Swartz[2], many organisms acquire resistance to anti-infective medications so that <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>rates</b> of these medications decrease over time.

5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase <b>the</b> <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{success of}} the American white ibis is sensitive to the hydrological conditions of the ecosystem such as rainfall and water levels. Low and decreasing water levels predict good prey accessibility. Water level reversals, where levels rise in the breeding season, disperse prey and impact on foraging success. Nest numbers and average clutch sizes are smaller in periods of reduced prey availability. <b>The</b> <b>success</b> <b>rate</b> of parents raising one or more young to 20 days of age ranges widely from 5 to 70% of nests, and varies greatly between nearby colonies. American white ibis parents {{have been known to}} supplement their chicks' diet with items such as cockroaches and rotting food from human garbage in poorer years, when fish and crayfish are more scarce. Studies have also shown that years with higher nesting numbers had significantly faster spring drying rates of water bodies than years with low nesting numbers. This is because faster drying rates means that there are fewer fish and increased available area where crayfish can be hunted. This highlights the fact that American white ibises do not use probability of nesting failure as a key factor in determining nesting sites but instead, rely on other criteria such as prey availability and nest-site predation rates. The draining of wetlands in south Florida has also impacted on species that forage in shallow water such as the American white ibis, and its increase in numbers is a key indicator of restoration of habitat within the Everglades.|$|E
