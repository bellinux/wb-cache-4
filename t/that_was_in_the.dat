5|$|In {{the ending}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} theatrical version, Ellen rammed the shark with Mike's boat, mortally wounding it. The shark then causes {{the boat to}} break apart with its death contortions, forcing {{the people on the}} boat to jump off to avoid going down with it. American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive. This version is what Universal used on home media releases.|$|E

5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of seepage of lava from rifts {{in the sea}} floor.

The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.|$|E

5|$|With the Norwegian {{operation}} requirements {{drawn up}} for a coastal reconnaissance floatplane, a series of modifications were requested to the original design. The changes included a redesign of the float structure to accommodate either a torpedo or bomb load carried under the center fuselage to supplement five underwing bomb racks. Additional armament changes led {{to a combination of}} six machine guns replacing the four machine gun (two fixed forward, two flexible rear-mounted 7.9mm)/one cannon (forward facing, fixed 20mm) arrangement <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial design. Provision for a rear under-fuselage gun was also made. Further equipment requirements including fitting a rear fuselage-mounted camera as well as changes to instrumentation and radio equipment.|$|E
5|$|Bath was ravaged in {{the power}} {{struggle}} between the sons of William the Conqueror following his death in 1087. The victor, William II Rufus, granted the city to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath. Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king, {{as well as the}} city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had recently lost its abbot, Ælfsige, and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city; it was likely the abbey's wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery. By acquiring Bath, John also acquired the mint <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey, probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues. William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but {{it was part of a}} pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons at Wells who had previously served the diocese. John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray's rebellions. Permission was given to move the see of Somerset from Wells– a comparatively small settlement– to the then walled city of Bath.|$|E
5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped shape a society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E

5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access}} to specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E
