5|$|VHEMT {{promotes}} a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, {{a group that}} argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population {{to care for the}} Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism.

5|$|Manchester City's {{fortunes}} declined {{during the}} 1980s and 1990s. For a single season, 1998–99, the club fell {{as far as}} English football's third tier. The club did not qualify for European competition in this period. In ordinary circumstances, the club's fifth-placed finish in 1991 and 1992 would have granted a UEFA Cup place. However, English clubs had recently returned from a ban issued after the Heysel Stadium disaster. As the UEFA coefficient that determines the number of places per country is based upon performances in European competition over <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> England had a reduced allocation until 1995.|$|E

5|$|Capital to {{fund the}} scheme had been raised {{separately}} by the Wakefield and Leeds committees. A complicated restructuring of the finances in 1721 fixed the nominal capital at £26,700. Regular dividends at 7 per cent were paid to the shareholders from 1718, and the navigation was leased to various groups, who {{would be responsible for}} collection of tolls and repairs. The lease rose from £800 in 1704 to £2,600 in 1729, when receipts from each of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> had averaged £6,016. The early trade consisted mainly of woollen goods from Leeds, Wakefield, Halifax and Bradford, with wool and corn from Lincolnshire and East Anglia travelling in the opposite direction. By the 1720s there were also significant quantities of coal.|$|E
5|$|R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a {{reported}} $80million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), {{rumored to be}} the largest recording contract in history at that point. The group's 1996 album New Adventures in Hi-Fi debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK. The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial fortunes of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> Time writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole. That same year, R.E.M. parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against him {{by a member of the}} band's home office in Athens. The group's lawyer Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{countries}} participating each year has grown steadily, from seven in 1956 to over twenty in the late 1980s. A record 43 countries participated in 2008 and 2011. As the number of contestants has risen, preliminary competitions and relegation have been introduced, to ensure that as many countries as possible {{get the chance to}} compete. In 1993, a preliminary show, Kvalifikacija za Millstreet ("Qualification for Millstreet"), was held to select three Eastern European countries to compete {{for the first time at}} the main Contest. After the 1993 Contest, a relegation rule was introduced; the six lowest-placed countries in the contest would not compete the following year. In 1996, a new system was introduced. Audio tapes of all twenty-nine entrants were submitted to national juries. The twenty-two highest-placed songs after the juries voted reached the contest. Norway, as host country, was given a bye to the final. From 1997 to 2001 a system was used whereby the countries with the lowest average scores over <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> were relegated. Countries could not be relegated for more than one year.|$|E

The estimated annual average landing from east coast during the period 1993 - 97 was 60. 638 tonnes against 46. 000 t obtained along west coast thereby showing the potential of this new resource, especially along the southern maritime states of the east coast. It has been observed that the oil sardine catch during 1993 - 97 increased to more than three fold in Andhra Pradesh from that of <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> period 1988 - 92 while along Tamil Nadu - Pondicheny coast the catch almost doubled and recorded 80 % of the total oil sardine production of east coast...|$|R

5|$|Growth, {{employment}} and household income have lagged behind the South, {{and the five}} most deprived districts in England are all in Northern England, as are ten of the twelve most declining major towns in the UK. The picture is not clear-cut, as the North has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable Southern areas such as Surrey. Yorkshire's Golden Triangle which extends from north Leeds to Harrogate and across to York is an example, as is Cheshire's Golden Triangle, centred on Alderley Edge. There are major disparities even across individual cities: Sheffield Hallam {{is one of the}} wealthiest constituencies in the country, and is the richest outside London and the South East, while Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, just {{on the other side of}} the city, is one of the most deprived. Housing in Northern England is more affordable than the UK average: the median house price in most Northern cities was below £200,000 in 2015 with typical increases of below 10% over <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> However, some areas have seen house prices fall considerably, putting inhabitants at risk of negative equity.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1990s, {{the number}} of air {{ambulance}} crashes in the United States, mostly involving helicopters, began to climb. [...] By 2005, this number had reached a record high. Crash rates from 2000 to 2005 more than doubled <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> <b>year's</b> rates. To some extent, these numbers had been deemed acceptable, as it was understood that {{the very nature of}} air ambulance operations meant that, because a life was at stake, air ambulances would often operate on the very edge of their safety envelopes, going on missions in conditions where no other civilian pilot would fly. [...] As a result, nearly fifty percent of all EMS personnel deaths in the United States occur in air ambulance crashes. [...] In 2006, the United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that many air ambulances crashes were avoidable, eventually leading to the improvement of government standards and CAMTS accreditation.|$|R
40|$|Background Premature {{termination}} from counseling is {{a pervasive}} problem across college campuses; thus, predicting counseling dropout may encourage counseling centers to develop methods {{to reduce the}} risk of attrition from counseling. This study examined the relationship between psychological distress and premature termination from therapy in counseling center clients, as measured by the Outcome Questionnaire- 45. 2. Method Archival data were collected from a student counseling center at a large Midwestern university. Across <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> period, 70 male and 128 female client files were grouped by attrition status (intake only, premature termination, planned termination). Results There was a significant gender by termination status interaction for symptom distress. Women with higher symptom distress scores were at a higher risk for premature dropout from counseling. Conclusions These results suggest the importance of considering the potential impact of symptom distress on early dropout in university counseling centers...|$|R

PHN lending rebounded in FY 88 to $ 304. 9 {{million for}} eight projects, a 50 percent {{increase}} in volumeover <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>five</b> <b>year</b> average. Lending for health predominated, while population lending accounted for 27 percent of the total. Interest in nutrition increased, but nutrition lending received little emphasis (except in connection with structural adjustment). Important trends included increased attention to project software, continued support for decentralization of health systems, more efforts to involve {{the private sector in}} delivering PHN services, more emphasis on health costs and financing, development of new ways to reach clients at periphery, and more emphasis on focused projects. If lending to PHN sectors is to increase from its current low level of 2 to 3 percent of Bank lending to 5 percent or more, current staff resources are inadequate. There is a shortfall in PHN staff resources of about 20 staff years to meet the targeted level of 12 to 14 projects and $ 500 million a year in PHN lending.
