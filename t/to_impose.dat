Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states <b>to</b> <b>impose</b> any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E

What is the potential involved in such optimization? It is often suggested that it is entropy or entropy production.
