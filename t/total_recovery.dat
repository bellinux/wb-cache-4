Initially, MIM received good revenue from its bulk concentrate, but as the nature of the ore continued to deteriorate, the production of the bulk concentrate increased and saturated the market. Payment terms declined until MIM received less than half the payment for zinc in the bulk concentrate than it received for zinc in the zinc concentrate.|$|E
25|$|In 1933, native Iowan Henry A. Wallace went to Washington as Secretary of Agriculture {{and served}} as {{principal}} architect for the new farm program. Wallace, {{former editor of the}} Midwest's leading farm journal, Wallace's Farmer, believed that prosperity would return to the agricultural sector only if agricultural production was curtailed. Further, he believed that farmers would be monetarily compensated for withholding agricultural land from production. These two principles were incorporated into the Agricultural Adjustment Act passed in 1933. Iowa farmers experienced some recovery {{as a result of the}} legislation but like all Iowans, they did not experience <b>total</b> <b>recovery</b> until the 1940s.

John Ely made a spot start for the Dodgers on April 10 against the Padres, allowing two home runs while the Dodgers offense could only tally four singles in a 7–2 loss. Kershaw continued his dominance over the Giants in his next start, blanking them for 6 2/3 innings while the Dodgers opened a series in San Francisco with a 6–1 victory. The victory came with a cost, however, as starting shortstop and leadoff hitter Rafael Furcal suffered a broken thumb while stealing third base.

At the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Bournemouth in April 2010, Holby City was accused of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS, encouraging patients to believe in miracles and fuelling compensation culture.
