5000|$|In {{keeping with}} Bauhaus philosophy, {{every aspect of}} the house and its {{surrounding}} landscape was planned for maximum efficiency and simplicity. Gropius carefully sited the house to complement its New England habitat on a grassy rise surrounded by stone retaining walls, amidst wetlands and an orchard of 90 apple trees which the Gropiuses allowed to grow naturally other than a few rounds of mowing during the growing season. Gropius wanted the outdoor space around the home to be an equally [...] "civilized area" [...] and created a lawn that extended twenty feet around the entire house, with a perennial garden expanding in the south by the porch. Although the house sits on a rather flat plot of land, by keeping the woodlands well maintained, the Gropiuses were able to retain a broad view of the south, east, and west. His screened porch was placed {{in such a way that}} it helps to divide the land around the house into multiple zones, comparable to rooms inside a house. The house was conceived as part of an organic landscape, where Gropius utilized indoor/outdoor spaces to accentuate a relationship between the structure and the site. Before the home's design was even complete, Walter Gropius was hard at work creating the ideal landscape. He selected mature trees from the neighboring forest and helped to transplant them in what would later become his yard. Ise was the predominate landscaper in the family, and she and Walter selected Scotch pine, white pine, elm, oak, and American Beech trees to complement their surroundings. The Gropiuses also added [...] "rescued" [...] boulders and wooden trellises adorned with pink climbing roses and Concord grapevines to flatter the New England landscape. Bittersweet <b>vines</b> and <b>trumpet</b> <b>vines</b> also connected the home to nature. Ise spent many hours each week planting, weeding, and trimming. She also filled and maintained more than a dozen bird feeders and bird houses on the property and claimed to have known more than ninety birds personally. After a trip to Japan in the 1950s, Mrs. Gropius removed the perennials and covered the ground in a layer of gray gravel, where she then planted azaleas, candytuft, cotoneaster, and one large red-leafed Japanese Maple.|$|R

40|$|Using {{vertical}} greenery {{systems to}} reduce heat transmission {{is becoming more}} common in modern architecture. Vertical greenery systems are divided into two main categories; green facades and living walls. This study aims to examine the thermal performance of vertical greenery systems in hot and humid climates. An experimental procedure {{was used to measure}} indoor temperature and humidity. These parameters were also measured for the gap between the vertical greenery systems and wall surfaces. Three boxes were used as small-scale rooms. Two boxes were provided with either a living wall or a green facade and one box did not have any greenery (benchmark). Blue <b>Trumpet</b> <b>Vine</b> was used in the vertical greenery systems. The data were recorded over the course of three sunny days in April 2013. An analyses of the results showed that the living wall and green facade reduced indoor temperature up to 4. 0 °C and 3. 0 °C, respectively. The living wall and green facade also reduced cavity temperatures by 8. 0 °C and 6. 5 °C, respective...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFacade {{and roof}} greenings enhance thermal comfort in {{building}} environment both {{indoor and outdoor}} by reducing heat transfer to and from building envelope. They shade buildings from solar radiation, absorb solar radiation for photosynthesis and evapo-transpiration, reduce solar reflection and re-radiation to atmosphere. Green façade and roof has been included as one of major green building evaluation criteria for many sustainable cities in the world nowadays. This research aims to study the use of climbing plants as vertical shading devices, “biofacade”, for naturally ventilated building with windows facing west. Blue <b>trumpet</b> <b>vine</b> (Thunbergia grandiflora) was selected due to its fast growth and consistently full leave coverage. Two experiments were carried out to compare air temperature of a room with biofacade and a room without. Natural ventilation were added to both rooms and the thermal performances were compared. It {{has been found that}} biofacade performance increased when room air velocity was high from the case with natural ventilation. The room air temperature was reduced from outside ambient air temperature to the maximum of 9. 93 °C, with an average of 3. 63 °C during day time (9 : 00 a. m. - 8 : 30 p. m.). When air velocity was low, the temperature difference had maximum of 6. 72 °C, average of 0. 91 °C lower than normal room. At night (9 : 00 p. m. - 8 : 30 a. m.), however, biofacade had slightly higher air temperature than normal room and outside ambient air in both cases. Unexpectedly, leaves of the selected climbers did not obstruct wind when cross ventilation was provided and air velocity inside room with biofacade was higher than room without biofacade especially in the daytime. Besides, in tropical climate, air behind leaves always maintain lower temperature than ambient air temperature, which is different from research in temperate climate where air behind leaves can sometime obtain higher temperature. From the 2 experiments, the room temperature with biofacade reduced significantly but still could not reach comfort zone (22 - 28 °C) during the day time. However, the application can be recommended to use for pre-cooling the fresh air-intake of air conditioning systems, so it can help reduce cooling load efficiently...|$|E
