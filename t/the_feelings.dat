5000|$|Perhaps another helpful {{analogy to}} Berry's Paradox {{would be the}} phrase, [...] "indescribable feeling". [...] If <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> is indeed indescribable, then no {{description}} of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> would be true.

Following the album's completion, Bloc Party embarked on promotional tours before its release.|$|E
5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E
50|$|The {{evaluator}} is {{instructed to}} assess {{the extent to which}} the patient displays the given criterion. Each item is scored independently based on a five-point, ratio scale. A rating of 0 indicates that <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> is not present in the patient. A rating of 1 indicates mild prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient. A rating of 2 indicates moderate prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient. A rating of 3 indicates severe prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient. A rating of 4 indicates a very severe prevalence of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> in <b>the</b> patient.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the existential explication {{of the idea}} of "saṁsāra" by Yoshinori Takeuchi, compared with the one by Keiji Nishitani. According to Takeuchi, the idea of "saṁsāra" is grounded in <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of "saṁsāra". And he pointed out some examples of <b>the</b> <b>feeling.</b> But they belong to <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> which one has after conversion. He failed to show any examples of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> which one has before conversion or enlightenment. I try to consider where <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> originates before conversion or enlightenment. I think it originates from the shudder that one has when one acknowledges that the birth-and-death problem (one has to transcend both birth and death and never be born and die any more) will never vanish even if one is dead. If one cannot settle this problem during this lifetime, and as long as it never disappears when one dies, then one must carry it over into one's next life after death. This is the source of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of "saṁsāra"...|$|R

5|$|The {{tradition}} of Voviyo (wedding songs), sung by women during a Ros, {{is important to}} this community.

Only women whose husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> of the people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.|$|E

We explored the hypothesis that one factor underlying <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of knowing is the degree of prior learning for the sought-after item. Undergraduates learned a list in which various items were acquired to a criterion of either one correct recall, two correct recalls, or four correct recalls. Four weeks later, the subjects had a recall-retention test, then rank ordered the nonrecalled items in terms of <b>the</b> relative <b>feeling</b> of knowing for each of the nonrecalled items, and finally had a recognition test on the nonrecalled items.

Port became irritated <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> Lyon had for his ex-girlfriend Danielle and his unwillingness to commit to a relationship, and eventually severed ties with him. Lyon's distaste for his housemate Adam Senn's girlfriend Allie Crandell ultimately ruined their friendship, while Senn and Crandell's relationship was strained by rumors of his alleged infidelity. Lucas' long-distance boyfriend Duncan Davies, who lived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, broke up with Lucas after discovering that she had become friendly with her ex-boyfriend JR. Meanwhile, the companionship between Port and Palermo dissolved after growing tensions in the workplace.|$|E

Even {{in the wake of his}} recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> in Athens about his return. His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.|$|E

5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
