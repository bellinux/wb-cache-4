40|$|AbstractT 91 ferritic-martensitic {{steel is}} one of the {{candidate}} materials to future fast reactors where lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) is chosen as the coolant. The interaction of the steel with LBE coolant should be investigated by means of mechanical tests and detailed microstructural analysis. Quantitative analysis requires fracture toughness <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> LBE. However <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> LBE are not easily applied with conventional methods due to the conductive nature of LBE.

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest a crucial involvement of glutamate in {{the mechanism of}} action of anxiolytic and/or antidepressant drugs. The involvement of group I mGlu receptors in anxiety and depression has also been proposed. Given the recent discovery of a selective and brain penetrable mGlu 5 receptor antagonists, the effect of 2 -methyl- 6 -(phenylethynyl) -pyridine (MPEP), i. e. the most potent compound described, was evaluated in established models of anxiety and depression. Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats or male Albino Swiss or C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. The anxiolytic-like effects of MPEP was <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> the conflict drinking test and the elevated plus-maze <b>test</b> <b>in</b> rats as well as <b>in</b> the four-plate <b>test</b> <b>in</b> mice. The antidepressant-like effect was estimated using the tail suspension <b>test</b> <b>in</b> mice and the behavioural despair <b>test</b> <b>in</b> rats. MPEP (1 [*]–[*] 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) induced anxiolytic-like effects in the conflict drinking test and the elevated plus-maze <b>test</b> <b>in</b> rats as well as <b>in</b> the four-plate <b>test</b> <b>in</b> mice.

MPEP (1 [*]–[*] 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) did shorten the immobility time in a tail suspension <b>test</b> <b>in</b> mice, however it was inactive in the behavioural despair <b>test</b> <b>in</b> rats. These data suggest that selective mGlu 5 receptor antagonists {{may play a role in}} the therapy of anxiety and/or depression, further studies are required to identify the sites and the mechanism of action of MPEP...|$|R
