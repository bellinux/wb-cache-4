5|$|In 1951, after India {{became a}} republic, the Indian Standards Institute (now the BIS) {{brought out the}} first {{official}} specifications for the flag. These were revised in 1964 {{to conform to the}} metric system which was adopted in India. The specifications were further amended on 17 August 1968. The specifications cover all the essential requirements of the manufacture of the Indian flag including sizes, dye colour, chromatic values, brightness, <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> and hemp cordage. The guidelines are covered under civil and criminal laws and defects in the manufacturing process can result in punishments that include fines or jail terms.|$|E

5000|$|Metadata {{operations}} in XFS {{have historically been}} slower than with other file systems, resulting in, for example, poor performance with operations such as deletions {{of large numbers of}} files. However, a new XFS feature implemented by Dave Chinner and called delayed logging, available since version 2.6.39 of the Linux kernel mainline, is claimed to resolve this; performance benchmarks done by the developer in 2010 revealed performance levels to be similar to ext4 at low <b>thread</b> <b>counts,</b> and superior at high <b>thread</b> <b>counts.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} active threads in a {{multi-core}} processor varies {{over time and}} is often {{much smaller than the}} number of supported hardware threads. This requires multi-core chip designs to balance core count and per-core performance. Low active <b>thread</b> <b>counts</b> benefit from a few big, high-performance cores, while high active <b>thread</b> <b>counts</b> benefit more from a sea of small, energy-efficient cores. This paper comprehensively studies the trade-offs in multi-core design given dynamically varying active <b>thread</b> <b>counts.</b> We find that, under these workload conditions, a homogeneous multi-core processor, consisting of a few high-performance SMT cores, typically outperforms heterogeneous multi-cores consisting of a mix of big and small cores (without SMT), within the same power budget. We also show that a homogeneous multi-core performs almost as well as a heterogeneous multi-core that also implements SMT, as well as a dynamic multi-core, while being less complex to design and verify. Further, heterogeneous multi-cores that power-gate idle cores yield (only) slightly better energy-efficiency compared to homogeneous multi-cores. The overall conclusion is that the benefit of SMT in the multi-core era is to provide flexibility with respect to the available thread-level parallelism. Consequently, homogeneous multi-cores with big SMT cores are competitive high-performance, energy-efficient design points for workloads with dynamically varying active <b>thread</b> <b>counts...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>counting</b> {{algorithms}} seek {{to determine}} from x-ray images the {{vertical and horizontal}} <b>thread</b> <b>counts</b> (frequencies) of the canvas weave comprising a painting’s support. Our spectral-based algorithm employs a variant of short-time Fourier analysis to the image domain that reveals isolated peaks at the proper vertical and horizontal frequencies. Paintings made on canvas sections cut from the same canvas roll have been hypothesized to have similar, distinctive weave characteristics, allowing art historians to more accurately date paintings. Spatial variation of weave frequency measurements across a painting were cross-correlated using a new measure to determine possible common weave patterns between pairs of x-rays. By analyzing a database of x-rays made from 180 paintings by van Gogh, our algorithms confirmed situations where paintings were {{known to have been}} made on canvases cut from the same roll and found new ones.

25|$|The {{production}} of badges and emblems changed in 1956 to the rolled edge now in current use, thus eliminating the various colored backgrounds. The outside oval was then changed to red. With {{the introduction of}} the Improved Scouting Program in 1972 came an overhaul of many badges and emblems. The new stylized Eagle Scout badge with no text was a major change that proved to be unpopular. It appears that some Scouters commissioned reproductions of the 1956 badge for issue in place of the 1972 version. In 1975 the badge design partially reverted to the 1956 version. 1985 saw a reversion to the 1956 issue with some minor differences. The border and the eagle were done in silver metalized thread and the Be Prepared text was in blue. In 1986 the metalized eagle changed back to standard thread due to problems with wearing and the scroll and text were enlarged. The metalized border was changed to standard thread in 1989. Later variants increased the <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> of the white stripe to eliminate the visible background.|$|E

2500|$|Don't Get Too Comfortable, {{which is}} subtitled [...] "The Indignities of Coach Class, The Torments of Low <b>Thread</b> <b>Count,</b> The Never-Ending Quest for Artisanal Olive Oil, and Other First World Problems" [...] was {{published}} in 2005 and also consists of comical autobiographical essays. Some of the essays were originally published in shorter form elsewhere and some original. The over-riding theme of the articles is the absurdity and excessiveness in American life: the book is about luxuries and privileges being treated as deserved rights. Rakoff said that {{the moral of the}} book is that there should be [...] "a little more guilt out there" [...] and [...] "we could all, myself included, count our blessings, acknowledge our privileges." [...] The book was generally praised by critics. The New York Times said, [...] "Rarely have greed, vanity, selfishness, and vapidity been so mercilessly and wittily portrayed". Emily Gordon says that in his [...] "bursts of pure enthusiasm, he's a delectable Cole Porter, Nicholson Baker and Sarah Vowell smoothie". However, Rakoff was criticised in the Washington Post for misusing the word [...] "like", with the reviewer suggesting that Rakoff's prose could use tightening. In The New York Times, Jennifer 8. Lee said the book was [...] "no more than a collection of vaguely related magazine pieces" [...] rather than [...] "a coherent seriocomic manifesto", that some essays were off-theme, and not about narcissism and excess.|$|E
5000|$|Tartan is {{recorded}} by counting the threads of each colour {{that appear in}} the sett. The <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> not only describes {{the width of the}} stripes on a sett, but also the colours used. For example, the <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> [...] "K4 R24 K24 Y4" [...] corresponds to 4 black threads, 24 red threads, 24 black threads, 4 yellow threads. The first and last threads of the <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> are the pivot points. Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6 inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a necktie. In this case the <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> has to be reduced in proportion (about 3 inches).|$|E

5000|$|The {{quality of}} bed sheets is often {{conveyed}} by the thread count—the {{number of threads}} per square inch of material. In general, the higher the <b>thread</b> <b>count,</b> the softer the sheet, but the weave and type of thread may affect the [...] "hand" [...] of the material so that a sheet with a lower <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> may actually be softer than one with a higher count. Yarn quality also plays {{a part in the}} look and feel of sheets, as finer yarns tend to create a finer sheet fabric. The ply also plays a role in how heavy the sheet feels. Ply represents how many fibers are twisted together as the sheet is being created. A 2 ply 300 <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> sheet will feel heavier than a single ply 600 <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> sheet. [...] The most common constructions are muslin, percale, sateen, flannel, and knitted jersey. In a plain weave the warp and weft cross each other one at a time, and sateen, has multiple threads (usually three or four) over, and one under.|$|E

An extensive, experimental evaluation with both new and commonly used benchmarks is provided, on four different shared-memory systems with hardware supported <b>thread</b> <b>counts</b> ranging from 48 to 512, showing Stamp-it to be competitive with {{and in many cases}} and aspects outperforming other schemes...|$|R
50|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>count</b> or threads {{per inch}} (TPI) {{is a measure of}} the {{coarseness}} or fineness of fabric. It is measured by counting the number of threads contained in one square inch of fabric or one square centimeter, including both the length (warp) and width (weft) threads. The <b>thread</b> <b>count</b> is the number of threads counted along two sides (up and across) of the square inch, added together. It is used especially in regard to cotton linens such as bed sheets, and has been known to be used in the classification of towels.|$|E

40|$|Software {{transactional}} memory (STM) {{can lead}} to scalable implementations of concurrent programs, as the relative performance of an application increases {{with the number of}} threads that support it. However, the absolute performance is typically impaired by the overheads of transaction management and instrumented accesses to shared memory. This often leads STM-based programs with low <b>thread</b> <b>counts</b> to perform worse than a sequential, non-instrumented version of the same application. In this paper, we propose FASTLANE, a new STM system that bridges the performance gap between sequential execution and classical STM algorithms when running on few cores. FASTLANE seeks to reduce instrumentation costs and thus performance degradation in its target operation range.

X-ray images of a painting serve as the raw data. Canvas texture can be modeled as a sum of two sinusoids having nearly orthogonal spatial frequencies. The actual painting serves as an additive signal that only distracts from the thread-counting process. The algorithm employs a variant of short-time Fourier analysis to the image domain. In simple cases, two-dimensional Fourier transforms of small areas reveal isolated peaks at the proper vertical and horizontal frequencies. In more challenging cases, even within the same painting, additional peaks appear in the expected frequency range, requiring heuristics to extract from the spectral measurements representative thread-count estimates for a painting...|$|R
40|$|A {{large body}} of data-flow {{analyses}} exists for analyzing and optimizing sequential code. Unfortunately, much of it cannot be directly applied on parallel code, for reasons of correctness. This paper presents a technique to automatically, aggressively, yet safely apply sequentially-sound data-flow transformations, without change, on shared-memory programs. The technique is founded {{on the notion of}} program references being “siloed ” on certain control-flow paths. Intuitively, siloed references are free of interference from other threads within the confines of such paths. Data-flow transformations can, in general, be unblocked on siloed references. The solution has been implemented in a widely used compiler.
