5|$|Aurobindo was {{influenced}} by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities he favoured non-co-operation and passive resistance; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> revolt failed.|$|E
5|$|Modern English syntax {{language}} is moderately analytic. It has developed {{features such as}} modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> voice and progressive aspect.|$|E
5|$|Passive constructions {{also use}} {{auxiliary}} verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction {{in such a}} way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence she sees him into <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> becomes he is seen (by her), or he gets seen (by her).|$|E
25|$|In Japanese, for example, <b>the</b> adversative <b>passive</b> (also called {{indirect}} passive) indicates adversative affect. The indirect or adversative <b>passive</b> has <b>the</b> same form as <b>the</b> direct <b>passive.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> direct <b>passive,</b> <b>the</b> indirect <b>passive</b> may be {{used with}} intransitive verbs.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> perfect <b>passive</b> infinitive uses <b>the</b> perfect <b>passive</b> participle {{along with}} the {{auxiliary}} verb esse. <b>The</b> perfect <b>passive</b> infinitive must agree with what it is describing in number and gender.|$|R
50|$|Finnish has two {{possible}} verb voices: active and <b>passive.</b> <b>The</b> active voice corresponds with the active voice of English, but <b>the</b> Finnish <b>passive</b> voice has some important differences from <b>the</b> English <b>passive</b> voice.|$|R
5|$|There are, in addition, {{matrices}} {{that effect}} Lorentz boosts. These {{can be thought}} of, in <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> view, as (instantly!) giving the coordinate system (and with it the observer) a velocity in a chosen direction.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{were blocked}} with {{entanglements}} of barbed wire, {{usually in the}} form of three coils of concertina wire fixed by metal posts, or a simple fence of straight wires supported on waist-high posts. The wire would also demarcate extensive minefields, with both anti-tank and anti-personnel mines on and behind the beaches. On many of the more remote beaches this combination of wire and mines represented the full extent of <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> defences.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{so-called}} New <b>Passive</b> in Icelandic {{takes the}} form 'it was elected us' (or, e. g., 'then was elected us', without an expletive), instead of <b>the</b> standard <b>passive</b> form 'we were elected'. It has neither A-movement to subject nor acc-to-nom conversion, which are otherwise diagnostic of <b>the</b> canonical <b>passive</b> in Icelandic and related languages. Some researchers have argued that "passive" {{is in fact a}} misnomer and that the construction should instead be analyzed as an active one, with a nominative pro. This paper argues instead in favor of a minimalist analysis, where <b>the</b> New <b>Passive</b> is closely related to <b>the</b> impersonal P <b>passive</b> (with a PP, type 'then was shouted at us'), which is highly common and productive in Icelandic. On the approach pursued, acc-to-nom conversion involves case-star deletion, absent from <b>the</b> New <b>Passive</b> (much as from so-called psych and fate (un) accusatives in standard Icelandic). Additionally, <b>the</b> New <b>Passive</b> has a strong vP phase edge, blocking A-movement, in contrast to the defective vP edge in <b>the</b> canonical <b>passive.</b> <b>The</b> paper argues that A-grounding or "freezing" is brought about by phi-minimality, A-islands thus arising in a parallel fashion with A'-islands...|$|R

50|$|The X {{series is}} an active product {{designed}} to bridge <b>the</b> gulf between <b>passive</b> and active tonalities.

5|$|In {{the sources}} {{considered}} so far, Troilus' only narrative function is his death. The {{treatment of the}} character changes in two ways {{in the literature of}} the medieval and renaissance periods. First, he becomes an important and active protagonist in the pursuit of the Trojan War itself. Second, he becomes an active heterosexual lover, rather than <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> victim of Achilles' pederasty. By the time of John Dryden's neo-classical adaptation of Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida it is the ultimate failure of his love affair that defines the character.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{efforts by}} Magnus to besiege Swedish-controlled Reval were faltering, {{with support from}} neither Ivan nor Magnus' brother, Frederick II of Denmark forthcoming. Ivan's {{attention}} was focused elsewhere, while Frederick's reluctance perhaps stemmed from a new spirit of Swedish–Danish unity that made him unwilling to invade Livonia on behalf of Magnus, whose state was a vassal of Russia. The siege was abandoned in March 1561, whereupon Swedish action in the Baltic escalated, with <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> backing of Sigismund, John's brother-in-law.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinal Laws, a quasi-constitution {{endorsing}} most of {{the conservative}} laws responsible for the inefficient functioning of the Commonwealth, were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. The Sejm also continued enacting laws reducing religious tolerance in the Commonwealth. <b>The</b> <b>passive</b> electoral rights of the Orthodox and Protestants were diminished, with a restriction {{limiting the number of}} non-Roman Catholic Sejm deputies to three (one from Greater Poland, one from Lesser Poland, and one from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania). They were also banned from election to the Senate or ministerial positions.|$|E

25|$|The problem arises with non-European {{languages}}. Many constructions {{in these}} languages share {{at least one}} property with <b>the</b> canonical European <b>passive,</b> but not all. While it seems justified to call these constructions passive when comparing them to European languages' passive constructions, as a whole <b>the</b> <b>passives</b> of <b>the</b> world's languages do not share a single common feature.|$|R
5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants {{in the case of}} war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{can only}} be used with older analog-only devices (using {{connections}} such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) {{by means of a}} digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, {{but it is important to}} distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). <b>The</b> <b>passive</b> cables are only useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{group of}} {{materials}} scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data {{on the characteristics of}} plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.|$|E
40|$|Non-finite verb {{forms are}} ideal as {{indicators}} of a translator 2 ̆ 7 s ability and style of translating Latin into OE. (1) This is because in Latin there are six different infinitives: the present active infinitive, <b>the</b> present <b>passive</b> infinitive, <b>the</b> perfect active infinitive, <b>the</b> perfect <b>passive</b> infinitive, <b>the</b> future active infinitive, and <b>the</b> future <b>passive</b> infinitive. However, in OE {{there is only one}} infinitive: the present active infinitive. In Latin there are four different participles: the present active imperfect participle, <b>the</b> present <b>passive</b> perfective participle, <b>the</b> future active imperfective participle, and <b>the</b> future <b>passive</b> imperfective participle (gerundive). The gerund is the neuter singular nominal of the gerundive. However, in OE there are only two participles: the present active participle and <b>the</b> past <b>passive</b> participle. <b>The</b> translator had little problem in translating the equivalent forms, but when confronted with those infinitives and participles for which there are no equivalents in OE, the translator was forced to innovate. These innovations are personal stylystic traits and {{can be used as a}} base of comparison with other Alfredian Translations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} two passives in Kaqchikel, a Mayan {{language spoken}} in Guatemala. <b>The</b> first <b>passive,</b> which we label the &# 8216;standard passive&# 8217; is already well-attested in the literature. However, <b>the</b> second <b>passive,</b> which we label the &# 8216;ki-passive&# 8217;, {{has not been}} previously described. A verb in the ki-passive shows active morphology, with ergative agreement for a third person plural subject, as would be appropriate for a verb with an impersonal &# 8216;they&# 8217; subject. In Kaqchikel, however, we argue that this verb form {{has evolved into a}} new <b>passive.</b> <b>The</b> paper compares the properties of <b>the</b> standard <b>passive</b> and <b>the</b> ki-passive, and argues that while they involve the same change of grammatical relations, <b>the</b> two <b>passives</b> differ in <b>the</b> discourse functions they assign to the agent and patient...|$|R
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers {{have criticized the}} book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe {{was trying to say}} with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E
5|$|President Antanas Smetona's {{unconditional}} {{acceptance of a}} second ultimatum {{in the space of}} a little over one year became a major source of dissatisfaction with his authoritarian rule. The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis: <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> cabinet of Vladas Mironas was replaced by a cabinet headed by General Jonas Černius. For the first time since the 1926 coup d'état, the government included members of the opposition: Leonas Bistras, of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, was named Minister of Education and Jurgis Krikščiūnas, of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union, was named Minister of Agriculture. Because other parties were banned, Bistras and Krikščiūnas were officially billed as independent private citizens. Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well. However, even the looming international crisis did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite, and they continued to engage in petty political disputes.|$|E

5|$|The Committee {{also played}} an {{important}} political role. By providing an alternative supply of food, the CNSA prevented the German administration of Belgium {{from being able to}} use food as a bargaining tool to force Belgians to work in war industries and contributed to <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> resistance movement within occupied Belgium. However, the CNSA and CRB's activities meant that the Germans benefitted from having seven million Belgians and two million Frenchmen in their territory fed and consequently did not face major food riots or other disruption that might have arisen if the Germans had had to feed the population of the occupied territories. The Germans also exploited their deal agreeing to give impunity to CNSA food shipments by seizing food produced in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The early Baroque period {{produced}} {{a number of}} noted poets. Sebastian Grabowiecki wrote metaphysical and mystical religious poetry representing <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> current of Quietism. Another szlachta poet Samuel Twardowski participated in military and other historic events; among the genres he pursued was epic poetry. Urban poetry was quite vital {{until the middle of}} the 17th century; the plebeian poets criticized the existing social order and continued within the ambiance of elements of the Renaissance style. The creations of John of Kijany contained a hearty dose of social radicalism. The moralist Sebastian Klonowic wrote a symbolic poem Flis using the setting of Vistula river craft floating work. Szymon Szymonowic in his Pastorals portrayed, without embellishments, the hardships of serf life. Maciej Sarbiewski, a Jesuit, was highly appreciated throughout Europe for the Latin poetry he wrote.|$|E
5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced {{by women and}} minorities in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned <b>the</b> <b>passive</b> portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable reproductive health care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E
