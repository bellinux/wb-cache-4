The new model featured a rounded exterior body shell, improved dynamics and many firsts for an Australian-built car. Also, a stronger body structure increased crash safety. The locally produced Buick-sourced V6 engine powered the Commodore range, as did the 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, and was replaced in 1999 by the 5.7-litre LS unit.|$|E
5|$|The final {{classification}} {{was a team}} classification.

In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem from the loss of unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a {{basis for}} his theory of game strategies, which is {{considered}} as one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem states {{that it is possible to}} solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> perfectly played game (either white can force a win, or black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw). However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.|$|E
5|$|Obayashi {{already had}} {{experience}} with special effects {{from his work}} on television commercials. Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw the special effects for the film. Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate on camera. <b>The</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lot of these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E

The longest Mexican National Heayweight Championship reign belongs to El Médico Asesino with a total of 1,378 days. El Halcón was champion for the shortest time, 24 days, but also holds the record for most reigns with five in total. Cien Caras's two combiend reigns lasted 1,483 days, more than any other champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominance}} of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop was supplanted in the late-2000s, {{largely due to}} the mainstream success of hip-hop artists such as Kanye West. <b>The</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> highly publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper 50 Cent's third studio albums, Graduation and Curtis respectively, has since been accredited to the decline. The competition resulted in record-breaking sales performances by both albums and West outsold 50 Cent, selling nearly a million copies of Graduation in the first week alone. Industry observers remark that West's victory over 50 Cent proved that rap music did not have to conform to gangsta-rap conventions in order to be commercially successful. West effectively paved the way for a new wave of hip-hop artists, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold and became platinum-selling artists.|$|E

British Columbia has 50 cities. Greenwood incorporated as a city in 1897 prior to the current legislation and retains this status despite its population of 708 being less than the current 5,000 threshold. Six other cities also have populations less than 5,000yet retain their status.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. <b>The</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ritualised contest between the two sides of a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E

5|$|Celeste gives Natasha the waitressing job at Charlie's and {{she moves}} in with Summer and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), after her house is sold. Natasha also decides {{to drop out}} of her {{university}} course, upon realising that it is not right for her. Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she solves the problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with conditional probability, which they use to predict <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of guys at Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple of police officers walks in. Natasha convinces Ed to hold a game at the Men's Shed, so they can continue to test the theory and make some money. Andrew comes up with an idea to use the theory to make an odds calculator mobile app. When Natasha goes to asks Ed about the idea, he introduces her to the hobby of LARPing, before agreeing to sign Andrew's contract.|$|E
5|$|Henry Chadwick is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also {{the inventor of the}} modern box score and the writer of the first rule book for the game of baseball. Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the early days of}} the sport was performed by newspaper writers. A judgment call that is required by the official scorer does not alter <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value of baseball players, MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.|$|E

In 2004, he was listed as having worked a number of matches for the Naucalpan, State of Mexico based International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) but did not tour {{extensively}} outside Nuevo León. In 2007, Rey Hechicero became involved in a storyline feud against another local Monterrey wrestler called Gitano del Norte ("The Gypsy of the North"), a storyline that led to both men putting their masks on the line on <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Lucha de Apuestas ("Bet match"). Rey Hechicero won and forced his opponent to unmask, which in Lucha Libre is considered more prestigious than winning championships. He capped 2007 by defeating Tigre Universitario to win the WWA World Middleweight Championship Defeating Tigre Universitario for the championship {{was part of a}} long running storyline between the two, a storyline that would see both of them involved in a four-man Lucha de Apuesta on March 23, 2008. Both Rey Hechicero and Tigre Universitario escaped from the match with their masks while Valiente pinned Sergio Romo, Jr. to force Romo to be shaved bald after the match since he was not masked.|$|E
