25|$|The Far North is {{the area}} between the {{northern}} boundary {{of the country and}} the parallel 26Â° S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the Atacama desert, the most arid in the world. <b>The</b> <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the pampas Tamarugal. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs Bolivia, has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the Salar de Atacama, due to the gradual accumulation of sediments over time.|$|E

25|$|Formed {{approximately}} 8000 years ago, the Chihuahuan Desert is {{a relatively}} dry desert, although it is slightly wetter than the Sonoran Desert to the west. The Chihuahuan Desert spreads across the southeastern portion of the region, covering from southeastern Arizona, across southern New Mexico, and the portion of Texas included in the Southwest. While {{it is the second}} largest desert in the United States, only a third of <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> within the United States, with the rest in Mexico. El Paso is the major city in this desert, with other smaller cities being Las Cruces and Roswell in New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} local surface low {{pressure}} are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block {{any form of}} air ascent. Also, to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself, <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> made even drier by his geographical configuration and location. Indeed, the extreme aridity of the Sahara can not be only explained by the subtropical high pressure. The Atlas Mountains, found in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of {{the northern part of}} the desert. These major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates.|$|E
25|$|Great Desert: It {{lies between}} Calormen and the {{northern}} countries of Archenland and Narnia. Located immediately {{to the north of}} the Carlomen capital Tashbaan, the desert can be crossed on horseback in about a night and a day of hard riding. The desert provides some protection from Calormen invasion since the springs at the great oasis would not be sufficient to enable an army of any size to cross it. This oasis is halfway across the desert; however a secret and well watered valley leads into Archenland. <b>The</b> <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> described as an ocean of sand by Narnians. It can be bypassed by sea as the Calormenes do in The Last Battle. The Hermit of the Southern March lives north of it. Beyond it is Anvard and Narnia.(HHB)(LB).|$|E

25|$|Forestry has an {{important}} part {{to play in the}} amelioration of the conditions in semi-arid and arid lands. If properly planned, forestry can make {{an important}} contribution to the general welfare of the people living in desert areas. The living standard of the people in <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> low. They can not afford other fuels like gas, kerosene etc. Fire wood is their main fuel, of the total consumption of wood about 75 percent is firewood. The forest cover in desert is low. Rajasthan has a forest area of 31150km2. which is about 9% of the geographical area. The forest area is mainly in southern districts of Rajasthan like Udaipur and Chittorgarh. The minimum forest area is in Churu district only 80km2. Thus the forest is insufficient to fulfill the needs of firewood and grazing in desert districts. This diverts the much needed cattledung from the field to the hearth. This in turn results into the decrease in agricultural production. Agroforestry model is best suited to the people of desert. Some Institutes have done good work in Agroforestry.|$|E
500|$|... "Race Against Time" [...] was {{released}} on the 12-inch, cassette, and CD versions of the single. [...] The song developed from the band's interest in urban funk, and was described by The Edge as [...] "a kind of Afro-rhythmic piece" [...] and [...] "a study in rhythm." [...] The bass riff in the song, inspired by the bodhrÃ¡n, was played by The Edge, but stemmed from some of Clayton's unused bass parts. Mullen's drum part was recorded in a single take. The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase [...] "Race against time". Bono said of the song, [...] "It {{reminds me of the}} desert. <b>The</b> <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> so empty, but it aches with a strange kind of fullness." [...] John Hutchinson of Musician magazine described the song as having an [...] "African flavour" [...] and as being reminiscent of Peter Gabriel.

500|$|Bono is {{credited}} as the album's sole lyricist. Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States against the band's deep {{fascination with the}} country, its open spaces, freedoms, and ideals. Anger is directed particularly at the perceived greed of the Ronald Reagan administration and its foreign policy in Central America. Bono said, [...] "I started to see two Americas, the mythic America and the real America", hence the album's working title, The Two Americas. Having toured the US extensively in the past, the group were inspired by the country's geography. As such, the desert, rain, dust, and water appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record. In many cases, <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> <b>is</b> used {{as a metaphor for}} [...] "spiritual drought". One track that chiefly represents these themes is [...] "In God's Country", which critic Barbara Jaeger interpreted as addressing America's role as the [...] "promised land". Clayton explained the impact of the desert imagery: [...] "The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record. Most people would take the desert on face value and think it's some kind of barren place, which of course is true. But in the right frame of mind, it's also a very positive image, because you can actually do something with blank canvas, which is effectively what the desert is." ...|$|E
