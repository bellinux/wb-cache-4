5|$|The AH-64A is the {{original}} production attack helicopter. The crew sit in tandem in an armored compartment. It is powered by two GE T700 <b>turboshaft</b> engines. The A-model was equipped with the −701 engine version until 1990 when the engines were switched to the more powerful −701C version.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Boeing {{conceptualized}} an Apache upgrade {{prior to}} the introduction of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft, forecast to replace the Apache by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp <b>turboshaft</b> engine from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings to offload lift from the main rotor during cruise, and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust. In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another Apache upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying the Apache through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 <b>turboshaft</b> engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E

5|$|Lockheed {{worked on}} modifying the AH-56 design {{to address the}} {{vibration}} and other issues. As a precaution, Cheyenne #9 (s/n 66-8834) was fitted with an ejection seat for the pilot after the March accident. The downward firing ejection seat {{was placed in the}} forward seat in place of the gunner's station. This prototype would be used for all remaining envelope expansion flights. Prototype #9 also received an upgraded transmission and drivetrain, and a hinged rear canopy in place of the original sliding canopy around 1970. The new transmission allowed the T64-GE-16 <b>turboshaft</b> engine output to be increased from a derated 3,435horsepower (2,561kW) to 3,925horsepower (2,927kW). The new canopy eliminated the canopy vibrations.|$|E

25|$|Bell {{announced}} the KingCobra program in January 1971. Two prototypes were built, {{one with a}} P T400-CP-400 Twin Pac dual <b>turboshaft</b> engine system much like that used on the AH-1J, but with a stronger drivetrain allowing full 1,800 shp (1,340kW) operation, {{and the other with}} a single Lycoming T55-L-7C <b>turboshaft</b> engine with 2,000 shp (1,490kW).|$|E
