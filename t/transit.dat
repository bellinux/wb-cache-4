5|$|The Omaha Traction Company, which {{operated}} as the Street Railway Company, {{changed its}} name to the Omaha <b>Transit</b> Company when streetcar service ended in the city in 1952. After World War II Omahans preferred their automobiles and new highways. When the Urban Mass <b>Transit</b> Act of 1964 was passed, Omaha's private <b>transit</b> companies were not able to apply for federal subsidies available to public <b>transit</b> operators. The Omaha <b>Transit</b> Company ceased operations on June 30, 1972, when the City of Omaha assumed authority for public transportation in the city. City <b>Transit</b> Lines, another private company in Omaha, went out of business on that day as well. The Metro Area <b>Transit</b> Authority was created by the Nebraska Legislature, consisting of a five-member board appointed by the mayor and confirmed by Omaha's City Council and the Douglas County Commissioners. It acquired the assets of the Omaha <b>Transit</b> Company and selected assets of the City <b>Transit</b> Lines of Council Bluffs, along with more than $3,000,000 in federal funding. The Authority operates today as Metro Area <b>Transit,</b> or MAT.|$|E

50|$|The Roman-Egyptian {{astronomer}} Ptolemy {{wrote about}} the possibility of planetary <b>transits</b> across the face of the Sun in his work Planetary Hypotheses.

5|$|Thus after 243 {{years the}} transits of Venus return. The 1874 <b>transit</b> {{is a member}} of the 243-year cycle #1. The 1882 <b>transit</b> {{is a member of}} #2. The 2004 <b>transit</b> is a member of #3 and the 2012 <b>transit</b> is a member of #4. The 2117 <b>transit</b> is a member of #1 and so on. However, the {{ascending}} node (December transits) of the orbit of Venus moves backwards after each 243 years so the <b>transit</b> of 2854 is the last member of series #3 instead of series #1. The descending node (June transits) moves forwards, so the <b>transit</b> of 3705 is the last member of #2.|$|E
5|$|A solar <b>transit</b> of Venus is an {{extremely}} rare event, and the last solar <b>transit</b> of the planet before 2004 was in 1882. The most recent solar <b>transit</b> was in 2012; the next one will not occur until 2117.|$|E
5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 <b>transit</b> of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event.

Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus <b>transit</b> in 1639 and, as the next full <b>transit</b> was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E

In 2008, RTA completed the HealthLine, a bus rapid <b>transit</b> line, for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along Euclid Avenue from downtown through University Circle, ending at the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland.

CT is publicly funded, financed through sales taxes, farebox revenue and subsidies, with an operating budget of $133.2 million.

Sound <b>Transit</b> was established in 1996 as a regional <b>transit</b> authority, and selected the State Route 99 corridor as a route for its express bus system, but later replaced it, before service began, with an express route on Interstate 5 from Everett to Northgate, while leaving SR 99 to Community <b>Transit.</b> Sound <b>Transit</b> funded the construction of business access and <b>transit</b> lanes on State Route 99 through Lynnwood from 244th Street to 148th Street in 2002, converting former parking lanes, and widening the highway in some areas, improving existing bus service, and laying the ground for a future bus rapid <b>transit</b> line.|$|E
