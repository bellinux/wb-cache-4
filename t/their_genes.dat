5|$|Essential {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of <b>their</b> <b>genes.</b> Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of <b>their</b> <b>genes).</b> Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of <b>their</b> <b>genes).</b> The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E
5|$|Organisms inherit <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> {{from their}} parents. Asexual organisms simply inherit a {{complete}} copy of their parent's genome. Sexual organisms have {{two copies of}} each chromosome because they inherit one complete set from each parent.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} is {{a collection}} of techniques used to analyse biological markers in the genome and proteomethe individual's genetic code and how their cells express <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> as proteinsby applying molecular biology to medical testing. The technique is used to diagnose and monitor disease, detect risk, and decide which therapies will work best for individual patients.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{confirmed}} that the body′s response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) is not only associated with virus, but also associated with some cytokines and <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> polymorphisms. In this paper, the current research on some cytokines associated with HCV and <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> polymorphisms is reviewed. And it is shown that interleukin- 28 B is {{closely associated with the}} course and prognosis of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Therefore, it is of great significance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of CHC to investigate host cytokines and <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> polymorphisms...|$|R

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of living organisms encode <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> in long strands of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits, each composed of: a five-carbon sugar (2'-deoxyribose), a phosphate group, {{and one of the}} four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.|$|E
5|$|However, some eusocial {{species such}} as {{termites}} are not haplodiploid. Conversely, all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters that share only 25% of <b>their</b> <b>genes.</b> Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality. But, monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated, so {{it is likely that}} haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees.|$|E
5|$|In a 1989 {{review of}} the {{research}} on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then-prevalent idea of antisocial behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E
5000|$|Viruses, {{despite having}} {{only a few}} genes, possess {{mechanisms}} to regulate <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> expression, typically into an early and late phase, using collinear systems regulated by anti-terminators (lambda phage) or splicing modulators (HIV).|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms often {{regulate}} <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> expression at {{the level}} of transcription and/or translation in response to solar radiation. In this review, we present the use of both transcriptomics and proteomics to advance knowledge in the field of bacterial response to damaging radiation. Those studies pertain to diverse application areas such as fundamental microbiology, water treatment, microbial ecology and astrobiology. Even though it has been demonstrated that mRNA abundance is not always consistent with the protein regulation, we present here an exhaustive review on how bacteria regulate <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> expression at both transcription and translation levels to enable biomarkers identification and comparison of gene regulation from one bacterial species to another...|$|R
25|$|The three human ras genes encode {{extremely}} similar proteins {{made up of}} {{chains of}} 188 to 189 amino acids, <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> symbols are HRAS, NRAS and KRAS, which produces the K-Ras4A and K-Ras4B isoforms from alternative splicing).|$|R
5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought to be relatively common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, presumably because all <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> have been lost or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the mitochondria have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and atovaquone.|$|E
5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The study was not designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> already put them at risk.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{the numbers}} of rats and mice used is {{estimated}} to be from 11 million to between 20 and 100 million a year. Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs, hamsters, and gerbils. Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share 99% of <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> with humans. With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases. Rats are also widely used for physiology, toxicology and cancer research, but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice, which limits the use of these rodents in basic science. Over 500,000 fish and 10,000 amphibians were used in the UK in 2016. The main species used is the zebrafish, Danio rerio, which are translucent during their embryonic stage, and the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Over 20,000 rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in 2004. Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests (Draize test) because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize. The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades, in 1996, there were 3,693 procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK, in 2016 this number was just 128. Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of carboxysomes. Although they may seem similar in appearance, they differ in their protein composition, {{including}} the form of RuBisCO they enclose.

50|$|Bottlenecks {{also exist}} among {{pure-bred}} animals (e.g., dogs and cats: pugs, Persian) because breeders limit <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> pools {{by a few}} (show-winning) individuals for their looks and behaviors.

25|$|Genes are {{pieces of}} DNA that contain {{information}} for synthesis of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) or polypeptides. Genes are inherited as units, with two parents dividing out copies of <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> to their offspring. This {{process can be}} compared with mixing two hands of cards, shuffling them, and then dealing them out again. Humans have two copies of each of <b>their</b> <b>genes,</b> and make copies that are found in eggs or sperm—but they only include one copy of each type of gene. An egg and sperm join to form {{a complete set of}} genes. The eventually resulting offspring has the same number of genes as their parents, but for any gene one of their two copies comes from their father, and one from their mother.|$|E
25|$|Many {{mechanisms}} prevent biparental chloroplast DNA inheritance, including selective {{destruction of}} chloroplasts or <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> within the gamete or zygote, and chloroplasts from one parent being {{excluded from the}} embryo. Parental chloroplasts can be sorted so that only one type is present in each offspring.|$|E
25|$|Since some {{viruses that}} infect eukaryotes need to {{transport}} their genetic material into the host cell's nucleus, they are attractive tools for introducing new genes into the host (known as transformation or transfection). Modified retroviruses {{are often used}} for this purpose, as they integrate <b>their</b> <b>genes</b> into the host's chromosomes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFour {{putative}} yeast transcription factors (Hal 6 – 9 p) {{have been}} identified which upon overexpression in multicopy plasmids increase sodium and lithium tolerance. This effect is mediated, at least in part, by increased expression of the Ena 1 p Na+/Li+ extrusion pump. Hal 6 p and Hal 7 p are bZIP proteins and <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> disruptions affected neither salt tolerance nor ENA 1 expression. Hal 8 p and Hal 9 p are putative zinc fingers and <b>their</b> <b>gene</b> disruptions decreased both salt tolerance and ENA 1 expression. Therefore, Hal 8 p and Hal 9 p, but not Hal 6 p and Hal 7 p, qualify as transcriptional activators of ENA 1 under physiological conditions. Hal 8 p seems to mediate the calcineurin-dependent part of ENA 1 expression...|$|R
