5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

The inner panels contain {{scenes from the}} Last Judgement arranged across two registers. The large central panel that spans both registers shows Christ seated on a rainbow in judgment, with his feet resting on a golden globe. Below him the Archangel Michael holds scales as he weighs souls. The panel on Christ's far right shows the gates of Heaven, <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> far left the entrance to Hell. The panels of the lower register form a continuous landscape, with figures depicted moving from the central panel to their final destinations after receiving judgement.|$|E
5|$|These {{conflicts}} are {{demonstrated by the}} varying loyalties of the main characters. Genly Ai tells Argaven after Estraven's death that Estraven served mankind as a whole, just as Ai did. During the border dispute with Orgoreyn, Estraven tries to end the dispute by moving Karhidish farmers out of the disputed territory. Estraven believes that by preventing war he was saving Karhidish lives and being loyal to his country, while King Argaven {{sees it as a}} betrayal. At {{the end of the novel}} Ai calls his ship down to formalize Gethen's joining the Ekumen, and feels conflicted while doing so because he had promised Estraven that he would clear Estraven's name before calling his ship down. His decision is an example of Le Guin's portrayal of loyalty and betrayal as complementary rather than contradictory, because in joining Gethen with the Ekumen Ai was fulfilling the larger purpose that he shared with Estraven. Donna White wrote that many of Le Guin's novels depict a struggle between personal loyalties and public duties, best exemplified in The Left Hand of Darkness, where Ai is bound by a personal bond to Estraven, but must subordinate <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mission for the Ekumen and humanity.|$|E

5|$|Waters {{followed}} Roman Candles {{with a third}} short film, Eat Your Makeup (1968), {{in which}} Divine once more wore drag, this time to portray a fictionalized version of Jackie Kennedy, the widow of recently assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy. In the film, she turns to kidnapping models and forcing them to eat their own makeup. Divine kept his involvement with Waters and these early underground films a secret from his conservative parents, believing {{that they would not}} understand them or the reason for his involvement in such controversial and bad-taste films; they would not find out about them for many years. Divine's parents had bought him his own beauty shop in Towson, hoping that the financial responsibility would help him to settle down in life and stop spending so extravagantly. While agreeing to work there, he refused to be involved in owning and managing the establishment, leaving <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother. Not long after, in the summer of 1968, he moved out of his parental home, renting his own apartment.|$|E

25|$|Although the Armenians {{were known}} to history much earlier (for example, they were {{mentioned}} in the 6th century BC Behistun Inscription and in Xenophon's 4th century BC history, The Anabasis), the oldest surviving Armenian-language text is the 5th century AD Bible translation of Mesrop Mashtots, who created the Armenian alphabet in 405 AD, at which time it had 36 letters. He is also credited by some {{with the creation of}} the Caucasian Albanian alphabet. In The Anabasis, Xenophon describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC. He relates that the Armenian people spoke a language <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ear sounded like the language of the Persians.|$|E

Other significant regulatory legislation enacted during Nixon's presidency included the: Noise Control Act (1972); Marine Mammal Protection Act (1972); Consumer Product Safety Act (1972); and the Endangered Species Act (1973).|$|E

500|$|Irving {{is largely}} {{credited}} {{as the first}} American Man of Letters, {{and the first to}} earn his living solely by his pen. Eulogizing Irving before the Massachusetts Historical Society in December 1859, his friend, the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, acknowledged Irving's role in promoting American literature: [...] "We feel a just pride in his renown as an author, not forgetting <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> other claims upon our gratitude, he adds also that of having been the first to win for our country an honourable name and position in the History of Letters".|$|E
500|$|In {{subsequent}} years, xx proved highly influential as many indie {{bands and}} mainstream pop acts incorporated the record's distinctive musical characteristics {{into their own}} songs. Petridis later wrote <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> surprise much of 2016's best-selling singles [...] "sounded oddly but irrefutably" [...] like the album: [...] "You can hear its muted, echoing guitars on everything from the Chainsmokers' 'Don't Let Me Down' to Shawn Mendes' 'Stitches' to Zara Larsson's 'Lush Life'." [...] Ryan Tedder, who wrote hit songs for such top-selling singers as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Ariana Grande, said the xx's [...] "hauntingness" [...] on the record [...] "gets referenced in at least every other [...] session". By January 2017, xx had reached 562,400 copies sold in the UK.|$|E
500|$|Bartlett, {{celebrated as}} a hero by press and public, was honoured for [...] "outstanding bravery" [...] by the Royal Geographical Society. However, he was later censured by an {{admiralty}} commission for taking Karluk into the ice, and for allowing Mackay's party to leave the main group—despite the letter that Mackay and the others had signed, absolving the captain from responsibility. Stefansson, too, was privately critical of Bartlett's conduct. Bartlett resumed his career at sea, {{and over the next}} 30 years led many more excursions to the Arctic. During the Second World War he carried out surveying and supply work for the Allies; he died, aged 70, in April 1946. His account of the Karluk disaster, published in 1916, makes no direct criticism of Stefansson or anyone else; Niven records, however, <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friends Bartlett was highly uncomplimentary about his former leader.|$|E

500|$|Scholars {{argue that}} Muhammad {{had already decided}} upon this {{judgment}} before the Qurayza's surrender, and that Sa'ad was putting his allegiance to the Muslim community above <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> tribe. One reason cited by some for such punishment is that Muhammad's previous clemency towards defeated foes was in contradiction to Arab and Jewish laws of the time, and {{was seen as a}} sign of weakness. [...] Others see the punishment as a response to what was perceived as an act of treason by the Qurayza since they betrayed their joint defence pact with Muhammad by giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the Muslims. Maxime Rodinson interprets the massacre as an astute political move that overrode all feelings of humanity, in order to remove a constant source of threat to Medina, and dishearten his enemies.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. It {{was named the}} fifth best episode of the show by MSNBC. They praised how the episode utilized Burns's physical weaknesses for laughs, and Homer's line; [...] "I guess some people never change. Or, they quickly change and then quickly change back." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> surprise, [...] "the dress code plot works the best". He liked the mockery of Mad magazine and the [...] "overemphasis on the way it disrupts the educational process". Jacobson thought the bowling plot had plenty of [...] "nice moments" [...] too, and [...] "these {{add up to a}} solid show". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered {{the best part of the}} episode to be when Homer ends a phone conversation with the [...] "highly quotable" [...] line, [...] "I gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening." [...] Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A. Mirkin described the episode as [...] "excellent", and praised Scully's [...] "great" [...] script.|$|E
500|$|... "Loverboy"'s hook {{is built}} around a sample of [...] "Candy", by Cameo. Aside from {{borrowing}} from the melody, [...] "Loverboy" [...] features Cameo as a lead vocalist on the track. According to Chuck Taylor from Billboard, [...] "Loverboy" [...] is reminiscent of several of Carey's previous lead singles, as they too were predominantly built around samples of older songs. He described some of its background flourishes as [...] "swirling harmonies overtop", and noted the inclusion of many shouts and ad-libs from Carey and Cameo. Due to the song's heavy usage of the [...] "Candy" [...] sample, and the heavy blend of instrumentation and vocals, he said <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> bewilderment, the song was [...] "devoid of a standard hook". NMEs Elios Therepio felt the idea of sampling [...] "Candy" [...] was genius [...] "on paper", but once recorded, suffered from various miscalculations. He felt it didn't match the success Carey's previous single, [...] "Fantasy" [...] (which also recalled its melody from an older song), and criticized the inclusion of several over-the-top [...] "keyboard and synth arrangements". Regarding Carey's voice, aside from describing it as [...] "obscured", Therepio expressed his difficulty in understanding her lyrical phrases, claiming it was weakened from [...] "no-everyone-can-understand-what-you're-saying'-itis". Gil Kaufman from MTV News noted the inclusion of [...] "bouncing funky bass [...] rock guitars", while Roger Caitlin of the Hartford Courant described how Carey was often reduced to [...] "breathy background vocals" [...] on [...] "Loverboy". Lyrically, the song finds Carey looking for her [...] "loverboy", and a sugar-daddy that's going to [...] "love her right". Therepio found it ironic how Carey was crooning for a sugar-daddy, when she had just left one (referring to her older ex-husband Tommy Mottola). Additionally, he felt Carey was molding her image {{from that of a}} balladeer, to a [...] "pin-up image" [...] of a pop star. The song's lyrics are racy, and feature the protagonist asking for her [...] "loverboy" [...] to fulfill her sexual desires: [...] "Loverboy come on and love me / Give me more".|$|E
