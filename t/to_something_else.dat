25|$|Avicenna's {{consideration}} of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated {{in terms of his}} ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} {{character}} and plot changes, it was also decided to change the game's working title, No One Lives Forever, <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> for similar reasons related to the Bond franchise (in particular, the novel Nobody Lives for Ever), as well as possible legal considerations. However, the title, in fact, stayed throughout the development, and [...] "The Operative" [...] (referring to the game's heroine, Agent Archer) {{was added to the}} beginning of the title.|$|E
500|$|Ice later {{developed}} {{a friendship with}} producer Ross Robinson, who had become known for producing music by Deftones, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sepultura. Robinson and Ice shared an interest in motocross racing. Monte Lipman hoped that Robinson would produce a new Vanilla Ice album. According to Robinson, others had attempted to discourage him from working with Ice, saying it might hurt his reputation. Rather than being dissuaded, their fear encouraged Robinson who agreed to work with Ice. In an interview, Robinson stated [...] "It's the most punk-rock thing you could do." [...] Despite not being happy with his old image, Winkle stated that {{he never had a}} problem with his older music. Ice decided against changing his stage name <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> as he felt no need to run from his past, despite being uneasy with some of it and started performing again, booking a hundred shows a year.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{priorities}} for Goldwyn was to shorten {{the length of the}} show to at least three hours or less. In view of his goal, he told reporters regarding winner's acceptance speeches, [...] "We are actually going to give them 45 seconds. The light (next to the camera) will start blinking at 45 seconds and go red at 55 seconds. After one minute we will either cut to a commercial or go <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> We've also asked multiple winners to flip a coin and pick a spokesman." [...] Furthermore, instead of each Best Original Song nominee being performed separately, all five songs were performed as part of a musical number featuring actress Bernadette Peters singing brief introductions to each one. Although Goldwyn attempted to move the Documentary and Short Film Categories to a separate ceremony from the broadcast, the AMPAS Board of Governors refused to do so.|$|E
500|$|A much {{different}} {{origin of the}} song was told on The Howard Stern Show in November 2011. Chris Martin explained to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck {{with him for a}} bit; then in a Neil Young voice he sang [...] "look at the stars". Martin went on to further explain that the word [...] "yellow" [...] has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change [...] "yellow" [...] <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word [...] "yellow" [...] just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just {{to move on to the}} next question. Martin applauded Stern saying [...] "I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1960s had {{a return}} to [...] "the more mundane {{sensibilities}} of comedy," [...] due to viewers' wishes for television programming to be a [...] "cultural antidepressant." [...] Thus, fantasy and rural-oriented comedies gained popularity and dominated the Nielsen ratings. Like other comedies at the time, Gomer Pyle was a [...] "deep escapist" [...] show; it avoided political commentary and offered viewers a distraction from the social changes of the 1960s. Despite being a military-themed show and airing during {{the peak of the}} Vietnam War, the show never discussed the war. Instead, the show focused on [...] "Gomer's innocent simplicity [...] Sergeant Carter's frustration and later concern for Gomer's well-being." [...] This, compounded with the popularity of rural comedies in the 1960s, made the show popular. Frank Sutton, who played Carter, also ascribed the show's popularity to its concentration on its two main characters, and the plots being built around their respective personalities. The program remained in the top 10 of the ratings throughout its run—in the top three for all but its third season when CBS moved it from Fridays to Wednesdays. Nabors quit because he desired to move <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> 'reach for another rung on the ladder, either up or down'.|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he {{believed}} the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for Agent Carter, before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [...] tune in <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and {{there has to be}} a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.|$|E
500|$|When {{the group}} arrived in California, Nirvana {{did a few}} days of {{pre-production}} where the band and Vig tightened up some of the song arrangements. The only recording carried over from the Smart Studios sessions was the song [...] "Polly", which included cymbal crashes performed by Chad Channing. Once recording commenced, the band worked eight to ten hours a day. The band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes; if the takes were not satisfactory at that point, they would move on <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> The group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed. Cobain used a variety of guitars, from Stratocasters to Jaguars, and Novoselic used a black 1979 and natural 1976 Gibson Ripper. Novoselic and Grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days, but Cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs, singing, and particularly lyrics (which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording). Cobain's phrasing was so consistent on various takes that Vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs. Vig says that he often had to trick Cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes. In particular, Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on the song [...] "In Bloom" [...] by telling him [...] "John Lennon did it." [...] While the sessions went well generally, Vig said Cobain would become moody and difficult at times: [...] "He'd be great for an hour, and then he'd sit in a corner and say nothing for an hour." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite its run {{during the}} Vietnam War, Gomer Pyle {{remained}} popular, because it avoided war-related themes and instead {{focused on the}} show's rural roots {{and the relationship between}} Pyle and Carter.
