25|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{financial}} performance, 1962 {{turned out to}} be the busiest year in Silver City's 16-year history. During that year, the airline and its French partner CAT carried 96,272 vehicles and 238,748 passengers on 43,064 flights, representing increases of 10%, 6% and 12% compared with 1961. In addition, over 43,000 tonnes of cargo were carried. However, these record-breaking <b>traffic</b> <b>statistics</b> did not alter the fact that the airline's air ferry operation was no longer economically viable. With the advent of new, high-capacity roll-on/roll-off ferries competition intensified. Established aircraft manufacturers were not interested in producing reasonably priced replacements for the ageing Bristol Freighters/Superfreighters that were suffering from wing fatigue. The airline's long-standing policy of stimulating the market by continuously reducing fares had resulted in uneconomic yields in the absence of a corresponding reduction in costs. The Hermes fleet had continued in operation serving several UK airports, mainly on inclusive tour flights, with the last example being retired from service in late 1962.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, British Eagle—as well as BUA, Caledonian and Transglobe—also {{applied to}} the ATLB for {{licences}} to operate scheduled and non-scheduled services in competition with BOAC on several long-haul routes. British Eagle sought a 15-year licence for a London – New York passenger service to be operated with Boeing 707-320Cs from 1 April 1969 between either Heathrow or Stansted and JFK at an initial frequency of two daily return flights during summer (April—October) and one round-trip per day in winter (November—March). Similar licences were sought to operate to Los Angeles/San Francisco and Toronto/Montreal with Chicago as an intermediate stop. In addition, the airline sought licences for a London—Bermuda—Nassau—Kingston/Montego Bay mid-Atlantic and Caribbean service, with Chicago as an intermediate stop between London and Bermuda or Nassau. There were also plans to seek licences for a transatlantic all-cargo service between London, New York and six other points on the East Coast of the United States, {{as well as for}} a mixed passenger/cargo service between London and Hong Kong. As the latter was an unrestricted cabotage route, British Eagle intended to seek approval for a £125 one-way fare that would have undercut the existing fare by £83. At the forthcoming ATLB hearings, British Eagle planned to back up its case with detailed <b>traffic</b> <b>statistics</b> showing a marked decline in Britain's traffic share over a period of five years on routes shared with foreign flag carriers where BOAC was the sole British flag carrier. These figures indicated {{that in the case of}} the transatlantic scheduled air market between Britain and the United States, the American market share rose by 10% between 1962 and 1966 while the British share fell by 7% within that period. British Eagle wanted to use these findings to argue that licensing a second British scheduled carrier on these routes would substantially benefit the British economy by strengthening Britain's overall competitive position vis-à-vis overseas rivals in a dollar-earning market and thus complement rather than damage BOAC. British Eagle's applications competed with BUA's, Caledonian's and Transglobe's. BUA sought unrestricted frequencies across the North Atlantic to several destinations in the US and Canada, beginning with a thrice-weekly Gatwick—Belfast—JFK VC10 service. It also wanted to extend its existing South American routes via Lima and the Pacific to Australasia, hoping to convert this into a supersonic operation by the early 1970s. Caledonian sought transatlantic scheduled services linking its main operating bases at Gatwick and Prestwick in the UK with a number of destinations in the US and Canada, with particular emphasis on the West Coast of the United States to take full advantage of its growing fleet of long-range Boeing 707-320Cs. Transglobe Airways sought to operate scheduled passenger/cargo services from its Gatwick base to points on the US and Canadian west coasts.|$|E

40|$|Managing {{quality of}} service (QoS) is an {{important}} network operation, especially in hybrid wired and wireless multimedia networks. In this study, a two-stage approach to intelligently manage QoS for multimedia traffic was developed. Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) {{was included in the}} study {{as an example of a}} typical multimedia application. Initially an adaptive statistical sampling technique was employed. It determined the <b>traffic's</b> <b>statistics</b> and used them in a fuzzy inference system to determine the optimum interval between every two consecutive sections of the traffic sampled. In the second stage, a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering was used to pre-process QoS parameters (delay, jitter and packet loss ratio) obtained from the devised sampling scheme. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network then used the information from FCM to assess the QoS provided for VoIP. It was shown that the developed adaptive statistical sampling represents the traffic more correctly than the systematic, stratified and random non-adaptive sampling methods. Also, the combination of statistical sampling followed by FCMand MLP accurately indicated the QoS for VoIP...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Switched Processing Systems (SPS) {{capture the}} essence of a {{fundamental}} resource allocation problem in many modern communication, computer and manufacturing systems involving heterogeneous processors and multiple classes of job traffic flows. Recently, increased {{attention has been paid to}} the issue of improving quality of service (QoS) performance in terms of delays and backlogs of the associated scheduling policies, rather than simply maximizing the system’s throughput. In this study, we investigate a class of throughput maximizing scheduling policies called MaxProduct policies. The objective is that through a use of dynamically changing “optimal ” queue weights, the corresponding QoS performance measure-e. g. the average system delay- can be significantly improved. The proposed approach involves a statistical smoothing technique for tracking the system’s workload and utilizes the result of how the MaxProduct policies drain out an initially placed workload in the shortest possible time. It is further shown that the proposed modification of the MaxProduct policy, achieves maximum throughput without requiring knowledge of the incoming <b>traffic’s</b> <b>statistics.</b> The scheduling policy is illustrated on a small SPS subject to different types of input traffic.
