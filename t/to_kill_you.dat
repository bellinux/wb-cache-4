500|$|... "Running to the Edge of the World" [...] is a David Bowie-inspired ballad, which {{features}} Manson singing in falsetto notes during its middle 8. [...] "I Want <b>to</b> <b>Kill</b> <b>You</b> Like They Do in the Movies" [...] is a primarily bass-driven rock song. At over 9 minutes, it is longest {{song on the}} album. Its lyrics document the disintegration of Manson's relationship with Wood, and his fantasies of [...] "smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer." [...] It {{was one of the}} first tracks the band recorded for The High End of Low, and was originally 25 minutes long. Reluctant to release a double album, they re-recorded a shorter version following the completion of the album's final song, [...] "15", with Manson asking the band: [...] "How many minutes do I have left on this CD ? And it was 9 minutes. I said, 'Roll it, I'm going to sing it.' What appears on the record is one [...] performance." ...|$|E

The episode also features guest appearances from talk show host Charlie Rose and film producer Robert Evans as themselves. Evans and Rose appear in a scene {{at the beginning of}} the episode, when Homer stays up late and watches television because of his fear that he might die in his sleep. Rose is seen interviewing Evans on the television, and as they are talking about Evan's film Love Story, Rose says: [...] "And the critics loved it, too. I remember Vincent Canby said, [...] 'I'm going <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>you,</b> Homer. You are so dead.'" [...] The last part is imagined by Homer, who has become incredibly sleepy. Later in the interview, when talking about his unsuccessful film The Two Jakes, Evans says: [...] "I said to myself, 'Evans, you forgot Hollywood Rule No. 1: [...] Kill Homer Simpson.'" ...|$|E

Throughout March, five rough mixes of songs from the album were leaked. In {{an interview with a}} fansite, Chris Vrenna said of the leak: [...] "I hate stealing of music in any form. If a band chooses to put tracks online, that's great. [...] I think true fans know that usually songs found online before the record is released are rough mixes, and will wait to hear the music the way the artist intended." [...] "We're from America" [...] was released as a free download on the band's website from March 27, with a one-track digital single released through online retailers on April 7. A CD single was released on April 14, and was exclusively sold at Hot Topic. It peaked at number three on Billboards Hot Singles Sales, spending six weeks on the chart.|$|E
500|$|According to Wilkinson, in {{the months}} leading up to the alleged kidnapping, Jernigan had come to Wilkinson's office several times {{demanding}} money he claimed he was owed from his prior business dealings with Wilkinson. Wilkinson said he had been making the requested payments, but that when he refused Jernigan's request on April 10, Jernigan presented him with a four-page suicide note, then produced a pistol and told Wilkinson, [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>you</b> first." [...] Wilkinson further alleged that Jernigan forced him to drive to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Frankfort, a hotel Wilkinson owned, at gunpoint. The two spent the night at the hotel, and sometime during the night, Wilkinson contacted James Aldridge, president of New Farmers National Bank in Glasgow, Kentucky. Wilkinson, who owned an interest in New Farmers National Bank, told Aldridge he needed $500,000 as soon as possible. The next day, Wilkinson and Jernigan flew to Glasgow aboard a plane operated by Wilkinson Flying Service, another company owned by Wilkinson. Wilkinson said Jernigan threatened to kill employees at the company if Wilkinson attempted to alert them. Aldridge met Wilkinson and Jernigan with the money Wilkinson had requested at the Glasgow Municipal Airport. Upon their arrival, Wilkinson paid Jernigan $500,000 and was released unharmed.|$|E
500|$|Neil Pigot, who {{did some}} {{work with the}} group, {{describes}} their style as [...] "a sort of extension of the Python tradition, but very much in an Australian context." [...] He says that DAAS were [...] "crucially important" [...] {{in the development of}} Australian comedy, directly contributing to the styles of successful comedy shows such as The D-Generation, Fast Forward and Wogs Out of Work. At the time DAAS emerged, Pigot says, comedy in Australia was dominated by joke-tellers and impersonators. [...] By contrast, DAAS were belligerent and confrontational, frequently attacking topical issues, invading people's personal space and involving the audience in their act. Mark Trevorrow, who frequently collaborated with the group, described their work as [...] "true genius." [...] "Their great shows were among the greatest evenings I've witnessed in my life and their worst shows were among the worst," [...] he said. [...] "They'd whip up an audience and appeal to people's darker side. [...] It was very Dada, what they were doing. [...] And what happens with that is you're just as often likely to have people who want <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>you</b> as applaud you." [...] In addition, ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson says that the group {{played an important role in}} raising the profile of Australian comedy overseas, particularly in Britain where DAAS were very popular. British comedian Al Murray said of seeing the group at the Edinburgh Festival in 1988, [...] "they came onstage with the attitude of feral invaders and left it with no taboo untouched." [...] Murray described the All Stars as [...] "an insanely hot act from Oz who sang, cursed, sweated and insulted each other and their audiences with a level of commitment and polish that seemed exotically charged and almost transgressive in the late 80s." ...|$|E
