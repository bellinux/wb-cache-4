500|$|The De Long [...] party {{found no}} {{immediate}} sign [...] at their landing-place [...] of any human habitation, {{and had only}} a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a <b>tent</b> <b>pole,</b> they set out in search of [...] settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. [...] On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. [...] De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.|$|E

Star Trek had become known to those within Paramount as [...] "the franchise", because of its great success and recurring role as a <b>tent</b> <b>pole</b> for the studio when other projects failed. TNG had the highest ratings of any Star Trek series and became the #1 syndicated show during the last years of its original seven-season run. In response to TNG's success, Paramount released a spin-off series [...] in 1993. While never as popular as TNG, the series had sufficient ratings for it to last seven seasons.|$|E

McTavish explained that if a character is nice to Bianca, the audience tends to like that character, and if he is mean to Bianca, the audience knows he is a bad guy.

2500|$|Chuckwagon {{racing is}} a team event, led by a driver who {{commands}} a team of horses pulling the chuckwagon, and is supported by two or four outriders, each racing individual thoroughbred horses that follow the chuckwagon. [...] Each race typically involves three or four teams, and begins with the outriders [...] "breaking camp", by tossing two tent poles (with four outriders only) and a barrel representing a camp stove {{into the back of}} their wagon before mounting their horses and following the wagons as they complete a figure eight around two barrels before circling a race track. [...] The first wagon to cross the finish line typically wins, although various time penalties are handed out for infractions such as a barrel being knocked over, a <b>tent</b> <b>pole</b> or stove not loaded, wagon interference or an outrider crossing the finish line too far behind his wagon driver.|$|E

2500|$|The initial discovery, by Bedouin {{shepherd}} Muhammed edh-Dhib, {{his cousin}} Jum'a Muhammed, and Khalil Musa, {{took place between}} November 1946 and February 1947. The shepherds discovered seven scrolls (See Scrolls and fragments) housed in jars in a cave near what {{is now known as}} the Qumran site. John C. Trever reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with the Bedouin. Edh-Dhib's cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib himself was the first to actually fall into one. He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which Trever identifies as the Isaiah Scroll, Habakkuk Commentary, and the Community Rule, and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls were destroyed in this process, despite popular rumor. The Bedouin kept the scrolls hanging on a <b>tent</b> <b>pole</b> while they figured {{out what to do with}} them, periodically taking them out to show it to their people. At some point during this time, the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouin first took the scrolls to a dealer named Ibrahim 'Ijha in Bethlehem. 'Ijha returned them, saying they were worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouin went to a nearby market, where a Syrian Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, [...] "Kando", a cobbler and part-time antiques dealer. The Bedouin and the dealers returned to the site, leaving one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for 7 GBP (equivalent to US$37, in 2014). The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouin left them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. (See Ownership.) ...|$|E
