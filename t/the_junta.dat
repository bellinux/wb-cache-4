5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so in {{defiance}} of the local authority. <b>The</b> <b>Junta</b> summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext that there was a threat to their lives. <b>The</b> <b>Junta</b> appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> left their usual moderation {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|Cornelio Saavedra {{was aware}} that <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> would be {{resisted}} by factions still loyal to the old authorities. It was resisted locally by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it; and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter-revolution at Córdoba. During this early period, <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> worked united against the royalist threats. Mariano Moreno, the secretary of war, drafted the decrees and regulations to deal with royalists. First, a decree ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes, and for those concealing conspiracies against <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> or other people. The Royal Audiencia swore loyalty to the Regency Council, in defiance to <b>the</b> <b>Junta,</b> so they were summoned, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. <b>The</b> <b>Junta</b> appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno organized as well the Paraguay campaign and the First Upper Peru campaign, to the plazas that resisted <b>the</b> <b>Junta.</b> The second one, headed by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo, would move to Córdoba and attack the counter-revolution; before marching to Upper Peru. Ocampo's initial orders were to capture the counter-revolutionary leaders and send them to Buenos Aires, so that they could be judged. When the counter-revolution became stronger Moreno called <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> and proposed that the enemy leaders should be shot {{as soon as they were}} captured instead of brought to trial. The new orders were carried out by Juan José Castelli. Cornelio Saavedra supported all these measures.|$|E
5|$|Leiva wrote a {{constitutional}} code {{to regulate the}} actions of <b>the</b> <b>Junta.</b> It stipulated that <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> could not exercise judicial power, which was reserved for the Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires; that Cisneros could not act {{without the support of}} {{the other members of the}} Junta; that the Cabildo could dismiss anyone who neglected his duty; that the Cabildo's consent would be required to create new taxes; that <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> would sanction a general amnesty for those who had aired opinions at the open cabildo; and that <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> would invite the other cities to send delegates. The commanders of the armed forces, including Saavedra and Pedro Andrés García, agreed to this code. <b>The</b> <b>Junta</b> swore the oath of office that afternoon.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Juntas</b> Generales (Batzar Nagusiak in Basque) are {{representative}} assemblies in the Southern Basque Country that {{go back to}} the 14th century. <b>The</b> three main <b>Juntas</b> Generals in <b>the</b> Basque Country were - and are - <b>the</b> <b>Juntas</b> Generales of Biscay, <b>the</b> <b>Juntas</b> Generales of Gipuzkoa and <b>the</b> <b>Juntas</b> Generales of Álava. The equivalent in Navarre was the Cortes - or The Three States, roughly House of the Commons - to become the present-day Parliament of Navarre.|$|R

5|$|Saavedra {{was warned}} by fellow members of <b>the</b> <b>Junta,</b> {{military}} leaders {{and even the}} Cabildo that if he left Buenos Aires, the government would be prone to fall into a political crisis. He left anyway, convinced {{that he would be}} able to reorganize the Army of the North. The warnings were justified; shortly after his departure, <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> was turned into a legislative power, while the executive would be managed by the First Triumvirate. This arrangement lasted for a short time, then <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> was abolished. The Regiment of Patricians made a mutiny against the triumvirate, but failed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{conflict}} between Alberti and Moreno {{was caused by}} the arrival of Gregorio Funes, dean of Córdoba with similar ideas to those of Cornelio Saavedra, president of <b>the</b> <b>Junta.</b> Moreno was keeping an internal dispute with Saavedra, and expected Alberti to write against Funes. He did not, and Moreno made harsh comments about it. Alberti would be further distanced from Moreno when <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> voted for the incorporation of the deputies from other cities into <b>the</b> <b>Junta.</b> At first, both of them opposed the proposal, but Alberti ultimately voted accepting it, stating that he did so just out of political convenience. The Primera Junta was thus turned into <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> Grande. Mariano Moreno, left in a minority group, resigned.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> Grande {{assisted}} to Alberti's funeral, even his political enemy Gregorio Funes. Domingo Matheu {{was the most}} affected one by his death, {{to the point of}} crying for it. Alberti was replaced in <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> by Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, a decided morenist. Saavedra and Funes did not like him, but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination.|$|E

They also rejected the Spanish Constitution of 1812. The triumph of the republican ideas (from the American and French revolutions), transformed <b>the</b> <b>juntas</b> into true independence movements.|$|R

5|$|However, {{this power}} allowed Leiva {{to perform a}} {{maneuver}} that Castelli had not anticipated. Although he approved the end of Cisneros' rule as viceroy, Leiva formed a Junta with Cisneros as its president; Cisneros would stay in power. The other members of <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> would have been two peninsulars, the priest Juan Nepomuceno Solá and the merchant José Santos Inchaurregui, and two criollos, Saavedra and Castelli. The bulk of the natives rejected the proposal: they did not accept that Cisneros should remain in power, even under a different title. They were suspicious of the intentions of Saavedra, and believed that with Castelli alone in <b>the</b> <b>Junta,</b> little or nothing could be achieved. Castelli and Saavedra resigned that same day {{to put pressure on}} Cisneros and force him to resign, and <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> never came into power.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Alberti {{worked in}} journalism as well, at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres {{newspaper}} created by <b>the</b> <b>Junta.</b> The ruling that created this newspaper gave Alberti {{the duty of}} selecting the news reports to publish. This duty was exclusive of Alberti and not shared with {{the other members of}} <b>the</b> <b>Junta.</b> Some historians also consider that Alberti may be the real author of the newspaper's editorials, as they were not signed and the style is not similar to other reports by Mariano Moreno, who is usually considered the author.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Junta</b> {{suffered}} from internal {{conflicts between the}} conservatives (led by Cornelio Saavedra) and the liberals (led by Mariano Moreno). Azcuénaga was aligned with Moreno. Although he opposed the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> into <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> Grande, he voted for the proposal, perhaps under pressure of Saavedra. Mariano Moreno resigned in December, and all his supporters were forced to resign in May 1811. Azcuénaga was exiled to the Mendoza Province, and lost his military rank. His wife requested instead an exile to the closer Luján, which was declined. <b>The</b> <b>Junta</b> {{was replaced by the}} First Triumvirate. Azcuénaga still had a positive image among his peers, and the political change allowed his return and the restitution of his rank. However, a mistake with the documentation gave him only the rank of colonel; he could only retrieve his rank of Brigadier in 1814. He was appointed Governor intendant of Buenos Aires (ruling over the province, whereas the Triumvirate had a national authority).|$|E

5|$|The Primera Junta {{was finally}} established. It was {{composed}} by president Cornelio Saavedra, members Manuel Alberti, Miguel de Azcuénaga, Manuel Belgrano, Juan José Castelli, Domingo Matheu and Juan Larrea, and secretaries Juan José Paso and Mariano Moreno. The rules governing it were {{roughly the same}} as those issued the day before, with the additional provisions that the Cabildo would watch over the members of <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> itself would appoint replacements in case of vacancies. Saavedra spoke to the crowd, and then moved on to the Fort, among salvos of artillery and the ringing of bells. Meanwhile, Cisneros dispatched a post rider to Córdoba, Argentina, to warn Santiago de Liniers about what had happened in Buenos Aires and to request military action against <b>the</b> <b>Junta.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican {{delegation}} was freely {{elected by}} those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners), {{in a rare}} exercise of political openness in the colony. Segundo Ruiz Belvis was elected to <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> representing Mayagüez, something that horrified the then governor general of the island. To the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates, including its leader, José Julián Acosta, <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> had a majority of Spanish-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested. However, Acosta could convince <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). Once he became prime minister in 1870, Castelar did approve an abolition bill, praising {{the efforts of the}} Puerto Rico members, sincerely moved by Acosta's arguments.|$|E
5|$|The deputies and <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> met on December 18, {{to decide}} what to do. Funes, who was close to Saavedra, argued that Buenos Aires had no right to appoint {{national}} authorities by itself and expect obedience from the provinces. The nine deputies voted for their incorporation, as did Larrea, Azcuénaga, Matheu and Alberti, founding members of <b>the</b> <b>Junta.</b> Saavedra declared that the incorporation was not fully legal, but that he supported it for public convenience. Only Juan José Paso voted with Moreno against the incorporation of the deputies. Left in a minority within <b>the</b> <b>Junta,</b> Moreno resigned. He was appointed to a diplomatic mission in Europe, but died in high seas, in unclear circumstances. Some historians consider that Saavedra plotted to murder Moreno, others that it was a negligence of the captain, and others that it was because of Moreno's frail health.|$|E
50|$|The Regimiento General (General Regiment) was {{established}} in 1500 and had the function of governing the territory when <b>the</b> <b>Juntas</b> were not meeting. It was formed by 12 regidores that were named by <b>the</b> <b>Juntas</b> and one corregidor. The regiment meet three times each year, and eventually got the name of Universal government of the Lordship.|$|R

5|$|The {{resignation}} of Ponce Vaides {{and the creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>junta</b> has been considered by scholars to be the beginning of the Guatemalan Revolution. However, the revolutionary junta did not immediately threaten the interests of the landed elite. Two days after Ponce Vaides' resignation, a violent protest erupted at Patzicía, a small Indian hamlet. <b>The</b> <b>junta</b> responded with swift brutality, silencing the protest.

5|$|Three {{months after}} the {{creation}} of the Primera Junta, Manuel Belgrano was appointed Chief Commander of an army sent to gather support at Corrientes, Santa Fe, Paraguay, and the Banda Oriental. A few days later his goal was made more specific: he must aim for Paraguay. <b>The</b> <b>Junta</b> had been informed that the patriotic party was strong, and a small army would suffice to take control. Trusting this information, Belgrano went to Paraguay with two possible goals: get acknowledgment for <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> in Paraguay or promote a new government that would stay on friendly terms with Buenos Aires. Belgrano was unaware that on 24 July a general assembly in Paraguay discussed <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> of Buenos Aires, and decided to reject it and pledge allegiance to the Regency Council of Spain.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{criticism}} continued even a {{week after}} the storm, especially over the scale of the disaster. The government claimed that only 27 people had been killed by Giri while numerous local and international agencies stated significantly higher totals. They were also blamed for downplaying the amount of damage, resulting in slower distribution of aid to areas in desperate need. Two weeks after Giri struck Myanmar, little attention was given to the ongoing disaster by <b>the</b> <b>Junta.</b> The Myanmar government continued to keep other countries out of the area and prevent them from knowing {{what was going on in}} the hardest hit areas. Thousands of survivors continued to suffer due to the insufficient relief making it into the region. On November8, local media discovered that <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> was threatening to sever aid to the region if residents did not vote for them in the national election. According to Mizzima, the opposing party won landslide victories in numerous townships; however, in the cyclone affected areas, <b>the</b> <b>Junta</b> had complete victories.|$|E
