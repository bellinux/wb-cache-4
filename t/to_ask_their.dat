5|$|The {{next day}} Hastings called {{for both the}} Solicitor General, Sir Henry Slesser, and Jimmy Maxton, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> opinion on the prosecution. Maxton knew Campbell, and {{revealed}} {{that he was only}} the temporary editor and had not written the article – the article had actually been copied from another newspaper. Along with Guy Stevenson, the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, Hastings then visited Ramsay MacDonald to explain the facts of the case. MacDonald blamed the Director of Public Prosecutions for starting the case, although Hastings intervened and admitted to Macdonald that it was entirely his fault. The Prime Minister said that he felt they should go through with the case now they had started, but Hastings suggested that a member of the Treasury Counsel appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court and withdraw the prosecution. MacDonald agreed, and the next morning Travers Humphreys appeared for the Crown at the Magistrates Court and had Campbell discharged.|$|E

The launch of the car also marked the start of Miku's debut in the US alongside it. Crypton had always sold Hatsune Miku as a virtual instrument, but they decided <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> own fanbase in Japan if it was okay with them to market her to the United States as a virtual singer instead.|$|E
25|$|Mail {{was vital}} for the prisoners of war. Letters allowed {{them not only}} to receive news from home but also <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> {{families}} to send parcels and inform them of their receipt. Every month, a prisoner {{had the right to}} write two letters (limited to six pages each for officers, and four pages for other ranks), on paper that he had to buy at the camp, and four postcards. These were the numbers in theory, at least, though very often the practice differed. For the German authorities, mail represented a considerable source of pressure; the right to write and receive mail was regularly denied. In the first half of 1915, French prisoners sent 350,000 letters to France; the figure doubled {{in the second half of}} the year. On an average week, French prisoners received 45,000 letters containing money. This number fluctuated significantly: 8,356 such letters between 8 and 24 October 1914, 79,561 between 22 and 28 November 1915. Many prisoners did not know how to write and asked others to write for them. Censorship and package inspections were daily occurrences.|$|E

25|$|Greece {{is ranked}} {{as the first}} country in the Balkans with most people who were awarded as Righteous Among the Nations. The Greek {{population}} was significantly active in hiding fellow Greeks of Jewish religion from the Nazi German forces during the Axis occupation of Greece. Even though Jews of Thessaloniki were easily deported from Thessaloniki, collaboration was minimal in capital Athens, where Nazi propaganda was not as effective, as the ancient Romaniote Jewish communities were well-integrated into the Orthodox Greek society and could not easily be singled out from the Christians, who in turn were more ready to resist the German authorities' demands. The Archbishop of Athens Damaskinos ordered his priests <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> congregations to help the Jews and sent a strong-worded letter of protest to the collaborationist authorities and the Germans. Many Orthodox Christians risked their lives hiding Jews in their apartments and homes, despite threat of imprisonment. Even the Greek police ignored instructions to turn over Jews to the Germans. When Jewish community leaders appealed to Prime Minister Ioannis Rallis, he tried to alleviate their fears {{by saying that the}} Jews of Thessaloniki had been guilty of subversive activities and that this was the reason they were deported. At the same time, Elias Barzilai, the Grand Rabbi of Athens, was summoned to the Department of Jewish Affairs and told to submit a list of names and addresses of members of the Jewish community. Instead he destroyed the community records, thus saving the lives of thousands of Athenian Jews. He advised the Jews of Athens to flee or go into hiding. A few days later, the Rabbi himself was spirited out of the city by EAM-ELAS fighters and joined the resistance. EAM-ELAS helped hundreds of Jews escape and survive (especially officer Stefanos Sarafis), many of whom stayed with the resistance as fighters and/or interpreters.|$|E

I call on all parents <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> children to stay home." [...] A former general who was a part of the intelligence services said that Mubarak would have no qualms about [...] "setting the whole country on fire."

He advises patient groups to write to drug companies with the following: [...] "We are living with this disease; is there anything at all that you're withholding? If so, tell us today." ...|$|E
500|$|Dawson {{described}} the prosthetics for the Klingon version of Torres as [...] "a forehead, nose, and teeth". She {{felt that the}} look was not as sophisticated as the character's normal appearance as a half-human/half-Klingon {{because of the lack}} of skin tones and nuances of the facial features. While Dawson's make-up typically took two hours to apply, the full Klingon prosthetics took around three hours. To save time reapplying the make-up and prosthetics repeatedly, each day's shooting would concentrate on one of the two characters, and switch the following day. Dawson compared the experience to repertory theatre. Despite the casting of the photo double, and attention to scheduling, Kolbe expressed disappointment in not being able to shoot more scenes with the two versions of Torres in the cave, but understood the frequent use of the split screen could negatively impact the production cost. After the episode had aired, Dawson called her parents <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> opinions. They replied: [...] "ou were good, but the girl that played that Klingon was really great!" [...] Dawson took their remarks as a compliment.|$|E

Morale-boosting, indeed!" [...] James Dinh of MTV News showed the video, on a small player, to fans in Times Square in New York City <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> opinions. Most said she looked [...] "sexy" [...] in the video, and {{agreed that it was}} {{different}} from previous videos and shows where she came from and where she is going in her personal life. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote, [...] "I must confess that I do fail to understand the point of Rihanna humping the gun turret of a pink tank dressed in Mickey Mouse ears. It seems pains were taken to make the setting look like Afghanistan or Iraq with the other actors looking as close to real military personnel as possible." [...] Lamb criticized the video's lack of sensitivity and respect for using an army and weapons of destruction to glamorize war, saying, [...] "Does Def Jam, Rihanna's label, need to be reminded that this comes on the heels of sadly sending off an additional 30,000 troops from our country to real war? In my mind {{this is one of the}} most tasteless, offensive moves by a major pop artist in recent memory." ...|$|E

50|$|Conversely, high SES {{individuals}} occupy {{high power}} positions {{that call for}} greater expressivity. High SES parents encourage their children to question the world around them. In addition <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> <b>their</b> children more questions, these parents push their children to create questions of their own. In contrast with low SES parents, these individuals often view the power disparity between parent and child as detrimental to the family. Opting instead to treat children as equals, high SES conversations are characterized by a give and take between parent and child. These interactions help prepare these children for occupations that require greater expressivity.|$|R

2500|$|In October 2013, Bob Katz {{announced}} on his website that [...] "The last {{battle of the}} loudness war has been won", claiming that Apple's mandatory use of Sound Check for iTunes Radio meant that [...] "The way to turn the loudness race around right now, is for every producer and mastering engineer <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> clients if they have heard iTunes Radio. When they respond in the affirmative, the engineer/producer tells them they need {{to turn down the}} level of their song(s) to the standard level or iTunes Radio will do it for them. He or she should also explain that overcompressed material sounds [...] "wimpy" [...] and [...] "small" [...] in comparison to more open material on iTunes Radio."

2500|$|Franck was finding, in the 1880s, that he {{was caught}} between two stylistic advocates: his wife Félicité, who did not care for changes in Franck's style from that to which she had first become accustomed; and his pupils, who had a perhaps {{surprising}} influence over their teacher {{as much as he}} over them. [...] Vincent d'Indy is quoted as saying [...] "When [...] was hesitating over the choice of this or that tonal relation or over the progress of any development, he always liked to consult his pupils, to share with them his doubts and <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> opinions." [...] In turn, one of Franck's students recounts that Mme Franck remarked (with some truth) that [...] "It is you pupils who have aroused all the hostility shown against him." [...] In addition, there were some discords within the Société Nationale, where Saint-Saëns had put himself increasingly at odds with Franck and his pupils.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{rigorous}} {{procedures in}} place to minimise the risk of accidental overexposure of radiation therapy to patients. However, mistakes do occasionally occur; for example, the radiation therapy machine Therac-25 was responsible {{for at least six}} accidents between 1985 and 1987, where patients were given up to one hundred times the intended dose; two people were killed directly by the radiation overdoses. From 2005 to 2010, a hospital in Missouri overexposed 76 patients (most with brain cancer) during a five-year period because new radiation equipment had been set up incorrectly. Although medical errors are exceptionally rare, radiation oncologists, medical physicists {{and other members of the}} radiation therapy treatment team are working to eliminate them. ASTRO has launched a safety initiative called [...] that, among other things, aims to record errors nationwide so that doctors can learn from each and every mistake and prevent them from happening. ASTRO also publishes a list of questions for patients <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> doctors about radiation safety to ensure every treatment is as safe as possible.|$|E

2500|$|But {{instead he}} {{received}} news of an armed uprising in Vietnam, led by Hoang Ha Tam. So he assembled his comrades in Hong Kong, and sent {{two people to}} Japan to buy 500 of the Arisaka Type 30 rifles. But after buying the weapons to support the uprising with, {{they could not afford}} to hire a ship to smuggle the rifles into Vietnam. So, in July, Phan went to Thailand <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>their</b> government to help with the smuggling. The foreign minister refused, since it would be a major diplomatic incident with France if it leaked out. So he had to return to Hong Kong and wait for the money needed for smuggling. The money never arrived, and news arrived that his fundraising organiser was dead, and that the uprising was going badly. Phan donated 480 of the rifles to the forces of Sun Yat-sen. He then tried to smuggle the remaining 20 of the rifles via Thailand, disguised as first-class luggage. This attempt failed. He spent the first half of 1910 begging on the street, selling his books, and spending all his money getting drunk at the pub. This went on until he met an elderly woman, Phan Po-Lin, who took the entire movement into her house. Funds arrived and he planned to move to Thailand. He arrived in Thailand in November 1910, and all his students and followers who could, took up farming there.|$|E
