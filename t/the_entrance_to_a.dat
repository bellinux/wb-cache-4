The only military cemetery in Bratislava is Slavín, unveiled in 1960 in honour of Soviet Army soldiers who fell during the liberation of Bratislava in April 1945. It offers an excellent view of the city and the Little Carpathians.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{attended}} Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) {{and then}} the City College of New York (CCNY) in the mid-1960s, where {{she was involved in}} many political activities, protests, and sit-ins. She was arrested for the first time—with 100 other BMCC students—in 1967, on charges of trespassing. The students had chained and locked <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> college building to protest low numbers of black faculty and the absence of a black studies program. In April 1967 she married Louis Chesimard, a fellow student-activist at CCNY. The married life ended within a year; they divorced in December 1970. Shakur's marriage receives one paragraph in her memoir, she wrote that it ended over their differing views of gender roles.|$|E
5|$|The Hospitium {{is located}} between {{the ruins of}} St. Mary's Abbey Church and the River Ouse and {{is thought to have}} {{originally}} been a guest house for visitors to the abbey of low social rank, or possibly a barn. It was originally {{part of a group of}} buildings in the abbey grounds that included a brew-house, stables, mill and, near the main gate, a boarding school with 50 pupils. The oldest parts of the ground floor were built around 1300, but the upper storey has been extensively restored in modern times. The ruined gateway at the side dates back to the 15th century, and was probably <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> passage that ran towards the water-gate by the river.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish influence. The {{architectural}} {{influence of}} the ruling Spanish (Illustration 13), although this was a milder influence {{than that of the}} Normans. The Spanish style, a more restrained version of French renaissance architecture, is particularly evident in eastern Sicily, where — owing to minor insurrections — the Spanish maintained a stronger military presence. Messina's monumental Porta Grazia, erected in 1680 as <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Spanish citadel, would not be out of place in any of the towns and citadels built by the Spanish in their colonies elsewhere. The style of this arched city gate, with its ornate mouldings and scrolls, was widely copied all over Catania immediately following the quake.|$|E
5|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern {{rock nuthatch}} builds a similar but less complex structure across <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cavity. Its nest can be quite small but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.|$|E
5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} {{who are members of}} the church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools, and some have been punished for it. In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member of the church was pushed by a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, a public official sealed <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the church in the area. Reporter Rodolfo Chávez Calderón stated that the church was in compliance with local laws.|$|E

5|$|The {{party is}} warped {{back to the}} top of Holy Loly Mountain, where the party discovers George's grave. Large rocks block <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cave inside Holy Loly Mountain, but are cleared by the power of Maria's conscience. The party {{encounters}} the Mother Ship and a fluid-filled tank that contains Giygas. The alien expresses its gratefulness to Ninten's family for raising it, but explains that George stole vital information from its people that could have been used to betray them, and proceeds to accuse Ninten of interfering with their plans. Giygas offers to save Ninten alone if he boards the Mother Ship. When Ninten declines, Giygas attempts to put Ninten to sleep. The party begins to sing the Eight Melodies while Giygas tries to quiet the party through an attack. When the party finishes the lullaby, Giygas is overcome with emotion at the thought of Maria's motherly love. Giygas says they will meet again and flies off in the Mother Ship. The game ends with Ninten, Ana, and Lloyd facing the player as the credits roll behind them.|$|E
5|$|Four {{sections}} of the Flodden Wall survive: {{to the north and}} south of the Grassmarket; in Greyfriars Kirkyard; and along Drummond Street and the Pleasance. North of the Grassmarket the wall runs alongside Granny's Green Steps and has been incorporated into later buildings, including the former Greyfriars Mission Kirk. A line of granite paving across the Grassmarket marks the line of the wall where it was uncovered during construction work in 2008. In the Vennel the last remaining bastion of the town walls survives. The Flodden Tower, as it is sometimes known, comprises two remaining walls with a total length of , pierced by crosslet gunloops and a 19th-century window. Sections of the Flodden Wall can be seen within Greyfriars Kirkyard, adorned with 16th and 17th century tombstones. At the junction of Forrest Road and Bristo Street a line of cobbles and a narrow gap in the later buildings mark the line of the wall. The longest section is in Drummond Street and the Pleasance, where it originally enclosed the Blackfriars Monastery. At the corner of the wall a blocked archway is probably <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> demolished bastion. The site of the Netherbow is marked with an outline of brass blocks at the junction of the Royal Mile and St Mary's Street.|$|E
