40|$|The {{research}} {{topic of}} my doctoral thesis explores {{the world of}} totally disconnected locally compact (<b>t.</b> <b>d.</b> l. <b>c.)</b> groups through the interaction with several geometric and harmonic analytic concepts. When investigating the existence of various properties of <b>t.</b> <b>d.</b> l. <b>c</b> groups, this interplay {{is far from being}} well understood. For example, this is the case when studying what are the necessary conditions of a <b>t.</b> <b>d.</b> l. <b>c.</b> group to enjoy the Howe [...] Moore property. Even for specific <b>t.</b> <b>d.</b> l. <b>c.</b> groups acting on d-regular trees, this problem remains widely open and only partials results have been obtained in this thesis. In consequence, new notions and techniques need to be discovered and exploited. Such a notion, namely, strongly regular hyperbolic elements, already emerged as a necessity to solve in full generality one of the questions proposed in my PhD project. This question was to characterize locally compact groups acting on Euclidean buildings and admitting a Gelfand pair. The particular dynamical properties of strongly regular hyperbolic elements beautifully link geometry with harmonic analysis. Additionally, these elements appear to have several other applications, for example, answering the flat closing problem for general buildings. (SC - Sciences) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

40|$|A {{seminar on}} lamb {{marketing}} was organised {{to provide a}} forum for discussion of this important issue, as New Zealand faces {{significant changes in the}} lamb marketing environment. The increasing importance of new lamb markets, especially in the Middle East, the importance of the North American market and the increasing fragility of the United Kingdom lamb market, make such discussion very timely. In addition, the market requirement for lambs with a lower fat content has meant that lamb grading standards have been more rigorously set and substantial price schedule penalties have been imposed for over fatness. Increasing production, processing and transportation costs have meant that the farmers share, of the market price for lamb, has fallen. This means that it has become even more important to achieve the maximum possible market return. The achievement of this target must depend on the markets available, the type of marketing activity undertaken in those markets and the structure of the industry supporting the marketing effort. The optimum results may not be available based on the present industry structure and approach and it was therefore considered appropriate that alternatives be reviewed and examined with a view to the future.

That measure, according to the author, considers the absolute frequency of the term as a primary indication of the relevance of a term, and penalizes the terms that occur in the contrasting corpora of other domains dividing the term absolute frequency in the corpus of the domain by the geometric composition of the absolute frequency in each of the contrasting corpora. After the ordering of the terms by each of these measures, cut points were chosen and applied to the ordered lists of terms. For the experiments, they used the JPED corpus and four other contrasting corpora [79], which are Stochastic modelling, Data mining, Parallel processing, and Geology. The precision of bigrams and trigrams extracted from the JPED corpus were evaluated in the following scenarios: (i) comparison of the linguistic heuristics adopted for the selection or removal of NPs, while it is possible to show that the use of the proposed heuristics significantly improve results; (ii) comparison of the statistical measures used, while, for this corpus, the precision rates are higher when the <b>t</b> f- <b>d</b> <b>c</b> f is used; and (iii) comparison of the variation of the contrasting corpora using the <b>t</b> f- <b>d</b> <b>c</b> f measure, that made it possible to show that when the four contrasting corpora are used together, better results are obtained.

On the other hand, incubation with low concentrations of monovalent anti-M-CK Fab did not extract but rather decorated the M-line, giving rise to a distinct two-line staining pattern. A similar double-line staining pattern, although less pronounced, was also observed within the M-line of paraformaldehyde- prefixed myogenic cells, which after permeabilization were incubated with low concentrations of divalent anti-M-CK antibody. In both cases, the two decorated lines appearing {{in the middle of}} the A-band were spaced axially 42 - 44 nm apart and correspond most likely to the two M 4 and M 4 ' m-bridge rows described by Sjostrom and Squire (1977, J.

These mutants all overproduced immediate-early viral polypeptides at the nonpermissive temperature. Although one of these viruses, ts K, gave a more restricted infected-cell polypeptide profile under these conditions than the other three, no complementation was detected between pairwise crosses of these mutants in the yield test. Recombination, however, was obtained between all mutant pairs except ts T and D. In physical mapping experiments, ts+ virus was recovered from cells coinfected with DNA of ts T, D, or c 75 and BamHI fragment k from wild-type strain 17 HSV- 1 DNA cloned in pAT 153, whereas ts K was rescued by cloned HSV- 1 BamHI-y. Both of these cloned DNA fragments contained sequences from the short repeat region of the HSV- 1 genome. The ts mutations were more precisely mapped by marker rescue, using restriction enzyme fragments within BamHI-k and -y from cloned DNA. The smallest fragment able to rescue a mutant was 320 base pairs long. The order of the four mutations derived from these studies {{was consistent with the}} assignment by genetic recombination. All four lesions mapped within the coding sequences of the immediate-early polypeptide Vmw IE 175 (ICP 4) which lie outside the "a" sequence.

A special apparatus, with a stationary piston and a reciprocating cylinder was used, by means of which the variation of the friction on the piston assembly during the cycle was recorded.

Thermocouples were installed at various positions in the piston, the ring and the cylinder, providing a method of determining the mean temperature of the oil between the piston assembly and the cylinder. The tests included an Investigation of the effects of viscosity, speed, and pressure on piston friction force.

This review covers the fundamentals of environmental contrast and the current arsenal of endogenous and exogenous MRI and MRS contrast enhancing agents available to visualize it. We begin describing the physicochemical background necessary to understand paramagnetic and diamagnetic contrast enhancement with a special reference to novel magnetization transfer and C- 13 hiperpolarization strategies. We describe then the main macrocyclic structures used to support the environmentally sensitive paramagnetic sensors, including CEST and PARACEST pH sensitive probes, temperature probes and enzyme activity or gene expression activatable probes. Finally we address the most commonly used diamagnetic contrast agents including imidazolic derivatives to reveal extracellular pH and tissue pO(2) values by MRS.

Model and Context Refinements Variables Invariants Events Sets Constants Properties sees refines ABSTRACT MODEL ABSTRACT CONTEXT CONCRETE MODEL M C N Variables Invariants Events sees Fig. 4. Special Case of Model and Context Refinements 25 The {{situation}} {{is not the same}} when refining models. The concrete model N (which supposedly "sees" concrete context D) has a collection of state variables w, which must be completely distinct (in first approximation) from the collection v of variables in the abstraction M. Model N also has an invariant dealing with these variables w. But contrarily to the case of abstract model M where the invariant exclusively depended on the local variables of this model, this time it is possible to have the invariant of N also depending on the variables v of its abstraction M. This is the reason why we collectively name this invariant of N the gluing invariant J(s, <b>t,</b> <b>c,</b> <b>d,</b> v, w) : it "glues" the state of the concrete model N to that of its abstraction M. 4. 2 Refinement of Existing Events The new model N has a number of events. For the moment, each event in the concrete model N is supposed to refine a certain event in its abstraction M. Suppose we have an abstract event with guard G(s, c, v) and before-after predicate R(s, c, v, v #) and a corresponding concrete event with guard H(s, <b>t,</b> <b>c,</b> <b>d,</b> w) and before-after predicate S(s, <b>t,</b> <b>c,</b> <b>d,</b> w, w #). The latter is said to refine the former if the following holds: v # (R(s, c, v, v #) J(s, <b>t,</b> <b>c,</b> <b>d,</b> v #, w #)) 4. 3 Introducing New Events in a Refinement New events can be introduced in a refinement. In this case, the refinement mechanism is slightly different from the previous o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Objective High Intensity Focused Ultrasounds (HIFU) {{demonstrated}} {{the ability to}} destroy blood clots without addiction of thrombolytic drugs. However, the involved physical principles are yet unclear, thus slowing a translation to clinical application. It is agreed that thermal effects must be avoided; however {{it is hard to}} directly measure the temperature because of the dynamics of the procedures. Methods We {{demonstrated the}} possibility to break human blood clots in an in-vitro system. We used a commercial HIFU transducer (Precision Acoustics) with focus dimensions (previously mapped) of 2. 2 mm and 23 mm (- 6 dB focal radius and length). Acoustic parameters were: frequency 1 MHz, pulse length 450 μs, duty cycle (<b>d.</b> <b>c.)</b> 10 %, output power 65 W, therapy duration (<b>t.</b> <b>d.)</b> 120 s. Results We used long segments of porcine clots (similar acoustic properties of human thrombi but easier to produce) to evaluate the presence of thermal effects, by varying the duty cycle of the sonication protocol. The following parameters were adopted {{in order to maintain the}} same amount of delivered energy: A. <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> 100 % <b>t.</b> <b>d.</b> 20 s; B. <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> 50 % <b>t.</b> <b>d.</b> 40 s; <b>C.</b> <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> 10 % (same as thrombolysis experiments) <b>t.</b> <b>d.</b> 200 s; D. <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> 0 % (control). After sonication, porcine clots were cut in correspondence of the produced lesion and were observed under a digital microscope (HiroxKH 7700, magnification 20 x). The following features were observed: A. evidence of necrotic tissue, surface erosion and internal holes; B. moderate necrosis and surface erosion; C. presence of surface erosion, no evidence of thermal lesions; D. homogeneous and uniform surface. Conclusions The absence of visible thermal lesions enforces the hypothesis of mechanical effects in HIFU thrombolysis. Inertial cavitation should play an important role in the phenomenon and must be detected and quantified, and possibly enhanced by microbubbles. We implemented a system which detects acoustic emission of collapsing bubbles (i. e. broadband noise at high frequencies) in order to assess the influence of this phenomenon in thrombolysis...|$|R
40|$|Burkeite {{formation}} {{is important in}} saline evaporites and in pipe scales. Burkeite is an anhydrous sulphate-carbonate with an apparent variable anion ratio. Such a formula with two oxyanions lends itself to vibrational spectroscopy. Two symmetric sulphate stretching modes are observed, indicating {{at least at the}} molecular level the nonequivalence of the sulphate ions in the burkeite structure. The strong Raman band at 1065 cm− 1 is assigned to the carbonate symmetric stretching vibration. The series of Raman bands at 622, 635, 645, and 704 cm− 1 are assigned to the ν 4 sulphate bending modes. The observation of multiple bands supports the concept of a reduction in symmetry of the sulphate anion from <b>T</b> <b>d</b> to <b>C</b> 3 v or even C 2 v...|$|R
