5|$|He led the {{planning}} for the Battle of Leyte, known as Operation King II, and predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> fleet would attempt to intervene, striking at the invasion force through the Surigao Strait. His warning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> fleet would sortie was discounted by MacArthur's chief intelligence officer, Brigadier General Charles A. Willoughby, but Tarbuck put his objection in writing. MacArthur would later commend him for an accurate prediction of {{the course of the}} Battle of Leyte Gulf.|$|E
5|$|Wewak was {{captured}} on 10 May 1945, and the 16th Brigade began pursuing the Japanese defenders that had withdrawn inland. They continued until 11 August, when offensive operations ceased after word was received <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> had entered into ceasefire talks. The battalion {{was in the}} Mount Shiburangu area on 15 August when news came <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> had surrendered following the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The battalion's losses during its final campaign were 51 killed and 76 wounded.|$|E

5|$|American forces {{then began}} {{preparing}} {{to move against}} nearby Kiska island, termed Operation Cottage, the final fight in the Aleutian islands campaign. In August 1943, elements of the 7th Infantry Division took part in an amphibious assault on Kiska with a brigade from the 6th Canadian Infantry Division, {{only to find the}} island deserted by the Japanese. It was later discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> had withdrawn their 5,000-soldier garrison during the night of 28 July, under cover of fog.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one hour}} later, Hiryū's second attack wave, {{consisting}} of ten B5Ns and six escorting A6Ms, arrived over Yorktown; the repair efforts {{had been so}} effective <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> pilots assumed that Yorktown must be a different, undamaged carrier. They attacked, crippling Yorktown with two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a 23-degree list to port. Five torpedo bombers and two fighters were shot down in this attack.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila.

MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E

5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{may have}} fired torpedoes at her. This {{may have been}} one of many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 had attempted to fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E

Leaving Hornet behind, Kinkaid directed the carrier and her task force to retreat {{as soon as they}} were able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, Enterprise recovered 57 of the 73 airborne U.S. aircraft as she retreated. The remaining U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean, and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.|$|E

5|$|At {{a cost of}} one {{destroyer}} sunk {{and three}} damaged, the Japanese evacuated 10,652 men from Guadalcanal. 600 of those died during the evacuation, and 3,000 more required extensive hospital care.

5|$|Believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> were {{beginning}} a major offensive {{in the southern}} Solomons aimed at Henderson Field, Halsey responded by sending, beginning on 29 January, a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal supported by most of his warship forces, separated into five task forces.

5|$|In early November, Vandegrift, fearing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> were {{planning}} {{an assault on}} the Lunga perimeter from the east using Shōji's forces plus additional reinforcements, launched an operation against the Japanese units at Koli Point.

5|$|In late March, the code-breakers at the Far East Combined Bureau, {{a branch}} of Bletchley Park, {{informed}} Somerville <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> were planning a raid into the Indian Ocean to attack Colombo and Trincomalee and destroy his fleet. He therefore divided his fleet into two groups: Force A, which consisted of the two fleet carriers, Warspite and four cruisers, and Force B, centred on Royal Sovereign and her sisters and the carrier Hermes. He intended to ambush Nagumo's fleet in a night action, the only method by which {{he thought he could}} achieve a victory. After three days of searching for the Japanese fleet without success, Somerville returned to Addu Atoll to refuel. While refuelling his ships, Somerville received a report <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> fleet was approaching Colombo, which they attacked the following day, on 5 April, followed by attacks on Trincomalee on 9 April.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the casualties to his brigade, Porter decided {{to isolate the}} Pocket with two infantry companies while a heavy artillery barrage was fired into the area over several days. An attempt to capture the Pocket would only be made once it was judged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> were no longer capable of resisting effectively. As part of this plan, the 2/12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons of shells into the Pocket between 15 and 20 June.|$|E

5|$|Japanese forces {{landed in}} Miri on 16 December 1941. They conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941. On 25 December 1941, Sibu was bombed by 9 Japanese warplanes flown from Kuching. The Resident of Third Division, Andrew Macpherson {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{would start to}} invade Sibu following the air attack. He and his officer later fled Sibu to the upstream of Rajang River. They planned to pass through Batang Ai and trek through the forests to reach Dutch Borneo. However, they were caught and killed by the Japanese at Ulu Moyan, Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{decision}} to move swiftly against Finschhafen, coupled with Blamey's to envelop the Japanese defences by landing at Scarlet Beach, and Yamada's to avoid a decisive engagement that might result {{in the loss of}} all or part of his force, gave Windeyer the time and space he needed to take Finschhafen. Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived.

The reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
