The synagogue was vandalized {{three times in a}} ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L’Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, [...] "Despite the measures taken, things persist, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed." ...|$|E

He added: [...] "We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and {{the wishes of the}} inhabitants of the Falkland Islands... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.... I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> be too nice about saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, nothing to be ashamed of, in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people".|$|E

In this he agrees with the doctrines of theurgy put forward by Iamblichus. Theurgy is possible because the powers of the gods (the henads) extend through their series of causation even down to the material world. And by certain power-laden words, acts, and objects, the soul can be drawn back up the series, so to speak. Proclus himself was a devotee of many of the religions in Athens, considering that the power of the gods could be present in these various approaches.|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to refute}} the formalist {{interpretation}} of Kant’s ethics {{according to which}} all {{that it takes to}} be virtuous is to do one’s duty for the sake of duty with no regard to one’s happiness. In contrary, this thesis claims <b>that</b> for Kant, <b>we</b> have a duty to promote general happiness and its distribution in proportion to virtue-“the highest good”. In other words, we should adopt a beneficent will and promote the happiness of all. To be able to perform this command of morality, Kant <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to establish an ethical community. This is because a morally corrupt community feeds our desire to affirm our superiority over others making us too preoccupied with distinctions in terms of wealth, knowledge and status to recognize the importance of and our capacity for virtue. A further argument of this thesis is that the ethical community has a religious nature and appeals to our need for the possibility of God’s existence {{as well as to the}} morally useful psychologically compelling effect of belief in God.

40|$|Summer School Series {{held every}} summer in Florence, Italy. In 2012 between 24 - 30 June. Poetry in Politics of Liminality A strong {{tradition}} in cultural anthropology – most notably represented by Geertz – concerns the foundational importance {{of meaning in}} human cultures. Aesthetic experiences of beauty, artistic forms of play and sacral ritual performances are fundamental to all cultures, and yet these meanings also appear to be irreducibly unique. Yet, while we are in love with Poetry, {{we also have to}} be in love with what is beyond it. This is why IPA <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to attempt to take hold of this beyond by the means of political anthropology. The 2012 IPA Summer School concerns Poetry in Liminality. In the contemporary academic scene, the meaning of everyday life and even objects has become a valid field. Yet, political anthropology first of all suggests that {{there is a difference between}} ordinary and extraordinary meanings to life, and secondly that the meaning derived from poetry is not a neutral reflection of whatever lies beyond it. Poesis can entail the recognition of the beautiful and the attempt to convey it or a desperate effort to express in familiar terms a frighteningly alien vision of the world. Poets are best remembered as proponents of schismatic divisions – and could anything be more solid, dense, or bodily serious as this view. As liminal figures poets are also famed for their despising of the materialistic and utilitarian values leading societies around of them, where emphasis is again placed on the exclusiveness, on their separation from the surrounding whole. Keats said that ‘A poet must have negative capability, the ability to empty himself and let the thing, or event, or other person come to be and speak through him’. Especially in modernity, poetry is considered at once as the highest form of truth and yet an utterly transparent vision of the world – or else poetry is mere play without seriousness or meaning, mere trickery. This, however is truly an error, as it ignores the radical manner in which Poetry altered our understanding of the nature of reality – substituting as more real a layer or level of reality from which life seems pointless – but which exist beyond both Poetry and our everyday. Political anthropology reminds us that poetry emerges from liminal experiences wherein structures are suspended, certainties are subject to doubt and the poet may touch the void. Furthermore, as Plato recognized, within such performances, any image may appear real. Yet, if poetry has any meaning it must reflect the reality beyond. Reality is absolute, where things are stable and constituted, their existence being independent from our beliefs, faith or hope. Matter does matter, not because we perceive it as such, but because its existence is morally ordered beyond us; its origins is outside us, we are merely its receivers, given to us as a gift. This is reflected in the common etymological root of ‘matter’ and ‘mother’ in Latin mater. If we manage to identify ourselves with this absolute reality, we participate in the abundance its heaps on us; but if we try to exploit it for our own benefit, its turns into a mirage in our very hands, while we become corrupted by the very effort. Thus, the play, beauty and liminality of meaning must be reconsidered in terms of gift-giving, reciprocity and grace. With this Summer 2012 International Academic journal IPA hopes to continue its highly successful summer school series. Altogether in our first three Summer Schools about three dozen students and 13 academics participated from four continents and 22 nationalities (Ireland, Northern Ireland, England, Wales, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, the United States, Canada, Japan, Uganda, and Ghana).

It is a matter in which I have thought much, and, I may say, suffered much. I have ideas, old-fashioned ideas, on the matter, which I need not pause to explain to you now. If we are as much together as I hope we shall be, you will, no doubt, come to understand them. The disposition of a family property, even though it be one so small as mine, is, to my thinking, a matter which a man should not make in accordance with his own caprices,--or even with his own affections. He owes a duty to those who live on his land, and he owes a duty to his country. And, though it may seem fantastic to say so, I think he owes a duty to those who have been before him, and who have manifestly wished that the property should be continued in the hands of their descendants. These things are to me very holy. In what I am doing I am in some respects departing from the theory of my life,--but I do so under a perfect conviction that by the course I am taking I shall best perform the duties to which I have alluded.
