25|$|As a {{demonstration}} of the principles involved in raytracing, let us consider how one would find the intersection between a ray and a sphere.

25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might tell us that a cause <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E

500|$|Musicologist Walter Everett interprets {{that most}} of the lyrics on side two's medley deal with [...] "selfishness and self-gratification – the {{financial}} complaints in 'You Never Give Me Your Money,' the miserliness of Mr. Mustard, the holding back of the pillow in 'Carry That Weight,' the desire that some second person will visit the singer's dreams – perhaps the 'one sweet dream' of 'You Never Give Me Your Money'? – in 'The End.'" [...] Everett adds that the medley's [...] "selfish moments" [...] are played {{in the context of the}} tonal centre of A, while [...] "generosity" [...] is expressed in songs where C major is central. The medley concludes with a [...] "great compromise in the 'negotiations'" [...] in [...] "The End", which serves as a structurally balanced coda. In response to the repeated A-major choruses of [...] "love you", McCartney sings in realisation that there is as much self-gratifying love ("the love you take") as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> the generous love ("the love you make"), in A major and C major, respectively.|$|E

As a general thing, I disapprove of the agonies of film mortality and its frequent projection of cemetery scenes, but {{this is one of the}} situations that must be handed the label 'exception'. ... The picture is a miniature masterpiece." [...] Contained within her review Kelly, also mentioned that baby Helen was placed in front of the camera so that even as she lay [...] "dying" [...] that she was still shown to be breathing. Kelly stated that no person would wish for a person to stop breathing for the sake of the film, but noted that it was not the best point of vision, but noted that the scene was well-managed. In Britain, The Bioscope reviewer agreed with other reviewers in finding the film to be, [...] "...a perfectly delightful little film. Although it is true that its plot, what <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> it, contains nothing very new, it is not merely a conventional dog and child picture of the ordinary type. It is, rather, an exquisite pictorial fancy, charmingly conceived for the most part and charmingly executed throughout. ... The picture is perfectly done, and not even in the ghost scenes toward the end is there anything banal or insincere in it. A film so full of tender sentiments and natural beauty should meet with the warmest of welcomes everywhere." ...|$|E

Many ancient cultures, [...] such as the Egyptians, believed that the heart was where a person's soul was housed, therefore any issues of expression were caused by injury or tainting of the soul. The first recorded case of aphasia is from an Egyptian papyrus, the Edwin Smith Papyrus, which details speech problems in a person with a traumatic brain injury to the temporal lobe. During the second half of the 19th century, aphasia was a major focus for scientists and philosophers who were working in the beginning stages of the field of psychology.|$|E
