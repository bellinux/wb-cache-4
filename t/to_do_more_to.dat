5|$|By 1958, Lê Duẩn {{ranked second}} only to Hồ in the party hierarchy, {{although}} Trường Chinh remained powerful. Lê Duẩn was a party man and never held a post in the government. He made a brief, secret visit to South Vietnam in 1958, writing a report, The Path to Revolution in the South, in which he stated that the North Vietnamese had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> assist the southern fighters. The Central Committee decided to initiate the revolution in January 1959.|$|E

The members of Congress asked the council <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> protect the federal government. Dickinson and the council agreed to consult with the militia commanders and reply to Congress the next day. The following morning, the Pennsylvania Council again refused Congress' request. Lacking sufficient assurances that the state would be willing to protect Congress, the members left Philadelphia that day for Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
