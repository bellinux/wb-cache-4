50|$|Apart {{from the}} TV lift systems, {{there are also}} the related {{projector}} lift systems. These projector lift systems may be distinguished into two equipment groups. On the one hand there is the projector ceiling light, which vertically lowers the projector downwards from a suspended ceiling, and there are projector lifts for integration into tables or furniture. The latter moves the projector vertically upwards, out of the furniture or table. Both systems are mostly made from ultra light aluminium. Stable equipment guiding is achieved in most cases using scissors or special guides. A projector lift system is often driven by a <b>tubular</b> <b>motor,</b> or another electromotor, which moves a shaft accordingly. Then the lower platform which the projector stands on, can be lowered via special belts or chains. Projector ceiling lift systems are available as ultra flat versions right up to stage projector lift devices with a lift of 5m and more, and a load bearing capacity of several 100 kg.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The travelling magnetic wave of a linear induction motor induces eddy currents in a secondary circuit (usually a sheet consisting at least partly of a non-magnetic metal, often aluminium), which cause the unrestrained member to move linearly {{in the direction of}} the travelling wave. A linear motor can also transport ferromagnetic powder, although this travels in the opposite direction to the travelling magnetic field. The motion is therefore due to a mechanism other than the eddy currents flowing in the sheet secondary. Expressions for the forces acting on an iron particle due to a travelling magnetic field are derived in the thesis. Preliminary experiments support the assumptions made in the derivations of the force expressions and lead to the formation of an hypothesis. This is shown to be capable of predicting both linear and rotational particle speeds and, with greater accuracy, the distance travelled and the rotation experienced by the particles. Experiments conducted on tubular and transverse flux motors have enabled different linear motors to be identified as suitable for a number of powder transportation applications. The results obtained show also the importance of large flux density values, the tangential to normal flux density ratio and large pole-pitch winding arrangements, with the latter lending support to the original hypothesis. The results of a finite element investigation of the <b>tubular</b> <b>motor</b> did not closely agree with the results from the experimental motor although similar trends were evident. Flux density values within particles were found to be considerably greater than those outside, as assumed in the hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The design, fabrication, {{and testing}} of a quarter-car {{facility}} coupled with various control algorithms are presented in this thesis. An experimental linear <b>tubular</b> <b>motor,</b> capable of producing a 52 -N force, provides control actuation to the model. Controllers consisting of two designs were implemented: a classical controller employing lead and lag networks and a state-space feedback design. Each design was extensively simulated to screen for receptiveness to actuation force limitations and robustness regarding the inexact tire modeling. The goal of each controller was to minimize the acceleration of the sprung mass {{in the presence of}} simulated road disturbances, modeled by both sinusoidal and step input excitation wheels. Different reference velocity inputs were applied to the control scheme. Responses to a zero reference were juxtaposed to those that resulted from tracking a reference built off a model that incorporated inertial-frame damping attached to the sprung mass. The outcome of this comparison was that low-frequency disturbances were attenuated better when tracking a zero reference, but the reference relaxation introduced by the inertialframe damping model allowed for better-attenuated high frequency signals. Employing an inertial-frame damping value of 250 N-s/m, the rejected frequency component of the system response synchronous with the disturbance input excitation of 40 rad/s bettered by 33 % and 28 % when feeding control force from the classical controller and state-space controller, respectively. The experimental analysis conducted on the classical and state-space controllers produced sinusoidal disturbance rejection of at worst 50 % within their respective bandwidths. At 25 rad/s, the classical controller was able to remove 80 % of the base component synchronous with the disturbance excitation frequency, while the state-space controller filtered out nearly 60 %. Analysis on the system's ability to reject step disturbances was greatly confounded with the destructive lateral loading transferred during the excitation process. As a result, subjection to excitation could only occur up to 25 rad/s. At the 20 rad/s response synchronous to the disturbance excitation, the classical and state-space controllers removed 85 % and 70 % of the disturbance, respectively. Sharp spikes in timebased amplitude were present due to the binding that ensued during testing...|$|E

30|$|Although {{there is}} no tubular micromotor {{reported}} moving by the bubble recoil mechanism in pure water, alternative mechanisms have offered the possibility of moving such structures in water.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a methodology to synthesize a fuzzy controller to correct the tracking dynamics of the electromechanical positioning drive trajectory. A general framework about topologies in the field of linear electromechanical drives is presented. Special focus is made on parallel manipulators using tubular linear synchronous permanent magnet motors, where computer simulations confirmed large amplitude variations of load forces applied to linear actuators of the six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) parallel manipulator. The 6 DOF parallel manipulators are wide used for the support of the flight simulators, and are projected to emulate the aeronautic motions. The commercial 6 DOF parallel manipulators usually employ hydraulic linear actuators. The hydraulic linear actuators have bigger volume/power ratio than <b>tubular</b> linear synchronous <b>motors</b> and an expensive maintenance cost. The difficulties of these applications are {{in the absence of the}} trajectory planning, which is common in parallel manipulator applications. The fuzzy controller synthesis for the linear position drive is described. Its main goal is to perform the automatic adjustment of the <b>tubular</b> linear <b>motor</b> positioning trajectory, by changing its speed and acceleration references. The resulting motion trajectory obtained from the fuzzy controller is particularly suited to high accuracy applications such as parallels manipulators, robotics systems and factory automation. The electromechanical position drive present in this paper is based on Permanent Magnet <b>Tubular</b> Linear Synchronous <b>Motor</b> (PM-TLSM) as the electromechanical linear actuator fed by a position drive controller and a linear encoder as feedback device of the system. The structure of the laboratory prototype of the fuzzy controller coupled to the electromechanical linear position drive is presented.
