5|$|The ECSC stood {{model for}} the {{communities}} set up after it by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> and European Atomic Energy Community, with whom it shared its membership and some institutions. The 1967 Merger (Brussels) Treaty led to all of ECSC's institutions to merge into that of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community,</b> but the ECSC retained its own independent legal personality. In 2002, the Treaty of Paris expired and the ECSC ceased to exist in any form, its activities fully absorbed by the European Community under the framework of Amsterdam and Nice treaties.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{established}} a common market for its member states. The Eurasian Economic Community was modelled on <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community.</b> The two had a comparable population size of 171 million and 169 million, respectively.|$|E

5|$|After {{discussions with}} Lloyd and senior civil servants, Macmillan took the {{unprecedented}} step of appointing two Foreign Office cabinet ministers: Home, as Foreign Secretary, in the Lords, and Edward Heath, as Lord Privy Seal and deputy Foreign Secretary, in the Commons. With British {{application for admission}} to <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> (EEC) pending, Heath was given particular responsibility for the EEC negotiations {{as well as for}} speaking in the Commons on foreign affairs in general.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> and Euratom were {{established}} in 1958 by the Treaties of Rome. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the European Parliamentary Assembly. The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality. This {{is seen as the}} birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.|$|E
5|$|Dormand opposed Britain's {{membership}} of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> (EEC), {{and at the}} time of the referendum on EEC membership in 1975 he was an advocate for the United Kingdom leaving the EEC and rejoining the European Free Trade Association. His main work in opposition was as a member of select committee on nationalised industries, where his knowledge and inquisitorial skills won him the respect of the committee's left-wing chair Ian Mikardo. In February 1972 he called for employment for miners who had been made redundant, and became Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party's Northern Group in 1973.|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has {{received}} much negative publicity {{as the most}} expensive, complex and problematic of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community's</b> policies. Suggestions for its reform, however, have met with limited success, owing either to entrenched political factors or to the intellectual inadequacy of the ideas themselves. A short-sighted perspective of European agriculture has inevitably prevailed...|$|R

5|$|Hungary {{recognised}} Croatian independence on 15 January 1992 (with {{the rest}} of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> member states), and established diplomatic relations with Croatia three days later. During the Croatian War of Independence, Croatia obtained arms from several countries (including Hungary), despite a United Nations-imposed arms embargo. As of December 2011, Hungary and Croatia have 96 treaties and agreements in force regulating {{a wide range of}} activities and relations (including diplomatic, cultural, economic, energy, transport, education, minority and other issues). Furthermore, Hungary supported the Croatian NATO membership request and Croatian accession to the European Union.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} France joining the Commonwealth. The proposal was never accepted and the following year France signed the Treaty of Rome, which established <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community,</b> the precursor to the European Union. In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal. Lord Mountbatten claimed the Queen was opposed to the invasion, though Eden denied it. Eden resigned two months later.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield {{remained}} a major industrial city throughout {{the first half}} of the 20th century, but the downturn in world trade following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching restructuring of steel production throughout <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> led to the closure of many of the steelworks from the early 1970s onward. Urban and economic regeneration schemes were initiated in the late 1980s. The city centre was blighted by empty shops and improvements were halted by the Great Recession.|$|E

5|$|The Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia, also {{referred}} to as Badinter Arbitration Committee, was set up by the Council of Ministers of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> (EEC) on August 27, 1991, to provide the Conference on Yugoslavia with legal advice. The five-member Commission consisted of presidents of Constitutional Courts in the EEC. Starting in late November 1991, the committee rendered ten opinions. The Commission stated, among other things, that SFR Yugoslavia {{was in the process of}} dissolution and that the internal boundaries of Yugoslav republics may not be altered unless freely agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Republic of Germany was a {{founding}} member of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> in 1957 and the European Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany {{is a member of the}} United Nations, NATO, the G7 (formerly G8), the G20, and the OECD. The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential and successful artists, philosophers, musicians, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.|$|E
5|$|The three {{communities}} were later merged in 1967, by the Merger Treaty, into the European Communities. The institutions were carried over from <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> (making the Commission of that community the direct ancestor {{of the current}} Commission). Under the Treaties of Rome, the Common Assembly (which renamed itself the Parliamentary Assembly, and then the European Parliament) was supposed to become elected. However this was delayed by the Council until 1979. Since then it gained more powers via successive treaties. The Maastricht Treaty also gave further powers to the Council by giving it {{a key role in}} the two new pillars of the EU which were based on intergovernmental principles.|$|E
5000|$|The Irish Dairy Board (Board) was {{established}} {{by an act of}} the Oireachtas, the Dairy Produce Marketing Act 1961, and replaced the earlier Butter Marketing Committee. It was created to centralise the overseas marketing of Irish dairy products to achieve economies of scale and greater brand recognition. At the time of the Board's creation, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community's</b> market was closed to Irish butter, and the United Kingdom market limited Irish imports by an import quota.|$|R

50|$|Placements abroad can be {{a method}} for {{promoting}} the free movement of workers in Europe. In this case they are concerned with learning how {{to live and work}} in another country, how to become a ’migrant worker’ willing and able to move across borders and thereby allay skills shortages in other Member States (corresponding to the thoughts in the Treaty of Rome from 1957 creating <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Communities,</b> where <b>the</b> free circulation of labour across borders was seen as an essential element in the economic development of Europe).|$|R
5|$|By early 1972, {{with the}} {{monument}} to Caroline erected on Codden Hill, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the {{passage through the}} House of Commons of Heath's European Communities Bill, approving the United Kingdom's accession to <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community.</b> The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's second reading, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 Rochdale was won from Labour, {{and in the next}} year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: Sutton, Isle of Ely, Ripon and Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic tensions that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E
40|$|Romania’s {{integration}} into <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Union raised <b>the</b> necessity of adapting Romania’s accounting settlements to <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Directives and <b>the</b> to the International Financial Reporting Standards, {{in order to}} achieve the standardization of working accounting methods. This is accomplished by the transposition into the national legislation of the IVth and of the VIIth Directive of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Communities</b> settled by <b>the</b> Order of the Minister of Public Finances no 1752 / 2005 and the continuation of the gradual implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards, settled by the Order of the Minister of Public Finances no 1121 / 2006. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{founding}} {{members of the}} EFTA were: Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. During the 1960s, these countries were {{often referred to as}} the Outer Seven, as opposed to the Inner Six of <b>the</b> then <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> (EEC).|$|R
5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the floods, the Pan American Health Organization provided $10,000 worth of water supply units {{and a group}} of six workers, and offices within the United Nations provided $55,000 worth of contributions. The government of Barbados provided five units to assist in vector control, and the United States donated $25,000 in aid. <b>The</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> donated about $376,300 in assistance. The government of Canada provided $142,490 worth of aid, and the government of West Germany donated $21,740. The British Red Cross and the United Kingdom government collectively donated $302,850 to the country, mostly for 3helicopters to transport relief and medical teams. The California Air National Guard flew three trips of supplies, including 2,000cots, to Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1992, Croatia gained {{diplomatic}} recognition by <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> members, and subsequently the United Nations. The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory by Croatia. This {{was accompanied by}} the exodus of about 200,000 Serbs from the rebel territories, whose lands were subsequently settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The remaining occupied areas were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995, with the process concluded in January 1998. Croatia became a World Trade Organization (WTO) member on 30 November 2000. The country signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union in October 2001. Croatia {{became a member of}} NATO on 1 April 2009, and joined the European Union on 1 July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Since the 20th century {{there has}} been {{significant}} population movement to England, mostly {{from other parts of}} the British Isles, but also from the Commonwealth, particularly the Indian subcontinent. Since the 1970s {{there has been}} a large move away from manufacturing and an increasing emphasis on the service industry. As part of the United Kingdom, the area joined a common market initiative called <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> which became the European Union. Since the late 20th century the administration of the United Kingdom has moved towards devolved governance in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England and Wales continues to exist as a jurisdiction within the United Kingdom. Devolution has stimulated a greater emphasis on a more English-specific identity and patriotism. There is no devolved English government, but an attempt to create a similar system on a sub-regional basis was rejected by referendum.|$|E
50|$|Economics Minister Karl Schiller (SPD) had {{proposed}} revaluing (increasing the external value of) the Deutsche Mark, West Germany's currency, {{to reduce the}} country's inflation rate {{and the rate of}} growth of the country's businesses' income. He also wanted to reduce West Germany's economic dependence on the exports. However, his counterpart Finance Minister Franz-Josef Strauss (CSU) rejected the Deutsche Mark's revaluation, because his strong supporters, the Bavarian farmers, also opposed it. After all, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community's</b> foodstuffs prices were paid in US dollars, and the Deutsche Mark's revaluation would have made them less favourable for the West German farmers (i.e. more expensive for other Western Europeans to buy).|$|R
