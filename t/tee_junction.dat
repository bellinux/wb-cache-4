Its south end is separated from the A4055 Cardiff-Barry main road via Palmerston Road, (sic) a <b>tee</b> <b>junction</b> with the A4055 {{and access to the}} original part of Palmerston's housing is via a narrow railway bridge over the Barry-Cardiff railway line and lies north-west of the former Biglis Junction which was a short distance from the so-called [...] "Palmerston Bridge". Immediately south-east of the railway line lies a Waitrose supermarket and fuel station which took over the former Safeway business in 2004 and prior to that, the site housed J.Feltz, Sidroy Mills lingerie factory. Separated from the area and south east of the railway is Tŷ Verlon trading estate. Schools and other establishments within its boundary do not include the letter 'w' in the name, as is the case shown for the inset picture header on this webpage. Palmerston includes the local Glenbrook Inn established in 1982 and {{to the west of the}} suburb was the colloquially named “Penny ha’penny” footbridge, which being about 550 feet long, linked Palmerston with the Coldbrook area of Cadoxton. It bridged 39 railway sidings known in railway terms as “Cadoxton North Sidings” and following the complete closure of the Cadoxton-Pontypridd/Penrhos Railway line after 1963, it survived for a while after all the railway sidings were lifted. An extensive housing estate now sits on the sidings area. Palmerston's northern flank is skirted by the A4231 Docks Link road. The accompanying inset picture shows the chimney and turbine & generating building housing a gas-fired 230MW power plant built by September 1998 and accessed from the Sully Moors road about a mile south-east of Palmerston. It lies on land previously occupied by the Supplies Reserve Depôt (SRD) and later, plastics plant.

Piping branch junctions and nozzle attachments to main pressure vessels are common engineering components used in the power, oil and gas, and shipbuilding industries amongst others. These components are usually fabricated by multipass welding. The latter process is known to induce residual stresses at the fabrication stage, which can have severe adverse effects on the in-service behavior of such critical components. It is thus desirable if the distributions of residual stresses can be predicted well in advance of welding execution. This paper presents a comprehensive study of three dimensional residual stress distributions in a stainless steel <b>tee</b> branch <b>junction</b> during a multipass welding process. A full three dimensional thermomechanical finite element model has been developed for this purpose. A newly developed meshing technique has been used to model the complex intersection areas of the welded junction with all hexahedral elements.
