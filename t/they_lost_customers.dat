50|$|Result: Revolution set {{up their}} pitch in Covent Garden, while Instinct sold from Whitecross Street Market. Revolution decided to {{identify}} and price their cheese {{before going to the}} market, resulting in them arriving later than planned. However, on arrival, sales picked up quickly and all the girls sold hard, particularly Zoe, who was criticised for being selfish and taking many of the sales herself. By contrast, Instinct arrived at the market earlier, but spent so long identifying and pricing the cheese that <b>they</b> <b>lost</b> many <b>customers.</b> Tim created some ready-made lunches which proved popular, but only made a small number of them. The boys made very few sales on the stall and later had to resort to selling the rest of the cheese in bulk at massively reduced prices. In the boardroom, Instinct made a loss of £210.01 and Revolution made a profit of £143.88.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} {{years there has been}} an {{increased}} interest in regaining <b>lost</b> <b>customers,</b> both in practice and science. Causes for this interest are eminent defection rates of 25 percent, higher acquisition costs for new customers and the question which customer characteristics enhance the renewing of a relationship (Reichheld and Sasser 1990; Griffin and Lowenstein 2001). Em-pirical studies show that recapturing <b>lost</b> <b>customers</b> can generate significant financial value (e. g., Thomas et al. 2004). Regained customers are, as compared to loyal clients, often charac-terized by lower price sensitivity, higher sales and a longer post-reacquisition relationship with the firm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For the {{stationary}} loss systems M/M/m/K and GI/M/m/K, {{we study}} two quantities: {{the number of}} <b>lost</b> <b>customers</b> during the time interval (0, t] (the first system only), {{and the number of}} <b>lost</b> <b>customers</b> among the first n customers to arrive (both systems). We derive explicit bounds for the total variation distances between the distributions of these quantities and compound Poisson-geometric distributions. The bounds are small in the light traffic case, i. e., when the loss of a customer is a “rare ” event. To prove our results, we show that the studied quantities can be interpreted as accumulated rewards of stationary renewal reward processes, embedded into the queue length process or the process of queue lengths immediately before arrivals of new customers, and apply general results by Erhardsson on compound Poisson approximation for renewal reward processes. 1...|$|R

The optimum value of the control variable is also obtained so as to minimize the total cost to the system due to the waiting taxis and <b>lost</b> <b>customers.</b> ...|$|R
