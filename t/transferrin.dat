5|$|In blood plasma, zinc {{is bound}} to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and <b>transferrin</b> (10%). Because <b>transferrin</b> also {{transports}} iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.|$|E
5|$|When cranial CSF leak is {{suspected}} because of {{discharge from the}} nose or ear that is potentially CSF, the fluid can be collected and tested with a beta-2 <b>transferrin</b> assay. This test can positively identify if the fluid is cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{contribute to}} antioxidant defense by chelating transition metals and {{preventing them from}} catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important {{is the ability to}} sequester iron, which is the function of iron-binding proteins such as <b>transferrin</b> and ferritin. Selenium and zinc are commonly referred to as antioxidant nutrients, but these chemical elements have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. <b>Transferrin</b> does not belong to either of these classes.|$|E
5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of <b>transferrin</b> to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
25|$|Serum <b>transferrin</b> and <b>transferrin</b> {{saturation}} {{are commonly}} used as screening for haemochromatosis. <b>Transferrin</b> binds iron and is responsible for iron transport in the blood. Measuring <b>transferrin</b> provides a crude measure of iron stores in the body. Fasting <b>transferrin</b> saturation values in excess of 45% for males or 35% in premenopausal women (i.e. 300ng/L in males and 200ng/L in females) are recognized as a threshold for further evaluation of haemochromatosis. <b>Transferrin</b> saturation greater than 62% is suggestive of homozygosity for mutations in the HFE gene.|$|E
25|$|Most cell types take up iron {{primarily}} through receptor-mediated endocytosis via <b>transferrin</b> receptor 1 (TFR1), <b>transferrin</b> receptor 2 (TFR2) and GAPDH. TFR1 has a 30-fold higher affinity for transferrin-bound iron than TFR2 {{and thus is}} the main player in this process. The higher order multifunctional glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) also acts as a <b>transferrin</b> receptor. Transferrin-bound ferric iron is recognized by these <b>transferrin</b> receptors, triggering a conformational change that causes endocytosis. Iron then enters the cytoplasm from the endosome via importer DMT1 after being reduced to its ferrous state by a STEAP family reductase.|$|E
25|$|Protein encoded by {{this gene}} is a {{membrane}} protein {{that is similar}} to MHC class I-type proteins and associates with beta-2 microglobulin (beta2M). It is thought that this protein functions to regulate circulating iron uptake by regulating the interaction of the <b>transferrin</b> receptor with <b>transferrin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the {{regulation}} of iron metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how haemochromatosis operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the HFE gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of <b>transferrin,</b> which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. <b>Transferrin</b> levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of <b>transferrin</b> from the liver). When <b>transferrin</b> is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong <b>transferrin</b> signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE {{is only part of}} the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.|$|E
25|$|Also {{increased}} levels of lactoferrin and <b>transferrin</b> inhibit bacterial growth by binding iron, an essential nutrient for bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Liver biopsies involve {{taking a}} sample of tissue from the liver, using a thin needle. The amount of iron in the sample is then {{quantified}} and compared to normal, and evidence of liver damage, especially cirrhosis, measured microscopically. Formerly, {{this was the only}} way to confirm a diagnosis of haemochromatosis but measures of <b>transferrin</b> and ferritin along with a history are considered adequate in determining the presence of the malady. Risks of biopsy include bruising, bleeding and infection. Now, when a history and measures of <b>transferrin</b> or ferritin point to haemochromatosis, it is debatable whether a liver biopsy is still necessary to quantify the amount of accumulated iron.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of haemochromatosis is often made following the incidental finding on routine blood screening of elevated serum liver enzymes or {{elevation of the}} <b>transferrin</b> saturation. Arthropathy with stiff joints, diabetes, or fatigue, may be the presenting complaint.|$|E
25|$|Ceruloplasmin is {{the major}} copper-carrying protein in the blood. Ceruloplasmin {{exhibits}} oxidase activity, which is associated with possible oxidation of Fe(II) into Fe(III), therefore assisting in its transport in the blood plasma in association with <b>transferrin,</b> which can carry iron only in the Fe(III) state.|$|E
25|$|Immunoliposomes are antibody-conjugated liposomes. Liposomes {{can carry}} drugs or {{therapeutic}} nucleotides and when conjugated with monoclonal antibodies, may be directed against malignant cells. Immunoliposomes {{have been successfully}} used in vivo to convey tumour-suppressing genes into tumours, using an antibody fragment against the human <b>transferrin</b> receptor. Tissue-specific gene delivery using immunoliposomes has been achieved in brain and breast cancer tissue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transferrin</b> can {{instead be}} removed by size {{exclusion}} chromatography. This method {{is one of}} the more reliable chromatography techniques. Since we are dealing with proteins, properties such as charge and affinity are not consistent and vary with pH as molecules are protonated and deprotonated, while size stays relatively constant. Nonetheless, it has drawbacks such as low resolution, low capacity and low elution times.|$|E
25|$|Historically, CDGs are {{classified}} as Types I and II (CDG-I and CDG-II), depending on the nature and location of the biochemical defect in the metabolic pathway relative to the action of oligosaccharyltransferase. The most commonly used screening method for CDG, analysis of <b>transferrin</b> glycosylation status by isoelectric focusing, ESI-MS, or other techniques, distinguish between these subtypes in so called Type I and Type II patterns.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{toxicity}} {{results when}} {{the amount of}} circulating iron exceeds the amount of <b>transferrin</b> available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet over-consumption rather than variations in diet. The type of acute toxicity from iron ingestion causes severe mucosal damage in the gastrointestinal tract, among other problems.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of blood}} test panels may help in diagnosis. The OVA1 panel {{includes}} CA-125, beta-2 microglobulin, <b>transferrin,</b> apolipoprotein A1, and transthyretin. OVA1 above 5.0 in premenopausal people and 4.4 in postmenopausal people indicates {{a high risk}} for cancer. A different set of laboratory tests is used for detecting sex cord-stromal tumors. High levels of testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, combined with other symptoms {{and high levels of}} inhibin A and inhibin B can be indicative of an SCST of any type.|$|E
25|$|In medicine, {{nutritional}} status {{can be assessed}} by measuring the concentration of transthyretin in the blood. In theory, other transport proteins such as albumin or <b>transferrin</b> could be used, but transthyretin is preferred because of its shorter half-life, although this means that its concentration more closely reflects recent dietary intake rather than overall {{nutritional status}}. Transthyretin concentration {{has been shown to}} be a good indicator of whether or not a malnourished patient will develop refeeding syndrome upon commencement of refeeding, via either the enteral, parenteral or oral routes.|$|E
25|$|The European Food Safety Authority {{concluded}} that chromium {{is not an}} essential nutrient, making this the only mineral for which the United States and the European Union disagree. The proposed mechanism for cellular uptake of CrIII via <b>transferrin</b> has been called into question. There is no proof that chromium supplementation has physiological effects on body mass or composition, and its use as a supplement may be unsafe. A 2014 systematic review {{concluded that}} chromium supplementation {{had no effect on}} glycemic control, fasting plasma glucose levels, or body weight in people with or without diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hospitals}} use the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) protocol {{in order}} to assess the level of withdrawal present and therefore the amount of medication needed. When overuse of alcohol is suspected but drinking history is unclear, testing for elevated values of carbohydrate-deficient <b>transferrin</b> or gammaglutamyl transferase can help make the diagnosis of alcohol overuse and dependence more clear. The CIWA has also been shortened (now called the CIWA-Ar), while retaining its validity and reliability, to help assess patients more efficiently due to the life-threatening nature of alcohol withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|Total {{body iron}} averages {{approximately}} 3.8 g {{in men and}} 2.3 g in women. In blood plasma, iron is carried tightly bound to the protein <b>transferrin.</b> There are several mechanisms that control human iron metabolism and safeguard against iron deficiency. The main regulatory mechanism is situated in the gastrointestinal tract. When loss of iron is not sufficiently compensated by adequate intake of iron from the diet, a state of iron deficiency develops over time. When this state is uncorrected, it leads to iron deficiency anemia. Before anemia occurs, the medical condition of Iron Deficiency without anemia is called Latent Iron Deficiency (LID) or Iron-deficient erythropoiesis (IDE).|$|E
25|$|CPV2 is a non-enveloped {{single-stranded}} DNA virus. The {{name comes}} from the Latin parvus, meaning small, as the virus is only 20 to 26 nm in diameter. It has an icosahedral symmetry. The genome is about 5000 nucleotides long. CPV2 continues to evolve, {{and the success of}} new strains seems to depend on extending the range of hosts affected and improved binding to its receptor, the canine <b>transferrin</b> receptor. CPV2 has a high rate of evolution, possibly due to a rate of nucleotide substitution that is more like RNA viruses such as Influenzavirus A. In contrast, FPV seems to evolve only through random genetic drift.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{experiments}} in the 1920s seemed {{to show that the}} blood–brain barrier (BBB) was still immature in newborns. The reason for this mistake was an error in methodology (the osmotic pressure was too high and the delicate embryonal capillary vessels were partially damaged). It was later shown in experiments with a reduced volume of the injected liquids that the markers under investigation could not pass the BBB. It was reported that those natural substances such as albumin, α-1-fetoprotein or <b>transferrin</b> with elevated plasma concentration in the newborn could not be detected outside of cells in the brain. The transporter P-glycoprotein exists already in the embryonal endothelium.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{overload}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of chronic transfusion therapy, necessary {{for patients with}} beta thalassemia. Iron chelation is a medical therapy that avoids the complications of iron overload. The iron overload can be removed by Deferasirox, an oral iron chelator, which has a dose- dependent effect on iron burden. Every unit of transfused blood contains 200–250mg of iron and the body has no natural mechanism to remove excess iron Deferasirox is a vital part in the patients health after blood transfusions. During normal iron homeostasis the circulating iron is bound to <b>transferrin,</b> but with an iron overload, the ability for <b>transferrin</b> to bind iron is exceeded and non-transferrin bound iron is formed. It represents a potentially toxic iron form due to its high propensity to induce oxygen species and is responsible for cellular damage. The prevention of iron overload protects patients from morbidity and mortality. The primary aim is to bind to and remove iron from the body and a rate equal to the rate of transfusional iron input or greater than iron input. During clinical trails patients that received Deferasirox experienced no drug-related neutropenia or agranulocytosis, which was present with other iron chelators. Its long half life requires it to be taken once daily and provides constant chelation. Cardiac failure is a main cause of illness from transfusional iron overload but deferasirox demonstrated the ability to remove iron from iron-loaded myocardial cells protecting beta thalassemia patients from effects of required blood transfusions.|$|E
25|$|Abdominal pain due to hypersplenism and splenic {{infarction}} and right-upper quadrant pain {{caused by}} gallstones are major clinical manifestations. However, diagnosing thalassemiæ from symptoms alone is inadequate. Physicians note these signs as associative {{due to this}} disease's complexity. The following associative signs can attest to {{the severity of the}} phenotype: pallor, poor growth, inadequate food intake, splenomegaly, jaundice, maxillary hyperplasia, dental malocclusion, cholelithiasis, systolic ejection murmur in the presence of severe anemia and pathologic fractures. Based on symptoms, tests are ordered for a differential diagnosis. These tests include complete blood count; hemoglobin electrophoresis; serum <b>transferrin,</b> ferritin, total iron-binding capacity; urine urobilin and urobilogen; peripheral blood smear, which may show codocytes, or target cells; hematocrit; and serum bilirubin.|$|E
25|$|Aceruloplasminemia {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} (a five-base pair insertion in exon 7) in the CP gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called ceruloplasmin, a protein involved in iron transport and processing. Ceruloplasmin helps move iron from the organs and tissues of the body and prepares it for incorporation into a molecule called <b>transferrin,</b> which transports it to red blood cells to help carry oxygen. The CP gene mutation results in the production of ceruloplasmin protein that is unstable or nonfunctional by altering the open reading frame such that the amino acid ligands in the essential carboxyl terminal region are eliminated. When ceruloplasmin is unavailable, transport of iron out of the body's tissues is impaired. The resulting iron accumulation damages cells in those tissues, leading to neurological dysfunction and other health problems.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to a systemic bacterial infection, the immune system initiates {{a process known as}} iron withholding. If bacteria are to survive, then they must obtain iron from their environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called siderophores and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and <b>transferrin.</b> The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a metabolic price they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against most bacterial infections; there are some exceptions however. TB causing bacterium can reside within macrophages which are an iron rich environment and Borrelia burgdorferi utilises manganese in place of iron. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with hemochromatosis, are more susceptible to some bacterial infection.|$|E
25|$|Most of the charged {{impurities}} {{are usually}} anions such as nucleic acids and endotoxins. These can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Either cation exchange chromatography is used {{at a low}} enough pH that the desired antibody binds to the column while anions flow through, or anion exchange chromatography is used at a high enough pH that the desired antibody flows through the column while anions bind to it. Various proteins can also be separated along with the anions based on their isoelectric point (pI). In proteins, the isoelectric point (pI) {{is defined as the}} pH at which a protein has no net charge. When the pH > pI, a protein has a net negative charge and when the pH < pI, a protein has a net positive charge. For example, albumin has a pI of 4.8, which is significantly lower than that of most monoclonal antibodies, which have a pI of 6.1. Thus, at a pH between 4.8 and 6.1, the average charge of albumin molecules is likely to be more negative, while mAbs molecules are positively charged and hence it is possible to separate them. <b>Transferrin,</b> on the other hand, has a pI of 5.9, so it cannot be easily separated by this method. A difference in pI of at least 1 is necessary for a good separation.|$|E
500|$|After uptake {{in human}} cells, iron storage is {{carefully}} regulated; iron ions are never [...] "free". This is because free iron ions {{have a high}} potential for biological toxicity. A major component of this regulation is the protein <b>transferrin,</b> which binds iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells. <b>Transferrin</b> contains Fe3+ {{in the middle of}} a distorted octahedron, bonded to one nitrogen, three oxygens and a chelating carbonate anion that traps the Fe3+ ion: it has such a high stability constant that it is very effective at taking up Fe3+ ions even from the most stable complexes. At the bone marrow, <b>transferrin</b> is reduced from Fe3+ and Fe2+ and stored as ferritin to be incorporated into hemoglobin.|$|E
500|$|CSF can leak {{from the}} dura {{as a result}} of {{different}} causes such as physical trauma or a lumbar puncture, or from no known cause when it is termed spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak. It is usually associated with intracranial hypotension: low CSF pressure. It can cause headaches, made worse by standing, moving and coughing, as the low CSF pressure causes the brain to [...] "sag" [...] downwards and put pressure on its lower structures. If a leak is identified, a beta-2 <b>transferrin</b> test of the leaking fluid, when positive, is highly specific and sensitive for the detection for CSF leakage. Medical imaging such as CT scans and MRI scans can be used to investigate for a presumed CSF leak when no obvious leak is found but low CSF pressure is identified. Caffeine, given either orally or intravenously, often offers symptomatic relief. Treatment of an identified leak may include injection of a person's blood into the epidural space (an epidural blood patch), spinal surgery, or fibrin glue.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{specific}} elements from the lanthanide group that has been tested and used is cerium (Ce). There have been studies that use a protein-cerium complex to observe the effect of cerium on the cancer cells. The hope was to inhibit cell proliferation and promote cytotoxicity. <b>Transferrin</b> receptors in cancer cells, {{such as those in}} breast cancer cells and epithelial cervical cells, promote the cell proliferation and malignancy of the cancer. <b>Transferrin</b> is a protein used to transport iron into the cells and is needed to aid the cancer cells in DNA replication. [...] <b>Transferrin</b> acts as a growth factor for the cancerous cells and is dependent on iron. Cancer cells have much higher levels of <b>transferrin</b> receptors than normal cells and are very dependent on iron for their proliferation. Cerium has shown results as an anti-cancer agent due to its similarities in structure and biochemistry to iron. [...] Cerium may bind in the place of iron on to the <b>transferrin</b> and then be brought into the cancer cells by transferrin-receptor mediated endocytosis. The cerium binding to the <b>transferrin</b> in place of the iron inhibits the <b>transferrin</b> activity in the cell. This creates a toxic environment for the cancer cells and causes a decrease in cell growth. This is the proposed mechanism for cerium’s effect on cancer cells, though the real mechanism may be more complex in how cerium inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Specifically in HeLa cancer cells studied in vitro, cell viability was decreased after 48 to 72 hours of cerium treatments. Cells treated with just cerium had decreases in cell viability, but cells treated with both cerium and <b>transferrin</b> had more significant inhibition for cellular activity.|$|E

2500|$|Ferritin and <b>transferrin</b> saturation: {{markers of}} iron {{overload}} as in hemochromatosis, copper and ceruloplasmin: markers of copper overload as in Wilson's disease ...|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{diagnostic}} measures for haemochromatosis, <b>transferrin</b> saturation and ferritin tests, {{are not a}} part of routine medical testing. [...] Screening for haemochromatosis is recommended if the patient has a parent, child or sibling with the disease.|$|E
2500|$|Iron {{is needed}} for {{bacterial}} growth making its bioavailability {{an important factor in}} controlling infection. Blood plasma as a result carries iron tightly bound to <b>transferrin,</b> which is taken up by cells by endocytosing <b>transferrin,</b> thus preventing its access to bacteria. Between 15 and 20 percent of the protein content in human milk consists of lactoferrin that binds iron. As a comparison, in cow's milk, this is only 2 percent. As a result, breast fed babies have fewer infections. Lactoferrin is also concentrated in tears, saliva and at wounds to bind iron to limit bacterial growth. [...] Egg white contains 12% conalbumin to withhold it from bacteria that get through the egg shell (for this reason, prior to antibiotics, egg white was used to treat infections).|$|E
