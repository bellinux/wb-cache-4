5|$|Istanbul University, {{founded in}} 1453, {{is the oldest}} Turkish {{educational}} institution in the city. Although originally an Islamic school, the university established law, medicine, and science departments in the 19th century and was secularized after {{the founding of the}} Turkish Republic. Istanbul Technical University, founded in 1773, is the world's third-oldest university dedicated entirely to engineering sciences. <b>These</b> <b>public</b> universities are two of just eight across the city; other prominent state universities in Istanbul include the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, which served as Turkey's primary institution of art until the 1970s, and Marmara University, the country's third-largest institution of higher learning.|$|E
5|$|Chariot {{racing in}} the Byzantine Empire also {{included}} the Roman racing clubs, which {{continued to play}} {{a prominent role in}} <b>these</b> <b>public</b> exhibitions. By this time, the Blues (Vénetoi) and the Greens (Prásinoi) had come to overshadow the other two factions of the Whites (Leukoí) and Reds (Roúsioi), while still maintaining the paired alliances, although these were now fixed as Blue and White vs. Green and Red. These circus factions were no longer the private businesses they were during the Roman Empire. Instead, the races began to be given regular, public funding, putting them under imperial control. Running the chariot races at public expense was probably a cost-cutting and labor-reducing measure, making it easier to channel the proper funds into the racing organizations. The Emperor himself belonged to one of the four factions, and supported the interests of either the Blues or the Greens.|$|E
40|$|Communication and the {{way this}} {{communication}} process is perceived by different publics {{is part of the}} public-science relationship. This article presents qualitative data with respect to biotechnology and genomics communication and identifies similarities and differences among publics in various roles. Focus group discussions were conducted with members of the general public, active consumers, patients, and genomics experts in the Netherlands. The analysis demonstrated that <b>these</b> <b>publics</b> prefer varied communication approaches that depend on their particular roles, with varying possibilities of participation. In all cases, transparency and openness as basic communication elements have to be fulfilled to gain trust from <b>these</b> <b>publics...</b>|$|R
40|$|This chapter explores how the publics of {{contemporary}} participative experiments are engaged and enrolled into forms of public action. To do this the chapter reflects on and compares a local governmental, a social movement and a popular media event. Rather than {{assuming that the}} <b>publics</b> of <b>these</b> participative experiments already existed, the chapter considers the range of ways that <b>these</b> <b>publics</b> were convened and how <b>these</b> <b>publics</b> interacted in <b>these</b> settings. It shows how the apparently 'new' <b>publics</b> of <b>these</b> experiments were called up by invoking various pre-existing norms of public action and begins to consider how these mediated forms of public action might be conceptualised...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>these</b> <b>public</b> prayers, {{there are also}} private prayers prescribed for both monastics and laypersons; in some monasteries, however, these are read in church.

40|$|Based on {{a survey}} of 2, 000 persons {{conducted}} in 2009 in the PACA region (Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur), {{the aim of this}} survey is to highlight the existence of different types of public (mostly exclusive) concerned by energy issues: one of <b>these</b> <b>publics</b> is interested in a global issue (climate change) and another is concerned with electricity-supply problems in the PACA region, thus making energy a local issue. The study shows that <b>these</b> two <b>publics,</b> although they differ from territorial and ideological standpoints, have in common that they belong to the more affluent, educated and politically-minded social strata. In particular, they are more aware {{than the rest of the}} population of energy-saving issues in the PACA region. They therefore declare a greater number of thrifty behaviours (demand-side management (DSM) actions and/or investment). In accordance with works comparing consumer attitudes (Beck, 1986; Dozzi, Wallenborn & Lennert, 2008), there is little or no connection between electricity consumption and the fact of belonging to a concerned public. Whilst there are no direct links between individual preferences and practices, the latter being mediated by past individual choices and infrastructures, collective preferences can sustainably configure new practices. One interesting avenue of research would be to analyse how <b>these</b> <b>publics</b> appropriate proposals for public energy policies, and pricing policies in particular: price flexibility in terms of supply and demand, carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, places of production or consumption volume (block tariffs) ...|$|R

25|$|Most of <b>these</b> <b>public</b> health {{concerns}} {{have focused on}} children who are infected with hookworm.

25|$|However, <b>these</b> <b>public</b> {{reactions}} {{have been}} criticized for embodying white feminism because they do not take into account intersectionality and the increased obstacles that women of color face.
