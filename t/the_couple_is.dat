Before he can do so, however, the train on which <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> travelling is suddenly wrecked.

5|$|The two {{contestant}}s {{then open}} their largest pieces of baggage and reveal the secrets they contain. Each contestant makes one final statement, {{and the main}} contestant eliminates a second contestant. The main contestant's own baggage is then opened and the contents revealed to the remaining contestant. If the contestant accepts the secret belonging to the central character, <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> given an expense-covered evening together. However, if the contestant can not accept the secret, the pair part ways.|$|E
5|$|With {{her right}} leg held {{straight}} and her left leg bent a little (the pratyalidha stance), Chhinnamasta stands in a fighting posture on the love-deity couple of Kamadeva (Kama)– a symbol of sexual lust– and his wife Rati, who are engaged in copulation with the latter usually on the top (viparita-rati sex position). Kamadeva is generally blue-complexioned, while Rati is white. Below <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> a lotus with an inverted triangle, and in the background is a cremation ground. The Chhinnamasta Tantra describes the goddess sitting on the couple, rather than standing on them. Sometimes, Kamadeva-Rati is replaced by the divine couple of Krishna and Radha. The lotus beneath <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> sometimes replaced by a cremation pyre. The coupling couple is sometimes omitted entirely. Sometimes Shiva– the goddess's consort– is depicted lying beneath Chhinnamasta, who is seated squatting on him and copulating with him. Dogs or jackals drinking the blood sometimes appear in the scene. Sometimes Chhinnamasta is depicted standing on a lotus, a grass patch, or the ground.|$|E
5|$|At the Acme factory, Doom {{reveals his}} plot to destroy Toontown {{with a giant}} machine loaded with dip to build a freeway, the only way past Toontown since Cloverleaf has bought out Los Angeles' tram system. Roger unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to save Jessica, and <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> tied onto a hook {{in front of the}} machine's hose. Valiant then performs a comedic vaudeville act, causing the weasels to die of laughter; Valiant kicks their leader, Smart Ass, into the machine's Dip vat, killing him instantly. Valiant then fights Doom, who is eventually flattened by a steamroller, but survives. Eddie is shocked when Doom reveals that he is the toon who killed Teddy. Valiant uses a toon mallet with a spring-loaded boxing glove and fires it at a switch that causes the machine to empty its dip onto Doom, dissolving him.|$|E
5000|$|If most {{figures are}} danced around the set, {{with one or}} more <b>couples</b> visiting <b>the</b> others in turn, <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> <b>are</b> {{likewise}} numbered around the set. In 17th century England they were numbered clockwise, with <b>the</b> second <b>couple</b> to <b>the</b> first <b>couple's</b> left. In most present-day American square dance traditions, <b>the</b> <b>couples</b> <b>are</b> numbered counterclockwise: <b>the</b> second <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> to <b>the</b> first <b>couple's</b> right, <b>the</b> third <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> across from <b>the</b> first, and <b>the</b> fourth <b>couple</b> <b>is</b> to <b>the</b> left of the first.

5|$|The video {{consists}} of multiple scenes with Carey and (now husband) Cannon, who plays her love interest. This is shown along with various behind-the-scenes footage of Carey at various promotional {{events in the}} United Kingdom. The video begins with grainy footage of a plane landing in the Bahamas, with Carey and Cannon exiting the aircraft with her dog.
