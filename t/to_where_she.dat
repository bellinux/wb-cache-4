500|$|The {{elevation}} of the Mouzalones {{was not only a}} mark of personal affection or favour, but also in line with Theodore's policies, which aimed to curb the influence and independence of the powerful nobility. The appointment of low-born [...] "new men" [...] to such high posts, and Theodore's often harsh and arbitrary treatment of the nobles, aroused the ire of the traditional aristocracy, and especially the capable and ambitious Michael Palaiologos. The aristocrats' hostility was further intensified when the emperor gave his low-born favourites noble brides: George Mouzalon wedded Theodora Kantakouzene, a niece of Michael Palaiologos, and Andronikos married a daughter of the former protovestiarios Alexios Raoul. After Mouzalon's murder, Theodora would marry the protovestiarios John Raoul Petraliphas (in 1261). A staunch opponent of her uncle's unionist religious policies, she was exiled and became a nun. After Michael's death, she restored the monastery of Saint Andrew in Krisei, <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> transferred the relics of Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos, and was a prominent member of the capital's literary circles.|$|E

500|$|Despite her {{crimes and}} faults, Global TV {{describes}} Sharon {{as a central}} heroine who has endured many challenges to get <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> is. She is considered a fan favorite on the soap opera, but also a [...] "love-her-or-hate-her character", and has divided viewer opinions. In an early observation of the character, Kathleen Sloan of the Toronto Star noted that Sharon's [...] "angelic demeanor" [...] could mask a [...] "devil in disguise". Tommy Garrett of Canyon News describes Sharon as an [...] "ever-suffering heroine, who can't find a break in life", stating that she has [...] "faced it all". In 2009, Luke Kerr of Daytime Confidential noted that all of Sharon's love interests—including Jack, Brad and Nicholas—"seem to think" [...] that she is [...] "the perfect woman". Jamey Giddens (also from Daytime Confidential) described her as soap operas' [...] "hottest mess". Case herself opined that Sharon was a damsel in distress and [...] "wasn't very colorful", {{which is why the}} writers chose to have her do [...] "bad things" [...] over the years. Former head writer Charles Pratt, Jr. likened Sharon's story to The Perils of Pauline (1914).|$|E
500|$|According to Woolverton, {{the story}} team {{challenged}} nearly every line of dialogue Woolverton suggested for the character. On one occasion, the story artists re-wrote what Woolverton had originally scripted as Belle using a map to indicate places <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> {{would like to}} travel to the character baking a cake. Arguing that the liberated Belle would not even know how to bake, Woolverton decided to compromise by having the character read a book instead, which was similarly debated because some filmmakers considered reading to be too passive an activity. To resolve this, Woolverton scripted Belle walk while reading, an activity in which Woolverton herself partook as a child. In Beaumont's fairy tale, Belle is essentially forced to replace her father as the Beast's prisoner. To make the character more independent, Woolverton re-wrote her so that she willingly ventures into the woods in search of her father, bravely confronts the Beast and ultimately trades her own freedom in return for Maurice's instead. During Gaston's climactic fight with the Beast, the character's line [...] "Time to die!" [...] was changed to [...] "Belle is mine!" [...] in order to return the focus of the story to Belle.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{are related to}} third-wave {{feminism}} and self-empowerment. It confronts society's standards and stereotypes with regard to female beauty. The song opens with a recorded snippet of a beauty pageant judge questioning Beyoncé on her life aspirations, to which she replies, [...] "My aspiration in life would be... to be happy". The sample is used to frame the song {{in the context of}} the singer's childhood. According to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, the snippets were used to question the singer's [...] "drive and desire that's got her <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> is today, and whether the struggle was entirely worth it". The song then transcends into a depiction of Beyoncé as a beauty pageant contest awaiting judgment in the lyrics, [...] "Mama said, 'You're a pretty girl, what's in your head, it doesn't matter. Brush your hair, fix your teeth. What you wear is all that matters". The second verse of [...] "Pretty Hurts"—"Blonder hair, flat chest/ TV says bigger is better/ South Beach, sugar free/ Vogue says thinner is better"—serve as an analysis of female body image and society's obsession with physical perfection.|$|E
