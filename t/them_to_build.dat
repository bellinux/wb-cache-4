Though Lincoln Cathedral is architecturally a closer match to the Abbey, they preferred Ely, a favoured filming location. Its size allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> sets showing not just the coronation, but the preparations before it.|$|E

Lots there, at the time, ran {{all the way to}} the river's waterline, giving their owners the unusual advantage of river and street frontage. The sloping bluff also allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> multi-story warehouses and granaries closer to the unloading points along the river.|$|E

To build out its base of partners who create applications on the Watson platform, IBM consults with a network of venture capital firms, which advise IBM on which of their portfolio companies may be a logical fit for what IBM calls the Watson Ecosystem. Thus far, roughly 800 organizations and individuals have signed up with IBM, with interest in creating applications that could use the Watson platform.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, octopuses can {{be readily}} trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They {{have been reported to}} practise observational learning, although the validity of these findings is contested. Octopuses have also been observed in what has been described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food. They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs. The veined octopus collects discarded coconut shells, then uses <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a shelter, an example of tool use.|$|E
5|$|Stratton wrote Social Psychology for International Conduct {{for social}} science {{teachers}} {{who wanted to}} use psychology to analyze international affairs. The book's first part evaluated races. Stratton concluded the Caucasoid and Mongoloid races were innately more intelligent enabling <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> strong cultures. He also stated the prejudice of other people was from {{the social and political}} advantages it brought. Stratton saw nations as made up of individuals and possessing a national character similar to what individuals had. Reviewing the book in the American Journal of Sociology, Ellsworth Faris objected to the author concluding the Northern and Central Europeans were more intelligent than Southern and Eastern Europeans, noting intelligence measures correlated also with length of stay in America.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese general, {{convinced}} of the impossibility of taking Badajoz by assault, changed his strategy and began a circumvallation of the town, {{in order to try}} to isolate it completely. The Spanish, meanwhile, were reinforcing their own defensive fortifications with extensive works, mainly ravelins built between the medieval towers. Various outlying forts were also strengthened with the aim of obstructing the Portuguese works and forcing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a larger circumvallation line. One of these forts was San Miguel, a star fort able to accommodate 600 infantry, built around a hermitage. It had five earthen bulwarks and an artillery-proof parapet.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades {{served as}} a {{military}} adviser to Sparta and helped the Spartans secure several crucial successes. He advised <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a permanent fort at Decelea, just over ten miles (16km) from Athens and {{within sight of the}} city. By doing this, the Spartans cut the Athenians off entirely from their homes and crops and the silver mines of Sunium. This was part of Alcibiades's plan to renew the war with Athens in Attica. The move was devastating to Athens and forced the citizens to live within the long walls of the city year round, making them entirely dependent on their seaborne trade for food. Seeing Athens thus beleaguered on a second front, members of the Delian League began to contemplate revolt. In the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in Sicily, Alcibiades sailed to Ionia with a Spartan fleet and succeeded in persuading several critical cities to revolt.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-community, having seen the {{benefits}} to the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With Redemption, they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that would more easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little prior knowledge of it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine. Several designers were trained to use Java to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Aguayo {{returned}} to Mexico, the new viceroy of New Spain, Juan de Acuña, marqués de Casafuerte, {{was ordered to}} cut costs accrued {{for the defense of}} {{the northern part of the}} territory. Acuña appointed Colonel Pedro de Rivera y Villalón to inspect the entire northern frontier. Beginning in what is now California in November 1724, Rivera spent the next three years inspecting the northern frontier, reaching San Antonio in August 1727. His reports of Los Adaes, Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto, and the presidio at San Antonio were favorable, but he was unimpressed with Presidio de los Tejas, whose 25soldiers were guarding empty missions. The native population had refused to congregate into communities around the missions and refused baptism unless they were on the brink of death. Because the Indians were well-armed, the Franciscans were unable to compel them to join the missions. The frustrated missionaries finally petitioned the Spanish government for 50soldiers to burn the Indians' houses of worship and force <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> homes near the missions. No troops were forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|Though the Halifax {{area was}} settled by aboriginals, {{particularly}} the Mi'kmaq people, {{as early as}} 7000 BC, there is no archaeological evidence of native habitation on Melville Island prior {{to the arrival of}} the Europeans. The first Europeans to reach the land were likely French traders and missionaries in the 17th century. Halifax was founded by the British in 1749. The first documented use of Melville Island was by Robert Cowie and John Aubony, who obtained a Crown grant in 1752 to allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a storehouse. After Cowie's death in 1781, John Butler Kelly purchased what was then known as Cowie's Island and quickly resold it in 1784 to James Kavanagh, the head of a prosperous family fishery, for £65. Kavanagh used the land, known as Kavanagh's Island according to the then-prevalent tradition of place naming, to dry and store fish that he would then sell from his Halifax store.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road staged {{its first}} Scottish League match when Hibs joined {{the league in}} 1893. Hibs were only renting Easter Road, which Edinburgh city {{planners}} had designated for future development. This meant the club were unwilling to develop the ground and looked for alternatives. Hibs considered relocating to Aberdeen in 1902, a year before Aberdeen FC was formed by a merger of three local clubs. In 1909, work began on a potential new ground in the Piershill area of Ednburgh, but the North British Railway company won a court order allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a railway line over the ground. No line was ever built, but Hibs' interest in moving to the site was thwarted. The long-term future of Easter Road was only secured in 1922, when the club agreed a 25-year lease on the ground. Two years later, three banks of terraces were raised, while a main stand seating 4,480 people {{was built on the}} west side of the ground. The redeveloped stadium had a capacity of 45,000. The pitch was also moved 40 yards to the east, providing space for the main stand. The slope was reduced to approximately 6 feet as part of this work.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} hard time getting started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints are already in the computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, {{was alarmed}} by this, {{both as a}} matter of principle, since Stephen had {{previously}} agreed in 1135 to respect the freedoms of the church, and more pragmatically because he himself had recently built six castles and had no desire to be treated in the same way. As the papal legate, he summoned the King to appear before an ecclesiastical council to answer for the arrests and seizure of property. Henry asserted the Church's right to investigate and judge all charges against members of the clergy. Stephen sent Aubrey de Vere as his spokesman to the council, who argued that Roger of Salisbury had been arrested not as a bishop, but rather in his role as a baron who had been preparing to change his support to the Empress Matilda. The King was supported by Hugh, Archbishop of Rouen, who challenged the bishops to show how canon law entitled <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> or hold castles. Aubrey threatened that Stephen would complain to the pope that he was being harassed by the English church, and the council let the matter rest following an unsuccessful appeal to Rome. The incident successfully removed any military threat from the bishops, but it may have damaged Stephen's relationship with the senior clergy, and in particular with his brother Henry.|$|E
