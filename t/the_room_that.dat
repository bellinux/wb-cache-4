5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near the back of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> are only used {{when the rest of the}} restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E

25|$|This is {{what the}} Chinese room thought {{experiment}} is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, {{there is no one}} or nothing in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, Milligan played {{games with}} the medium itself. Whole scenes were written in which {{characters}} would leave, close the door behind themselves, yet still be inside the room. Further to this, characters would announce their departure, slam a door, {{but it would be}} another character who had left <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>That</b> character would then beat on the door for re-admittance, the door would open and close and again the wrong character would be locked out.|$|E

Her remains were deemed to be incorrupt in 1955 upon exhumation and were transferred from Peru back to her homeland of Ecuador until 1972 when moved to her village of Nobol.

Curious, the Sister entered the room and saw the back of a nun crying in front of the portrait. When the Sister went to comfort the sobbing nun, she turned and saw there was nothing but darkness where the woman's face should have been. Sightings persisted time and again from a number of different sources.|$|E
500|$|The Alumnae Gymnasium was {{designed}} in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. While Tubby's original designs had called for the building to be constructed from stone, the revised plans he submitted in February 1889 replaced that stone with red brick. The structure stands two stories tall and features on its southwestern corner a rounded tower. Inlaid high into the patterned brickwork of its walls were Diocletian windows which originally served to provide light to the swimming pool while preventing passersby from seeing into the swimming area. The pool itself was lined with marble and fed by an artesian well [...] deep. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> would later become the Aula featured a fireplace adorned with terra cotta and raftered ceilings [...] high. Recent renovations have returned the Aula space to its original state, with visible rafters, terra cotta accents, and hardwood floors.|$|E

Wallace decides not to drop the class on whose test he cheated. Veronica proves that the essay hers was supposedly plagiarized from was posted after she turned in her paper; nevertheless, she still wants to find who framed her. Parker Lee, Veronica, Piz, and Logan (Jason Dohring) bowl and have fun together. When Veronica and Logan get room service, Veronica spots Jeff Ratner and questions him. Parker is romantically interested in Piz, and she tasks Veronica with talking to him about her.

500|$|General Nguyen Van Chuan {{was invited}} to the coup {{headquarters}} by Khiêm after the takeover was complete. He recalled that there were 15–20 Vietnamese officers present along with Khánh and Khiêm, and that many had been placed on leave without pay or removed after Diệm's overthrow. Chuan said that Khánh chaired a meeting, and claimed that Minh's government was [...] "neutralist, pro-Communist and pro-French", and incompetent. He said that the plotters [...] "didn't know what to call the coup d'état {{to make it sound}} all right; it was only a while later that they thought of the term 'rectification'". Wilson was present at the meeting and telephoned Harkins [...] "every five minutes", and Khánh left the meeting early and left Khiêm in charge, saying that he had to meet Harkins. During the meeting, Thieu and Mậu turned up by 08:40 and the atmosphere of the meeting was likened to a triumphant election campaign function on vote-counting night. Before leaving and telling the others he was meeting Harkins, Khánh had announced to the officers in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> he would be heavily dependent on US advice and support.|$|E

Veronica learns that a student, Moe Flater (Andrew McClain), took Parker home the night of the rape. She confronts him, but upon further investigation, she accepts his alibi.

500|$|However, Scott instead {{contacted}} Lindelof {{and asked}} him to review Spaihts's script. Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it. Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the Alien films, such as the Alien creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to Alien, the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series, and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments. Lindelof said, [...] "If the ending to [...] is just going to be <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> John Hurt walks into that's full of [...] eggs , there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end."

This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
