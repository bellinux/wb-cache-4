5|$|Rammed-earth walls {{during this}} time were tapered: the {{thickness}} of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> greatest at the base and decreases steadily with increasing height, as detailed in Li Jie's book.|$|E
5|$|The {{hierarchy}} of <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>is</b> introduced with James Cosmo as commander Jeor Mormont, Peter Vaughan as the blind maester Aemon, Owen Teale as the trainer {{of the new}} recruits Ser Alliser Thorne, and Francis Magee as the recruiter Yoren.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> built during <b>the</b> 12th century. In the 17th century <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt and {{reinforced}} by bastions, ravelins and artillery batteries.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> City <b>Wall</b> of Suzhou (...) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> city <b>wall</b> {{surrounding}} Suzhou city. That {{length of}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> 15,204 metres before 1958.

5000|$|In 1905-06, <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> secured and {{partially}} rebuilt. After {{the tops of}} <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> secured in 1961/63, further restoration finally began in 1986; this has continued sporadically since.|$|R
5|$|The land walls {{stretch from}} Fort Bokar {{in the west}} to the {{detached}} Revelin Fortress in the east. On the landside, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> protected with an additional range of slanted supporting walls as defense against artillery fire, especially against possible Ottoman attacks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Craigmillar Castle is the 14th-century L-plan tower house, built on a rocky outcrop. Wrapped around this is the 15th-century {{courtyard}} wall, with ranges of buildings at the south-east, east, and west. Beyond <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> a lower outer wall, enclosing a broad outer courtyard. This contained gardens and a chapel. Further gardens lay to the south, where {{the outline of a}} fish pond can be seen.|$|E
5|$|Clay {{is usually}} hard and strong when dry, but becomes very soft when it absorbs water. The dry clay helps hold an earth wall together, but if <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> {{directly}} exposed to rain, or to water leaking {{down from the}} roof, it may become saturated and collapse.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} six stages, {{and the area}} behind <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{expanded}} from a small area near Morocco in the north {{to most of the}} western and central part of the country gradually. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> built were: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1887 the City Engineer {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{out of plumb}} by 9 inches (23 cm) in 100 yards (91.4 metres). In consequence, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> stabilised by <b>the</b> addition of eight engaged buttresses.|$|R

5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E
5|$|Some Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against {{inserting}} {{fingers into}} the cracks of the Wall as {{they believe that the}} breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>is</b> located outside the Temple area.|$|E
5|$|The Great Wall of China visible today largely {{dates from}} the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often {{extending}} its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of fascination for foreigners, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> single-skin with exposed studs to {{the east}} and west verandahs. <b>The</b> west <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> lined with 140mm {{horizontal}} beaded tongue and groove boards. <b>The</b> south <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> clad to <b>the</b> exterior with rough sawn beaded tongue and groove boards with joins at the junctions of the stud framing and the internal partitions. <b>The</b> north <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> clad with horizontal beaded tongue and groove boards.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} built {{solely from}} tamped earth. During the Longqing Emperor's period (1568) <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> strengthened by laying blue bricks {{on the top}} and exterior faces of <b>the</b> earthen <b>walls.</b> During <b>the</b> reign of Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty (1781), <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> enlarged; drainage features, crenels and other modifications were made; and the structure as it is now seen came into existence. By the end of the Qing dynasty rule, the structure had begun to deteriorate. In a limited degree the Republican Authorities carried out maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> which <b>was</b> in a poor state. In {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>wall's</b> defense system <b>was</b> considered to be of strategic importance, even though demolishing of similar walls in other regions of the country was undertaken following the 1911 Revolution. In 1926, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> attacked with bombs by enemy forces resulting in serious structural damage, but the city within <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> not affected. During the Second World War, when the Japanese carried out air bombings from 1937 to 1940, the residents built around 1,000 bunkers, as anti-aircraft shelters within the wide base (thickness of more than [...] ) of <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> A few escape openings were also made through <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> as passageways. Even later, new gates to allow traffic through <b>the</b> Xian <b>Wall</b> <b>were</b> constructed during <b>the</b> Republican rule.|$|R

5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists of his white collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window {{can be seen in the}} rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> {{marked on}} the garden side, on {{what would have been}} the {{external}} wall of the prison, by a plaque from the local council. There is also a paving stone with information about Dickens's father. The Cuming Museum has one of the prison's pumps and the Dickens House Museum one of its windows.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{artwork and}} sculptures, quotations, {{furniture}} and photography have been commissioned {{as part of}} the art strategy. A range of quotations have been inscribed onto the stonework in and around the parliamentary complex. Beneath the Canongate Building fa√ßade is the Canongate Wall, constructed from a variety of indigenous Scottish rocks such as Lewisian gneiss, Torridonian sandstone and Easdale slate. The stones are set into large concrete casts, each one inscribed with a quotation. The Canongate Wall contains a total of 24 quotations. Etched along the lower stretch of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> a pictorial representation of the Old Town of Edinburgh-based around a sketch by Enric Miralles showing the view of the Old Town from his bedroom window in the Balmoral Hotel.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of three load bearing <b>walls</b> <b>is</b> presented and discussed in this paper. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> of soil-cement bricks made with three different material proportions, in which {{two of them had}} part of the cement amount replaced by crushed ceramic waste. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> 95. 20 cm high, 75. 32 cm wide and 12. 56 cm thick and had their bricks layered with cement paste. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> tested under compression and their displacements were measured with 5 dial gages. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> had satisfactory behaviour and their strengths were suitable as required by Brazilian popular houses. The differences between the brick strength and <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> strength <b>were</b> less than 20 %. A finite element analysis (FEA) was performed and the uniformity of the compressive stress distributions in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>was</b> evaluated. Finally, it was observed that the partial replacement of the cement by crushed ceramic waste is possible...|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> still {{standing}} following the two conservation projects. The southern approach was guarded by a shield wall. One corner of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{protected by a}} semi-circular avant-corps. Inside <b>the</b> shield <b>wall,</b> <b>the</b> castle tower and residence hall were rectangular.|$|R
2500|$|On <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{names of}} {{servicemen}} classified as KIA (Killed in Action), or MIA (Missing in Action) when <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> constructed.

5|$|Most archaea (but not Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma) {{possess a}} cell wall. In most archaea <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> {{assembled}} from surface-layer proteins, which form an S-layer. An S-layer is a rigid array of protein molecules {{that cover the}} outside of the cell (like chain mail). This layer provides both chemical and physical protection, and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell membrane. Unlike bacteria, archaea lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Methanobacteriales do have cell walls containing pseudopeptidoglycan, which resembles eubacterial peptidoglycan in morphology, function, and physical structure, but pseudopeptidoglycan is distinct in chemical structure; it lacks D-amino acids and N-acetylmuramic acid.|$|E
5|$|Off <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>is</b> {{the fifth}} album by American singer Michael Jackson, {{released}} on August 10, 1979 in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records. It was his nineteenth album in total since Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5 (1969), {{as well as}} his first album released through Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death roughly 30 years later. It was released following Jackson's critically well-received film performance in The Wiz. While working on that project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album.|$|E
5|$|The Writing on <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>is</b> a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Directed by Barry O'Neil from a script by Lloyd Lonergan, this presumed lost film focuses on a young girl named Grace who becomes attracted to a wealthy man named Jack. Two men, named Turner and Hank plot to rob Jack after he withdraws a large sum of money from a bank, but Grace warns him of a plot to drug him. Jack escapes and marries Grace. The film has no known trade publication reviews, but reviews may exist for this film. Theaters were advertising this film as late as 1913.|$|E
50|$|The Temple protestant de Reims was {{designed}} by Charles Letrosne in a flamboyant neo-Gothic style. Originally <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> lavishly decorated in Art Deco style by Gustave Louis Jaulmes, but in 1973 <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> painted white, giving an austere appearance.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 September 2009, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{painted over}} by Wellington City Council's anti-graffiti team. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> chalked {{back up on}} 16 September 2009.

5|$|The castle {{was built}} using the trace italienne style popular during the seventeenth century; its floor has a {{geometric}} design, and bastions {{are the main}} defensive elements. However, unlike other permanent bastioned fortifications, its defensive walls were designed as two sections: {{the lower part of}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> vertical (perpendicular to the base) and the upper part, above the string course, is inclined inwards. This design makes the fort unique in Venezuela; in most castles, the lower portion of the walls inclines outwards at the base and the upper parts are vertical (perpendicular to the base).|$|E
5|$|Lord Selkirk was {{involved}} with the first permanent settlement (known as the Red River Colony), the purchase of land from the Hudson's Bay Company, and a survey of river lots in the early 19th century. The North West Company built Fort Gibraltar in 1809, and the Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Douglas in 1812, both {{in the area of}} present-day Winnipeg. The two companies competed fiercely over trade. The M√©tis and Lord Selkirk's settlers fought at the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. In 1821, the Hudson's Bay and North West Companies merged, ending their long rivalry. Fort Gibraltar was renamed Fort Garry in 1822 and became the leading post in the region for the Hudson's Bay Company. A flood destroyed the fort in 1826 and it was not rebuilt until 1835. A rebuilt section of the fort, consisting of the front gate and a section of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>is</b> near the modern-day corner of Main Street and Broadway Avenue in downtown Winnipeg.|$|E
5|$|The Western Wall is {{considered}} holy {{due to its}} connection to the Temple Mount. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>is</b> the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, {{though it is not}} the holiest site in the Jewish faith, which lies behind it. The original, natural and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by Herod, who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support extensive substructures and earth fills needed to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved esplanade which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one {{is considered}} to be closest to the former Temple, which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount esplanade. Just over half the wall's total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates {{from the end of the}} Second Temple period, and is commonly believed to have been built around 19 BCE by Herod the Great, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad era, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.|$|E
