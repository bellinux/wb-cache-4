The 3 D trajectories, and the 2 D projections, of fluorescent nanoparticles were obtained with an orbital tracking microscope in two different cell types: in Dictyostelium discoideum ameba and in adherent, more flattened HuH- 7 human cells. As expected from the different 3 D organization of both cells' cytoskeletons, a third of the active transport was lost upon projection in the ameba whereas the identification of the active phases was barely affected in the HuH- 7 cells.

40|$|Cells {{can detect}} and react <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>biophysical</b> {{properties}} of <b>the</b> extracellular environment through integrin-based adhesion sites and adapt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extracellular milieu {{in a process}} called mechanotransduction.

" The transmission of forces across integrin-based adhesions establishes a mechanical reciprocity between the visco-elasticity of the ECM and the cellular tension. During mechanotransduction, force allosterically alters the functions of mechanosensitive proteins within adhesions to elicit biochemical signals that regulate both rapid responses in cellular mechanics and long-term changes in gene expression.

40|$|Overview In {{competition}} ChIP, {{the experimental}} data is fit with an analytic model <b>to</b> extract <b>the</b> turnover rate λ, with 1 / λ determining {{the average length}} between two turnover events. We found that under our experimental conditions λ can only be determined for sites with relatively slow turnover and 1 / λ has to be longer than 500 s (Supplementary Fig. 6, 7 b). It is, however, not clear how this turnover rate is linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>biophysical</b> properties usually used to describe protein-‐DNA interactions, namely the search time for a binding site and the actual residence time at this site. As described in detail below, our simulations suggest that under our experimental conditions the extracted turnover is independent of the underlying search time and depends solely on the underlying residence time. We also describe below how this {{can be explained by}} the measurement principle of ChIP-‐chip. In sum, our analysis suggests that the extracted turnover rate at a binding site is actually its dissociation rate. In other words, competition ChIP measures the residence time. Model to describe protein-‐DNA binding interaction kinetics for the simulation of competition ChIP DNA-‐protein interactions are often described in a simplified model with first order reversible binding kinetics 1, 2. In this model proteins find their binding sites by random diffusion and upon binding they remain transiently bound for a certain time. Two time scales describe this process. First, the time it takes a newly unbound site to be bound by one of the freely diffusing proteins, or the search time Ts. Second, the length of time this protein will stay bound at a site, or the residence time TR. Monte-‐Carlo simulation of competition ChIP <b>To</b> determine how <b>the</b> turnover rate is related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>biophysical</b> properties describing <b>the</b> protein-‐DNA interactions, we implemented a Monte Carlo simulation.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> <b>biophysical</b> and {{socioeconomic}} impacts of climate change on maize production and food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) using adapted improved maize varieties and well-calibrated and validated bioeconomic models. Design/methodology/approach: Using the past climate (1950 - 2000) as a baseline, the study estimated <b>the</b> <b>biophysical</b> impacts of climate change in 2050 (2040 - 2069) and 2080 (2070 - 2099) under the A 1 B emission scenario and three nitrogen levels, and the socioeconomic impacts in 2050. Findings: Climate change will affect maize yields across SSA in 2050 and 2080, and the extent of the impact at a given period will vary considerably between input levels, regions and maize mega environments (MMEs). Greater relative yield reductions may occur under medium and high-input intensification than under low intensification, in Western and Southern Africa than in Eastern and Central Africa and in lowland and dry mid-altitude than in highland and wet mid-altitude MMEs. Climate change may worsen food insecurity in SSA in 2050 through its negative impact on maize consumption and reduction in daily calorie intake. However, international trade has <b>the</b> potential <b>to</b> offset some of the negative impacts.
