She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.|$|E

500|$|Chaplin felt The Gold Rush was {{the best}} film he had made to that point. It opened in August 1925 {{and became one of}} the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a profit of $5 million. The comedy {{contains}} some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating his shoe and the [...] "Dance of the Rolls". Macnab has called it [...] "the quintessential Chaplin film". Chaplin stated, [...] "This is the picture <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be remembered by" [...] {{at the time of the}} film's release.|$|E
500|$|On June 2, 2016, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} that Lansbury {{would return to}} Broadway in the 2017–18 season in a revival of Enid Bagnold's 1955 play The Chalk Garden. The play will be produced by Scott Rudin at a theatre to-be-announced. However, in an interview published on September 20, 2016, Lansbury stated that {{she will not be}} performing in The Chalk Garden, stating, in part: [...] "At my time of life, I've decided <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be with family more and being alone in New York doing a play requires an extraordinary amount of time left alone." ...|$|E

500|$|Though Lawson {{has enjoyed}} a {{successful}} career in cookery, {{she is not a}} trained chef, and does not like being referred to as a [...] "celebrity chef". Furthermore, she does not see herself as a cook or an expert in her field. Throughout Lawson's television programmes, she emphasises that she cooks for her own pleasure, for enjoyment, and that she finds cooking therapeutic. When deciding upon which recipes to feature in her books, she takes the view of the eater, stating, [...] "If it's something I don't want to carry on eating once I'm full, then I don't want the recipe ... I have to feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> cook the thing again".|$|E
500|$|The set {{was already}} being broken down {{the day after}} filming finished. Debra Messing, who plays Grace, said it was [...] "cordoned off like an {{accident}} scene. It {{was a shock to}} see parts of it gone already." [...] Each cast member was allowed to keep their favorite souvenir from the set. Messing took the door to Grace's office; she wanted to lean it up against the wall at her house as a piece of modern art. Sean Hayes was given a couple of pieces from Will's apartment: [...] "There's a leather box that was on Will’s desk <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> find a place for." [...] Mullally chose a simple portrait from one of the walls, and McCormack took a small ceramic dog, though he said he would have taken everything if he could.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of Dallas, Principal took certain {{measures}} in her personal life in order to add depth to her character. She initially was very distant from the cast and they assumed she didn't like them. Series producer Leonard Katzman confronted her about the issue and she said, [...] "I like everybody. It's just <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> feel like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing." [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Her relationship with Patrick Duffy's character, Bobby, was a central component to the show, and when Duffy returned to Dallas in 1986, after being killed off a year earlier, the entire previous year had been written off as Pam's dream.|$|E

500|$|Lovato's fifth album, Confident, was {{released}} on October 16, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{he first}} started {{composing}} Schyman scored his music by playing {{it on the}} piano {{without the aid of}} computers, but now he composes digitally using Digital Performer and [...] "the latest technology". He considers himself to be a [...] "very intuitive composer", in that he has [...] "something in my mind’s ear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> achieve" [...] and improvises until the music he is creating matches up with it. He finds that the hardest part of composing for a project is finding the basic concept for the music that he wants to use, rather than composing any of the individual pieces. Although he has written a concerto, Schyman does not regularly compose [...] "art music" [...] pieces, as he finds his commercial work to be [...] "satisfying music from a creative standpoint".|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{created a}} pair of razor-blade sunglasses—which she {{believed}} portrayed tough female spirit—to wear in the video, explaining [...] "I wanted to design a pair {{for some of the}} toughest chicks and some of my girlfriends ... they used to keep razor blades in the side of their mouths ... That tough female spirit is something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> project. It's meant to be, 'This is my shield, this is my weapon, this is my inner sense of fame, this is my monster.' Gaga also said that the video shows [...] "how the entertainment industry can, in a metaphorical way, simulate human trafficking - products being sold, the woman perceived as a commodity." [...] The white latex suits in the video were inspired by the wolf costume from the film Where the Wild Things Are. Gaga also wore designer Alexander McQueen's [...] high shoes and the famous [...] "Alien" [...] shoes.|$|E

500|$|Townsend's {{restraint}} {{reaches a}} breaking point on [...] "Heaven's End", which Jon Wiederhorn of Revolver described as [...] "a groovy pop song that morphs into a violent, acid-drenched nightmare." [...] It {{is followed by}} [...] "Ain't Never Gonna Win", a live studio jam by the album's four musicians which was described by David E. Gehlke of the online magazine Blistering as [...] "trippy". [...] "Trainfire", a classic country–style song inspired by Elvis Presley's cover of [...] "Mystery Train", addresses Townsend's former addiction to pornography, which he described as [...] "this crazy, crack cocaine on the internet that nobody wants to talk about." [...] The song continues the album's theme of honesty and self-acceptance, both about pornography and musical tastes. Townsend explained the song's musical style, saying [...] "yes, I like heavy music and am good at making it, {{but that is not}} all that I listen to, and that is not all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{recording}} for her thirteenth studio album, Madonna enlisted American DJ {{and producer}} Diplo {{to work with}} her on some songs. In May 2014, she posted three photos on her Instagram account, which revealed she was working the producer. She called him [...] "a slave driver" [...] in the studio. Diplo commented that he met Madonna because of her kids and then she invited him to a party, and they ended up writing seven songs together. He continued: [...] "I do not usually feel pressured to write hits, but when it’s an artist of this cailber, it’s obvious <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> push the bounderies a little bit further and surpass myself." [...] He claimed she was [...] "up for anything" [...] and that he [...] "love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and Madonna was very open-minded to my ideas... she was down from day one." [...] He added: ...|$|E
500|$|Actor James Doohan {{claimed that}} Paramount chief Frank Mancuso had fired Bennett {{following}} negative {{reaction from the}} core cast, Roddenberry, and fans. Bennett claimed that after he rewrote the script to include Shatner and Nimoy, Paramount had still rejected it and that he {{decided it was time}} he left the franchise. He said, [...] "My term was up. I was offered $1.5million to do Star Trek VI and I said 'Thanks, I don't want to do <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do the Academy.'" [...] Actor Walter Koenig approached Mancuso with a new script outline codenamed [...] "In Flanders Fields"; in it, the Romulans join the Federation and go to war with the Klingons. The Enterprise crew, except Spock, are forced to retire for not meeting fitness tests. When Spock and his new crew are captured by a monstrous worm-like race of aliens (which Koenig described as [...] "things that the monsters in Aliens evolved from"), the old crew must rescue them. In the end, all of the characters except McCoy and Spock die.|$|E

But there it is. I was, perhaps {{two or three years}} old. From where I stood, my father and uncle wrote the type of music that children loved. So <b>that's</b> what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do too." ...|$|R
500|$|Catherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret {{to attend}} court. Writing {{that she wanted}} to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: [...] "Pardon me if, reading <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children". When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine {{pressured}} her hard, playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves. The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at Notre-Dame, Paris. Frieda dismisses this accusation based on the fact Catherine had nothing to gain from her death, once the marriage contract had been signed, although Frieda considered Catherine responsible for Philibert le Vayer, who was Duke of Anjou's favourite.|$|E
500|$|In early 2015, Nintendo {{launched}} its Creator Program, {{in order to}} share revenue with YouTube video creators who feature gameplay of their products in videos. PewDiePie joined various gamers in criticising the programme. PewDiePie called the program a [...] "slap {{in the face to}} the YouTube channels that [...] focus on Nintendo game exclusively", adding, [...] "The people who have helped and showed passion for Nintendo's community are the ones left in the dirt the most." [...] Despite criticisms from PewDiePie and other gamers alike, Nintendo experienced more requests from YouTube creators than expected, causing an extension on the 72-hour wait time for video approval through the program. Additionally, PewDiePie, stated, [...] "I'll still play Nintendo games <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play on my channel as usual. I'm lucky to be in a situation where losing ad revenue on a few videos won't matter. However, many people on YouTube are not in that situation." [...] Ultimately, the focal point of criticism is toward the approval of a video which Nintendo has to administer, and may be motivated by biased intentions.|$|E
500|$|As {{a member}} of the Barnes family, Pamela was {{initially}} met with suspicion and hostility from the rival Ewing family after she had married Bobby Ewing and moved onto the Southfork Ranch to live with her new husband. The strongest hostility towards Pamela came from Bobby's older brother, J.R. Ewing, who tried to drive Pamela off Southfork Ranch with methods of bribery and intimidation, as well as trying to con Bobby into believing that Pamela {{was having an affair with}} her ex-boyfriend, Ray Krebbs. Principal, who wanted to represent her character's outsider perception of the family, would portray this with the cast. Leonard Katzman described her as being [...] "the world's most isolated lady". When confronted by Katzman about why Principal chose to be isolated from everyone else, he described the situation as: [...] "After a while, I thought, 'Maybe she doesn't like us'. I went to see her. She said, 'No, I like everybody. It's just <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> feel like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing.'" [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Fellow actor Patrick Duffy analyzed: ...|$|E
