5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang off <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two {{platforms}} positioned {{in a cutting}} partially covered with a glazed roof and partially exposed to the atmosphere. It was designed by John Fowler the MR's chief engineer. The brick-built street-level entrance building featured a balustrade along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> decoratively topped with urns. Fowler's building was demolished and reconstructed to a design by the MR's architect Charles W Clark in 1914 with a cladding of white faïence blocks. The building is listed Grade II by Historic England. The brickwork of the platform retaining walls was restored in 1986 during a renovation of the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{script is}} {{characterized}} by numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. In analyzing the film's abrupt tone shifts, Greg Sestero highlighted two scenes in particular. In the first scene, Johnny enters the rooftop {{in the middle of}} a tirade about being accused of domestic abuse, only to become abruptly cheerful upon seeing Mark; a few moments later, he laughs inappropriately upon learning that a friend of Mark's had been severely beaten. On set, Sestero and first assistant director Sandy Schklair repeatedly tried to convince Wiseau that the line should not be delivered as comical, but Wiseau refused to refrain from laughing. In the second instance, occurring a few scenes later, Mark attempts to kill Peter by throwing him off a roof after Peter expresses his belief that Mark is having an affair with Lisa; just as Peter is about to fall to his death, Mark pulls Peter back over <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> apologizes, and the two continue their previous conversation with no acknowledgement of what just occurred.|$|E

25|$|The {{tradition}} Tongan fale {{consisted of}} a curved roof (branches lashed with sennit rope, or kafa, thatched with woven palm leaves) resting on pillars made of tree trunks. Woven screens filled in the area between the ground and <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> The traditional design was extremely well adapted to surviving hurricanes. If the winds threatened to shred the walls and overturn the roof, the inhabitants could chop down the pillars, so that the roof fell directly onto the ground. Because the roof was curved, like a limpet shell, the wind tended to flow over it smoothly. The inhabitants could ride out the storm in relative safety.|$|E

500|$|The {{height of}} {{buildings}} in Washington {{is limited by}} the Height of Buildings Act. The original Act was passed by Congress in 1899 in response to the 1894 construction of the Cairo Hotel, which is much taller than the majority of buildings in the city. The original act restricted the heights of any type of building in the United States capital city of Washington, D.C., to be no higher than , [...] for residential buildings. In 1910, the 61st United States Congress enacted a new law which raised the overall building height limit to , but restricted building heights to the width of the adjacent street or avenue plus thus, a building facing a -wide street could be only [...] tall. However, building heights are measured from the sidewalk or curb to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> Architectural embellishments, mechanical rooms, and common rooftop structures may be exempted from the overall height limit, provided they are set back from the roof line. The heights of buildings listed here may therefore exceed the general height limit as measured for the purpose of the city's zoning laws.|$|E
