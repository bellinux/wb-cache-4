5|$|<b>Tommy</b> <b>was</b> finally {{released}} on 17 May 1969 in the US, and 23 May in the UK, because of delays with the cover. The original double album was configured with sides 1 and 4 on one disc, and sides 2 and 3 on the other, to accommodate record changers.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, a super deluxe {{version of}} <b>Tommy</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} as a 3-CD / Blu-ray disc box set. As {{well as the}} original album, the package includes additional demos, and a live performance mostly taken from the Who's show at the Capital Theatre, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on 15 October 1969. The live disc was significant, as it debunked a long-standing myth that the tapes for the tour were burned in preference for the Leeds University show in February 1970 that made up Live at Leeds.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was born}} in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. His father Dave, a {{chartered}} surveyor and former Watford youth team player, helped coach with the academy during his son's time there. His younger brother Jack, born in 1983, also came through the club's youth system to become a professional player. The pair did not play for Watford together competitively; <b>Tommy</b> <b>was</b> substituted in the 67th minute of the club's 4–0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion on 26 April 2003, while Jack would make his first-team debut as a 81st-minute substitute. Jack would not make another appearance that season, while Tommy left for Sunderland in the summer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tommy</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{released as}} a two-LP set with artwork designed by McInnerney, {{which included a}} booklet including lyrics and images to illustrate parts of the story. The cover is presented {{as part of a}} triptych-style fold-out cover, and the booklet contained abstract artwork that outlined the story. Although the album included lyrics to all the songs, indicating individual characters, it did not outline the plot, which led to a concert programme being prepared for shows, that carried a detailed synopsis.|$|E

5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Who's concerts that included <b>Tommy</b> <b>was</b> overwhelmingly positive. The touring helped keep the album in the public eye, and cleared the band's debts. Several live recordings of Tommy from the Who's 1969–70 tours have been released. A complete performance {{is available on the}} 2002 Deluxe Edition of the live album Live at Leeds, recorded on 14 February 1970. The second Isle of Wight performance is available on Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, released in 1996. The Coliseum Theatre gig is available on the 2007 video release At Kilburn 1977 + Live at the Coliseum. Portions of the Woodstock performance of Tommy were released on the Woodstock film and later on The Kids Are Alright. The complete show was recorded, but has never been officially released.|$|E
5|$|Townshend came up {{with the}} concept of Tommy after being {{introduced}} to the work of Meher Baba, and attempted to translate Baba's teachings into music. Recording on the album began in September 1968, but took six months to complete as material needed to be arranged and re-recorded in the studio. <b>Tommy</b> <b>was</b> acclaimed upon its release by critics, who hailed it as the Who's breakthrough. Its critical standing diminished slightly in later years; nonetheless, several writers view it as an important and influential album in the history of rock music. The Who promoted the album's release with an extensive tour, including a live version of Tommy, which lasted throughout 1969 and 1970. Key gigs from the tour included appearances at Woodstock, the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival, the University of Leeds, the Metropolitan Opera House and the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival. The live performances of Tommy drew critical praise and rejuvenated the band's career.|$|E
