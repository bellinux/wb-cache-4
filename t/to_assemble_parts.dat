40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} novel approach to virtual assembly that combines dynamic modeling with geometric constraint-based modeling to support low clearance manual assembly of CAD models. This is made possible by utilizing the boundary representation solid model data available in most contemporary CAD representations, which enables (a) accurate collision/physics calculations on exact model definitions, and (b) access to geometric features. Application of geometric constraints during run-time, aid the designer during assembly of the virtual models. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated using a pin and hole assembly example. Results that demonstrate the method give the user the ability <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>parts</b> without requiring extensive CAD preprocessing and without over constraining the user to arrive at predetermined final part orientations. Assembly is successful with diametral clearance as low as 0. 0001 mm, as measured between a 26 mm diameter hole and pin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of pointshell {{shrinking}} and feature size on manual assembly operations in a virtual environment with haptic force feedback. Specific emphasis is on exploring methods to improve voxel-based modeling to support manual assembly of low clearance parts. CAD parts were created, voxelized and tested for assembly. The results showed that pointshell shrinking allows the engineer <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>parts</b> with a lower clearance than without pointshell shrinking. Further results showed that assemble-ability is dependent on feature size, particularly part diameter and clearance. In a pin and hole assembly, as the pin diameter increases, for a given percent clearance, assembling low clearance features becomes difficult. An empirical equation is developed to guide the designer in selecting an appropriate voxel size based on feature size. These results advance the effort to improve manual assembly operations via haptic feedback in the virtual environment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceViscoElastic Materials (VEM) are intensively used {{to solve}} NVH issues. Damping pads and anti flutter {{products}} reduce the structure borne noise. Sealants and absorbing materials prevent the air borne transmission. Adhesives are common solutions <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>parts.</b> Whereas VEM are well known, the {{finite element analysis}} of their dynamic behavior is not straightforward. Most of the time, {{the use of a}} computer aided engineering software requires to simplify VEM as standard elastic materials. This simplification is not always the obvious thing to do and may lead to inaccurate results. The paper tackles the way how advanced capabilities are introduced in Code_Aster to take into account frequency dependent properties of VEM. The computing of frequency response functions and modes of vibration (real or complex) is addressed. Having frequency dependent modes is a step forward for the modal projection method and for the model updating with an experimental modal basis as a reference. The new capabilities are then compared with the standard approaches {{in the case of an}} automotive windshield. Two VEM are considered: the windshield bonding and the polyvinylbutyral of the laminated glass...|$|E

40|$|Cleanliness of {{manufactured}} {{parts and}} assemblies {{is a significant}} issue in many industries including disk drives, semiconductors, aerospace, and medical devices. Clean manufacturing requires cleanroom floor space and cleaning technology that are both expensive to own and expensive to operate. Strategies to reduce these costs are an important consideration. One strategy shown to be effective at reducing costs is <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>parts</b> into subassemblies and then clean the subassembly, rather than clean the individual parts first and then assemble them. One advantage is that assembly outside of the cleanroom reduces the amount of cleanroom floor space and its associated operating cost premium. A second advantage is that this strategy reduces the number of individual parts that must be cleaned prior to assembly, {{reducing the number of}} cleaning baskets, handling and, possibly, reducing the number of cleaners. The assemble then clean strategy also results in a part that is significantly cleaner because contamination generated during the assembly steps are more effectively removed that normally can be achieved by hand wiping after assembly in the cleanroom...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The use of fibre {{reinforced}} plastics – FRP’s – in structures {{is under a}} considerable increase. Advantages of their use are related with their low weight, high strength and stiffness. The improvement of the dynamic characteristics has been profitable for aeronautics, automobile, railway, naval and sporting goods industries. Drilling is a widely used machining technique as it is needed <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>parts</b> in a structure. This is a unique machining process, characterized by the existence of two different mechanisms: extrusion by the drill chisel edge and cutting by the rotating cutting lips. Drilling raises particular problems that can reduce mechanical and fatigue strength of the parts. In this work, quasi-isotropic hybrid laminates with 25 % of carbon fibre reinforced plies and 4 mm thickness are produced, tested and drilled. Three different drill geometries are compared. Results considered are the interlaminar fracture toughness in Mode I – GIc –, thrust force during drilling and delamination extent after drilling. A bearing test is performed to evaluate tool influence on the load carrying capacity of the plate. Results consider the influence of drill geometry on delamination. A correlation linking plate damage to bearing test results is presented...|$|E
40|$|To {{design and}} build living systems, {{synthetic}} biologists have at their disposal an increasingly large library of naturally derived and synthetic parts. These parts must be combined together in particular orders, orientations, and spacings to achieve desired functionalities. These structural constraints {{can be viewed as}} grammatical rules describing how <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>parts</b> together into larger functional units. Here, we develop a grammar for the design of synthetic transcription factors (sTFs) in eukaryotic cells and implement it within GenoCAD, a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for synthetic biology. Knowledge derived from experimental evidence was captured in this grammar to guide the user to create designer transcription factors that should operate as intended. The grammar can be easily updated and refined as our experience with using sTFs in different contexts increases. In combination with grammars that define other synthetic systems, we anticipate that this work will enable the more reliable, efficient, and automated design of synthetic cells with rich functionalities.

Some of the part is easy to assemble {{and some of it}} is difficult <b>to</b> <b>assemble.</b> <b>Parts</b> that are difficult to assemble could cause a rise of cost in terms of labor and time. The objectives of this project are to improve the design of Proton Wira driver's seat by using integrated Value Engineering (YE) and Design for Assembly (DFA) and to make the comparative analysis between current design and proposed design in terms of assembly effectiveness. The flow of this project is started from collecting Wira seat information and using YE approach to identify the function identification and implement function analysis. Then, the alternative design will be generated and the best alternative design will be evaluated using Pugh method. After that, the proposed design will be compared with current design of Wira seat using DFA approached. The result shows that the DFA Index for the proposed design of Wira driver's seat is higher than current design that is 4. 7 compare to 4. 4. Hence, it can be concluded that the integrated of VE and DFA method can improve the design of Wira driver's seat in terms of assembly effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} a {{distributed}} mobile robot platform to deliver parts around a model construction site. The platform's robots, specialized into delivery robots and assembly robots, use a distributed coverage algorithm {{to determine where}} parts should be delivered. The robots consist of a mobility platform (iRobot iCreate), a manipulation platform (Crustcrawler arm), and an IR communication system to enable recognition and grasping of parts. To control the robot hardware, we implemented software in Java. The delivery robots use IR communication to find parts at a supply station. After communicating over UDP multicast with assembly station robots, the delivery robots deliver parts to the assembly robots based on their coverage control algorithm. To evaluate the algorithm, we constructed a hardware system of 4 robots, connected to a VICON motion capture system for localization. We discuss the results of successful hardware and software testing of {{the system as a}} method of delivering parts around a construction site, and we discuss future plans to use the platform <b>to</b> <b>assemble</b> <b>parts</b> once delivered. by Adrienne Bolger.
