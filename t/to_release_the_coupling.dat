50|$|Drašković's {{pronounced}} anti-war views came to {{the fore}} in mid to late 1991, particularly in November of that year when he wrote a passionate condemnation of the Serbian bloody assault on Vukovar in a Serbian daily Borba. In early 1992, he called on all citizens of Bosnia to reject nationalism. In 1993, he and his wife Danica were arrested, beaten and sent to a high-security prison. Only his hunger strike, and international outrage pressured <b>the</b> Yugoslav government <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple.</b>|$|R

She was kept a virtual prisoner at home and Goonewardena was forced at file a habeas corpus writ <b>to</b> get her <b>released.</b> <b>The</b> <b>couple</b> were married on 30 January 1939.|$|R
5000|$|Lippi painted using tempera, {{coloured}} pigments {{bound in}} egg-yolk, the standard medium of the day. This, [...] " [...] {{has to be}} applied very gently, very delicately, little parallel strokes, literally stroking paint on to the surface. A great master like Lippi would have created seamless transitions which are barely visible now..He must have had wonderfully fine brushes, I don't know how many he got through each day, wearing them out." [...] Lippi knew that his painting was to be displayed in a very particular environment, the windowless chapel of the Medici palace, {{so it would be}} seen only by candlelight. A small part of Mary's cloak bears traces of damage from the naked flame of an altar candle. Lippi used the darkness, and finished the painting with a breathtaking display of gold. His use of gold was both, [...] "very extravagant and virtuoso, but also very restrained..halos with their incised and punched decorations..and sometimes he's not even using gold, he's using little dots of yellow and ochre to suggest the play of light across a golden surface, set next to actual gilding." [...] For Cosimo, the banker, the gold might also have held a very personal meaning. Tim Parks: [...] "To me , {{the most important part of}} the picture is the amount of gold that's used, this extraordinary superimposition of cash and the sacred - the darkness at the centre of the painting does nothing but set off the gold here. He wanted to make his money religiously respectable - I think that's absolutely key to the whole thing..." [...] Unlike most artists of the day Lippi chose to sign his picture, on the handle of the axe, 'with panache, in a virtuoso display of foreshortening.' By the year 1459 Lippi's work was finished, and the painting placed above Cosimo's private altar. Four years later, Cosimo died. Lippi's fame continued to grow - he fathered another child with Lucrezia and <b>the</b> Pope offered <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> from Holy Orders so that they could be married - Lippi declined. A decade after finishing his Adoration Fra Filippo Lippi died.Lippi's inspiration continued - the young Sandro Botticelli, once Filippo Lippi's pupil, adopted his style and Michelangelo praised him. Soon his Adoration had become one of the most copied paintings of the 15th century, an image in demand for the houses of the rich and poor alike. Yet its fame did not mean it was secure in its home, and it faced threats from rebellion and war.|$|R
50|$|Arriving in 1977, <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> {{prepared}} to do a series of population censuses of the wildlife. In 1978, they spent the winter in Marguerite Bay on the Antarctic Peninsula, where Poncet began {{a survey of the}} seabirds of the area and a count of elephant seals. The following year, Poncet gave birth to her first son, Dion on South Georgia Island. Their boat had become trapped in the ice and they were forced to wait until a British icebreaker was able <b>to</b> <b>release</b> their schooner. <b>The</b> <b>couple</b> sailed back to Tasmania for repairs, where their second son, Leiv was born in 1981. The following year, they returned to the Antarctic for the 1982-1983 bird season count and settled in the Falkland Islands. Their son Lars Nigel, nicknamed Diti, was born in the Falklands in 1984. Throughout the 1980s, Poncet worked in conjunction with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) mapping locations of colonies around South Georgia and the Willis Islands of elephant seals, macaroni penguins and mollymawks.|$|R
5000|$|Lancaster {{has stated}} that his primary inspirations for this album were his Christian faith, {{and his wife and}} child. [...] The overall theme of this album is [...] "Be yourself". [...] The song [...] "Save Me", for example, is about the night Lancaster reaffirmed his faith in God. [...] Lancaster {{has stated that}} this song is the song that best {{represents}} his basic style for this album, and that it's the most personal and meaningful to him of all the songs on the record. [...] "Just In Time" [...] is about Lancaster's love for his wife, and it was <b>released</b> <b>to</b> celebrate <b>the</b> <b>couple's</b> anniversary. [...] "Change" [...] is a song giving thanks to Lancaster's fans and supporters. [...] "Do I" [...] is a song about Lancaster's stubbornness in arguments - it was written as an apology to his wife after a minor dispute that they had.|$|R
50|$|A rescue {{train was}} {{attempting}} to connect to the stalled train when the driver was told <b>to</b> <b>release</b> <b>the</b> brake while <b>coupling</b> {{had not yet been}} successful. It was then that the empty train began to roll backwards at a speed of ten metres per second, before smashing into the other train, which was carrying passengers. Therefore, it was believed that the incident was caused by negligence due to insufficient training of operation staff. This accident also resulted in two damaged trains with heavily damaged areas limited to the two leading cars. The colliding speed was suspected to be about 60 km/h due to the appearance of damaged areas. However, one train, which was rebuilt from the repair of the minor-damaged cars, was already fitted for operation at the end of 2006 and the remaining one was still under heavy repair until mid of 2007; it was released into service in October 2007. The cost resulting from the accident might be a much higher figure than BMCL quoted, and it was expected to be at least 400 million baht, which was totally insured by a local insurance company.|$|R
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} that overcomes {{some of the}} deficiencies in current methods that prevent determination of the exact monosaccharide composition of polysaccharides other than those that have regular repeating unit structures and, therefore, whole number ratios of constituent sugars. These deficiencies are differences in rates of release and rates of destruction of different sugars during acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and different detector response factors for each sugar. The developed method (1) provides rapid and complete depolymerization of the polysaccharide without destruction of constituent monosaccharides; (2) converts each monosaccharide into a major and minor derivative; (3) converts sugar units into derivatives that can be separated by HPLC and detected with a UV flow detector; (4) gives molar amounts of each sugar from UV detection after application of a constant response factor; and (5) {{can be used to}} determine the ratio of monosaccharide units in a polysaccharide. The method involves use of liquid anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at room temperature as a polysaccharide solvent, to provide solvolysis of glycosidic linkages, and as a reaction medium for specific coupling of 2, 6 -dimethylphenol <b>to</b> each <b>released</b> monosaccharide. <b>The</b> <b>coupling</b> reaction produces derivatives detectable with a UV detector. HPLC separation utilized a gradient solvent system of water and acetonitrile and a C 18 reversed phase column. Peak areas were compared using a response factor because of differences in molar absorptivity among monosaccharides. Reliability of the method was confirmed by analyzing polysaccharides of known composition. ...|$|R
40|$|The Na+/K+ pump is a {{ubiquitous}} P-type ATPase {{that binds}} three cytoplasmic Na+ ions deep within its core {{where they are}} temporarily occluded before being <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extracellular surface. The 3 Na+/ 2 K+-exchange transport cycle is completed when two extracellular K+ ions bind and become temporarily occluded within the protein and subsequently <b>released</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cytoplasm. <b>Coupling</b> of Na+-ion occlusion to phosphorylation of the pump by ATP and of K+-ion occlusion to its dephosphorylation ensure the vectorial nature of net transport. The occluded-ion conformations, with binding sites inaccessible from either side, represent intermediate states in these alternating-access descriptions of transport. They afford protection against potentially catastrophic effects of inadvertently allowing simultaneous access from both membrane sides. The marine toxin, palytoxin, converts Na+/K+ pumps into nonselective cation channels, possibly by disrupting <b>the</b> normal strict <b>coupling</b> between opening of one access pathway in the Na+/K+ ATPase and closing of the other. We show here that gating of the channels in palytoxin-bound Na+/K+ pumps in excised membrane patches is modulated by the pump's physiological ligands: cytoplasmic application of ATP promotes opening of the channels, and extracellular replacement of Na+ ions by K+ ions promotes closing of the channels. This suggests that, {{despite the presence of}} bound palytoxin, certain partial reactions of the normal Na+/K+-transport cycle persist and remain capable of effecting the conformational changes that control access to the pump's cation-binding sites. These findings affirm the alternating-access model of ion pumps and offer the possibility of examining ion occlusion/deocclusion reactions in single pump molecules...|$|R
