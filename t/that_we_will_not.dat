On 24 January 2017 Gabriel announced <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> run as candidate for chancellor in 2017; instead, he proposed that Martin Schulz become candidate and replace him as party chairman.|$|E
25|$|Taken together, {{proponents of}} {{reconciliation}} ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination {{of a large}} percentage of the earth's area as a sign <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because it means the remaining land is used more intensely. For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic fertilizer is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use. Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable socio-ecological system and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.|$|E

500|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} Irwin's death, {{at least ten}} stingrays were found dead and mutilated on the beaches of Queensland, with their tails cut off, prompting speculation {{as to whether they}} might have been killed by fans of Irwin as an act of revenge, although, according to the chairman of the Queensland fishing information service, anglers regularly cut the tails off of accidentally caught stingrays to avoid being stung. Michael Hornby, a friend of Irwin and executive director of his Wildlife Warrior fund, condemned any revenge killings, saying that [...] "We just want to make it very clear <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> accept and not stand for anyone who's taken a form of retribution.

500|$|During the proceedings, {{a number}} of boyars had {{switched}} to supporting peasants: the liberal boyar Ceaușescu, a delegate to the Commission's fourth session, made a celebrated speech in which he addressed laborers as [...] "brothers" [...] and deplored his own status as a landowner. An emotional audience applauded his gesture, and peasants proclaimed that God forgave Ceaușescu's deeds. Other landowners, more circumspect, asked peasants what they planned to use for compensation, {{for which they were}} to be largely responsible; according to Mihail Kogălniceanu, their answer was [...] "With these two slave's arms, we have been working for centuries and provided for all the landowners' expenses; once freed, our arms would work twice as much and rest assured <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> leave you wanting of what the country's judgment will decide we should pay you". This reportedly caused an uproar inside the Commission.|$|E

"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision {{that has been made}} {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the police}} {{have been known to}} crack down on certain occurrences in the park, when it comes to Hippie Hill, the SFPD has been known to be lenient with what goes on there.

It explores some of the existential issues that concern us all: to do with identity, sex, death, ontology, evil, desire and violence. The article takes a largely psychoanalytical approach, showing how Freud's concept of the Uncanny is particularly helpful in explaining both the text's appeal, and its creepy uneasiness. Namely, our fears about existence and identity as separate beings: our worry <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> either <b>not</b> be noticed (being invisible and isolated), or <b>we</b> <b>will</b> be completely consumed by the attention of another.
