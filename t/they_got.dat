They were promptly arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} May 1941, the NDH had asked Germany for, among other things, 22 Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> {{some of the}} {{remaining}} largely obsolete aircraft of the VVKJ. At the same time, Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers, which were then supplied to Bulgaria. Romania received six ex-VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes, as well as six Bristol Blenheims, whilst Finland received 20 half-completed Blenheims, together with manufacturing tools and production equipment, {{as well as a}} huge variety of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the setting}} {{up of the}} European External Action Service (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to {{influence}} {{the shape of the}} EEAS.

However, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> broader financial control over the new body.|$|E

5|$|Kinsey and {{his staff}} {{reported}} that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a sexual contact with another female. Of women who had sexual contact with another female, half to two-thirds of them had orgasmed. Single women had the highest prevalence of homosexual activity, followed by women who were widowed, divorced, or separated. The lowest occurrence of sexual activity was among married women; those with previous homosexual experience reported <b>they</b> <b>got</b> married to stop homosexual activity.|$|E

5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators.

The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, {{and went on to}} explain that a dog was required to find the athletes after <b>they</b> <b>got</b> lost in the snow.

5|$|Although the sextet had {{declined}} after 1986, in 1990 <b>they</b> <b>got</b> together to record Zyryab, a groundbreaking Arabic flamenco/jazz album with jazz pianist Chick Corea and fellow virtuoso flamenco guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar. The album {{is named after}} Ziryab, an 8th–9th century Shiraz-born poet/musician at the Umayyad court in Córdoba, credited with introducing to Spain the Persian lute, which evolved into the Spanish guitar—and according to some, established flamenco itself. One track on the album, a tarantas, is dedicated to Sabicas. The album was critically well-received; Jazz Times praised the passion and rhythm of the musicians featuring on the album.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} <b>they</b> <b>got</b> it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really {{only a couple of}} songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. {{for a couple of days}} and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

5|$|Cagney {{remained}} in retirement for 20 years, conjuring {{up images of}} Jack L. Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he {{found it easier to}} rebuff others, including a part in The Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where <b>they</b> <b>got</b> to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that <b>they</b> <b>got</b> their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E
