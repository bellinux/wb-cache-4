We used proteome analysis to search for proteins {{that are associated with}} the recovery of TJ permeability in capsaicin-treated Caco- 2 cells. A protein with a relative molecular mass of 14 kDa was found to be expressed more highly in capsaicin-treated cells than in nontreated cells. Mass spectrometry and sequence analyses revealed that the protein that is expressed significantly upon capsaicin treatment is the ribosomal protein P 2; its cDNA sequence was identical to that found in the human genome database. An increase in the amount of cellular filamentous actin (F-actin) was shown after 8 h of incubation with capsaicin. It has been reported that P 2 activates elongation factor 2, which stabilizes F-actin filaments, and that the depolymerization of F-actin is associated with the increase in TJ permeability (decrease in TER). Consequently, these results suggest that P 2 {{plays an important role in}} the recovery of the TJ permeability in capsaicin-treated human intestinal cells.

The transcellular pathway leads across the apical and basolateral cell membrane, whereas the paracellular pathway is directed through the tight junction.

In order to lessen the invasiveness of that procedure, we further refined the method for measuring the corneal TER by developing electrodes that could be placed on the cornea and in the conjunctival sac instead of inserting them into the anterior chamber. TER was then calculated by subtracting the electrical resistance, which lacked the corneal epithelial input, from the whole electrical resistance that was measured between the electrodes. Slit lamp examination and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to determine safety of the new device. Corneal TER changes after exposure to 0. 02 % BAC were determined using the new device as well as SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Slit lamp examination before and after exposure of rabbits' corneas to the sensor confirmed safety of the device. SEM examination revealed no difference of the corneal epithelium which exposed to the new device with normal corneas. SEM and TEM pictures revealed damaged microvilli and tight junctions after instillation of 0. 02 % BAC. TER change after treatment with 0. 02 %BAC was similar to those determined by the established anterior chamber method.

40|$|Introduction: The {{epithelial}} and endothelial {{barriers of}} the airway mucosa {{are critical for}} regulation of tissue homeostasis and protection against pathogens or other tissue damaging agents. In response to a viral infection, epithelial cells must signal to the endothelium to initiate immune cell recruitment. This is a highly temporal regulated process; however, the mechanisms of this cross-talk are not fully understood. Methods: In a close-contact co-culture model of human airway epithelial and endothelial cells cellular crosstalk was analysed using transepithelial electrical resistance (<b>TER)</b> <b>measurements,</b> immunofluorescence, electron microscopy and ELISA. Viral infections were simulated by exposing airway epithelial cells apically to double-stranded RNA (Poly(I:C)). Using a microfluidic culture system the temporal release of mediators was analysed in the co-culture model. Results: Within 4 h of challenge, double-stranded RNA induced the release of TNF-a by epithelial cells. This activated endothelial cells by triggering {{the release of the}} chemoattractant CX 3 CL 1 (fractalkine) by 8 h post-challenge and expression of adhesion molecules E-selectin and ICAM- 1. These responses were significantly reduced by neutralising TNF-a. Conclusion: By facilitating kinetic profiling, the microfluidic co-culture system has enabled identification of a key signalling mechanism between the epithelial and endothelial barriers.

Though the role of the epididymis is well established, the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for sperm maturation remain to be elucidated, particularly in the human, as limited biological tools exist. We have established the first stable epithelial cell lines transformed with SV 40 large T antigen (LTAg) from two regions of the human adult epididymis. The cell lines are composed of homogenous populations of diploid principal cells that possess ultrastructural characteristics similar to those of human principal cells in vivo. These cells express transcripts for adherens (cadherins CDH 1 and CDH 2) and tight (claudins CLDN 1, CLDN 2, CLDN 3, CLDN 4, CLDN 7, and CLDN 8) junctions as well as desmosomes (desmoplakin, DSP).

40|$|The {{suitability}} of the caco- 2 cell line {{as a model}} for studying the long term impact of dietary fatty acids on intestinal lipid handling and chylomicron production was examined. Chronic supplementation of caco- 2 cells with palmitic acid (PA) resulted in a lower triacylglycerol secretion than oleic acid (OA). This was coupled with a detrimental effect of PA, but not OA, on transepithelial electrical resistance (<b>TER)</b> <b>measurements,</b> suggesting a loss of structural integrity across the cell monolayer. Addition of OA reversed the adverse effects of PA and stearic acid on TER and increased the ability of cells to synthesise and accumulate lipid, but did not normalise the secretion of lipids by caco- 2 cells. Increasing amounts of OA and decreasing amounts of PA in the incubation media markedly improved the ability of cells to synthesise apolipoprotein B and secrete lipids. Real time RT-PCR revealed a down regulation of genes involved in lipoprotein synthesis following PA than OA. Electron microscopy showed adverse effects of PA on cellular morphology consistent with immature enterocytes such as stunted microvilli and poor tight junction formation. In conclusion, previously reported differences in lipoprotein secretion by caco- 2 cells supplemented with saturated fatty acids (SFA) and OA may partly reflect early cytotoxic effects of SFA on cellular integrity and function.

40|$|AbstractIn adult mammals such as rats, the blood–testis barrier (BTB) conferred by {{adjacent}} Sertoli {{cells in}} the seminiferous epithelium segregates post-meiotic germ cell development from the systemic circulation {{and is one of}} the tightest blood–tissue barriers. Yet it must “open” transiently at stages VIII to IX of the epithelial cycle to accommodate the migration of preleptotene/leptotene spermatocytes. While this is a vital event of spermatogenesis, the mechanism(s) that regulates BTB dynamics is virtually unknown. Recent studies have suggested that transforming growth factor-β 3 (TGF-β 3) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) secreted by Sertoli and germ cells into the microenvironment of the BTB are capable of inducing reversible BTB disruption in vivo, apparently by reducing the steady-state levels of occludin and zonula occludens- 1 (ZO- 1) at the BTB via the p 38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. In this study, local administration of TGF-β 3 (200  ng/testis) to the testis was shown to reversibly perturb the BTB integrity in vivo. We next sought to delineate the mechanism by which these cytokines maintain the steady-state level of integral membrane proteins: occludin, junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) and N-cadherin at the BTB. Primary Sertoli cells cultured in vitro were shown to establish intact tight junctions and functional BTB within two days when assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (<b>TER)</b> <b>measurement</b> across the cell epithelium. Sertoli cell integral membrane protein internalization at the BTB was assessed by biotinylation of cell surface proteins, to be followed by tracking the endocytosed/biotinylated proteins by using specific antibodies. Both TGF-β 3 (3  ng/ml) and TNFα (10  ng/ml) were shown to significantly accelerate the kinetics of internalization of JAM-A, N-cadherin, and occludin versus controls. Treatment of cells with phenylarsine oxide (PAO) at 10  μM that blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis was shown to inhibit the TGF-β 3 -induced protein internalization. This inhibition of TGF-β 3 -mediated protein endocytosis was further validated by silencing of clathrin. The specific effect of TGF-β 3 on protein internalization was further confirmed by RNAi using specific TGF-β receptor I (TβR 1) siRNA duplexes. When TβR 1 was knocked down, the TGF-β 3 -induced increase in the kinetics of JAM-A and occludin endocytosis was abolished, making them indistinguishable from controls, illustrating the specificity of the TGF-β 3 effects on protein endocytosis. In summary, this report demonstrates for the first time that BTB dynamics are regulated by TGF-β 3 and TNFα via an enhancement of protein endocytosis at the BTB...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial {{ovarian cancer}} {{originating}} from ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) {{is the most}} lethal type of gynecological cancer among women worldwide. The poor understanding of the cellular and molecular events associated with ovarian carcinogenesis leads to difficulties in early diagnosis and in efficient treatment. Recently, much evidence has implicated that tight junction (TJ) could {{play a role in}} signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, polarization, and differentiation. Moreover, altered expression of TJ proteins have been discovered in many types of human epithelial tumors. The general aims of this thesis were to investigate the expression, localization, function and modulation of TJ in normal OSE and epithelial ovarian tumors (EOT). Moreover, a further understanding of the possible roles of TJ in transformation of OSE towards EOT and in tumor progression was sought. The studies were approved by the human Ethics committee of Sahlgrenska Academy, Göteborg University. Informed written consent was obtained from all women participating in the study. Cultured OSE, EOT biopsies and cell lines were used in the studies. Formation of TJ was investigated by electron microscopy observation, immunofluorescence and western blot with semi-quantitative densitometry analysis. Ion-barrier function of TJ was evaluated by trans-epithelial resistance (<b>TER)</b> <b>measurement.</b> The results showed that: 1. TJ proteins ZO- 1, occludin and claudin- 1 are expressed in normal OSE cells in situ and in vitro. TJ structure was confirmed by electron microscopy observation in early passage of cultured OSE. During culture of normal OSE, a low TER value was built up and could be interfered with by a Ca 2 + chelator. 2. Claudin- 3 and - 4 were de novo expressed or up-regulated in ovarian epithelial inclusion cysts and EOT compared with normal OSE. Moreover, in ovarian serous and mucinous tumors, claudin- 4 was significantly increased in borderline-type tumors and adenocarcinomas compared with benign tumors. Claudin- 3 was significantly increased in adenocarcinomas compared with borderline-type and benign tumors; whereas no changes were found for claudin- 1 or - 5. 3. In the study of four ovarian cancer cell lines, ZO- 1, claudin- 1, - 3, - 4 and E-cadherin were found to be expressed along the entire cells periphery in serous adenocarcinoma cells concomitant with high TER value, while clear-cell and endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell lines did not express claudin- 4 and E-cadherin, concomitant with minimal TER values. 4. When transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 was added to cultured OSE and OVCAR- 3 ovarian cancer cell line, the expression levels of TJ and adherens junction (AJ) proteins and TER values were changed. Furthermore, treatment with TGF-β 1 also induced EMT-like morphological change in cultured OSE. It is concluded that normal OSE forms TJ with a weak ion-barrier function. The TJ proteins claudin- 3 and - 4 are up-regulated in EOT. Specific function of TJ might depend on and differ in between various histological subtypes of ovarian cancer. TGF-β 1 can modulate the formation of TJ and AJ, and the ion-barrier function of TJ in both OSE and epithelial ovarian cancer cells in culture. These findings suggest a potential role of TGF-β 1 in epithelial ovarian tumorigenesis...|$|R
30|$|A linear {{relationship}} between DTPA and liquid absorption rates was demonstrated after apical liquid addition to CF HBE cultures. Likely, {{some portion of}} this absorption is paracellular, and DTPA is simply conveyed along with liquid flow through the tight junctions between epithelial cells. This result implies that the paracellular movement of DTPA {{is proportional to the}} overall liquid absorption by the epithelium when a stimulus for liquid absorption is applied. TER, which provides a means of quantifying tight junction permeability, was lower in the CF cultures when assessed with a volt-ohm meter. There was no relationship between TER and DTPA absorption rate across a large range of TER values, and the DTPA absorption rate was still significantly higher in CF cultures when compared to non-CF cultures with similar TER levels. This result implies that DTPA absorption in these experiments is being driven by factors not directly related to epithelial damage or tight junction permeability. In a setting where no stimulus for liquid absorption is applied, these factors are more likely to influence DTPA absorption rate. TER values increased with the proportion of non-CF cells added to our mixed-cell experiments; however, {{there was no difference in}} <b>TER</b> when representative <b>measurements</b> from 9 CF and 11 non-CF cell lines were compared.|$|R

We have used a previously characterized polarized intestinal T 84 cell model to investigate the effects of infection with EAEC strain 042 on tight junction integrity. We find that infection with strain 042 induces a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) compared to uninfected controls and to cells infected with commensal E. coli strain HS. When the infection was limited after 3 h by washing and application of gentamicin, we observed that the TER of EAEC-infected monolayers continued to decline, and they remained low even as long as 48 h after the infection. Cells infected with the afimbrial mutant strain 042 aafA exhibited <b>TER</b> <b>measurements</b> similar to those seen in uninfected monolayers, implicating the aggregative adherence fimbriae II (AAF/II) as necessary for barrier dysfunction.

EAEC-infected T 84 cells exhibited irregular shapes, and some cells became elongated and/or enlarged; these effects were not observed after infection with commensal E. coli strain HS or 042 aafA.

40|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of Clostridium difficile {{is primarily}} linked to secretion of the intracellular acting toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) which monoglucosylate and thereby inactivate Rho GTPases of host cells. Although the molecular {{mode of action}} of TcdA and TcdB is well understood, far less is known about toxin binding and uptake. It is acknowledged that the C-terminally combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) of the toxins function as receptor binding domain. The current study evaluates {{the role of the}} CROP domain with respect to functionality of TcdA and TcdB. Therefore, we generated truncated TcdA devoid of the CROPs (TcdA 1 – 1874) and found that this mutant was still cytopathic. However, TcdA 1 – 1874 possesses about 5 to 10 -fold less potency towards 3 T 3 and HT 29 cells compared to the full length toxin. Interestingly, CHO-C 6 cells even showed almost identical susceptibility towards truncated and full length TcdA concerning Rac 1 glucosylation or cell rounding, respectively. FACS and Western blot analyses elucidated these differences and revealed a correlation between CROP-binding to the cell surface and toxin potency. These findings refute the accepted opinion of solely CROP- mediated toxin internalization. Competition experiments demonstrated that presence neither of TcdA CROPs nor of full length TcdA reduced binding of truncated TcdA 1 – 1874 to HT 29 cells. We assume that toxin uptake might additionally occur through alternative receptor structures and/or other associated endocytotic pathways.

Often, a dead-layer was determined, especially at the surfaces where the non-collecting anode (NCA) is the outermost anode rail.

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{the most}} common lethal inherited disease among Caucasians and arises due to mutations in a chloride channel, called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. A hallmark of this disease is the chronic bacterial infection of the airways, which is usually, associated with pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus and recently becoming more prominent, B. cepacia. The excessive inflammatory response, which leads to irreversible lung damage, will in the long term lead to mortality of the patient at around the age of 40 years. Understanding the pathogenesis of CF currently relies on animal models, such as those employing genetically-modified mice, and on single cell culture models, which are grown either as polarised or non-polarised epithelium in vitro. Whilst these approaches partially enable the study of disease progression in CF, both types of models have inherent limitations. The overall aim of this thesis was to establish a multicellular co-culture model of normal and CF human airways in vitro, which helps to partially overcome these limitations and permits analysis of cell-to-cell communication in the airways. These models could then be used to examine the co-ordinated response of the airways to infection with relevant pathogens in order to validate this approach over animals/single cell models. Therefore epithelial cell lines of non-CF and CF background were employed in a co-culture model together with human pulmonary fibroblasts. Co-cultures were grown on collagen-coated permeable supports at air-liquid interface to promote epithelial cell differentiation. The models were characterised and essential features for investigating CF infections and inflammatory responses were investigated and analysed. A pseudostratified like epithelial cell layer was established at air liquid interface (ALI) of mono-and co-cultures and cell layer integrity was verified by tight junction (TJ) staining and transepithelial resistance <b>measurements</b> (<b>TER).</b> Mono- and co-cultures were also found to secrete the airway mucin MUC 5 AC. Influence of bacterial infections was found to be most challenging when intact S. aureus, B. cepacia and P. aeruginosa were used. CF mono- and co-cultures were found to mimic the hyperinflammatory state found in CF, which was confirmed by analysing IL- 8 secretions of these models. These co-culture models will help to elucidate the role fibroblasts play in the inflammatory response to bacteria and will provide a useful testing platform to further investigate the dysregulated airway responses seen in CF.

40|$|We {{set up a}} {{polarized}} {{cell culture}} model to study the pathogenicity of a common respiratory tract pathogen, Chlamydia pneumoniae. Immunofluorescence staining of ZO- 1 (a tight junction protein) and Na+K+ ATPase (a protein pump localized at the basolateral membrane in the polarized epithelial cells), as well as <b>TER</b> <b>measurements,</b> suggested that the filter-grown Calu- 3 cells, but not the A 549 cells, were polarized when grown on collagen-coated membranes. Both the flat and the filter-grown cultures were infected with C. pneumoniae. Infection in the polarized Calu- 3 cultures produced more C. pneumoniae genome equivalents than infection in the flat cultures. However, this progeny was not as infective as that in the flat cultures. The maximum amount of C. pneumoniae was detected at 6 days postinfection in the filter-grown A 549 cells, indicating a slower developmental cycle than that observed in the flat A 549 cultures. The effect of cycloheximide on the growth of C. pneumoniae in the polarized cells was negligible. Furthermore, the infection in the polarized Calu- 3 cells was resistant to doxycycline, and several cytokines were released mainly on the apical side of the polarized cells in response to C. pneumoniae infection. These findings indicate that the growth of chlamydiae was altered in the filter-grown epithelial culture system. The diminished production of infective progeny of C. pneumoniae, together with the resistance to doxycycline and polarized secretion of cytokines from the infected Calu- 3 cells, suggests that this model is useful for examining epithelial cell responses to C. pneumoniae infection, and it might better resemble in vivo infection in respiratory epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|Uncontrolled {{activation}} of the alternative complement pathway and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{are thought to be}} associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Previously, we have shown that in RPE monolayers, oxidative-stress reduced complement inhibition on the cell surface. The resulting increased level of sublytic complement activation resulted in VEGF release, which disrupted the barrier facility of these cells as determined by transepithelial resistance (<b>TER)</b> <b>measurements.</b> Induced rather than basal VEGF release in RPE is thought to be controlled by different mechanisms, including voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) activation and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Here we examined the potential intracellular links between sublytic complement activation and VEGF release in RPE cells challenged with H 2 O 2 and complement-sufficient normal human serum (NHS). Disruption of barrier function by H 2 O 2 + NHS rapidly increased Ras expression and Erk and Src phosphorylation, but had no effect on P 38 phosphorylation. Either treatment alone had little effect. TER reduction could be attenuated by inhibiting Ras, Erk and Src activation, or blocking VDCC or VEGF-R 2 activation, but not by inhibiting P 38. Combinatorial analysis of inhibitor effects demonstrated that sublytic complement activation triggers VEGF secretion via two pathways, Src and Ras-Erk, with the latter being amplified by VEGF-R 2 activation, but has no effect on constitutive VEGF secretion mediated via P 38. Finally, effects on TER were directly correlated with release of VEGF; and sublytic MAC activation decreased levels of zfp 36, a negative modulator of VEGF transcription, resulting in increased VEGF expression. Taken together, identifying how sublytic MAC induces VEGF expression and secretion might offer opportunities to selectively inhibit pathological VEGF release only...|$|E
40|$|Uncontrolled {{activation}} of the alternative pathway of complement {{is thought to be}} associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The alternative pathway is continuously activated in the fluid phase, and tissue surfaces require continuous complement inhibition to prevent spontaneous autologous tissue injury. Here, we examined the effects of oxidative stress on the ability of immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE- 19) to regulate complement activation on their cell surface. Combined treatment with H 2 O 2 (to induce oxidative stress) and complement-sufficient serum was found to disrupt the barrier function of stable ARPE- 19 monolayers as determined by transepithelial resistance (<b>TER)</b> <b>measurements.</b> Neither treatment alone had any effect. TER reduction was correlated with increased cell surface deposition of C 3, and could be prevented by using C 7 -depleted serum, an essential component of the terminal complement pathway. Treatment with H 2 O 2 reduced surface expression of the complement inhibitors DAF, CD 55, and CD 59, and impaired regulation at the cell surface by factor H present within the serum. Combined treatment of the monolayers with H 2 O 2 and serum elicited polarized secretion of vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF). Both, secretion of VEGF and TER reduction could be attenuated using either an alternative pathway inhibitor or by blocking VEGF receptor- 1 / 2 signaling. Regarded together, these studies demonstrate that oxidative stress reduces regulation of complement on the surface of ARPE- 19 cells, increasing complement activation. This sublytic activation results in VEGF release, which mediates disruption of the cell monolayer. These findings link oxidative stress, complement activation, and apical VEGF release, which have all been associated with the pathogenesis of AMD...|$|E
40|$|Throughout spermatogenesis, {{germ cells}} move {{progressively}} from the basal to the adluminal compartment, which {{is accompanied by}} continual disassembly and reassembly of intercellular junctions suggesting germ cell movement is composed of intermittent phases of junction disassembly and reassembly. A study was performed to correlate the expression of junctional-complex components (such as zonula occludens- 1 [ZO- 1], a tight-junction component protein) and nonjunctional complex components (such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator [uPA], a serine protease; cathepsin L, a cysteine protease; α 2 -macroglobulin, a nonspecific protease inhibitor; and cystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor) {{at the time when}} inter-Sertoli tight junctions were established in vitro. This is an attempt to investigate whether the expression of nonjunctional component genes also correlates with the formation of inter-Sertoli tight junctions in vitro. This is {{part of an effort to}} understand the physiologic elements of germ cell movement in the epithelium. Sertoli cells cultured in vitro are known to undergo programmed cell death. To ensure that the changes in target gene expression were not the result of apoptosis, Sertoli cells were cultured in vitro at densities of 0. 25, 0. 75, and 3 x 106 cells/cm 2 for up to 7 days on bicameral culture units coated with Matrigel (Collaborative Research) and were assessed by morphologic analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. It was noted that many of the Sertoli cells cultured at 3 x 106 cells/cm 2 underwent apoptosis by day 7, in contrast to cultures at 0. 25 and 0. 75 x 106 cells/cm 2 illustrating the Sertoli cell number per unit of area may be an important parameter to be considered when studying Sertoli cell function in vitro. Also, it was shown that the expression of ZO- 1 increased significantly between days 2 and 3 prior to the establishment of inter-Sertoli tight junctions assessed by transepithelial resistance <b>measurement</b> (<b>TER),</b> which illustrates that ZO- 1 can be used as a marker to monitor this cellular event. More interestingly, there was also a transient increase in the expression of uPA and cathepsin L between days 2 and 3 at the time preceding the formation of tight junctions. In Sertoli cells cultured at low density (2 x 104 cells/cm 2), when a confluent monolayer of cells could not form, there were no changes in the expression of either ZO- 1, uPA, or cathepsin L throughout the 7 -day culture period. These results show that the establishment of specialized junctions, such as tight junctions between Sertoli cells in vitro, may require the participation of both junctional and nonjunctional complex components. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Tight {{junctions}} (TJ) {{are essential}} components of polarized epithelia, and E-cadherin {{is important for}} their formation and maintenance. The bronchial epithelial cell line, 16 HBE 14 o-expresses E- and P-cadherin, but not N-cadherin. E- and P-cadherin levels changed during culture, the former increasing after confluence, and the latter were markedly reduced. All detectable E-cadherin was bound to beta- and gamma-catenins. We investigated involvement of E-cadherin with epithelial integrity using an E-cadherin specific, function-blocking antibody, SHE 78 - 7. Surprisingly, apical SHE 78 - 7 exposure caused a prompt fall in transepithelial resistance (TER), while TER remained unchanged for 8 hrs after basal exposure then dropped. SHE 78 - 7 exposure increased epithelial permeability to mannitol, inulin, and 9. 5 kDa and 77 kDa dextrans and caused fragmentation and loss of the tight junction protein, ZO- 1, from the cell borders in some areas. Ultrastructural studies showed that all junctional intercellular contact {{was lost in the}} center of SHE 78 - 7 induced lesions. Near the lesion periphery, epithelial structure was maintained, but TJs were dysfunctional as shown by ruthenium red penetration. Analysis of epithelial penetration by SHE 78 - 7 revealed discrete, local defects in the apical barrier at the top of some cell hills that permitted rapid access of the antibody to E-cadherin near the apical surface. In contrast, after basal exposure, antibody initially engaged with E-cadherin nearer the basal surface and only accessed apical E-cadherin later. Taken together with the <b>TER</b> <b>measurements,</b> these data suggest compartmentalization of E-cadherin function within 16 HBE 14 o-cells, with only the apical E-cadherin adjacent to the tight junctions contributing to the function of the latter...|$|E
40|$|Summary Although tight {{junctions}} (TJ) have been extensively studied in simple epithelial cells, {{it is still}} unknown whether their organization is coupled to cell differentiation in stratified epithelia. We studied the expression of TJ in RCE 1 (5 T 5) cells, an in vitro model which mimics the sequential steps of rabbit corneal epithelial differentiation. RCE 1 (5 T 5) cells expressed TJ components which were assembled once cells constituted differentiated epithelia, {{as suggested by the}} increase of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) which followed a similar kinetic to the expression of the early differentiation marker Pax- 6. TJ were functional as indicated by the establishment of an epithelial barrier nonpermeable to ruthenium red or a biotin tracer. In immunostaining experiments, TJ were located at the superficial cells from the suprabasal layers; Western blot and RT-PCR suggested that TJ were composed of claudins (cldn) - 1, - 2, - 4, cingulin (cgn), occludin (ocln) and ZO- 1. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and <b>TER</b> <b>measurements</b> showed that TJ became organized when cells began to form a 3 – 5 layers stratified epithelium; TER increased once cells reached confluence, with a time course comparable to the raise in the expression of cgn, cldn- 2 and - 4. Nevertheless, cldn- 1, - 2, ZO- 1 and ocln were present in the cells from the beginning of cultivation, suggesting that TER increases mainly depend on TJ assembly. While EGF increased epithelial barrier strength, retinoic acid disrupted it, increasing paracellular flux about 2 -fold; this effect was concentration dependent and completely reversible. Our results suggest that TJ assembly is tightly linked to the expression of corneal epithelial terminal phenotype...|$|E
40|$|The barrier {{function}} of the endothelium {{has been found to}} decrease in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) elevations in the cellular cytosol, while it seems to be rescued by increasing cAMP concentrations at the membrane. This suggests that cAMP compartmentalisation may be a regulatory mechanism of {{barrier function}}. Barrier dysfunction has been implicated in disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and oedema. It remains unknown whether cAMP compartmentalisation plays a role in barrier dysfunction. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether cAMP is compartmentalised in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMEC) and how this affects barrier maintenance. Here we describe the optimisation of methods to investigate the potential cAMP compartmentalisation in hPMEC. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy allows for high resolution live monitoring of spatiotemporal changes of cyclic nucleotides. FRET membrane targeted and cytosolic sensors, respectively, were developed to compare cAMP regulation in different subcellular locations in space and time. FRET imaging studies in hPMEC have not been undertaken before, therefore cell culture conditions were optimized for this specific purpose. In addition, a chamber that combines FRET imaging with transendothelial resistance (<b>TER)</b> <b>measurements</b> was designed and constructed to determine cAMP compartmentalisation in hPMEC and its contribution to cellular barrier function. Fluorescence imaging confirmed localization of FRET reporters at the membrane and in the cytosol, respectively. Addition of 28 mM HEPES and omission of serum were judged to be appropriate in conducting future FRET experiments in hPMEC. Initial FRET-TER chamber experiments were conducted, confirming that both FRET and TER could be measured with this approach. Preliminary data, employing different stimuli and FRET reporters, are in line with the notion of cAMP is compartmentalised in hPMEC. By further optimisation and development of the methods described here, insight will be gained into the localisation and regulation of cAMP at the subcellular level and its effect on endothelial barrier function. This will help clarify whether local manipulation of cAMP signals may offer alternative approaches to the treatment of barrier function-related pathologies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Accurate {{assessment}} of probiotics with targeted anti- Salmonella activity requires suitable models accounting for both, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions in gut environments. Here we report {{the combination of}} two original in vitro intestinal models closely mimicking the complex in vivo conditions of the large intestine. Effluents from continuous in vitro three-stage fermentation colonic models of Salmonella Typhimurium infection inoculated with immobilized child microbiota and Salmonella were directly applied to confluent mucus-secreting HT 29 -MTX cell layers. The effects of Salmonella, addition of two bacteriocinogenic strains, Bifidobacterium thermophilum RBL 67 (thermophilicin B 67) and Escherichia coli L 1000 (microcin B 17), and inulin were tested on Salmonella growth and interactions with epithelial cell layers. Salmonella adhesion and invasion were investigated and epithelial integrity assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (<b>TER)</b> <b>measurements</b> and confocal microscopy observation. Data from complex effluents were compared with pure Salmonella cultures. Results Salmonella in effluents of all reactors of the colonic fermentation model stabilized at mean values of 5. 3 ± 0. 8 log 10 cfu/ml effluent. Invasion of cell-associated Salmonella was up to 50 -fold lower in complex reactor samples compared to pure Salmonella cultures. It further depended on environmental factors, with 0. 2 ± 0. 1 % being measured with proximal, 0. 6 ± 0. 2 % with transverse and 1. 3 ± 0. 7 % with distal reactor effluents, accompanied by a similar high decrease of TER across cell monolayers (minus 45 %) and disruption of tight junctions. Subsequent addition of E. coli L 1000 stimulated Salmonella growth (6. 4 ± 0. 6 log 10 cfu/ml effluent of all 3 reactors) and further decreased TER, but led to 10 -fold decreased invasion efficiency when tested with distal reactor samples. In contrast, presence of B. thermophilum RBL 67 revealed a protective effect on epithelial integrity compared to previous E. coli L 1000 periods, as reflected by a significant mean increase of TER by 58 % in all reactors. Inulin addition enhanced Salmonella growth and invasion when tested with distal and proximal reactor samples, respectively, but induced a limited decrease of TER (minus 18 %) in all reactors. Conclusions Our results highlight the benefits of combining suitable cellular and colonic fermentation models to assess strain-specific first-level host protection properties of probiotics during Salmonella infection, providing an efficient system biology tool for preclinical development of new antimicrobials. </p...|$|E
