5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is better in Antananarivo <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere</b> on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E
5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and recent history of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} is even weaker in Ratanakiri <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E

5|$|In {{neighbouring}} Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles appeared somewhat {{later in}} the 12th and 13th centuries and in more limited numbers <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> due to the less feudal society.

5|$|North of Guam, Chataan {{affected}} Rota with 74km/h (46mph) sustained {{winds and}} gusts to 120km/h (75mph) at the island's airport. Rainfall {{was much less}} <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the typhoon's path, and a 24-hour total of 38.6mm (1.52in) was reported at Rota's airport. The storm inflicted heavy damage to crops and fisheries, and 60% of farmers reported a total loss. Chataan also damaged roads on the island, many due to fallen trees. Nine huts were destroyed, and damage was estimated at $2.7million.|$|E

5|$|Britain's {{enemies in}} {{continental}} Europe had long recognised Ireland as a weak point in Britain's defences. Landing troops {{there was a}} popular strategic goal, not only because an invader could expect {{the support of a}} large proportion of the native population, but also because at least initially they would face fewer and less reliable troops <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the British Isles. Additionally, embroiling the British Army in a protracted Irish campaign would reduce its availability for other theatres of war. Finally, French planners considered that a successful invasion of Ireland might act as the ideal platform for a subsequent invasion of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|In his fifties, Elgar {{composed}} a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took {{many years to}} achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, {{to be seen as}} appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Russel {{estimated}} the Egyptian village population to be 3.3 million in 2,300 villages, a high density for rural {{populations in the}} time period. He attributes it to the high productivity of Egyptian soil which allowed for increased agricultural growth. The urban population was much lower, 233,100, consisting of 5.7% of the total Egyptian population. The largest cities were Cairo (pop.60,000), Alexandria (pop.30,000), Qus (pop.25,000), Damietta (pop.18,000), Fayyum (pop.13,000), and Bilbeis (pop.10,000). Numerous smaller cities dotted the Nile River. Among the latter were Damanhur, Asyut, and Tanta. Cities in Egypt were also densely populated, mainly because of greater urbanization and industrialization <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Silk weaving is the {{dominant}} industry in Varanasi. Muslims are the influential community in this industry with {{nearly half a million}} of them working as weavers, dyers, sari finishers, and salespersons. Weaving is typically done within the household, and most weavers are Momin Ansari Muslims. Varanasi is known throughout India for its production of very fine silk and Banarasi saris, brocades with gold and silver thread work, which are often used for weddings and special occasions. The production of silk often uses bonded child labour, though perhaps not at a higher rate <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in India. The silk weaving industry has recently been threatened by the rise of power looms and computer-generated designs and by competition from Chinese silk imports.|$|E

5|$|The {{handwriting}} of {{the text}} {{from the beginning of}} Luke to 1 Corinthians 10:8, differs from that of the rest parts of the manuscript. Some letters have Coptic shapes (f.e. Α, Μ, Δ, and Π). The letters are more widely spaced and are a little larger <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere.</b> Delta has extended base and Pi has extended cross-stroke. Numerals are not expressed by letters except in Apocalypse 7:4; 21:17. In the past the codex had been judged to be carelessly written, with many errors of transcription, but not so many as in the Codex Sinaiticus, nor more than in the Codex Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|Two {{forms of}} juldarigi, from Gijisi (Dangjin) and Yeongsang, are {{recognised}} as Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea. The Yeongsan ceremony is held {{later in the}} year <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> having been moved from the lunar festival to March 1 in the mid-twentieth century (to commemorate the March 1st Movement). In 2009, a special ₩20000 coin was minted in South Korea commemorating the Yeongsan juldarigi. In Gijisi, where the sport has been practiced for at least 500 years, the traditional East/West divide is replaced with a division of teams into upriver and downriver. The centipede-like shape of the rope is said to resemble {{the way in which the}} villages of the region are arranged. Gijisi is also home to a museum devoted to the practice of juldarigi.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, law {{enforcement}} in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals. In 1740, the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier (Banal Frontier), specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin Generalcies. The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule there in the early 19th century. The term has dropped from official use for law enforcement officials, but it is still used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word cop. The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as Trenck's Pandurs, and less frequently in Croatia <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere,</b> as Croatian Pandurs.|$|E

5|$|Pedro de Alvarado {{passed through}} Soconusco with a {{sizeable}} force in 1523, {{en route to}} conquer Guatemala. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; he {{was accompanied by a}} great many indigenous allies. Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces. Due to the economic importance of cacao to the new colony, the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established cacao orchards. As a result, the inhabitants of Soconusco {{were less likely to be}} rounded up into new reducción settlements <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in Chiapas, since the planting of a new cacao crop would have required five years to mature.|$|E
5|$|The {{floods and}} mudslides killed {{many people in}} Haiti, {{although}} the exact total will likely never be known. On November19, officials reported 531deaths, and by two days later the total was potentially as high as 2,000. On November24, the death toll reached 824, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on December21 that Gordon killed 1,122people in the country. Most of the deaths occurred in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, and Léogâne. Damage was heavier in Haiti <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere</b> along Gordon's track due to poor infrastructure consisting of shacks on flood-prone denuded hills. The country suffers large death tolls from many hurricanes, caused in part by human activity. Large-scale deforestation left Haiti with about 1.4% of its forests as of 2004, leaving denuded mountain slopes that allows rainwater to wash down unimpeded. The lack of tree cover contributed to the devastating floods that caused most of Gordon's deaths.|$|E
5|$|According to the Köppen classification, the British Isles {{experience}} a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Lincolnshire's {{position on the}} east of the Isles allows for a sunnier and warmer climate relative to the national average, and {{it is one of the}} driest counties in the United Kingdom. Although it may vary depending on altitude and proximity to the coast, the mean average temperature for the East of England is approximately 9°C to 10.5°C; the highest temperature recorded in the region was 37.3°C at Cavendish on 10 August 2003. On average, the region experiences 30 days of rainfall in winter and 25 in summer, with 15 days of thunder and 6–8 days of hail per year; on 25 August 2001, hail the size of golf balls were reported in Sleaford and other parts of central Lincolnshire. Wind tends to affect the north and west of the country more than the East, and Lincolnshire tends to receive no more than 2 days of gale per year (where gale is a gust of wind at >34knots, sustained for at least 10 minutes). Despite this, tornadoes form more often in the East of England <b>than</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the country; Sleaford experienced tornadoes in 2006 and 2012, both of which caused damage to property.|$|E
