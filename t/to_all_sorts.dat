25|$|For a decade, colleges had {{required}} {{science and}} engineering majors to take a course in computer programming, typically using the FORTRAN or BASIC languages. This meant there was a sizable customer base who knew about computers. In 1970, electronic calculators were not seen outside of a laboratory, but by 1974 they were a common household item. Calculators and video games like Pong introduced computer power to the general public. Electronics hobbyists were moving on to digital projects such as digital voltmeters and frequency counters.

25|$|The {{authorization}} {{system was}} against Article 21 {{of the constitution}} that guarantees {{the freedom of speech}} and expression. Writing and publication of history textbook is a form of speech that is protected by the Constitution; however, the system of school textbook authorization as it was practiced in 1965 conducted thought control and prohibited publication and use of textbooks at schools that were deemed inappropriate according to a particular political ideology held by the government. According to Ienaga this falls under the category of censorship (検閲) that is prohibited by Section 2, Article 21 of the Constitution of Japan. Article 21 specifically prohibits censorship in an independent section because it is the principle of the democratic constitution of Japan that the people are guaranteed the opportunities to freely enjoy the results of scholastic researches, be exposed <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of ideas and opinions, and know socio-political reality and historical truth through various media such as press, radio, and television.|$|E

His tastes were not particularly elevated, but they were thoroughly English; and he showed much (though not unfailing) comprehension for the common instincts of the people over whom he reigned. This was not the less remarkable because, though a good linguist in French and German, he never learned to speak English without a German accent.|$|E

500|$|In September 1939 after Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union both invaded and {{occupied}} Poland, as a {{fulfillment of the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact they had signed earlier, Lwów initially came under Soviet occupation. Steinhaus considered escaping to Hungary but ultimately decided to remain in Lwów. The Soviets reorganized the university {{to give it a}} more Ukrainian character, but they did appoint Stefan Banach (Steinhaus's student) as the dean of the mathematics department and Steinhaus resumed teaching there. The faculty of the department at the school were also strengthened by several Polish refugees from German occupied Poland. According to Steinhaus, during the experience of this period, he [...] "acquired an insurmountable physical disgust in regard <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of Soviet administrators, politicians and commissars" ...|$|E

In a 1997 interview, Harrison said that the song's inclusion reflected the band's willingness to experiment during this period, adding: [...] "We were listening <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of things, Stockhausen, avant-garde music, whatever, {{and most of it}} made its way onto our records." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{overview}} of the fourth season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] was rated an A-. It was noted that the episode [...] "makes good use of locations", and the ambiguous resolution to Jeremiah Smith's plot arc was seen as a positive, as it [...] "opens the door <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of provocative potentialities". Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B+, though he felt it suffered from [...] "treading-water plotting". Handlen also described the episode as being tense on its own, but suffering from [...] "stagnation" [...] when held as part of the series' ongoing mythology. He cited the death of X as an example of this, feeling that the scene was [...] "appropriately shocking" [...] and perhaps [...] "one of the most memorable deaths in the series"—however, the almost immediate introduction of a successor character, Marita Covarrubias, was seen as [...] "deflat the importance" [...] of the events.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{was remarkably}} adept at {{recognizing}} new writing talent and making innovative works {{appealing to the}} public. More importantly, he functioned {{as a catalyst for}} experimentation by bringing disparate authors together. While Johnson promoted his authors, he retreated into the background himself. His friend John Aikin explained that he had [...] "a decided aversion <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of puffing and parade"; Johnson's unassuming character has left historians and literary critics sparse material from which to reconstruct his life. For 200 years, it was assumed that all of Johnson's business records and correspondence had been destroyed, but in the early 1990s, one of his [...] "letter books" [...] was discovered in an old desk. It contained copies of letters written to business associates as well as friends from 1795 to 1809. His letters to other publishers discuss [...] "paper, printing, engraving costs, delivery dates, breaches of copyright, binding charges and accounts" [...] whereas his letters to friends include missives to Priestley, Maria Edgeworth, Erasmus Darwin, Charlotte Smith, and others. This material has allowed scholars to theorize more concretely about Johnson's life and work.|$|E
500|$|Carey's second book, Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome, {{examines}} {{developments in}} the study of junk DNA, or noncoding DNA. DNA that doesn't code for proteins has been dismissed as nonfunctional until recently. [...] She explains the [...] "most fundamental reason for the shift in emphasis is the sheer volume of junk DNA that our cells contain. One of the biggest shocks when the human genome sequence was completed in 2001 was the discovery that over 98 per cent of the DNA in a human is junk. It doesn't code for any proteins." [...] Carey describes how this Junk DNA maintains the integrity of our chromosomes; regulates the ways the protein-coding genes are expressed; influences how we age and generally introduces incredible degrees of subtlety and flexibility into how we use the relatively small numbers of genes that code for proteins... contributes <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of situations, from the correct control of gene expression in female cells to the regulation of pathways that drive cancer. [...] From Ernest Hemingway's mutant cat to exoneration of the innocent through DNA fingerprinting, junk DNA impacts on an astonishing range of biological phenomena.|$|E
500|$|AJ {{brings out}} a {{different}} side to Masood, which Ganatra said could [...] "upset the status quo". He said that AJ {{was brought in}} [...] "to stir up Masood's life, and that has exciting prospects", and they would [...] "get up <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>sorts</b> of shenanigans." [...] Presenter Kate Thornton, when interviewing Ganatra, said AJ was a [...] "playmate" [...] for Masood, while Wadia said that AJ brings the comedy back to Masood. Inside Soap Kate White called AJ [...] "a world away from family man Masood", while Soaplife said AJ is [...] "not a good influence but he sure puts a smile on [...] face and a new spring in his step." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, {{you get to see}} what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on the straight and narrow [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ as somebody with [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm interested to see him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..." [...] AJ is accepting of Syed's homosexuality and his relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge).|$|E
