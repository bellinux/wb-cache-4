40|$|Recent {{evidence}} shows that developing countries and transition economies are increasingly privatising their public firms {{and at the same}} time experiencing rapid growth of inward foreign direct investment (FDI). In an international mixed oligopoly, we analyse the interaction between privatisation and FDI. We show that privatisation increases <b>the</b> <b>incentive</b> for FDI, which in turn, increases <b>the</b> <b>incentive</b> for privatisation compared to the situation of no FDI. The optimal degree of privatisation depends on the cost difference between the public and the foreign firms, and on the foreign firm's mode of entry.

5|$|Because of {{repetitive}} {{actions and}} long-playing times, 4X games {{have been criticized}} for excessive micromanagement. In early stages of a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games. 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony's build orders, but players criticized these governors for making poor decisions. In response, developers have tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement, and some approaches have been more well received than others. Commentators generally agree that Galactic Civilizations succeeds, which GamingNexus.com attributes to the game's use of programmable governors. Sins of a Solar Empire was designed to reduce <b>the</b> <b>incentives</b> for micromanagement, and reviewers found that the game's interface made empire management more elegant. On the other hand, Master of Orion III reduced micromanagement by limiting complete player control over their empire.|$|E

When observable and unobservable risks are sufficiently positively correlated, increases (decreases) in observable risk generate <b>the</b> <b>incentive</b> for manager-equityholders to increase (decrease) unobservable risk. Thus, credible commitments to hedge observable risk can benefit the firm's manager-equityholders by reducing <b>the</b> <b>incentive</b> to shift risk and the associated agency cost of debt.
