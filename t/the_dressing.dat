5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> room from where they {{would have been able to}} hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|Beechwood Theater, {{a replica}} of the Little Theater on Broadway, was {{included}} in Wells Bosworth's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly wanted his own theater. Beechwood Theater, with 256 gold velvet seats, was designed by Winthrop Ames around 1917. Details were closely examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and fly gallery, and <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> rooms were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The stage floor was designed especially for dancing, and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.|$|E
5|$|Boston police {{attempted}} to arrest Richard in <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> room {{after the game}} ended, but were turned back by Canadiens players who barred the door, preventing any arrest. Bruins management finally persuaded the officers to leave with a promise that the NHL would handle the issue. Richard was never arrested for the incident. He was instead sent to the hospital by team doctors after complaining of headaches and stomach pains.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>dress</b> of Muslim men is {{much like}} <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> of Hindu men, {{and can not be}} {{differentiated}} unless Muslims wear taqiyah and sherwani, and keep a beard. <b>The</b> <b>dress</b> of Muslim women is the hijab.|$|R
50|$|There are six {{different}} dress codes for BB Officers for various functions and occasions.

50|$|Higher weights {{are then}} {{applied to the}} cloth {{vertices}} close to the hip so that they hug the character quite closely compared to the cloth farther down <b>the</b> <b>dress.</b> To make <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> more realistic, {{it is possible to}} assign cloth weights of even 0 to much of <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> because springs hold the cloth together; one must keep in mind, however, that doing this for <b>the</b> entire <b>dress</b> would effectively cancel the attachment of <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> to <b>the</b> character.|$|R
5|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry {{and devotion}} to duty whilst engaged in pack transport work near HOGGE {{on the night}} of 15 September 1917. Lieutenant DENNY showed great coolness and initiative throughout, especially when his convoy came under very heavy barrage in the vicinity of CLAPHAM JUNCTION. Although wounded himself, Lieut. DENNY personally obtained assistance for two of his men who were wounded. He then reorganised his command and succeeded in reaching his destination. Lieut.

5|$|Fulfordgate did not {{initially}} have any covered stands, and <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> rooms consisted {{of an old}} army hut, before open stands were bought from York Race Committee. The ground was gradually built up and improved, and covered accommodation was available after two years. In 1927, new turnstiles were installed and stronger fencing was built around the pitch, which {{made it more difficult}} for spectators to surmount it and access the pitch. Nine-tier terracing replaced the old banking behind one of the goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to hold 1,000 supporters and there a small seated stand was erected.|$|E
5|$|Gardiner's health {{continued}} {{to be an issue}} throughout the 1934 NHL playoffs. On March 29, 1934 in a playoff game against the Montreal Maroons Gardiner had a shutout as the Black Hawks won 3–0; though he was named first star as the best player of the game, Gardiner was in extreme pain during the entire game with a fever of 102 Fahrenheit and was attended to by a doctor in <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> room during intermissions.|$|E
50|$|A cape dress {{describes}} a woman's dress which combines {{features of the}} cape and <b>the</b> <b>dress.</b> Either a cape-like garment is attached to <b>the</b> <b>dress,</b> or otherwise integrated into its construction, or <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> and cape are made to co-ordinate in fabric and/or colour. Cape dresses were traditionally worn by (conservative) Mennonite women. Unlike the prayer (head) covering, <b>the</b> cape <b>dress</b> never became part of dress regulations. Besides its historical associations with Mennonite <b>dress,</b> <b>the</b> cape <b>dress</b> {{has become part of}} fashion vocabulary.|$|R
5|$|Fernandez was {{approached}} by fellow designer and stylist Formichetti to produce <b>the</b> <b>dress,</b> with it planned out {{over the course of}} a week, Formichetti having styled <b>the</b> look. <b>The</b> <b>dress</b> was asymmetrical, with a cowled–neck.

Flank steak was chosen as the material to use, with the meat coming from his family butcher. <b>The</b> <b>dress</b> required Gaga to be stitched into the outfit backstage.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} partial charge-spin {{separation}} fermion-spin theory implemented <b>the</b> gauge invariant <b>dressed</b> holon and spinon. In this novel approach, the physical electron is decoupled as <b>the</b> gauge invariant <b>dressed</b> holon and spinon, with <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> holon behaviors like a spinful fermion, and represents the charge {{degree of freedom}} together with the phase part of the spin degree of freedom, while <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> spinon is a hard-core boson, and represents the amplitude part of the spin degree of freedom, then the electron single occupancy local constraint is satisfied. Within this approach, the charge transport and spin response of the underdoped cuprates is studied. It is shown that the charge transport is mainly governed by the scattering from <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> holons due to <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> spinon fluctuation, while the scattering from <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> spinons due to <b>the</b> <b>dressed</b> holon fluctuation dominates the spin response.

5|$|Little {{can be seen}} of {{the levels}} now for the entrances were {{destroyed}} when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners’ path which zigzags up the hillside, a self-acting incline to lower ore to <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> floor, and the old winding-drum house. The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the fellside.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish fans in the crowd kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch and gestured to the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took his place in the dugout and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E

500|$|The Journal of Vision, a {{scientific}} journal about vision research, announced in March 2015 that {{a special issue}} about <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> would be published with <b>the</b> title A <b>Dress</b> Rehearsal for Vision Science. Scientific work is ongoing. The first large-scale scientific study on <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> was published in Current Biology {{three months after the}} image went viral. The study, which involved 1,400 respondents, found that 57% saw <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> as blue and black; 30% saw it as white and gold; 10% saw it as blue and brown; and 10% could switch between any of the colour combinations. A small number saw it as blue and gold. Women and older people disproportionately saw <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> as white and gold. The researchers further found that if <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> was shown in artificial yellow-coloured lighting almost all respondents saw <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> as black and blue, while they saw it as white and gold if the simulated lighting had a blue bias. [...] Another study in the Journal of Vision found that people who were early risers were more likely to think <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> was lit by natural light, perceiving it as white and gold, and that 'night owls' saw <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> as blue and black.|$|R
50|$|Further, Christ University has {{received}} backlash from several students regarding <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> code. For boys, <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> code is formal pants, shirts and a tie. For girls, <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> code is Indian salwar-kameez with a dupatta, compulsorily. Boys {{are not allowed}} to grow a beard or roll up their sleeves, and girls {{are not allowed to}} wear leggings. Very often, students have criticized the management for not providing a rational behind <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> code and have been shamed for being discriminatory.|$|R
5|$|On 21 June 2014, it was {{announced}} that the Salt Lake Stadium would undergo a renovation in preparation for the 2014 season.

Atlético Madrid meanwhile said they would help install 25,000 bucket seats to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{held the}} Newcastle post until 30 August 2004, {{when he was}} {{dismissed}} by Freddy Shepherd, after a poor start to the Premier League season and alleged discontent in <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> room. Robson's dismissal followed publication of his off the record observation of his disappointment that only 5,000 fans stayed to see the traditional lap of honour made by the players at St James' Park {{at the end of}} the previous season. However, he remains held in the highest esteem by the fans; he was granted the Freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne on 2 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes were}} made during the renovation. The {{vertical}} marquee which had marked the theatre's presence from 1926 to 1980, was removed, the orchestra pit and auditorium seating were rebuilt, <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> rooms moved, and the technical systems updated. However, the furniture, fixtures and interior signage were retained. Even the paint was carefully restored to its original luster. The renovation made it suitable again for live performances and filled Seattle's need for a touring Broadway musical venue. Renovation work was completed without federal, state, or local funds.|$|E
50|$|Twigley donated <b>the</b> <b>dress</b> to {{national}} children's charity TLC for Kids. <b>The</b> <b>dress</b> was auctioned off in October 2004, going for A$23,000.

5|$|The final whistle blew {{with the}} score {{remaining}} at 1–1. The Scottish players began celebrating their achievement with the estimated 12,000 Scotland fans {{who had made}} the trip to Cardiff, but were immediately aware that something was not right on the touchline, although with the level of commotion they were unclear precisely what was happening. It was Alex Ferguson, who went onto the pitch after the final whistle, who began informing some of the players of Stein's collapse, news of which began to filter through to all of them {{as they made their way}} back to <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> room.|$|E
5|$|A further {{tour of the}} US {{was planned}} for December 1976, {{but it had to}} be {{cancelled}} when, on 23 November, Brian Robertson suffered a hand injury when trying to protect fellow Glaswegian, singer and friend Frankie Miller in a fracas at the Speakeasy Club in London. Miller had been jamming onstage with the reggae band Gonzalez, but had been drunk, offending Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte. Hunte attacked Miller with a bottle in <b>the</b> <b>dressing</b> room, and Robertson intervened, suffering artery and nerve damage to his hand. Robertson subsequently broke Hunte's leg, broke the collarbone of another man, and headbutted another, before being hit on the head with a bottle, rendering him unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Arya {{once again}} returns {{to watch the}} play {{featuring}} Lady Crane. She sneaks backstage during the last act and poisons Lady Crane's rum.

5|$|Dromedary {{slaughter}} is {{more difficult}} than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, {{because of the size}} of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. <b>The</b> <b>dressing</b> percentage the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass is 55–70%, more than the 45–50% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.|$|E
