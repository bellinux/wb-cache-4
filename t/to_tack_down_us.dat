50|$|Another related {{issue for}} {{avoiding}} costly repairs (or disasters) {{is the proper}} operation of a home, including systems and appliances, {{in a way that}} prevents damage or prolongs their usefulness. For example, at higher latitudes, even a clean rain gutter can suddenly build up an ice dam in winter, forcing melt water into unprotected roofing, resulting in leaks or even flooding inside walls or rooms. This can be prevented by installing moisture barrier beneath the roofing tiles. A wary home-owner should be alert to the conditions that can result in larger problems and take remedial action before damage or injury occurs. It may be easier <b>to</b> <b>tack</b> <b>down</b> a bit of worn carpet than repair a large patch damaged by prolonged misuse. Another example is to seek out the source of unusual noises or smells when mechanical, electrical or plumbing systems are operating—sometimes they indicate incipient problems. One should avoid overloading or otherwise misusing systems, and a recurring overload may indicate time for an upgrade.|$|R

40|$|In 2008, Thomas Beatie, {{a legally}} {{recognized}} male, transgender man, became pregnant {{with his first}} child and approached the American mass media {{to tell his story}} and defend his decisions. Shortly thereafter, the public fought against his image, attempting to normalize his body and gender. Beatie 2 ̆ 7 s unique gender blurring, his choice for exposure and social recognition, and the resulting public controversy surrounding the incident makes for an important test case to understand Beatie 2 ̆ 7 s discursive and visual strategies directed toward the American public. This study, a rhetorical examination of the discourse and iconic visual image used by Beatie while his pregnant body received coverage by the mass media, seeks specifically to address the shortcomings in the study of discursive strategies for recognition of trans individuals. It uses the framing and theory of apologia rhetoric to understand Beatie 2 ̆ 7 s rhetorical choices. This project classifies and analyzes Beatie 2 ̆ 7 s messages, specifically looking for ways Beatie creates agency, identification and blurs his sex/gender identity. In exploring Beatie 2 ̆ 7 s discourse, this dissertation assesses the following fundamental questions about his discourse: to what degree does his apologia rhetoric operate as recognition? How well is he able to construct persuasive messages of apologia that allow him to be recognized in codes of pregnancy and masculinity at the same time? In interrogating these questions, this project evaluates Beatie 2 ̆ 7 s strategies and determines how they inform conclusions about apologia rhetoric, performatives, and the current American ideologies on sex and gender. I demonstrate the fundamental impossibility of being recognized as both an intelligible pregnant man and explain why Beatie cannot defend certain choices or aspects of his life because his recognition is always incomplete and impossible. It concludes that Beatie acquires a sense of control {{at the same time that}} he asks for recognition of a body that is unintelligible to the public. His demand for recognition and its inevitable failure confounds the present system and makes him an individual that is difficult <b>to</b> <b>tack</b> <b>down</b> according <b>to</b> the contemporary sex/gender binary. Most importantly, his partial success and partial failed recognition may be necessary to disrupt long-standing sex/gender norms and cultural assumptions about bodies...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} in which it grows, U. paniculata has little competition from other plants. It is heat tolerant and highly resistant to drought, salinity and brief inundation by sea water. It grows in loose sand rather than finer-grained silty or clay-rich soils and does not tolerate water-logging. The plants tend to trap blowing sand, and burial of the plant base by sand stimulates growth and helps the plant spread by <b>tacking</b> <b>down</b> the rhizomes.|$|R

5000|$|There are regular sailing {{regattas}} {{on national}} holidays which are contested by locally built and designed boats. These regattas do {{not conform to}} international sailing rules with regard to right of way. Instead, there is only one rule, known as the [...] "hard lee" [...] rule. (The name derives from the motion required <b>to</b> <b>tack</b> a tiller boat, which is to push the tiller [...] "hard to leeward"). In the event that two boats on opposite tacks are on a collision course, {{one or both of the}} captains may elect to call [...] "hard lee" [...] to the other. When this call is made, both boats must tack regardless of whether it is advantageous or not. The objective of this manoeuvre is to attempt to gain as much distance upwind as possible before having <b>to</b> <b>tack</b> <b>to</b> avoid a collision. Alternatively, one captain may decide to [...] "draw" [...] and either tack earlier or change his point of sail to avoid the manoeuvre. This means a loss in height, but it may be preferable <b>to</b> <b>tacking</b> towards a shallow reef or other unfavourable position.|$|R

This method is fast to implement and is recommended by sail training bodies such as the RYA as a 'quick stop' reaction to a man overboard emergency, for sailing boats that have an engine available for further maneuvers to approach {{and pick up the}} casualty.|$|R
