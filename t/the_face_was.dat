25|$|Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College has {{its share}} of ghostly and urban legends. The most famous is the Faceless Nun. It is said that one of the Sisters had a talent for {{painting}} portraits. Her method of painting was to always paint every detail of the portrait, taking her time for days and weeks, and saving the face for last. She always insisted that <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> the most important part and required the most attention. She would spend countless hours working on every detail of the face of her subject. Once she started on the portrait's face, she would devote her entire time to it until perfection was reached.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other therapsids, dicynodonts {{had very}} short snouts and no teeth {{except for the}} tusk-like upper canines. Dicynodonts are {{generally}} thought to have had horny beaks like those of turtles, for shearing off pieces of vegetation which were then ground on a horny secondary palate when the mouth was closed. The jaw joint was weak and moved backwards and forwards with a shearing action, instead of the more common sideways or up and down movements. It is thought that the jaw muscles were attached unusually far forward on the skull and took {{up a lot of}} space on the top and back of the skull. As a result, the eyes were set high and well forward on the skull, and <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> short.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, {{the church}} exhumed {{the body for}} a third time. They took relics, which were sent to Rome. A precise imprint of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> molded so that the firm of Pierre Imans in Paris could make a wax mask based on the {{imprints}} and on some genuine photos {{to be placed on}} her body. This was common practice for relics in France as it was feared that the blackish tinge to the face and the sunken eyes and nose would make an unpleasant impression on the public. Imprints of the hands were also taken for the presentation of the body and the making of wax casts. The remains were then placed in a gold and crystal reliquary in the Chapel of Saint Bernadette at the mother house in Nevers.|$|E
25|$|Shafi'i: The Shafi'i {{school has}} had two {{well-known}} positions on this issue. The first view is that covering of <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> not obligatory (fard). The second view <b>is</b> that covering <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> obligatory only in times of fitnah (where men do not lower their gaze; or when a woman is very attractive).|$|R
5000|$|The correct view as {{indicated}} by the evidence <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> woman's <b>face</b> <b>is</b> 'awrah which must be covered.

50|$|The {{shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>is</b> {{influenced}} by <b>the</b> bone-structure of the skull, and each <b>face</b> <b>is</b> unique through <b>the</b> anatomical variation {{present in the}} bones of the viscerocranium (and neurocranium). The bones involved in shaping <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>are</b> mainly <b>the</b> maxilla, mandible, nasal bone and zygomatic bone. Also important are various soft tissues, such as fat, hair and skin (of which color may vary).|$|R
25|$|A recent {{discovery}} {{has been}} the oldest pre Hispanic tomb, dated to between 700 and 500 BCE. It {{was found in a}} previously excavated 20-meter-tall pyramid, but in the very center. The occupant is richly attired with more than twenty axes found as offerings, placed in the cardinal directions. The culture is considered to be Olmec although more exact dating needs to be done. The offerings show Olmec influence, such as depictions of wide eyes and lips, but other typical Olmec decorations such as earspools and breastplates are missing. In addition to the axes, there are also more than three thousand pieces made of jade, river pearls, obsidian and amber, from areas as far away as Guatemala and the Valley of Mexico, showing trade networks. <b>The</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> covered in a seashell with eye and mouth openings, the earliest example of a funeral mask. The burial shows that many elements of Mesoamerican burials are older than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{assigned}} as a supervising animator on The Lion King, Nik Ranieri did character {{designs and}} test animation for Timon, but {{moved over to}} Pocahontas growing frustrated with an indecisive vision from the directors. There, {{he was assigned to}} animate Redfeather until Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered for the animals to be mute. Finding feathers difficult for Redfeather to gesture with, he was again assigned to animate Meeko using a Little Golden Books animal book illustrated by Alice and Martin Provensen as reference. Duncan Marjoribanks utilized geometric shapes to create Ratcliffe. In early drafts of the character, he had the body similar to a pear, but to make him appear more arrogant, the animator increased the force of gravity on his chest so that he seemed more pompous and physically threatening. Chris Buck served as the supervising animator for Percy, Wiggins, and Grandmother Willow. For Grandmother Willow, <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> traditionally animated by Buck, while the cowl and the trunk of the tree was digitally animated under the supervision of Steve Goldberg. Assisted with the effect animators, a 3D software program was employed for the bark to be individually manipulated and for the face to match with the computer-generated texture. The following supervising animators included Anthony DeRosa for Nakoma, Michael Cedeno for Kocoum, Ken Duncan for Thomas, T. Daniel Hofstedt for the settlers Lon and Ben, and Dave Pruiksma for Flit. While Mulan was within its pre-production stages, 18 minutes were animated by 170 animators and artists at the Disney-MGM Studios.|$|E

The image of the beating heart in the furnace was created by overlapping a shot of a fake beating heart and a shot of actual fire. The two were then merged in post-production by animator John Wash, because the fire would have melted the actual heart model. The beating of the hearts of Naciamento's victims was created via a pump that was operated off-screen.

He designed the figure with a strong, uncomplicated silhouette, which would be set off well by its dramatic harbor placement and allow passengers on vessels entering New York Bay to experience a changing perspective on the statue as they proceeded toward Manhattan.

Jackson also compared The Face to SBTRKT's material, given that the record successfully works for both a club environment and a mainstream pop audience. However, his major criticisms were that all the tracks were too similar to each other, a problem further hurt by the EP's longer-than-20-minute runtime, and the vocal features were [...] "underwhelming". One negative review from a Drowned in Sound critic called The Face a [...] "disappointing miscalculation of overegged trends with little real personality of its own" [...] that could only be enjoyed in a club setting, writing that the same [...] "soulfulness" [...] that was a major part of music by Joy Orbison was hard to find on the EP.|$|E
