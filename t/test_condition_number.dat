40|$|The flow {{behavior}} {{within the}} upper-surface boundary layer and near {{wake of a}} supercritical airfoil operating at cruise conditions is discussed. Experimental results obtained from wind-tunnel tests are presented which provide a more {{detailed description of the}} flow in these regions than was previously available. Mean streamwise velocity profiles measured by pitot-pressure-probe and laser-velocimeter techniques were found to be in excellent agreement. Other mean-flow properties obtained by the laser-velocimeter technique were the local flow angles in the viscous layers and the static pressures {{at the edges of the}} boundary layer and wake. The data set also includes measurements of the turbulence intensity and turbulent Reynolds-stress distributions as obtained by the laser-velocimeter technique.

40|$|Experience {{during the}} past 6 years of {{operation}} of the 0. 3 -meter transonic cryogenic tunnel at the NASA Langley Research Center has shown that there are problems associated with efficient operation and control of cryogenic tunnels using manual control schemes. This {{is due to the}} high degree of process crosscoupling between the independent control variables (temperature, pressure, and fan drive speed) and the desired <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> (Mach <b>number</b> and Reynolds number). One problem has been the inability to maintain long-term accurate control of the test parameters. Additionally, the time required to change from one <b>test</b> <b>condition</b> to another has proven to be excessively long and much less efficient than desirable in terms of liquid nitrogen and electrical power usage. For these reasons, studies have been undertaken to: (1) develop and validate a mathematical model of the 0. 3 -meter cryogenic tunnel process, (2) utilize this model in a hybrid computer simulation to design temperature and pressure feedback control laws, and (3) evaluate the adequacy of these control schemes by analysis of closed-loop experimental data.

Test results with both suction and injection is presented and discussed to understand the extent of influence of seepage in the depth-wise direction.

Two different Reynolds numbers (Re= 31000 and 47500) were used for each <b>test</b> <b>condition.</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> were chosen {{in order to keep}} flow condition as sub-critical (i. e.

The results from the analysis show that the effect of seepage on different turbulent characteristics is not restricted to the near-bed region but can be seen for most of the flow depth. Effect of injection on different turbulent characteristics is more evident with the lower flow rate, however the effect of suction seems to be independent of the flow rates.

A mathematical model {{has been used to}} examine fluid flows and heat transfer of the aviation kerosene RP- 3 with endothermic fuel pyrolysis at a supercritical pressure of 5 MPa. A pyrolytic reaction mechanism, which consists of 18 species and 24 elementary reactions, is incorporated to account for fuel pyrolysis. Detailed model validations are conducted against a series of experimental data, including fluid temperature, fuel conversion rate, various product yields, and chemical heat sink, fully verifying the accuracy and reliability of the model. Effects of fuel pyrolysis and inlet flow velocity on flow dynamics and heat transfer characteristics of RP- 3 are investigated. Results reveal that the endothermic fuel pyrolysis significantly improves the heat transfer process in the high fluid temperature region. During the supercritical-pressure heat transfer process, the flow velocity significantly increases, caused by the drastic variations of thermophysical properties.
