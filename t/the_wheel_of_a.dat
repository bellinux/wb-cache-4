25|$|Victory went to Schumacher at <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Ferrari in appalling conditions. It was {{something}} of a farce, for in addition to the pit lane confusion, he was penalised 10sec for passing another racer under a yellow flag. The stewards failed to inform the teams of their decision in the proper manner so Schumacher took his stop go penalty in the pits, after the race was over! McLaren appealed to the FIA, but the appeal was rejected and the results were confirmed, with Häkkinen second in the McLaren and Eddie Irvine third in the second Ferrari.|$|E
