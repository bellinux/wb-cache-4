5|$|Fellow Workers, {{this is the}} Continental Congress of <b>the</b> <b>working-class.</b> We {{are here}} to confederate the workers of this country into a working-class {{movement}} that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of <b>the</b> <b>working-class</b> from the slave bondage of capitalism. The aims and objects of this organization shall be to put <b>the</b> <b>working-class</b> in possession of the economic power, the means of life, {{in control of the}} machinery of production and distribution, without regard to capitalist masters.|$|E
5|$|Paris grew in {{population}} from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780. A new boulevard, the Champs-Élysées, extended the city west to Étoile, while <b>the</b> <b>working-class</b> neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine {{on the eastern}} site of the city grew more and more crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if it were to have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to <b>the</b> <b>working-class</b> by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E

5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by <b>the</b> <b>working-class.</b> Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures {{we had to go}} through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted not so much on the field of play as off it".|$|E
5|$|On 13 April German troops {{took over}} the Market Square, the Smolna, the Presidential Palace, and the Senate-Ritarihuone area. Toward the end, the Brigade Wolf with 2,000–3,000 {{soldiers}} joined the battle. The units rushed from north to the eastern parts of Helsinki, pushing into <b>the</b> <b>working-class</b> neighborhoods of Hermanni, Kallio and Sörnäinen. German artillery bombarded and destroyed the Workers' Hall, and put out the Red lantern of the Finnish revolution. The eastern parts of the town surrendered around 2 p.m., 13 April; a white flag {{was raised in the}} tower of the Kallio Church, but sporadic fighting lasted until the evening. In total, 60 Germans, 300–400 Reds and 23 White Guard troopers were killed in the battle. Around 7,000 Reds were captured. The German army celebrated the victory and demonstrated the might with a major military parade in the centre of Helsinki on 14 April 1918.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and brought up in <b>the</b> <b>working-class</b> area of Tinsley. The family later moved {{to the village of}} Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater {{prosperity}} but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as he was aware that Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12–2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3–1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier.|$|E

5|$|Women {{were not}} {{explicitly}} banned from voting in Great Britain until the 1832 Reform Act and the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act. In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as <b>the</b> <b>working-class</b> areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of pithead baths, led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little {{could be further from the}} truth in a society controlled by men.|$|E

25|$|Hegemony was a term {{previously}} used by Marxists such as Vladimir Lenin {{to denote}} {{the political leadership}} of <b>the</b> <b>working-class</b> in a democratic revolution. Gramsci greatly expanded this concept, developing an acute analysis of how the ruling capitalist class – the bourgeoisie – establishes and maintains its control.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} Gramsci's {{theories}} of hegemonic power, {{he argued that}} capitalist power needed to be challenged by building a counter-hegemony. By this he meant that, {{as part of the}} war of position, the organic intellectuals and others within <b>the</b> <b>working-class,</b> need to develop alternative values and an alternative ideology in contrast to bourgeois ideology. He argued that the reason this had not needed to happen in Russia was because the Russian ruling-class did not have genuine hegemonic power. So the Bolsheviks were able to see through a war of manoeuvre (the 1917 revolution), relatively easily, because ruling-class hegemony had never been fully achieved. He believed that a final war of manoeuvre was only possible, in the developed and advanced capitalist societies, when the war of position had been won by the organic intellectuals and <b>the</b> <b>working-class</b> building a counter-hegemony.|$|E
