40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of {{bleaching}} of alpaca tops and dyeing of bleached alpaca tops/yarns {{on the quality of}} tops and yarns. A dark brown alpaca top was bleached with hydrogen peroxide. Two bleaching methods were tried for effectiveness of color removal. A portion of each bleached top was dyed after bleaching. Color parameters were examined for unbleached, bleached and bleached/dyed tops, these tops were then converted into yarns of different twist levels and counts using a worsted spinning system. Some of the bleached yarn from each bleaching method was dyed in a package dye vat to compare the difference of <b>top</b> <b>dyeing</b> versus yarn package dyeing on yarn quality. Fiber diameter, yarn strength, yarn evenness, yarn hairiness and fiber degradation were tested to examine {{the effects of}} bleaching and dyeing on these properties at top and yarn stages. A processing route for bleaching and dyeing alpaca fiber was recommended. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} staple {{strength}} on later stage processing of fine fleece wools (19 µm) and the blending with pieces is investigated. The staple strength findings complement those of previous researchers who used wools of different fibre diameters or from single flocks. The results reported here show that, as previously, the direct effect of sta-ple strength {{is limited to}} the production of tops, where staple strength influences fibre length in the top and the generation of combing waste. Blend-ing fleece wool and pieces was shown to increase combing noil and reduce fibre length in the top. The topmaking results conducted at CSIRO sug-gest that there may be an economic advantage in incorporating lower staple strength, and hence cheaper wools, in an all-fleeces consignment while still being able to meet the technical requirements for yarn and fabric production. Although statisti-cally significant, the small tenacity and elongation differences for 1 / 64 Nm yarns produced from the high and low staple strength test batches appear to have had no significant impact on the fabric tensile properties. There were no inter-batch yarn even-ness and fault level differences recorded, with <b>top</b> <b>dyeing</b> having a much greater influence on yarn quality than any differences associated with staple strength. Blending fleeces and pieces in a 60 / 40 ratio had a greater impact on processing from raw wool to fabric than the effect of staple strength over the range investigated. In comparison to an all-fleeces batch it would appear the economics of processing a fleeces-and-pieces batch may not be attractive, as the blend composition had an adverse effect on yarn fault levels, tenacity and elongation, which in turn may adversely affect weaving performance. However, the effect on fabric properties appears to be minor. Key words fibre, yarn, fabric formation, process...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{pressing}} {{need to find}} alternatives for polluting and often non-sustainable fossil fuels. An obvious alternative energy source is the sun, which sends more than enough energy to Earth to satisfy mankind’s (current) demands. Modern commercial solar cell technology is still mainly based on silicon, which has to meet very high purity standards and is therefore expensive relative to fossil fuels. A viable alternative could be dye sensitized solar cells (DSCs), which operate with the much cheaper semiconductor titanium dioxide (TiO 2). Since the light is absorbed by a dye rather than the bulk semiconductor material itself, a DSC is much more versatile then a silicon based solar cell. This thesis discusses the development of dye sensitized solar cells in terms of semiconductor fabrication as well as dye development. Several types of dye sensitized solar cells have been fabricated and tested for various copper(I) and ruthenium(II) dyes. The emphasis was on solid state dye sensitized solar cells (ssDSCs) since liquid electrolyte type DSCs (leDSCs) have a stability disadvantage due to possible leakage and evaporation. SsDSCs rely on a solid hole conductor for charge transport rather than on a liquid electrolyte and charge transport is more dependent on charge hopping through the hole transport material (HTM) than on diffusion of charge carrying ions, like in leDSCs. Among the <b>top</b> performing <b>dyes</b> today are often transition metal complexes based on ruthenium, one of the standards being the ruthenium(II) dye N 719. All cell development parts of this thesis (Chapters 3 - 5) have been almost exclusively conducted with this dye. Since ruthenium is not very abundant in the Earth’s crust compared to other metals, the focus in dye development was laid on the cheaper transition metal copper in the last chapter. Chapter 1 gives a general introduction about energy needs of mankind and {{why we need to}} find alternative ways of saturating them. Chapter 2 gives an overview of the methods and materials used for solar cell fabrication and characterization. In Chapter 3, liquid electrolyte DSCs (leDSCs) based on an iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte have been fabricated and optimized with home made TiO 2 particles and layers. Not only the bare electrodes, but also scattering layers, whose function it is to retain the light longer in the DSC itself, have been fabricated and tested. Chapter 4 contains cell development on ssDSCs based on copper(I) iodide (CuI) as the HTM. In Chapter 5, ssDSCs employing polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) as the HTM have been assembled and tested for performance. In Chapter 6, several copper(I) metalorganic complex dyes incorporating back to back ligands have been tested for leDSCs and PEDOT ssDSCs. Those dyes have been compared to the standard ruthenium dye (N 719) in cell performance. Chapter 7 Is the conclusion of this thesis. Experimental and specific cell fabrication details are included in each chapter separately...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} a novel pH measurement instrument and demonstrate its performance by measurements carried out with a prototype. pH measurement {{is one of the}} most common measurements in process industry, but despite the wide-spread use of the measurement, common pH measurement methods have several deficiencies. The new instrument is based on measuring color changes of pH sensitive dye molecules which are trapped in a thin porous glass membrane. The main advantage of the dye measurement is the strong measurement signal, there are no noisy low-level electrochemical signals to be measured. The dye color measurement is realized by depositing a porous dielectric mirror on <b>top</b> of the <b>dye</b> film. This mirror can be manufactured with the same methods as the indicator film itself. The reflection spectrum of this indicator film and dielectric mirror combination is then dependent on the external pH, and the pH can then be determined by a simple three-wavelength measurement. A prototype was constructed to prove the viability of this optical measurement concept. New optical constructions were designed to meet the requirements of this instrument. The data processing methods required in the measurement interpretation were also developed. This thesis describes a part of an industrial research and development project. The ultimate aim of the project is to produce a commercial measurement instrument which is manufactured in large volumes. Thus, economic viability and manufacturability play an important role in the constructions and methods described in this work. Prototype measurements show the measurement principle is accurate enough to be used in an industrial instrument. The results also show that the optical properties of the medium under measurement can be compensated for with signal processing. In addition to the pH measurement instrument itself, some new sol-gel thin film research methods were developed. Also, to enable accurate manufacturing control, a signal processing method for improving the resolution of a commercially available position sensor was developed. reviewe...|$|R
