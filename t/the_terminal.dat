5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic, El Chal {{maintained}} its primary {{place in the}} San Juan valley. This is evidenced by major building activity in the site core where the massive structures were underwent new phases of construction and by the erection of new monuments to accompany the already existing Late Classic monuments. The continued importance of El Chal in <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic resulted in other centres in the region being eclipsed, such as El Ed√©n and El Tigrillo {{to the west and}} Copoja, La Puente and El Ocote to the southeast. During <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic, El Chal developed its own ceramic production industry.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Mayor Daley and airline {{officials}} {{celebrated the}} completion of <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Development Program. The project, designed by HNTB resulted in the addition of 14 gates (from 29 to 43), with the airport now having 43 gates on 3 concourses. A new 6,300-space economy parking garage, including a new bridge and roadway for buses shuttling passengers to and from <b>the</b> <b>terminal,</b> opened in December 2005.|$|E

25|$|The Baku Port {{was founded}} in 1902 and since then has been the largest Caspian Sea port. It has six facilities: <b>the</b> main cargo <b>terminal,</b> <b>the</b> {{container}} <b>terminal,</b> <b>the</b> ferry <b>terminal,</b> <b>the</b> oil <b>terminal,</b> <b>the</b> passenger <b>terminal</b> and <b>the</b> port fleet <b>terminal.</b> <b>The</b> port's throughput capacity reaches 15 million tons of liquid bulk and up to 10 million tons of dry cargoes.|$|R
50|$|All {{electric}} {{cells have}} two <b>terminals.</b> <b>The</b> first is <b>the</b> positive <b>terminal</b> and <b>the</b> second is <b>the</b> negative <b>terminal.</b> <b>The</b> positive <b>terminal</b> {{looks like a}} metal cap and <b>the</b> negative <b>terminal</b> looks like a metal disc. The current flows from <b>the</b> positive <b>terminal,</b> and out through <b>the</b> negative <b>terminal,</b> replicative of current flow (positive (+) to negative (-) flow).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> International <b>Terminal</b> {{is located}} in the newer L shaped <b>terminal</b> whilst <b>the</b> Domestic <b>Terminal</b> {{is located in}} the older {{adjacent}} building a short distance to the south east of <b>the</b> international <b>terminal.</b> <b>The</b> airport has 18 gates: 8 in <b>the</b> Domestic <b>terminal,</b> and 10 in <b>the</b> International <b>terminal.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>terminals</b> are separated by the Festival Plaza.|$|R
5|$|Opened with Melbourne Airport in 1970 for Trans Australia Airlines, <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> {{passed to}} Qantas in 1992 when they {{acquired}} the airline. Work on improving the original terminal commenced in October 1997 and {{was completed in}} late 1999 {{at a cost of}} $50million, featuring a second pier, stands for 9 additional aircraft, an extended access roadway and the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Terminal 2 handles all international, {{and limited}} domestic, flights out of Melbourne Airport, and was opened in 1970. <b>The</b> <b>terminal</b> has 20 gates with aerobridges. Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas (which {{includes}} two lounges in Terminal 2, a First lounge and a Business lounge/Qantas Club), Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand, Etihad Airways and Emirates all operate airline lounges in <b>the</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The BRT-operated Sea Beach Line, {{which served}} <b>the</b> <b>terminal,</b> opened on September 5, 1917, and the BRT West End Line had been {{similarly}} inaugurated on December 23, 1918. <b>The</b> <b>terminal</b> officially opened on May 29, 1919, {{when the new}} Brighton Line opened. With {{the opening of the}} Culver Line on May 1, 1920, <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> was finally completed.|$|E
50|$|Two {{circuits}} {{are said}} to be equivalent with respect to a pair of <b>terminals</b> if <b>the</b> voltage across <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> and current through <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> for one network have the same relationship as the voltage and current at <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> of <b>the</b> other network.|$|R
5000|$|In circuit theory {{these are}} called [...] "active resistors". Applying a voltage across <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> causes a {{proportional}} current out of <b>the</b> positive <b>terminal,</b> <b>the</b> opposite {{of an ordinary}} resistor. For example, connecting a battery to <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> would cause <b>the</b> battery to charge rather than discharge.|$|R
50|$|Buses {{have served}} the city since the 1920s. Tehran's {{transport}} system includes conventional buses, trolleybuses, and {{bus rapid transit}} (BRT). The city's four major bus stations include <b>the</b> South <b>Terminal,</b> <b>the</b> East <b>Terminal,</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Terminal,</b> and <b>the</b> northcentral Beyhaghi <b>Terminal.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{costs of}} salvage, clean-up, and {{compensation}} {{are believed to}} have totalled around US$120 million. That included compensation paid by Total to Gulf. Most of the relevant costs were paid by insurance companies and all the various claims and counter-claims were eventually settled out of court. Gulf never reopened <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> and a feasibility study in 1985 showed that it no longer had any potential use in international oil trade. In 1986, Gulf surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government. The government used <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> (after carrying out a limited refurbishment) to hold its strategic oil reserve. Initially, oil movement to and from <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> was carried out by road. In 1990, {{at the time of the}} first Gulf war, an improvised repair was carried out to the jetty to allow an oil tanker to offload at <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> on a one-off basis. In 1996, an unloading buoy was installed and this has been used since that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{final phase}} of {{expansion}} will increase <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> capacity to 40 million passengers annually.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>terminal</b> {{consists}} of a single building, with an integrated control tower, capable of handling 120passengers per hour. The facade is covered in Russian larch; the focus on wood as a dominant material was common for Norwegian architecture the 1990s, and is also seen at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (opened in 1998) and for the venues of the 1994 Winter Olympics. <b>The</b> <b>terminal</b> was designed by Alta-based architect Solveig Thorsen and is shaped like an aircraft wing, similar to <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> building at Gardermoen. There is a single gate at the airport, which prior to the installation of security control was 17steps from the entrance.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Trans-Canada Airport <b>terminal</b> {{replaced}} <b>the</b> wooden <b>terminal</b> in 1949. <b>The</b> Trans-Canada <b>Terminal</b> {{was replaced}} by <b>the</b> Aeroquay <b>Terminal</b> in 1964.|$|R
50|$|Normal Response Mode (NRM) is an {{unbalanced}} configuration {{in which}} only <b>the</b> primary <b>terminal</b> may initiate data transfer. <b>The</b> secondary <b>terminal</b> transmits data only in response to commands from <b>the</b> primary <b>terminal.</b> <b>The</b> primary <b>terminal</b> polls <b>the</b> secondary <b>terminal(s)</b> {{to determine whether they}} have data to transmit, and then selects one to transmit.|$|R
50|$|The airport has 3 <b>terminals.</b> They are <b>the</b> International <b>Terminal,</b> <b>the</b> Domestic <b>Terminal</b> and <b>the</b> waterdrome Seaplane <b>Terminal.</b>|$|R
5|$|Today, a {{wide range}} of shops and food outlets are {{situated}} at the end of <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> near the entrance into Terminal 2. Qantas has a Qantas Club, Business Class and a chairman's lounge in <b>the</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{communication}} from mobile terminals {{to the base}} stations is encrypted with a key known only to the base station and <b>the</b> <b>terminal.</b> For group conversations, two keys are used, one from <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> to the base station, and one from the base station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out. In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is encrypted {{all the way through}} the network from the one user to the other.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,600 people {{applied to}} be extras {{in the film}} during the open call on January 24, 2009 and January 25, 2009, at Crestwood Court in St. Louis, Missouri. Up in the Air cast 2,000 extras with 15 to 25 Missouri actors in minor {{speaking}} roles. About 250 extras were used from the Omaha, Nebraska, area. They were used for filming inside and outside <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> at Eppley Airfield, while Clooney acted out most of his scenes inside <b>the</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Robertson, the station's owner, {{released}} {{renderings of}} a proposed renovation that would see the {{inside and outside of}} <b>the</b> <b>terminal's</b> aesthetics improved as well as <b>the</b> <b>terminal's</b> heating and ventilation system, however these improvements would only come if Greyhound were to sign a long-term agreement with Robertson, which in the end would result in Station Centrale being phased out as <b>the</b> <b>terminal's</b> operators.|$|R
50|$|Nomanini has {{developed}} a complete sales system including a Point-of-Sales terminal aimed at easy of use and a backend for managing <b>the</b> <b>terminals.</b> Terminals can only sell vouchers up to their balance, so the operator can use a pre-paid system to let vendors charge up <b>the</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R
50|$|A spacious new {{international}} terminal {{was completed in}} 2000; this then became <b>the</b> domestic <b>terminal</b> in 2012 following the completion of <b>the</b> {{new international}} <b>terminal.</b> <b>The</b> old <b>terminal,</b> now reserved for domestic flights, is next to <b>the</b> international <b>terminal.</b> <b>The</b> <b>terminals</b> host about 2.5 million travellers per year, and are especially busy during the peak summer tourism months when charter flights arrive frequently from major cities in Europe.|$|R
5|$|Collieries in the Paulton basin were {{connected}} to <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> basin of the northern branch of the Somerset Coal Canal which was the focus for tramroads that connected at least 15 collieries around Paulton, Timsbury and High Littleton.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Classic {{there was}} greater {{public access to}} the acropolis; as the threat of warfare grew during <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic (AD 800-900), access became much more restricted. The end of formal {{occupation}} {{of the city in}} <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic appears to have been violent, with evidence of a battle recovered during excavations of the acropolis. Refugees appear to have occupied the city centre immediately after the collapse of formal settlement at La Blanca, but they abandoned the city for good in the 11th century, after which it was never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{identified}} 3 construction phases in Patio A, {{with the}} first two dating to the Late Classic and the final phase dating to <b>the</b> <b>Terminal</b> Classic.|$|E
50|$|Soon after <b>the</b> <b>terminal's</b> opening, {{service on}} Route 27 {{in this area}} was increased, and the route of buses passing through <b>the</b> <b>terminal's</b> area was {{modified}} to deviate into the station's parking lot.|$|R
40|$|A loop {{transmission}} system {{consisting of a}} central station, N input terminals with infinite buffer, and a multiplexed channel is considered. Data flows from <b>the</b> <b>terminals</b> to <b>the</b> central station and from the central station to <b>the</b> <b>terminals.</b> <b>The</b> first type of data transfer is accorded priority over the second type. This necessitates intermediate buffering of data from the central station to <b>the</b> <b>terminals.</b> <b>The</b> distributions of the queue lengths at all <b>terminals</b> and of <b>the</b> virtual waiting times of data units are calculated. Two numerical examples are given...|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> new <b>terminal</b> is {{just west}} of <b>the</b> {{previous}} <b>terminal.</b> <b>The</b> two-story, [...] <b>terminal,</b> designed by HNTB, is a modern architectural design expressing Wichita's prominent position in the aviation industry. [...] Other contractors included AECOM, providing project management services, and Key/Walbridge Joint Venture, serving as the general contractor. [...] Aviation themed exhibits are part of <b>the</b> <b>terminal's</b> design.|$|R
5|$|Greyhound Canada and Grey Goose Bus Lines offer {{domestic}} {{bus service}} from the Winnipeg Bus Terminal. <b>The</b> <b>terminal</b> was relocated from downtown Winnipeg {{to the airport}} in 2009, and is a Greyhound hub. Municipalities also operate localized transit bus systems.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, the South Beach Branch was {{extended}} from Arrochar {{to a new}} terminal at South Beach. In 1897, <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> at Saint George, which served the railroad and the ferry to Manhattan, was completed.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, the Airport Drive {{extension}} was completed, {{creating a}} second major {{link to the}} airport. The link starts at the M80 Western Ring Road and provides direct access to Melrose Drive 1.5 kilometres from <b>the</b> <b>terminal</b> area.|$|E
25|$|Axial {{electrolytic}} capacitor styles have a bar across {{or around the}} case pointing to the negative lead end to indicate <b>the</b> negative <b>terminal.</b> <b>The</b> positive <b>terminal</b> of <b>the</b> capacitor {{is on the side}} of the sealing. <b>The</b> negative <b>terminal</b> lead is shorter than <b>the</b> positive <b>terminal</b> lead.|$|R
