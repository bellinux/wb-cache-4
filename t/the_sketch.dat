5|$|In {{their book}} Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live, authors Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad wrote that <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> was writer Michael O'Donoghue's {{signature}} {{success on the}} television program. In addition, they noted that the staff of Saturday Night Live felt <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> was among the best routines on the program.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2008, Fey {{once again}} portrayed Palin, {{this time in}} a sketch {{featuring}} the real John McCain, the last of numerous sketches featuring the Arizona Senator. In <b>the</b> <b>sketch,</b> McCain poked fun at himself and his campaign, as well as Barack Obama's purchase of airtime on several major networks earlier in the week. In <b>the</b> <b>sketch,</b> McCain and Palin can only afford to buy airtime on QVC, a home-shopping channel. McCain's wife, Cindy, also made an appearance in <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> as herself.|$|E
5|$|Pielke {{praised the}} final scene of <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> as evocative of the {{original}} series and an indictment of capitalism. He wrote that Belushi finished off <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> with a moving rendition of {{the introduction to the}} original Star Trek series, while modifying it slightly to emphasize that NBC's greed had ended the Enterprise mission.|$|E
30|$|For <b>the</b> {{section on}} <b>sketching,</b> {{students}} were asked about their level of agreement {{with a variety of}} statements on the utility of <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> instruction during <b>the</b> latter, non-sketching focused, portions of <b>the</b> course. <b>The</b> <b>sketching</b> survey data, which are collected immediately after <b>the</b> 6 -week <b>sketching</b> portion of <b>the</b> course, revealed that students in the two instructional setting conditions and in the two instructor experience level conditions had largely different perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> instruction itself. But on these items about later utility of <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> instruction, minimal differences in student perceptions were seen. Overall, these results indicate that, for the most part, these differential experiences during <b>the</b> actual <b>sketching</b> instructions did not translate into differential perceptions of how <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> instruction served students during the remainder of the course.|$|R

"The Encantadas" [...] {{was one of}} {{the stories}} {{frequently}} singled out by reviewers of The Piazza Tales, mostly to compare <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> to <b>the</b> author's first books. The New York Atlas found that <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> were written in [...] "the style of the author's first works", and praised <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> because [...] "a more vivid picture of the fire-and-barren-curst Gallipagos we have never read". For the Southern Literary Messenger <b>the</b> <b>sketches</b> were <b>the</b> product of the author's extraordinary imagination, which took the reader [...] "into that 'wild, weird clime, out of space, out of time,' which is the scene of his earliest and most popular writings." ...|$|R

5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> was an effective satire of {{the cancellation of}} the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> in 1976 {{would be hard-pressed to}} imagine a future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane wondered how the Star Trek franchise could ever come back from the total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E

5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>sketches</b> of <b>the</b> {{first series}} {{had a very}} odd and surreal mood to them. In the second series in 1984 the overall style changed slightly.

The writers express their reluctance in doing product placements for GE (even though during the scene the cast talk about how great Snapple's White Green Tea tastes), but Liz agrees on the condition that Jack appears in <b>the</b> <b>sketch.</b> The next day, Liz watches a video containing outtakes from Jack's product placement video, where she discovers that he repeatedly forgot his lines after 142 takes. After realizing that he needs help, Liz encourages Jack to go through with <b>the</b> <b>sketch,</b> which he ultimately is able to shoot.|$|E
30|$|In the Fall 2015 data, {{only two}} items {{failed to show}} a {{significant}} difference (p[*]<[*]. 05) between groups: “Participating in <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> portion of this course improved my ability to prepare a set of working drawings for manufacturing” and “I believe <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> training I received in this course will enhance my ability to use CAD”. These results indicate that <b>the</b> two <b>sketching</b> instructional approaches were comparably effective {{on some of the}} more technical aspects of sketching. On all other aspects of <b>the</b> <b>sketching</b> instruction on which students were surveyed (e.g., improved ability to sketch, improving communication, improving creativity, being a good use of students’ time, and being fairly graded), the new approach was perceived as significantly more effective.|$|R

5|$|Mother Jones {{magazine}} additionally commented {{upon the}} key theme of satire over {{conflict between the}} critical success of Star Trek and the decision to cancel the program by the studio executives. The magazine noted that writer Michael O'Donoghue's work for <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> was among the highest caliber scripts he had written for Saturday Night Live. Mother Jones found it ironic that in <b>the</b> <b>sketch</b> the Enterprise was defeated not by its traditional enemies such as the Klingons, but by a stupid NBC executive {{in charge of the}} network's programming schedule.|$|E

In his book Metapop author Michael Dunne called the comedic bit among the most well-known of all Saturday Night Live routines. The Chicago Sun-Times referred to it as an intelligent satire of Star Trek. The Los Angeles Times placed the parody among the program's top ten sketches of all-time.

5|$|Bolt made a cameo {{appearance}} in the opening sketch of 13 October 2012 broadcast of Saturday Night Live, hosted by Christina Applegate.

5|$|DeForest Kelley, {{the actor}} who portrayed {{physician}} Leonard McCoy on Star Trek, was a personal favorite of John Belushi. Belushi had offices on the same lot as Kelley.
