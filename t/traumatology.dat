25|$|A {{rotator cuff}} tear {{can be caused}} by the {{weakening}} of the rotator cuff tendons. This weakening {{can be caused by}} age or how often the rotator cuff is used. Adults over the age of 60 are more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear. According to a study in the Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and <b>Traumatology</b> the frequency of rotator cuff tears can increase with age. The study shows the participants that were the ages of 70–90 years old had a rate of rotator cuff tears that were 1 to 5. The participants who were 90+ years old the frequency of a rotator cuff tear jumped to 1 to 3. This study shows that with an increase in age there is also an increase in the probability of a rotator cuff tear.|$|E
2500|$|As [...] "trauma" [...] {{adopted a}} more widely defined scope, <b>traumatology</b> {{as a field}} {{developed}} a more interdisciplinary approach. This is {{in part due to}} the field's diverse professional representation including: psychologists, medical professionals, and lawyers. As a result, findings in this field are adapted for various applications, from individual psychiatric treatments to sociological large-scale trauma management. However, novel fields require novel methodologies. While the field has adopted a number of diverse methodological approaches, many pose their own limitations in practical application.|$|E
