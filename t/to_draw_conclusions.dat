5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>conclusions</b> about life history in a population of Albertosaurus. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. While this {{could be due to}} preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough Daspletosaurus remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.|$|E

Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. Over half of the known T. rex specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity, a pattern that is also seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large, long-lived birds and mammals today. These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, {{partly due to the}} stresses of reproduction.

5|$|In 2004–05, {{researchers}} from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay {{product of the}} newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow chemical experimentation. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer {{was removed from the}} surface of the target (with dubnium on it), dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and lanthanum carrier, from which precipitated various +3, +4, and +5 species on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, in which it was converted to nitrate form then dried on a film and counted. It mostly contained a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, but also a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further at both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium in that experiment appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and not even once in niobium-only fractions. However, it was noted that these experiments were insufficient <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>conclusions</b> about the general chemical profile of dubnium.|$|E

25|$|Computer-aided {{detection}} (CADe) {{systems are}} usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense {{structures in the}} soft tissue. This allows the radiologist <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>conclusions</b> {{about the condition of}} the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. Computer-aided simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.|$|E

Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud.

25|$|Additionally, {{on his way}} to Edo, Thunberg {{managed to}} obtain a vast number of Japanese coins which he {{described}} in detail in the fourth volume of his travelogue, Travels in Europe, Africa and Asia, performed between the Years 1770 and 1779. The coins presented an important informational repository on the culture, religion and history of Japan, as their possession as well as their export by foreigners had been strictly forbidden by the shogun. This prohibition had been imposed to prevent the Empire of China and other rivals of the shogunate from copying the money and flooding the Japanese markets with forged coins. Consequently, Thunberg's transport of Japanese coins granted European scholars an entirely new perspective on Japan's monetary economy and allowed them <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>conclusions</b> on Japan's culture and religion through decorations on the coins and the materials used to produce the currency.|$|E

There is very weak evidence for chiropractic care for adult scoliosis (curved or rotated spine) and no scientific data for idiopathic adolescent scoliosis. A 2007 systematic review found that few studies of chiropractic care for nonmusculoskeletal conditions are available, and they are typically not of high quality; it also found that the entire clinical encounter of chiropractic care (as opposed to just SM) provides benefit to patients with cervicogenic dizziness, and that the evidence from reviews is negative, or too weak <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>conclusions,</b> {{for a wide variety of}} other nonmusculoskeletal conditions, including ADHD/learning disabilities, dizziness, high blood pressure, and vision conditions. Other reviews have found no evidence of significant benefit for asthma, baby colic, bedwetting, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, gastrointestinal disorders, kinetic imbalance due to suboccipital strain (KISS) in infants, menstrual cramps, insomnia, postmenopausal symptoms, or pelvic and back pain during pregnancy.
