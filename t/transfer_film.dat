40|$|Effects {{of water}} {{lubrication}} and applied {{load on the}} formation of PTFE <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> and metal-F bonds during sliding when PTFE filled composites sliding against steel and Al 2 O 3 are investigated. In water lubricated conditions, XPS analysis reveals that {{a thin layer of}} water molecules at the sliding interface inhibits the formation of PTFE <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> and Al-F bonds on the Al 2 O 3 ball, leading to a detrimental effect on the tribo-performance. Under various normal loads in dry sliding condition, it is found that the smearing of PTFE onto the wear surface of the composite and the transfer of PTFE onto the surface of the steel counterpart are stimulated by a high load. During sliding, the contact pressure is found to be the driving force of the reaction between steel and PTFE. It is concluded that under various loads, the total amount of PTFE <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> has a larger impact on the friction behavior than the formation of Fe-F bonds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Burris, David L. Polymers {{are used}} as {{self-lubricating}} materials in applications where the use of traditional lubricants is undesirable or precluded. Neat polymers often lack sufficient lubricity or wear resistance for bearing applications, so fillers are used to reinforce the polymer and improve its performance in sliding conditions. In the last two decades, the use of nanofillers has been explored to provide reinforcement without the abrasive effects of the more traditional fillers. For the most successful of these tribological nanocomposites, thin uniform films of polymer {{are found to be}} strongly adhered to the hard bearing steel countersurfaces. The improvements in tribological properties for these nanocomposites are widely attributed to the quality of these so-called transfer films. The proposed <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> attributes responsible for the wear reductions include: (1) thickness, (2) area fraction, (3) uniformity and continuity, (4) intrinsic wear resistance, (5) counterface adhesion, (6) chemical composition and (7) mechanical properties of <b>transfer</b> <b>film.</b> However, few of these has been studied quantitatively and it remains unclear which is most closely related to tribological performance. This thesis aims to elucidate how these attributes affect wear performance by 1) developing quantitative metrics for <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> properties and 2) correlating these properties to wear properties using a particularly effective and well-studied polymer nanocomposite system. The results suggest the <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> continuity is most strongly related to system's wear and can be quantified using the free-space length (Lf), a new metric developed here to access <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> quality. Other results suggest that effective nanofillers interact with the matrix polymer and possibly lead to the reduction of wear debris size during sliding. Very small debris (< 1 ??m) inherently adheres to the counterface and initiates a strongly adhered <b>transfer</b> <b>film.</b> Over time, more transferred small wear debris accumulate and form a thin, continuous and complete <b>transfer</b> <b>film.</b> The sliding frictional energy further induces excessive polymer degradation in the <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> which increases the hardness (H), modulus (E), surface energy (??) and intrinsic wear resistance (Kfilm) of the film. Debris size regulation, polymer degradation and improved film-counterface adhesion are identified as the most important factors in the wear reduction mechanisms.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>transfer</b> <b>films</b> atop steel counterfaces {{in contact with}} unfilled and bronze-filled PTFE has been studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The sliding apparatus was contained within the vacuum of the analytical system, so {{the effects of the}} native oxide, hydrocarbon, and adsorbed gaseous surface layers of the steel upon the PTFE transfer behavior could be studied in situ. For both the filled and the unfilled PTFE, cleaner surfaces promoted greater amounts of transfer. Metal fluorides, which formed at the transfer film/counterface interface, were found solely in cases where the native oxide had been removed to expose the metallic surface prior to sliding. These fluorides also were found at clean metal/PTFE interfaces formed in the absence of frictional contact. A fraction of these fluorides resulted from irradiation damage inherent in XPS analysis.

It was observed that the surface roughness of the coatings essentially determines the wear behavior of the ball counterpart, which consequently influences the <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> formation. A rough coating causes abrasive wear of the steel ball during the running-in period, which impedes {{the formation of a}} stable <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> and leads to higher values of coefficient of friction (CoF). Moreover, the CoF does not show a decreasing trend after the running-in period, although the roughness of the coating was greatly reduced.

In both of the cases, no wear of the steel ball occurs and a stable <b>transfer</b> <b>film</b> forms and effectively covers the contact area.
