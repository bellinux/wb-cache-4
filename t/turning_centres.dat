30|$|Cost—It {{relates to}} the capital {{investment}} required to procure and install a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre.</b> A CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre</b> having less initial capital investment is always preferred to that requiring higher capital outflow.|$|R
30|$|Maximum length (mm)—It {{refers to}} the maximum length of a {{workpiece}} that can be accommodated and machined on a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre.</b> This specification {{is related to the}} capacity of a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|R
30|$|Machining time—It is {{the time}} taken by a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre</b> to machine a {{workpiece}} having the desired dimensions and shape. Less machining time reduces the lead time to market a product. So, a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre</b> which has less machining time is more beneficial for a manufacturing organization.|$|R
30|$|The {{second phase}} of QFD-based expert system embarks with {{identifying}} the most important technical requirements based on which the end user wants to evaluate the candidate CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centres.</b> Once the desirable technical requirements are shortlisted by the end user, the range for each selected technical requirement needs to be specified.

30|$|The ‘Input Range’ {{functional}} key {{is pressed}} to generate empty cells to capture ranges {{of the selected}} criteria values within which the specifications of CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centres</b> should lie.|$|E
30|$|In the HoQ matrix, {{among the}} five {{criteria}} chosen for evaluation of CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centres,</b> negative priority weights for cost, spindle motor power and weight identify them as non-beneficial technical requirements. Now, pressing of the ‘Input Range’ key generates the necessary empty cells, where the ranges of values for the selected technical requirements are entered. Then, the functional key ‘Feasible Alternatives’ is then pressed to display a list of feasible CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centres</b> satisfying all the set criteria values.

By using a model, the entering of turns by vehicles and semitrailers was researched. The momentary <b>turning</b> <b>centres</b> for vehicles and semitrailers diverged, depending on the researched turning radiuses. All vehicles with semitrailers, when turning, move along a circle after a 90 ° turn is performed.

30|$|The {{final stage}} of the expert system {{consists}} of evaluating the feasible candidate alternatives to select the best CNC turning centre. In this stage, a final set of CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centres</b> {{that needs to be}} evaluated based on the set criteria is chosen from the list of feasible alternatives. A decision matrix comprising of the selected technical specifications with respect to each chosen CNC turning centre is then developed.

40|$|The {{development}} of the turning machine is characterized by an increasing degree of automation, capacity and flexibility. This is particularly true for the turning machines which have become self-sufficient <b>turning</b> <b>centres</b> with driven tools, {{the possibility of using}} multiple cutting dunctions, higher speed frequencies and tool and workpiece changing systems. Ergonomic and easy to operate control systems are just as important as systems for simulation and optimization of the munufacturing processes prior to real machining. The state of the art which has been achieved in this field meanwhile is documented by the VDI-Z-data base of turning machines comprising data of over 500 CNC turning machines. Evaluations of this data base - some examples given in this paper show some of the possibilities - can lead to valuable results both for munfacturers and users...|$|E
30|$|The interrelationship {{matrices}} for {{flexible and}} mass production plans are slightly {{different from each}} other. For example, presence of auxiliary attachments in a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre</b> makes it more flexible. This affects the overall cost of the machine more strongly in flexible production than mass production. In flexible production plan, the correlation indices between flexibility and all other technical requirements are high due to greater impact of these requirements on flexibility. Moreover, a large volume of finished products is required in mass production and hence, {{if the number of}} tools is more in a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre,</b> its productivity will also be high. Therefore, there exists a stronger relationship between productivity and number of tools in mass production than flexible production. Similarly, the capacity of a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centre</b> for mass production should be such that it can accommodate more number of tools so that several machining operations can be performed simultaneously. Hence, capacity of the machine and number of tools are more strongly related in mass production than flexible production.|$|R

30|$|Computer {{numerical}} control (CNC) machine tools are automated devices capable of generating complicated and intricate product shapes in shorter time. Selection {{of the best}} CNC machine tool is a critical, complex and time-consuming task due to availability {{of a wide range}} of alternatives and conflicting nature of several evaluation criteria. Although, the past researchers had attempted to select the appropriate machining centres using different knowledge-based systems, mathematical models and multi-criteria decision-making methods, none of those approaches has given due importance to the voice of customers. The aforesaid limitation can be overcome using quality function deployment (QFD) technique, which is a systematic approach for integrating customers’ needs and designing the product to meet those needs first time and every time. In this paper, the adopted QFD-based methodology helps in selecting CNC <b>turning</b> <b>centres</b> for a manufacturing organization, providing due importance to the voice of customers to meet their requirements. An expert system based on QFD technique is developed in Visual BASIC 6.0 to automate the CNC turning centre selection procedure for different production plans. Three illustrative examples are demonstrated to explain the real-time applicability of the developed expert system.|$|E
