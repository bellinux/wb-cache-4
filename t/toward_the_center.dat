5|$|As an {{industrial}} port city, Haifa {{has traditionally been}} a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. In recent years, {{there has been a}} drift <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%.|$|E

The first diver to reach Arkansas sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone. They were able to see the barrels of the forward guns, which had not been visible in 1946.|$|E

5|$|The {{news was}} sent to all the corps commanders. After dawn Abu Ubaidah entered Damascus from Jabiyah gate and the other commanders from their {{respective}} gates, while Khalid's corps was still battling in the city from the East Gate. Abu Ubaidah marched peacefully with his corps, accompanied by Thomas, Harbees, several dignitaries, and the bishops of Damascus, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of city. From the East Gate, Khalid and his men fought their way towards the center of Damascus, killing all who resisted. The commanders met at the Church of Mary {{in the center of}} the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the Earth {{by the force of}} gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E

The route eventually enters the latter's central business district, where the Saw Mill Parkway and the Harlem Line turn northwestward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the nearby village of Pleasantville. NY141 continues on a northern track however, veering off of Commerce Street onto Franklin Avenue, then becoming known as Broadway again as it heads through mostly residential areas on its way into the eastern portion of Pleasantville. It retains the Broadway name to a junction with Bedford Road, from where the route continues as Bedford Road for two blocks before ending at an intersection with NY117. Westbound NY117 enters from the west on Manville Road, while NY117 east turns north to follow Bedford Road.|$|E
5|$|MD346 {{continues}} east as Old Ocean City Boulevard, {{passing along}} {{the southern edge of}} Whaleyville, where the highway intersects MD610 (Whaleyville Road).

MD346 turns southeast, paralleling US50 for a while before turning south <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of Berlin. Upon entering the town limits of Berlin, the state highway curves east to intersect MD818 (Main Street). MD346 has a grade crossing of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad's Snow Hill Line track, then intersects MD377 (Williams Street) immediately before an intersection with US113 (Worcester Highway). The state highway passes south of Atlantic General Hospital and veers northeast to its eastern terminus at a tangent intersection with US50.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{itself is}} {{elongated}} along an axis that points <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of Mare Serenitatis. Large massifs {{are located on}} either side of the valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their geographic location in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a scarp cuts across the valley floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E

5|$|East Market Street crosses over a {{railroad}} as it leaves Celina. At Grand Lake Road, SR 703 turns south {{to continue as}} East Market Street, and SR 29 continues eastward to a divided highway. SR 703 then travels along the northern banks of the lake, with farmland north of the road. The road intersects multiple driveways and places, including the Wright State University Lake Campus and the Grand Lake St. Marys Lighthouse. Near Mercerâ€“Auglaize County Line Road, the highway enters Auglaize County as Celina Road. The route intersects SR 364 at Koenig Road, which becomes concurrent with SR 703. The concurrency crosses {{a railroad}}, and SR 364 continues southward at East Bank Road. SR 703 enters St. Marys as Jackson Street, and travels <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the city.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to lure out and destroy {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet with sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers and thirty-one torpedo boats {{commanded}} by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats. The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, at that time consisting of twenty-eight dreadnoughts and nine battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet. At the time of the battle, the ship's commander was Captain Henry Wise Parker, and she was the flagship of Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee. She was stationed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the British line. The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene.|$|E
5|$|When the core's mass {{exceeds the}} Chandrasekhar limit of about , {{degeneracy}} pressure {{can no longer}} support it, and catastrophic collapse ensues. The outer part of the core reaches velocities of up to 70,000km/s (23% {{of the speed of}} light) as it collapses <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the star. The rapidly shrinking core heats up, producing high-energy gamma rays that decompose iron nuclei into helium nuclei and free neutrons via photodisintegration. As the core's density increases, it becomes energetically favorable for electrons and protons to merge via inverse beta decay, producing neutrons and elementary particles called neutrinos. Because neutrinos rarely interact with normal matter, they can escape from the core, carrying away energy and further accelerating the collapse, which proceeds over a timescale of milliseconds. As the core detaches from the outer layers of the star, some of these neutrinos are absorbed by the star's outer layers, beginning the supernova explosion.|$|E

5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
