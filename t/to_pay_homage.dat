5|$|The child Baldwin V of Jerusalem died in {{late summer}} 1186. Raymond of Tripoli and his {{supporters}} could not prevent BaldwinV's mother, Sybilla, and her husband, Guy of Lusignan, from seizing the throne. Baldwin of Ibelin, who was the only Jerusalemite baron to refuse <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to Sybilla and Guy after their coronation, moved to Antioch. Bohemond granted a fief to him.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at the {{failures}} of the Angeloi, especially in terms of foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would go well for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to Constantinople.|$|E

50|$|Also {{attributed}} to Chrysomalus were teachings associated with civil disobedience: that the reverence of worldy rulers is akin <b>to</b> <b>paying</b> <b>homage</b> <b>to</b> Satan and that temporal authority should be denounced. Although {{this is similar}} to some practices {{attributed to}} the Bogomils by Cosmas the Priest, {{it is not possible to}} establish a definite connection.|$|R

5|$|Sons of Soul was {{produced}} entirely by the group, {{who worked with}} various session musicians and utilized both vintage and contemporary recording equipment. They intended <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to their musical influences—classic soul artists of the 1960s and 1970s—and incorporated live instrumentation, funk, and hip hop elements such as samples and scratches. Lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins handled most of the songwriting, which featured quirky, flirtatious lyrics.|$|E
5|$|After Alexander Aldea died in 1436, Vlad seized Wallachia with Hungarian support. Following {{the death}} of Sigismund of Luxembourg in 1437, Hungary's {{position}} weakened, causing him <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to Murad II, which included participating in Murad II's invasion of Transylvania {{in the summer of}} 1438. John Hunyadi, Voivode of Transylvania, came to Wallachia to convince Vlad to join a crusade against the Ottomans in 1441. After Hunyadi routed an Ottoman army in Transylvania, the sultan ordered Vlad to come to Edirne where he was captured in 1442. Hunyadi invaded Wallachia and made Vlad's cousin, Basarab II, voivode.|$|E
5|$|After Baldwin sanctioned the marriage, Constance and Raynald {{married in}} early 1153. Raynald {{took charge of}} the {{administration}} of the principality. However, he was unpopular because his subjects regarded him as an upstart. His frequent attempts to raise funds brought him into conflict with Patriarch Aimery and Emperor ManuelI during the subsequent years. The emperor forced Raynald <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to him in the spring of 1159. Raynald was captured and imprisoned by Majd al-Din, governor of Aleppo, during a plundering raid in November 1160 or 1161.|$|E
50|$|Having {{once been}} a vegetarian, Harry then spent 15 years researching meat in all its aspects.

5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> {{to one of his}} favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many ideas from his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower to feel like one.|$|E
5|$|Ernuszt also {{rented out}} the royal copper mines at Besztercebánya to the Thurzós for 12 years on 26 December 1494. The Thurzós and the banker Jakob Fugger {{established}} a joint venture, named Ungarischer Handel ("Hungarian Trade"), {{to exploit the}} mines. According to Antonio Bonfini, Ernuszt persuaded the king to launch a campaign against Lawrence Újlaki who had captured Futak and Cserög. Újlaki was forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to the king at Pécs on 27 March 1495, and to return the two estates to Ernuszt.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Gorée's example, Carabane is {{attempting}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> {{to victims of}} slavery by starting a small museum like the House of Slaves. Like Gorée and Saint-Louis, Carabane places great importance on its cultural heritage. The architectural reminders of this heritage require significant restoration as they have experienced considerable degradation. In 1964, French anthropologist Louis-Vincent Thomas posed {{the question of whether}} Carabane should be preserved, and this question continues to be relevant. The local people suggest that the entire Diogue–Nikine–Carabane area needs saving.|$|E

5|$|The {{downfall}} of the Kingdom of Hungary {{was marked by}} the battle of Mohács (Hungary) where the royal army was annihilated by the Ottomans on August 29, 1526. Thereafter the noblemen's political factions engaged in conflict and elected two kings. One of them, John I Szapolyai (15261540) {{was supported by the}} lesser nobility, while Ferdinand I of Habsburg (15261564) was recognized mainly in the kingdom's western counties, but the Transylvanian Saxons also supported him. Seeking the assistance of the Ottomans, John I had <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to the sultan at Mohács in 1529.|$|E
5|$|HAL Laboratory {{developed}} Super Smash Bros. Melee, with Masahiro Sakurai as {{the head}} of production. The game {{was one of the first}} games released on the GameCube and highlighted the advancement in graphics from the Nintendo 64.

5|$|Jonathan Gems, who had {{previously}} written multiple unproduced screenplays for director Tim Burton, came up with his own idea for a Mars Attacks film in 1993. The writer pitched both concepts of Mars Attacks and Dinosaurs Attack! to Burton, who both decided that Dinosaurs Attack! would be too similar to Jurassic Park (1993). Burton, who was busy preparing Ed Wood (1994), believed that Mars Attacks! would be a perfect opportunity <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to the films of Edward D. Wood, Jr., especially Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), and other 1950s science fiction B movies, such as Invaders from Mars (1953), It Came from Outer Space (1953), The War of the Worlds (1953), Target Earth (1954), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956).|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 2012, the Los Angeles Lakers {{acquired}} Nash in a sign-and-trade {{deal with}} Phoenix. Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto, {{but he decided}} that Los Angeles was the best fit {{for him and his}} family. Nash switched his jersey number, as his customary No. 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain. Nash, an avid soccer fan, chose No. 10 <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to Glenn Hoddle, Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and other soccer playmakers who wore the number. Entering his 17th NBA season, Nash came to the Lakers with concerns over his defense and the health of his back.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{agreement}} {{is thought to have}} been the threat posed to Áedán, and also to Áed, by Báetán mac Cairill. Báetán is said to have forced the king of Dál Riata <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to him at Rosnaree on Islandmagee. Áedán is thought to be the king in question, and Ulster sources say that Báetán collected tribute from Scotland. Following Báetán's death in 581, the Ulstermen abandoned the Isle of Man, which they had captured in Báetán's time, perhaps driven out by Áedán who is recorded as fighting there c. 583. Earlier, c. 580, Áedán is said to have raided Orkney, which had been subject to Bridei son of Maelchon, King of the Picts, at an earlier date.|$|E

5|$|Childermass {{meanwhile}} eventually {{receives the}} message meant {{for him by}} Strange and uses it to break the enchantment over Lady Pole. Enraged by this, the gentleman with the thistledown hair intends to place a second deadly curse on Lady Pole, as Faerie tradition demands. En route, he murders Vinculus after they encounter him, with Stephen Black forced to watch. During these events, Norrell and Strange attempt a spell that would cause the nature forces of England <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> to John Uskglass. Not knowing his true name, they dedicate it to the 'nameless slave'. However, the two magicians' belief that this is Uskglass is mistaken, and instead the power is devoted to Stephen.

5|$|Noblemen from Greater Poland offered <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> {{to either}} Mary or Jadwiga {{at a meeting}} in Radomsko on 25November, but they stipulated that the queen and her husband should live in Poland. The {{assembly}} of the nobility of Lesser Poland passed a similar resolution in Wiślica on 12December. On the latter occasion, in response to Queen Elizabeth's demand, the noblemen also promised that they would not pay homage to anyone else than either Mary or Jadwiga. Mary's fiancé, Sigismund, who had stayed in Poland, returned to Hungary. Bodzanta, Archbishop of Gniezno, the Nałęcz family, and their allies in Greater Poland favored a native prince, SiemowitIV of Masovia. To avoid a civil war, Queen Elizabeth sent envoys to the Polish noblemen's next assembly which met in Sieradz in late February 1383. Her envoys absolved the Poles from their 1382 oath of loyalty to Mary on 28March, announcing that the queen mother would send her younger daughter, Jadwiga, to Poland.|$|E

He regained his territories in 1101, and in 1115 Gruffydd ap Rhys, the exiled prince of Deheubarth, took refuge at Aberdaron to escape capture by Gwynedd's ruler. Henry I of England had invaded Gwynedd the previous year, and faced by an overwhelming force, Gruffudd ap Cynan had been forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>homage</b> and a substantial fine to Henry.
