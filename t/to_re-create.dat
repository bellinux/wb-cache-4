5|$|The {{makers of}} the film {{acknowledged}} the responsibility of portraying the story. One challenge faced was acquiring a real plane for shooting; director Ram Madhvani and Rucha Pathak decided <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> the plane because {{a major part of}} the film required shooting against the plane back-drop. It took them 48 days to build the plane, which closely resembled the original one.|$|E

5|$|Sony Pictures Imageworks {{designed}} {{the special effects}} for the film. The digital composition of the film, including the scene where the battle of Spider-Man and Electro in Times Square, took one year to complete. The sets of Times Square were built in Gold Coast Studios with the green screens {{and most of the}} scenes were digitally re-designed by computer. The photography and VFX team took over 36,000 photos of the Times Square in order <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> the location digitally. In addition, the animation team captured over 100 billboards during the photography process.|$|E
5|$|The aims of Astraea, in James Spence's mind, {{was to help}} reach {{parts of}} the world they've been unable to tour, like North America and South-east Asia as well as {{desiring}} to tour and support the album all of 2013. The band learned their studio output was not as easy <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> live as it was with previous albums. An example was with the song 'Gloam' as the pedal changes were too rapid for live performances.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and {{which would have been}} too difficult <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E

5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> the Little Boy. They were {{supervised by}} Harlow W. Russ, {{an expert on}} Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E
5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their lives. They attempted <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E

5|$|Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, {{went to work}} at once on {{the task}} of reform. He had <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by {{establishing}} Benedictine monasticism at Glastonbury. The Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration according to the author of 'Edgar's Establishment of the Monasteries' (written in the 960s or 970s) and according to Dunstan's first biographer, who {{had been a member of}} the community at Glastonbury. Their statements are also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.|$|E
5|$|Like live action, machinima is {{recorded}} in real-time, and real people can act {{and control the}} camera. Filmmakers are often encouraged to follow traditional cinematic conventions, such as avoiding wide fields of view, the overuse of slow motion, and errors in visual continuity. Unlike live action, machinima involves less expensive, digital special effects and sets, possibly with a science-fiction or historical theme. Explosions and stunts can be tried and repeated without monetary cost and risk of injury, and the host environment may allow unrealistic physical constraints. University of Cambridge experiments in 2002 and 2003 attempted to use machinima <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> {{a scene from the}} 1942 live-action film Casablanca. Machinima filming differed from traditional cinematography in that character expression was limited, but camera movements were more flexible and improvised. Nitsche compared this experiment to an unpredictable Dogme 95 production.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker is a 1979 British spy {{film and}} the {{eleventh}} in the James Bond series {{to be produced}} by Eon Productions, and the fourth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The third and final film in the series to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, it co-stars Lois Chiles, Michael Lonsdale, Corinne Cléry, and Richard Kiel. Bond investigates the theft of a space shuttle, leading him to Hugo Drax, {{the owner of the}} shuttle's manufacturing firm. Along with space scientist Dr. Holly Goodhead, Bond follows the trail from California to Venice, Rio de Janeiro, and the Amazon rainforest, and finally into outer space to prevent a plot to wipe out the world population and <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> humanity with a master race.|$|E

5|$|Song Reader, {{a project}} Beck {{released}} in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, {{in the hopes}} that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{intended}} to reach a wide audience, gaining an attention only previously seen by Dawn of Mana in 2006. The concept of the main character switching between angelic and demonic form was suggested by Yagi. The original concept was to keep both characters in separate bodies, with the unoccupied character being controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. The team used the Photon Server middleware to develop the game's multiplayer component. The development team initially thought of creating custom middleware, but the rebuild needed {{would have taken a}} whole year, threatening the project's existence. In search of suitable middleware, the team contacted Fixer, who offered them the use of multiple options including Photon Server. Trying out Photon Server, all the problems faced by the developers were resolved within a two-month period, and the middleware's inbuilt security structure and specification match with the game persuaded the project's engineers to greenlight its use. Rise of Mana was the first Japanese game to use Photon Server. The team needed to create two different specifications for iOS and Android, as Android had higher graphical power. During the early development stage, the team {{thought it would be fun}} <b>to</b> <b>re-create</b> the multiplayer elements in Secret of Mana. The initial idea was to have multiplayer available in standard quests, but this took up too much operational space to be practical, so they reduced this to raid battles. Due to the use of Photon Server, additional player characters could be fully rendered rather than appearing as ghost-like transparent helpers.|$|E

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world car {{manufacturers}} are required by law to state the fuel economy performance of their vehicles when undertaking one or more Standard Drive Cycles such as the Urban and Extra Urban test cycle definitions required in Western Europe. Such Standard Drive Cycles have their roots in obscure vehicle testing undertaken decades ago in the USA, and no physical test track exists in Europe which enables the precise re-creation of these test characteristics. Furthermore, the fundamental validity of these test cycles as a means of gauging and comparing passenger car fuel economy is seldom considered. This paper documents the early stages of a research project which aims to segment the Standard Drive Cycle definitions into a series of operating characteristic windows which can then be searched for and automatically extracted from general driving behaviour of a car on the road, and thereafter concatenated <b>to</b> <b>re-creating</b> a real-world equivalent of the Standard Drive Cycle without the need for rolling road or laboratory testing...|$|R
