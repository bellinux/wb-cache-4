This paper tests in two field experiments, whether men and women differ in <b>their</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> either a change in the {{behavior of}} the average group behavior or the price of giving, i. e. a matching mechanism. The results of the field experiment show that men and women do not differ in <b>their</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> a matching mechanism. However, substantial gender differences can be detected with respect to social comparison. Men behave stronger in line with average group behavior, whereas women seem to be insensitive to information about the group behavior...|$|R
25|$|Sloth bears likely view {{humans as}} {{potential}} predators, as <b>their</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> them (roaring, followed by retreat or charging) {{are similar to}} those evoked in the presence of tigers and leopards. Their long claws, ideally adapted for digging at termite mounds, make adults less capable of climbing trees to escape danger, as are other bears such as Asian black bears. Therefore, sloth bears have seemingly evolved to deal with threats by behaving aggressively. For the same reason, brown bears can be similarly inclined, accounting for the relatively high incidence of seemingly nonpredatory aggression towards humans in these two bear species.|$|E

The Socialist party had strong influence over public opinion. However, it was in opposition and also divided on the issue. It acted ineffectively against a military intervention. The future fascist leader Benito Mussolini – at this time still a left-wing Socialist – took a prominent anti-war position. A similar opposition was expressed in Parliament by Gaetano Salvemini and Leone Caetani.|$|E
