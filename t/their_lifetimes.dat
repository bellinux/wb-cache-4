5|$|The journey {{across the}} four {{cardinal}} points in India is considered sacred by Hindus, who aspire to visit these temples once in <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> Traditionally, the pilgrimage {{starts at the}} eastern end from Puri, proceeding clockwise in a manner typically followed for circumambulation in Hindu temples.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{condense}} in planets as {{a result}} of stellar evolution and destruction processes. Stars lose much of their mass when it is ejected late in <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes,</b> and sometimes thereafter {{as a result}} of a neutron star merger, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium. When gravitational attraction causes this matter to coalesce and collapse new stars and planets are formed.|$|E
5|$|Most house sparrows do {{not move}} {{more than a few}} {{kilometres}} during <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> However, limited migration occurs in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, P. d. bactrianus and P. d. parkini, are predominantly migratory. Unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.|$|E
30|$|Concerning smoking, {{patients}} were classified into never smokers (those {{who have not}} smoked 100 cigarettes during <b>their</b> <b>lifetime),</b> current smokers (those who report smoking at least 100 cigarettes in <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> and who smoke cigarettes every day or some days), and former smokers (those who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> but does not smoke cigarettes) [9].|$|R
40|$|Web {{objects are}} stored {{and can be}} {{requested}} from numerous servers, including authoritative "origin" servers and caches. Objects can be modified only by their origin servers and weak consistency with cached copies is maintained by limiting <b>their</b> <b>lifetime</b> durations.

5|$|Natives {{were also}} removed from high {{governmental}} and ecclesiastical office. After 1075 all earldoms were held by Normans, and Englishmen were only occasionally appointed as sheriffs. Likewise in the Church, senior English office-holders were either expelled from their positions or kept {{in place for}} <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes</b> and replaced by foreigners when they died. By 1096 no bishopric was held by any Englishman, and English abbots became uncommon, especially in the larger monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, {{which usually}} {{originates}} in peripheral lung tissue. Although most cases of adenocarcinoma {{are associated with}} smoking, adenocarcinoma {{is also the most}} common form of lung cancer among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes</b> ("never-smokers") and ex-smokers with a modest smoking history. A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.|$|E
5|$|Seal {{impressions}} {{found in}} Peribsen's tomb at Abydos show several deities: Ash, Min and Bastet, suggesting they were venerated during Peribsen's {{time on the}} throne. This finding argues against Peribsen worshipping a single god, or promoting monotheism. The heretic theory of Newberry, Černý, Grdseloff and others was devised from the very limited archaeological information available during <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> Most of the found clay seal impressions were still undeciphered and untranslated at their time.|$|E

5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventative nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|About 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by schizophrenia during <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected than females. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This {{is the result of}} increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes</b> to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E

5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} {{at some point}} in <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes</b> and is becoming more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%.|$|E
5|$|New gods {{continued}} to emerge after this transformation. Some important deities like Isis and Amun {{are not known}} to have appeared until the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC). Places and concepts could suddenly inspire {{the creation of a}} deity to represent them, and deities were sometimes created to serve as opposite-sex counterparts to established gods or goddesses. Kings were said to be divine, although only a few {{continued to}} be worshipped long after their deaths. Some non-royal humans were said to have the favor of the gods and were venerated accordingly. This veneration was usually short-lived, but the court architects Imhotep and Amenhotep son of Hapu were regarded as gods centuries after <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes,</b> as were some other officials.|$|E
5|$|The Championship Manager {{series has}} seen the {{greatest}} number of releases by Square Enix Europe, at nine games on four platforms, followed by the Tomb Raider series at six games across eleven platforms. Several of the franchises published by Square Enix Europe have sold millions of copies both before and after its founding: the Tomb Raider franchise has the highest lifetime sales with over 45 million copies since 1996, followed by Hitman with over 15 million copies sold since 2000. Several other series, including Deus Ex, Championship Manager, and Just Cause, have also sold several million copies over <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{crystallization}} of uric acid, often {{related to}} relatively high {{levels in the}} blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is {{the primary cause of}} hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at some point in <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530μmol/l (7 and 8.9mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535μmol/l (9mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{insurance system}} devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes</b> than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E
5|$|During mating, {{the male}} redback {{attempts}} to copulate by inserting {{one of its}} palps into {{the one of the}} female's two spermathecae (sperm storage organs), each of which has its own insemination orifice. It then tries and often succeeds in inserting the other palp into the female's second orifice. The redback spider is one of only two animals known where the male has been found to actively assist the female in sexual cannibalism. In the process of mating, the much smaller male somersaults to place his abdomen over the female's mouthparts. In about two of three cases, the female fully consumes the male while mating continues. Males which are not eaten die of their injuries soon after mating. Sacrifice during mating is thought to confer two advantages to the species. The first is the eating process allows {{for a longer period of}} copulation and thus fertilisation of more eggs. The second is females which have eaten a male are more likely to reject subsequent males. Although this prohibits future mating for the males, this is not a serious disadvantage, because the spiders are sufficiently sparse that less than 20% of males ever find a potential mate during <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes,</b> and in any case, the male is functionally sterile if he has used the contents of both of his palps in the first mating.|$|E

5|$|However, {{there has}} been {{controversy}} over the names used at various times, with names being dropped for religious and political reasons. Female names were exclusively used in the basins at various times between 1945 and 2000, and were the subject of several protests. At present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> Due to the potential for longevity and multiple concurrent storms, the names reduce the confusion about what storm is being described in forecasts, watches and warnings. Names are assigned in order from predetermined lists once storms have one, three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than , depending on which basin it originates in. Standards vary from basin to basin, with some tropical depressions named in the Western Pacific, while {{a significant amount of}} gale-force winds are required in the Southern Hemisphere. The names of significant tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with another name, at meetings of the World Meteorological Organization's various tropical cyclone committees.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, just as Rabbinic Judaism was in {{part the}} Pharisaic {{response}} to their acknowledgment that the Temple would not be rebuilt in <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes,</b> Christianity reflected the acknowledgment of early Christians that the Second Coming of Christ {{and the establishment of}} God's kingdom on earth was not to happen in <b>their</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> The critical analysis of the Gospels involves, at least in part, a consideration of how these concerns affected the Gospels' accounts of Jesus.|$|E
