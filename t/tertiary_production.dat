30|$|Oil {{recovery}} operations traditionally have been subdivided into three stages: primary, secondary, and <b>tertiary.</b> Primary <b>production,</b> the initial production stage, {{results from the}} displacement energy naturally existing in a reservoir. Secondary recovery, {{the second stage of}} production, is usually implemented after the primary production declines. The traditional secondary recovery process is waterflooding in which water is injected into a reservoir to obtain additional oil recovery through displacement of reservoir oil towards producing wells. Waterflooding is now accepted worldwide as a reliable and economic recovery technique and almost every significant oil field that does not have a natural water drive has been, is being, or will be considered for waterflooding. Waterflooding depends on many factors, including reservoir geometry, lithology, reservoir depth, porosity, absolute permeability, continuity of reservoir rock properties, magnitude and distribution of fluid saturations, fluid properties, and relative permeability. Permadi et al. (2004) investigated the effects of vertical heterogeneity on waterflood performance and concluded that a reservoir with an increasing upward permeability trend yields better waterflood performance as compared to that of an FU trend. The crossflow improves vertical sweep efficiency of waterflood and it is more effective in CU formations. El-Khatib (2010) studied the effect of a reservoir dip angle on waterflood performance. The dip angle of a reservoir controls the gravity and delays water breakthrough, leading to increasing oil recovery and lowering water cut.|$|R

40|$|Food web {{subsidies}} {{from external}} sources (“allochthony”) can support rich biological diversity and high secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>production</b> in aquatic systems, {{even those with}} low rates of primary production. However, animals vary in their degree of dependence on these subsidies. We examined dietary sources for aquatic animals restricted to refugial habitats (waterholes) {{during the dry season}} in Australia’s wet–dry tropics, and show that allochthony is strongly size dependent. While small-bodied fishes and invertebrates derived a large proportion of their diet from autochthonous sources within the waterhole (phytoplankton, periphyton, or macrophytes), larger animals, including predatory fishes and crocodiles, demonstrated allochthony from seasonally inundated floodplains, coastal zones or the surrounding savanna. Autochthony declined roughly 10 % for each order of magnitude increase in body size. The largest animals in the food web, estuarine crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus), derived ~ 80 % of their diet from allochthonous sources. Allochthony enables crocodiles and large predatory fish to achieve high biomass, countering empirically derived expectations for negative density vs. body size relationships. These results highlight the strong degree of connectivity that exists between rivers and their floodplains in systems largely unaffected by river regulation or dams and levees, and how large iconic predators could be disproportionately affected by these human activities.

Life in the sea has been broadly classified into three groups, viz., the plankton, the nekton and the benthos. The majority of the faunal assemblages of the plankton consists of zooplankton.

30|$|In {{enhanced}} oil recovery, a dilute aqueous solution of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide {{is used as}} a pushing fluid in the injection wells to sweep oil in the reservoir into the production well. Mobility reduction or viscosity behavior of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide polyelectrolyte solutions {{plays an important role in}} such applications. The properties of polyelectrolytes in aqueous solutions have been widely investigated in the past decade [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Oil production has three different stages: primary (production by natural reservoir energy), secondary (on the supply of external energy into the reservoir in the form of injecting fluids to increase reservoir pressure) and <b>tertiary</b> <b>production</b> ({{enhanced oil}} recovery methods increase the mobility of the oil in order to increase production). Over the lifetime of the oil field, the pressure will fall, and at some point, there will be insufficient underground pressure to lift the oil to the surface. In order to maintain the reservoir pressure and sweep out oil in a more efficient way, water flooding as secondary oil production is a practical and effective way for many reservoir formations. A problem with water flooding is that in many cases oil has higher viscosity than water, and this, however, may lead to an unstable displacement. Increasing the viscosity of injected water by adding a polymer will improve sweep during water flooding process. It is necessary to study and evaluate the rheological properties of the polymers before implementation as polymer flooding [40].|$|E

During warm years, there was a weak tendency for earlier timings of spring taxa and later timings of autumn taxa. While this {{is in line with}} many previous findings, numerous exceptions existed and only a few taxa (e. g. Gyrodinium spp., Pseudocalanus elongatus, and Acartia clausi) showed consistent, strong evidence for temperature-related timing shifts, revealed by all 4 of the timing indices that we used. Also, the calculated offsets in timing i. e. ‘‘mismatches’’) between predator and prey were no greater in extreme warm or cold years than during more average years. Further, the magnitude of these offsets had no effect on the ‘‘success’’ of the predator, in terms of their annual mean abundance or egg production rates. Instead numerous other factors override, including: inter-annual variability in food quantity, high food baseline levels, turnover rates and prolonged seasonal availability, allowing extended periods of production. Furthermore many taxa, notably meroplankton, increased well before the spring bloom. While theoretically a chronic mismatch, this likely reflects trade-offs for example in predation avoidance. Various gelatinous taxa (Phaeocystis, Noctiluca, ctenophores, appendicularians, medusae) may have reduced these predation constraints, with variable, explosive population outbursts likely responding to improved conditions. The match–mismatch hypothesis may apply for highly seasonal, pulsed systems or specialist feeders, but we suggest that the concept is being over-extended to other marine systems where multiple factors compensate...|$|E

40|$|This paper argues that, {{from the}} beginning, Media Studies — {{at least in}} Australian schools and {{universities}} — did not display the usual organising principles of an academic subject. Media Studies in both Australian secondary schools and universities has traditionally been organised to include the written alongside the oral and practical, to integrate theory with practice, {{to focus on the}} application — often {{at the expense of the}} abstraction of knowledge. At the school level, this theory/production integration has been justified and promoted under the rubric that students ‘learn by doing’. At university level, much of the same rhetoric is used but at the <b>tertiary</b> level media <b>production</b> classes also cater for the students who see — or hope to see — that a degree in Media Studies is an entrée into the media industries. This approach, the integration of training in media production with education in media theory and criticism, produces tensions, apparent contradictions and misalignments that are obvious to teachers and students alike. Drawing from post-modernist critiques and sociologies of subject knowledge, the study uses interviews with school teachers, students, academics and observations of lessons at school and university level to describe the issues and concerns from multiple perspectives...|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 {{indicates}} that breakthrough times for model# 2, model# 1 and model# 3 happen at 54  days (0.0168 PV), 30  days (0.0093 PV), and 19  days (0.0059 PV) after HSW breakthrough time, respectively. This issue {{has also shown}} in the plot of well water cut versus pore volume of water injected, in which the amount of well water cut suddenly increased from zero value. It {{should be pointed out}} that three models have the same oil recovery factor until 1241  days [breakthrough time (0.389 PV)], which reveals that there is no effect of low-salinity brine injection on oil recovery up to this time. The results also express that the general model with a weighting coefficient of model# 2 can continue its oil production for some more few years after 4500  days due to the minimal reduction in the slope of oil recovery curve. Using Fig.  7, it can be estimated by extrapolation that the amount of oil recovery for high-salinity water flooding does not exceed 51 % after many years of injection. However, the difference in oil recovery between each of three models and HSW flooding increases more and more over time, which reveals that the efficiency of LSW flooding rises after many years from the beginning of the injection; hence, LSW flooding is only useful for the secondary or <b>tertiary</b> stage of <b>production.</b> The amount of recovery enhancement in this study is consistent with previous researches, although some published data indicated even higher oil recovery within LSW flooding (Jerauld et al. 2006 b; Kim and Lee 2017; Lager et al. 2008 a; Omekeh et al. 2013; Shojaei et al. 2015).|$|R
