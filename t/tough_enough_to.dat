5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be <b>tough</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E

One controller was broken open on one side, and both were severely corroded and damaged by marine life. Both units were disassembled and the memory units flushed with deionized water. After they were dried and vacuum baked, data from these units was retrieved for forensic examination.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia inflorescences {{attract a}} variety of birds to the garden. <b>Tough</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as a}} street plant in parts of Sydney, B.ericifolia is a fairly easy plant to grow in the {{conditions}} it likes, namely a sandy, well drained soil and a sunny aspect. It requires extra water over dryer periods until established, which may take up to two years, as it comes from an area with rainfall in predominantly warmer months. It is resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, like most eastern banksias As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia ericifolia is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, this problem manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins; it can occur on plants grown in soils of high pH. This can happen especially where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E

I have worked hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown.

25|$|The U.S. Navy much {{preferred}} the more docile flight {{qualities of the}} F6F compared with the Vought F4U Corsair, despite the superior speed of the Corsair. This preference was especially noted during carrier landings, a critical success requirement for the Navy, in which the Corsair was fundamentally flawed in comparison. The Corsair was thus released by the Navy to the Marine Corps who, without the {{need to worry about}} carrier landings, used the Corsair to immense effect in land-based sorties. The Hellcat remained the standard USN carrier-borne fighter until the F4U series was finally cleared for U.S. carrier operations in late-1944 (the carrier landing issues had by now been tackled largely thanks to use of Corsair by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm). In addition to its good flight qualities, the Hellcat was easy to maintain and had an airframe <b>tough</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> withstand the rigors of routine carrier operations. Like the Wildcat, the Hellcat was designed for ease of manufacture and ability to withstand significant damage.|$|E
25|$|While market {{saturation}} was {{one reason}} for the fall in YAG production levels, another was the recent introduction of the other artificial garnet important as a diamond simulant, gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG; Gd3Ga5O12). Produced in much the same manner as YAG (but with a lower melting point of 1750nbsp&°C), GGG had an RI (1.97) close to, and a dispersion (0.045) nearly identical to diamond. GGG was also hard enough (hardness 7) and <b>tough</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be an effective gemstone, but its ingredients were also much more expensive than YAG's. Equally hindering was GGG's tendency to turn dark brown upon exposure to sunlight or other ultraviolet source: this was {{due to the fact that}} most GGG gems were fashioned from impure material that was rejected for technological use. The SG of GGG (7.02) is also the highest of all diamond simulants and amongst the highest of all gemstones, which makes loose GGG gems easy to spot by comparing their dimensions with their expected and actual weights. Relative to its predecessors, GGG was never produced in significant quantities; it became more or less unheard of by the close of the 1970s. Commercial names for GGG included Diamonique II and Galliant.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{the late}} 1970s, the Swan Brewery had a virtual {{monopoly}} in the Western Australia beer market. [...] Therefore, outside of the Goldfields where the original Hannan's Lager and Kalgoorlie Stout (Kalgoorlie brewed by the Swan Brewery owned Kalgoorlie Brewing Company) still held their own, the choice for beer drinkers was often only between Emu Bitter and Swan Lager, and both brews had their loyal consumers who would make fun of the opposing brew.

This behavior never really changed; if anything it became more brutal as Roy Jr. grew up. Many people would call Roy's father's treatment out-and-out abuse, but he believed {{he had a good}} reason for it: to make Roy Jr. <b>tough</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be a champion.

2500|$|Aquaman has {{a number}} of other superhuman powers, most of which derive from {{the fact that he is}} adapted to live and thrive in the harshest of {{underwater}} environments. He has the ability to breathe underwater and possesses a superhuman physique strong enough for his lungs to work unaffected by the immense pressure and the cold temperature of the ocean depths, also making him <b>tough</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> withstand attacks from superhuman opponents and resist machine gun fire. He also possesses superhuman strength as a result. [...] Aquaman possesses superhuman strength, but his strength is always underrated, considering the company that he keeps. Aquaman frequently displays feats of Super-Atlantean (the average Atlantean can lift/press approximately 2 tons) and Superhuman strength. While not on par with Superman and Wonder Woman, he has proven capable of leaps up to 6 miles. He threw an 8000-ton Soviet sub from the ocean floor (2.5 miles deep) to the surface and completely out of the water. [...] Aquaman and Wonder Woman both pulled a Naval Super Carrier through the ocean and onto land, They weigh at the least 70,000 tons or 140,000,000lbs. He single-handedly fights and defeats one of DC's most feared and toughest to defeat villains The Shaggy Man whose power and abilities are on par with Doomsday. He has lifted a 200-ton cruise ship completely out of the water. He has broken off a tectonic plate sending it crashing down to the ocean floor. [...] He can swim at very high speeds, capable of reaching speeds of 3,000meters per second (10,800km [...] per hour) and can swim up Niagara Falls. He also has swum to the four corners of the world gathering magic crystals needed to save the earth all within a few hours, and outswam a jet going hypersonic speed (6000mph). He can see in near total darkness and has enhanced hearing, granting limited sonar. Although he can remain underwater indefinitely without suffering any ill effects, Aquaman grows weak if he remains on land for extended periods. However, when Batman invented Aquaman's water suit he was able to walk on land for an indefinite amount of time and was no longer vulnerable to a [...] "dehumidifier". This weakness was later removed from continuity in 2011, establishing that he grew up on land before learning of his Atlantean heritage, but he still runs the risk of dying by dehydration within incredibly hostile environments. AC had been bestowed an ability he never showcased before gifted unto him by an old Sea Monarch, so far one of the said proclivities granted to him was the ability of unaided flight under his own power.|$|E
