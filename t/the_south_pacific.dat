5|$|USS Cummings {{served in}} the Pacific Fleet in the late 1930s, {{participating}} in numerous individual and fleet training exercises. In 1940, she served on security patrols off the west coast.

5|$|Within the Southern Hemisphere {{tropical}} cyclones generally form on {{a regular}} basis between the African coast and the middle of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific.</b> Tropical and Subtropical Cyclones have also been noted occurring in the Southern Atlantic Ocean at times. For various reasons including where tropical cyclones form, there are several different ways to split the area between the American and African coasts. For instance the World Meteorological Organization define three different basins for the tracking and warning of tropical cyclones. These are the South-West Indian Ocean between the African Coast and 90°E, the Australian region between 90°E and 160°E and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> between 160°E and 120°W.

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Rewa {{affected}} sixcountries {{and caused}} 22deaths on its 28-day journey across <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean in December1993 and January1994. Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28December south of Nauru. After forming, Rewa moved southwest through the Solomon Islands, crossing the 160thmeridian east from <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> basin into the Australian region. The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward, paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December. Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a Category4tropical cyclone on 2January. It maintained this intensity for about 12hours before {{an increase in}} wind shear induced its weakening by 3January. The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> basin on 4January, before it passed over New Caledonia between 5–6January.

5|$|Throughout the year, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E
