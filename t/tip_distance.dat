40|$|Background: Following {{internal}} fixation of intertrochanteric hip fractures, <b>tip</b> apex <b>distance,</b> fracture classification, {{position of}} the screw in the femoral head, and fracture reduction are known predictors for screw cutout, but {{the reliability of the}}se measurements is unknown. We investigated the reliability of the <b>tip</b> apex <b>distance</b> measurement, the Cleveland femoral head dividing system, the three-grade classification system of Baumgaertner for fracture reduction, and the AO classification system as predictors for screw cutout. Methods: All patients with an intertrochanteric hip fracture who were managed with either a dynamic hip screw or a gamma nail between January 2007 and June 2010 were evaluated from our hip trauma database. Results: The <b>tip</b> apex <b>distance</b> measurement was reliable and patients with device cutout had a significantly higher <b>tip</b> apex <b>distance.</b> The agreement between observers with regard to screw position and fracture reduction was moderately reliable. After adjustment for <b>tip</b> apex <b>distance</b> and screw position, A 3 fractures were at more risk of cutout compared with A 1 fractures. Poor fracture reduction was significantly related with a higher incidence of cutout in univariate analysis, but not in multivariate analysis. Central-inferior and anterior-inferior positions, after adjustment for <b>tip</b> apex <b>distance</b> and screw position, were significantly protective against cutout. Conclusion: To decrease probable risks of cutout, the <b>tip</b> apex <b>distance</b> needs to stay small or the screw needs to be placed central-inferiorly or anterior-inferiorly.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the relationship between interalar width, intercanine <b>tip</b> <b>distance</b> and anterior maxillary teeth width in a group of Iranian adults. Materials and Methods: This was an observational cross sectional study. The study included 120 dental students (60 males and 60 females) at School of Dentistry of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. First, interalar width was measured with a caliper on every subject. Then the length of the imaginary line connecting the 2 canine cusp tips (intercanine <b>tip</b> <b>distance)</b> was registered on a wax index. The collective width of the six anterior teeth was recorded using a brass wire on the prepared casts. Descriptive statistical, independent t-test, Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression were applied for statistical analysis (α = 0. 05). Results: The mean and standard deviation values for interalar width, intercanine <b>tip</b> <b>distance,</b> and the width of anterior maxillary teeth were 36. 38 ± 3. 81, 34. 15 ± 2. 05, and 48. 23 ± 2. 068 mm, respectively.

In general, cutting parameters are adjusted and tuned to provide the quality of cut desired. But this consumes exhaustive amounts of time and effort. Therefore, it is important to investigate the impact of cutting parameters on quality of cut. The aim {{of this study is to}} relate the CO 2 laser cutting parameters namely laser power, cutting speed and <b>tip</b> <b>distance</b> to the quality of cut of PMMA sheet.

40|$|Purpose: Tip {{test has}} been {{developed}} to characterize the friction during cold forging process based on a linear relationship between the maximum load and radial <b>tip</b> <b>distance</b> measured. In this previous investigation, a negative slope of linearity between maximum load and <b>tip</b> <b>distance</b> was observed which was totally opposite to the conventional tip test results although the linear relationship was still consistent. The present study investigates feasibility to utilize the tip test to differentiate the effect of surface roughness of the punch and dies on friction effect. Design/methodology/approach: For experiments, commercial aluminum alloys of 2024 -O and 6061 -O were used. Lubrication was varied with four different kinds of VG 32, VG 100, cooking corn oil, and grease. Maximum load and radial <b>tip</b> <b>distance</b> of deformed specimens were measured to determine {{the correlation between the}} two. Finite element simulation was utilized to calibrate and quantitatively determine friction factors at punch/work piece and die/work piece interfaces, respectively. Downsized tip test was performed with an experimental set-up by employing the punch, lower die, and counter punch working as bottom die. Findings: It was found that the ratio between these two friction factors and the slope between the <b>tip</b> <b>distance</b> and maximum load were dependent on the relative levels of surface roughness of the punch and dies. It was found that the tip test can be used to determine the effect of relative surface characteristics on friction behavior and material flow.

This recovers the validity of the tip test to determine the effect of the surface quality on friction behavior and material flow more scientifically.

The dependence of the maximum transmembrane potential across the cell membrane on cell size is much weaker than it is for bulk electroporation. Observed survival probabilities are related to the calculated fraction of the cell's surface area that is electroporated. Observed success of electroporation is related to the maximum transmembrane potential achieved...|$|R
