2500|$|Charter yacht visits usually {{begin in}} the Falkland Islands, last between four and six weeks, and enable guests to visit remote {{harbours}} of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Sailing vessels are now required to anchor out and can no longer <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the old whaling piers on shore. One exception to this is the recently upgraded/repaired yacht berth at Grytviken. All other jetties at former whaling stations lie inside a [...] exclusion zone; and berthing, or putting ropes ashore, at these is forbidden. Yachts visiting South Georgia are normally expected {{to report to the}} Government Officer at King Edward Point before moving round the island.|$|E
2500|$|BBC weather {{forecasts}} for the Cornwall area, {{broadcast the}} previous evening and earlier that morning, were discouraging; all promised increasing winds, up to Force 7, with the probability of rain from midday. Such weather conditions could produce heavy seas and poor visibility. Nevertheless, Darlwyne set out from Mylor shortly after 10.00 am in pleasant sunshine, expecting to return before 7.00 pm. The journey to Fowey, which included a slight detour to view Mevagissey harbour, was completed without incident, and the party arrived in Fowey just after 1.00 pm. By this time the weather had deteriorated, and it was raining heavily. Bown did not <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the main town quay, telling a local that the vessel was [...] "a bitch to handle", but anchored offshore, and again used the dinghies to land the party.|$|E

We were stuck thar a week once, just because we chanced {{to pick up a}} feller who'd been found gagged and then thrown overboard by wharf thieves. Had to dance attendance at court thar and lost our trip." [...] He stopped and looked half-pathetically at the prostrate Elijah. [...] "Look yer! ye ain't just dyin' to go ashore NOW and see yer friends and send messages, are ye?" ...|$|E

Let the waterman lie off in the stream, for if the flames come this way there will be a rush for boats, and people will not stop to ask to whom they belong. It will be better still to take one of the apprentices with you, leave him at the stairs till you return, and then <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a ship till we hail him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you took}} care of this house," [...] came the retort, [...] "an' cooked an' baked, an' washed, an' put up with what I put up, you'd have {{something}} to be beat out about. You've got a snap, you have. But just wait." [...] Sarah broke off to cackle gloatingly. [...] "Just wait, that's all, an' you'll be fool enough to get married some day, like me, an' then you'll get yours--an' it'll be brats, an' brats, an' brats, an' no more dancin', an' silk stockin's, an' three pairs of shoes at one time. You've got a cinch-nobody to think of but your own precious self--an' {{a lot of young}} hoodlums makin' eyes at you an' tellin' you how beautiful your eyes are. Huh! Some fine day you'll <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> one of 'em, an' then, mebbe, on occasion, you'll wear black eyes for a change." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'd been a widder-man {{for three}} yers, {{and his sister}} kept house for him. Then she got married and he just wanted some one to look after his house. It was worth looking after, too, mind you that. It's a {{handsome}} house. Jog along, black mare. As for Thomas, he was poor, and if his house didn't leak in dry weather it was about all that could be said for it, though it looks kind of pictureaskew. But, y'see, I loved Thomas, and I didn't care one red cent for W.O. So I argued it out with myself. 'Sarah Crowe,' say I--my first was a Crowe--'you can marry your rich man if you like but you won't be happy. Folks can't get along together in this world without {{a little bit of}} love. You'd just better <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Thomas, for he loves you and you love him and nothing else ain't going to do you.' Jog along, black mare. So I told Thomas I'd take him. All the time I was getting ready I never dared drive past W.O.'s place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me in the swithers again. But now I never think of it at all, and I'm just that comfortable and happy with Thomas. Jog along, black mare." ...|$|E

50|$|Fossil Bay {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular anchorages, {{particularly}} for small boats that prefer to <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> one of two docks rather than anchor or pick up a mooring ring. Fossil Bay is an inlet that opens to the southeast.|$|E

50|$|A small jetty {{dates to}} 1918. Originally 109 m long, it allowed ketches such as Karatta to <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> load cargoes, while a nearby fresh water well {{serviced}} horses which pulled wagons {{down to the}} bay. Until the 1930s, grain, stock and merchandise were taken to and from Kangaroo Island from this jetty.|$|E
50|$|Visiting tourist yachts {{and motor}} vessels can <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{pontoons}} inside the inner harbour, {{which has a}} fixed barrier to maintain water in the harbour at low tide, or may moor against outer harbour deep water pontoons.

5000|$|The Georgian Bay Line {{lost money}} in the 1960s. In 1963, after the GBL retired the North American, the South American and the Greene Line's Delta Queen were the last two long-distance cruise ships sailing under the U.S. flag. Neither vessel could meet modern fire-safety standards. In 1966, citing the danger to {{passengers}} of a catastrophic fire, Congress passed a law ordering both passenger vessels to <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the docks permanently. A series of temporary exceptions were carved out for the Delta Queen, {{but not for the}} South American. In 1967, the final Georgian Bay Line boat made its last trip.|$|E

50|$|In 2007 {{the event}} once again changed locations. The event would more closely follow to the {{original}} course, starting from the 79th Street Boat Basin but instead would end at Pier 84. The event itself was held at Pier 84, just south of Pier 86. It was chosen for both its large amount of room for tug boats to <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> and large space for the spectators to watch. The large Pier is now used as a park which is perfect for the spectators due to its space and easily available food and bathroom. This location would become the permanent location for the event.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 the {{location}} for the event was held at pier 63 Maritime. This location was superior to Staten Island {{for the fact that}} it had a good view for spectators. Unfortunately there were few places to tie the Tugboats. A barge was again provided for the line tossing competition and the awards ceremony. The barge also served as a place for tugs to tie up. The owner of pier 63 Maritime, John Krevey provided free food and drinks for the tugboat crew. However there were issues of the new location. The large amount of wake created by the event was deemed unsuitable by the neighboring Chelsea Piers. The lack of proper places for the tugboats to <b>tie</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> was also deemed a problem.|$|E
