5|$|There {{are several}} {{recorded}} incidents of CFM56 engines flaming out in heavy rain and/or hail conditions, beginning {{early in the}} CFM56's career. In 1987, a double flameout occurred in hail conditions (the pilots managed <b>to</b> <b>relight</b> the engines), followed by the TACA Flight 110 incident in 1988. Both CFM56 engines on the TACA 737 flamed out while passing through hail and heavy rain, and the crew was forced to land without engines on a grassy levee near New Orleans, Louisiana. CFMI modified the engines by adding a sensor to force the combustor to continuously ignite under these conditions.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order <b>to</b> <b>relight</b> the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E

The player returns the Amulet of Kings to Martin, and they subsequently {{travel to the}} Imperial City with the Blades <b>to</b> <b>relight</b> the Dragonfires and end the Daedric invasion. They find the city under attack by Daedra and an enormous avatar of Mehrunes Dagon himself. The player and Martin fight {{their way to the}} Temple of the One. There, Martin laments that they are powerless against Dagon's avatar and explains that they can only defeat him one way. He bids farewell to the player and shatters the Amulet of Kings, merging himself with the spirit of Akatosh, the Dragon-God of Time, thus becoming Akatosh's avatar. After a battle, Akatosh casts Dagon back into Oblivion and lets out a mighty roar before turning to stone. Martin, whose soul was consumed by the amulet, enters the afterlife to join his forebears. In a telepathic monologue to the player, he sheds an optimistic light, explaining that while the Amulet of Kings is destroyed and the throne again lies empty, the gates of Oblivion are now shut forever and the future of Tamriel now lies in the player's hands. The Empire's high chancellor sincerely thanks the player for their service during the crisis and proclaims them as the seventh Champion of Cyrodiil.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} relighting with sparsely sampled {{reflectance}} fields. We present a technique that approximates the correct result of relighting from intermediate light source positions. The acquisition of reflectance fields is a time consuming process, and typically the sampling resolution in the light source positions is rather limited. As a consequence, smoothly moving highlights and shadows due <b>to</b> <b>relighting</b> with a moving light source are hard to generate. Using light source interpolation, densely sampled reflectance fields can be simulated, enabling relighting with area light sources and smooth animation of highlights and shadows. Using light source interpolation we can relight with arbitrarily sampled 4 D incident light fields from complex or near-by light sources. ...|$|R

25|$|On 23 August 1179, Saladin {{arrived at}} Jacob’s Ford and ordered his troops to shoot arrows at the castle, thus {{initiating}} the siege. While the archers distracted the men inside the fortification, miners were digging a tunnel to breach {{the stone and}} iron walls at the north-east corner of Chastellet. Once the tunnel was dug, Saladin’s forces placed large amounts of wood inside and set it alight. This process, called sapping, was a method in which the tunnel's supports were burnt away forcing the walls to eventually collapse under their own weight. Sapping initially failed for Saladin and his troops, so the troops were forced {{to put out the}} fire with buckets of water and were paid one gold piece per bucket to do so. After the fire was extinguished, the miners were instructed <b>to</b> <b>relight</b> the fire. At the same time, Baldwin, having learned of this attack, called for reinforcements from Jerusalem.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a new theoretical approach to Image Processing and Vision. Expressed in mathemetical terminology, in our formalism image space is a fibre bundle, {{and the image}} itself is the graph of a section on it. This mathematical model has advantages to the conventional view of the image as a function on the plane: Based on the new method {{we are able to}} do image processing of the image as viewed by the human visual system, which includes adaptation and perceptual correctness of the results. Our formalism is invariant <b>to</b> <b>relighting</b> and handles seamlessly illumination change. It also explains simultaneous contrast visual illusions, which are intrinsically related to the new covariant approach. Examples include Poisson image editing, Inpainting, gradient domain HDR compression, and others. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} estimate the intrinsic texture properties (albedo, shading, normal) of scenes from multiple view acquisition under unknown illumination conditions. We introduce the concept of intrinsic textures, which are pixel-resolution surface textures representing the intrinsic appearance parameters of a scene. Unlike previous video relighting methods, the approach does not assume regions of uniform albedo, which makes it applicable to richly textured scenes. We show that intrinsic image methods {{can be used to}} refine an initial, low-frequency shading estimate based on a global lighting reconstruction from an original texture and coarse scene geometry in order to resolve the inherent global ambiguity in shading. The method is applied <b>to</b> <b>relighting</b> of free-viewpoint rendering from multiple view video capture. This demonstrates relighting with reproduction of fine surface detail. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic models with textured appearance shows accurate estimation of intrinsic surface reflectance properties. © 2014 Springer International Publishing...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{image-based}} approach <b>to</b> <b>relighting</b> photographs of tree canopies. Our {{goal is to}} minimize capture overhead; thus the only input required {{is a set of}} photographs of the tree taken at a single time of day, while allowing relighting at any other time. We first analyze lighting in a tree canopy both theoretically and using simulations. From this analysis, we observe that tree canopy lighting is similar to volumetric illumination. We assume a single-scattering volumetric lighting model for tree canopies, and diffuse leaf reflectance; we validate our assumptions with synthetic renderings. We create a volumetric representation of the tree from 10 - 12 images taken at a single time of day and and use a single-scattering participating media lighting model. An analytical sun and sky illumination model provides consistent representation of lighting for the captured input and unknown target times. We relight the input image by applying a ratio of the target and input time lighting representations. We compute this representation efficiently by simultaneously coding transmittance from the sky and to the eye in spherical harmonics. We validate our method by relighting images of synthetic trees and comparing to path-traced solutions. We also present results for photographs where sparse, validating with time-lapse ground truth sequences...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technique, based on pre-computed light transport and separable BRDF approximation, for interactive rendering of non-diffuse objects under all-frequency environment illumination. Existing techniques using spherical harmonics to represent environment maps and transport functions {{are limited to}} low-frequency light transport effects. Non-linear wavelet lighting approximation is able to capture all-frequency illumination and shadows for geometry relighting, but interactive rendering is currently limited to diffuse objects. Our work extends the wavelet-based approach <b>to</b> <b>relighting</b> of non-diffuse objects. We factorize the BRDF using separable decomposition and keep only a few low-order approximation terms, each consisting of a 2 D light map paired with a 2 D view map. We then pre-compute light transport matrices corresponding to each BRDF light map, and compress the data with a non-linear wavelet approximation. We use modern graphics hardware to accelerate precomputation. At run-time, a sparse light vector is multiplied by the sparse transport matrix at each vertex, {{and the results are}} further combined with texture lookups of the view direction into the BRDF view maps to produce view-dependent color. Using our technique, we demonstrate rendering of objects with several non-diffuse BRDFs under all-frequency, dynamic environment lighting at interactive rates.

Therefore an improved understanding of ignition behaviour is required to ensure that stringent relight requirements can be satisfied. Realistic operating conditions are simulated in a ground-based test facility. The application of laser diagnostics presents particular difficulties due to the large quantities of liquid fuel that impinge on the combustor walls during relight. Advances {{are made in the}} application of planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) to monitor fuel placement in a combustor under these conditions. A novel apparatus is developed to deliver a laser sheet to the combustion chamber while protecting all optical surfaces from contamination.

High-speed flame imaging performed simultaneously with the PLIF measurements provides important insights into the motion and breakup of flame during relight.
