Moreover, the co-operative law to be applied in each case has a decisive effect on <b>taxing</b> <b>aspects,</b> regulating as it does not only the specific procedure to be followed in determining the obligatory funding, but also whether to consider co-operative tax itself as a deductible expense.

40|$|We {{argue in}} this paper that the second-best nature of trade-policy {{intervention}} makes it likely {{that the issue of}} time consistency viii be an important consideration in determining both the extent and the efficacy of such intervention in most environments. The point is seen most directly by noting that a tariff is both a tax on consumers and a subsidy to producers of the import-competing good. Since first-best intervention typically calls for targeting each distortion with a separate tax/subsidy, the tariff will be a more effective policy tool if its consumption <b>tax</b> <b>aspect</b> can be separated from its production subsidy dimension. Consequently, if production decisions are made prior to consumption decisions, a government with sufficient policy flexibility will be tempted to surprise producers with policies other than those announced {{in an effort to make}} this separation. This leads optimal trade policy intervention to be time-inconsistent in a wide range of environments. We explore this idea in general terms and illustrate the results with specific examples. ...|$|R
