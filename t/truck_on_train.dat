2500|$|... 19 December 2007: a TGV from Paris to Geneva {{collided}} {{at about}} [...] with a <b>truck</b> <b>on</b> a level crossing near Tossiat in eastern France, near the Swiss border. The {{driver of the}} <b>truck</b> died; <b>on</b> the <b>train,</b> one person was seriously injured and 24 were slightly injured.|$|R
25|$|Turbochargers are {{commonly}} used <b>on</b> <b>truck,</b> car, <b>train,</b> aircraft, and construction equipment engines. They are most often used with Otto cycle and Diesel cycle internal combustion engines. They have also been found useful in automotive fuel cells.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fire was}} {{reported}} on 11 September 2008, at approximately 13:57 UTC (14:57 BST / 15:57 CEST) [...] from the French {{entrance to the}} tunnel in the North Tunnel. The blaze spread to other <b>trucks</b> <b>on</b> the <b>train</b> during the evening, destroying six carriages and one locomotive. The fire continued to burn overnight and {{was reported to have}} been put out by 06:00 UTC the following day, although fire crews continued to smother minor fires nearby for a further two hours. More than 300 firefighters {{from both sides of the}} English Channel helped tackle the blaze, with emergency services from East and West Sussex, London and Essex providing support.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Brunel in {{evidence}} then {{stated that he}} had examined the slip that caused the accident, {{but that it was}} a new one, close to the earlier one. The cutting was 57 ft deep, 40 ft wide at the bottom, 268 ft wide at the top. Spoil heaps on the top edge of the slope had not moved and therefore could not have contributed to the slip. The passenger <b>trucks</b> <b>on</b> the <b>train</b> had been between the tender and the goods waggons because this was the safest place for them: [...] "many accidents might arise to passengers if placed {{in the rear of the}} luggage trains" [...] if a following train ran into it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You came by the 3.10, Mr. Denham?" [...] {{said the}} Reverend Wyndham Datchet, tucking his napkin into his collar, so that almost {{the whole of}} his body was {{concealed}} by a large white diamond. [...] "They treat us very well, on the whole. Considering the increase of traffic, they treat us very well indeed. I have the curiosity sometimes to count the <b>trucks</b> <b>on</b> the goods' <b>trains,</b> and they're well over fifty--well over fifty, at this season of the year." ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{acoustic}} cleaner {{consists of}} a sound source similar to an air horn found <b>on</b> <b>trucks</b> and <b>trains,</b> attached to the material-handling equipment, which directs a loud sound into the interior. It is powered by compressed air rather than electricity {{so there is no}} danger of sparking, which could set off an explosion. It consists of two parts: ...|$|R
60|$|The old gentleman {{had been}} roused agreeably by the {{presence}} of this attentive and well-informed young man, as was evident by the care with which he finished the last words in his sentences, and his slight exaggeration in the number of <b>trucks</b> <b>on</b> the <b>trains.</b> Indeed, the chief burden of the talk fell upon him, and he sustained it to-night in a manner which caused his sons to look at him admiringly now and then; for they felt shy of Denham, and were glad not to have to talk themselves. The store of information about the present and past of this particular corner of Lincolnshire which old Mr. Datchet produced really surprised his children, for though they knew of its existence, they had forgotten its extent, as they might have forgotten the amount of family plate stored in the plate-chest, until some rare celebration brought it forth.|$|R
5000|$|Airport {{revitalization}} {{efforts in}} the late 1990s resulted in significant improvements after 2001. In 2001, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Education certified and licensed ‘Carnegie Mellon Driver Training & Safety Institute, Inc.’, (CM-DSTI) a non-profit subsidiary of Carnegie Mellon University, PA, to operate a private licensed school. This school, funded under a $7.5 Million congressional appropriation in 1999, provided large <b>truck</b> driver <b>training</b> <b>on</b> the airport property focusing on public transportation safety and security and human performance reliability (stress and fatigue). This included an indoor simulator (valued at approximately $650,000) and hands <b>on</b> <b>training</b> <b>on</b> Taxiway F (old decommissioned runway) [...] This school occupied three buildings {{at the heart of}} the Connellsville Airport (formerly buildings occupied by the USMC Reserve Training Center). The school, which had 60 employees and a $12 Million annual budget, operated at the airport location until about 2002.|$|R
5000|$|Commercial vehicle {{placards}} are of {{two general}} types, the single indicator, where in specific information of a fixed nature is displayed by the sign, {{such as the}} yellow [...] "oxidizing agent" [...] sign below, and the NFPA [...] "fire diamond" [...] style device which can be changed to depict new information as {{the contents of the}} vehicle change, and which carries information about the compound being carried, placard is similar to posters and logos, its flammability and resistance to water, for example. To see the signs put <b>on</b> <b>trucks</b> and <b>trains</b> meaning hazmats see: Hazmat Placards.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, the United States Postal Service {{explored}} {{the concept of}} flying post offices using highly modified C-82s which would operate similarly to those <b>on</b> <b>trains</b> where mail would be sorted by clerks and put in bags and then transferred to <b>trucks</b> <b>on</b> landing.|$|R
5000|$|Production {{began in}} August 1914 and twelve guns were {{produced}} in the first production lot. An additional twenty guns with the angle of elevation increased from 65° to 75° were produced in 1915 for the Imperial Russian Navy, but none were delivered. The guns were installed <b>on</b> <b>trucks,</b> armored <b>trains</b> and fixed land mounts instead. [...] By the end of 1917 only 76 guns had been completed, well short of the order the Artillery Inspectors office of the Imperial Russian Army had placed, which stated a minimum requirement of 146 batteries with 584 guns. Production was halted in 1921, but restarted in 1922 and continued until 1934. The Soviet name for the gun was 8-K.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, a {{table is}} added showing {{the number of}} offices and {{employees}} classed. First were listed the employees in the five divisions of the New York & Erie Railroad divided in workers at the station, <b>on</b> <b>trains,</b> <b>on</b> repairs of <b>trucks,</b> and <b>on</b> repairs of bridges and buildings.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe authors {{conducted}} an experimental study about road haulers' choice between railways and roads. If road haulers choose to load their <b>truck</b> <b>on</b> a <b>train,</b> {{they are not}} able to switch to using the road again until they reach the end of the line. On the contrary, highway choice is flexible in that the road hauler can change road at any time. Building upon the irreversibility of one of the two choices, the authors build a model in which traffic levels are risky using both infrastructures. In the model, they found that haulers' choices depend on the infrastructure price for railways and on the information level obtained by the hauler during travel. The flexible option is more valuable the more informed the agent is about traffic levels. These theoretical predictions are tested by implementing two experimental treatments. In the first, agents gain no information during their travel; in the second they become perfectly informed about traffic conditions during the travel. It is important that experimental payoffs are calibrated upon transport data about time and operating costs and infrastructure tariffs in France. From the experiment, the authors found that more risk-averse agents assign more value to the flexible option. The second result is that participants overreact to infrastructure price changes. The results indicate that, as the model stands, price levels and information level are important explanatory variables of choice. The higher the price is for railways and the higher the information is, the more participants give value to flexible option (highway), especially if participants are risk averse. The second result is that participants overreact to infrastructure price modification. The authors observed that, except for low levels of price, participants tend to choose the flexible option more frequently, even if it is suboptimal...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{efficient}} solution for automatic detection and reading of dangerous goods plates <b>on</b> <b>trucks</b> and <b>trains.</b> According to the ADR agreement dangerous goods transports are marked with an orange plate covering the hazard {{class and the}} identification number for the hazardous substances. Since under real-world conditions high resolution images (often at low quality) have to be processed an efficient and robust system is required. In particular, we propose a multi-stage system consisting of an acquisition step, a saliency region detector (to reduce the run-time), a plate detector, and a robust recognition step based on an Optical Character Recognition (OCR). To demonstrate the system, we show qualitative and quantitative localization/recognition results on two challenging data sets. In fact, building on proven robust and efficient methods, we show excellent detection and classification results under hard environmental conditions at low run-time. 1...|$|R
