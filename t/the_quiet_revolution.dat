5000|$|Gaston Miron, [...] ( [...] ; January 8, 1928 [...] - [...] December 14, 1996) was an {{important}} poet, writer, and editor of <b>the</b> Quebec <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution.</b> His masterpiece, L'homme rapaillé (partly translated as The March to Love: Selected Poems of Gaston Miron, whose title echoes Miron's most celebrated poem La marche à l'amour) has sold over 100 000 copies, in Quebec and overseas, ensuring Miron {{as one of the}} most widely read authors of Quebec literature. His commitment for a free and independent Quebec, both politically and through his writings, associated with his popularity, placed Miron as a central figure of the Quebec nationalist and independence movements.|$|R

40|$|This work reviews our {{understanding}} of the magnetic fields observed in <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> Sun. <b>The</b> subject has undergone a major change during <b>the</b> last decade (<b>quiet</b> <b>revolution),</b> and it will remain changing since the techniques of diagnostic employed so far are known to be severely biased. Keeping these caveats in mind, our work covers the main observational properties of <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> Sun magnetic fields: magnetic field strengths, unsigned magnetic flux densities, magnetic field inclinations, as well as the temporal evolution on short time-scales (loop emergence), and long time-scales (solar cycle). We also summarize the main theoretical ideas put forward to explain the origin of <b>the</b> <b>quiet</b> Sun magnetism.

500|$|The Richard Riot has {{achieved}} a mythical place in Canadian folklore. The riot is commonly viewed as a violent manifestation of the discontent Francophones within Quebec held with their place in largely Anglophone Canada, and some historians consider the riot to be a precursor to <b>the</b> 1960s <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution.</b> In its 40th anniversary retrospective of the Riot, Montreal newspaper La Presse opened with the following passage: [...] "Forty years ago began {{one of the most}} dramatic episodes in the history of Quebec, and of hockey." [...] Richard himself publicly dismissed his role as a catalyst for cultural or political change. He added in 1974 that he played with [...] "English boys" [...] and was largely unaware of the situation in French Quebec at the time.|$|R

25|$|The {{party has}} {{traditionally}} supported {{a form of}} Quebec federalism that supports Quebec remaining within the Canadian federation while also supporting reforms that would allow Quebec substantial autonomy. While the party {{has been described as}} centre-right in the context of Canadian politics, the party believes in a strong role for government in the economy and supports socially liberal policies. Also the party has had a prominent social-democratic faction within it that was historically prominent in the party during <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution.</b>|$|E
25|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution,</b> Quebeckers affirmed their identity, {{especially}} in the arts, culture and language. It was during the revolution {{that the government of}} Quebec formed the Ministry of Culture which focused mainly on defending the French language and culture. The transformation of Quebec was also marked by the adoption of the Law on the assurance-hospitalisation, guaranteeing universal health care through a tax-funded public delivery system. In 1964, Quebec had recognized the equality between men and women and allows all women to have jobs which were once exclusively for men.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} was issued its second provincial charter in 1950. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s (following <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution)</b> {{was a response}} to popular pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals as well as society. Its influence may be seen in when the {{university was}} issued its' third provincial charter, which was passed in 1967. It defined the Université de Montréal as a public institution, dedicated to higher learning and research, in the administration of which students and teachers would have the right to participate.|$|E
25|$|From <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution</b> to {{the passing}} of Bill 101, French in Quebec saw a period of {{validation}} in its varieties associated with the working class while the percentage of literate and university-educated francophones grew. Laws concerning the status of French were passed both on the federal and provincial levels. The Office québécois de la langue française was established to play an essential role of support in language planning. In Ontario, the first French-language public secondary schools {{were built in the}} 1960s, but not without confrontations. West Nipissing, Penetanguishene and Windsor each had their own school crisis.|$|E
25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution,</b> the {{government}} of Quebec invested heavily in the province's industries, A large component of this was nationalizing some predominant industries into state run business for example Hydro Quebec. {{in an attempt to}} modernize the economy and to encourage the development of francophone businesses. It was during this period that {{the government}} established the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the Régie des rentes and the Société générale de financement to promote the development of the industries in Quebec. In 1961, the Conseil d’orientation économique was established to promote economic growth of the regions of Quebec, growth which was once heavily funded by the Government of Canada.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Quebec {{experienced}} <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution</b> {{to modernize}} society from traditional Christian teachings. Québécois nationalists demanded independence, and tensions rose until violence erupted during the 1970 October Crisis. In 1976 the Parti Québécois {{was elected to}} power in Quebec, with a nationalist vision that included securing French linguistic rights in the province {{and the pursuit of}} some form of sovereignty for Quebec, leading to a referendum in 1980 in Quebec on the question of sovereignty-association, which was turned down by 59% of the voters. At the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982, the Quebec premier did not sign it; this led to two unsuccessful attempts to modify the constitution so it would be signed, and another referendum on Quebec independence in 1995 which was turned down by a small majority of 50.6%.|$|E
25|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution,</b> Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism {{and later}} the October Crisis the party's {{position}} on the national question {{became the subject of}} broad debate across the country, and influenced the agreement of the Canadian Labour Congress to work with the Quebec Federation of Labour on an equal and voluntary basis. The communists called for workers sympathetic with independence movements to unite on a common, immediate class-based programme of common struggle with English-speaking Canadian workers. The PCQ helped re-launch Montreal's mass May Day demonstrations and advanced many unique policies including the idea of a federated party of labour, which proved its prescience with the formation of Québec solidaire. The federated party of labour proposal was endorsed by the late 1960s by most trade union centrals, but the project was eclipsed by the emergence of the Parti Quebecois.|$|E
25|$|The {{aforementioned}} version {{opts for}} {{a certain level of}} sovereignty, while remaining within the greater British Empire or Commonwealth. The Canadian Tories are such example. Canadian Tories were also strongly opposed to free trade with the U.S, fearing economic and cultural assimilatation. On the other hand, French Canadian nationalism has its roots as early as pre-confederation. Although a more accurate portrait of French Canadian nationalism is illustrated by such figures as Henri Bourassa {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. Bourassa advocated for a nation less reliant on Great Britain whether politically, economically or militarily, although he was not, at the same time, opting for a republic which was the case for the radical French-speaking reformers in the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837. Nor were Bourassa or others necessarily advocating for a provincial nationalism, i.e. for the separation of Quebec from Canada which became a strong component in Quebec politics during <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution</b> and especially through the rise of the Parti Québécois in 1968.|$|E
5000|$|Montréal has a rich, {{yet still}} {{relatively}} young literary history in both French and English literature. A {{large number of}} novels have captured the realities of Montreal. While any list will understandably be subjective, a few works are agreed {{to be important in}} Canadian and Québécois literature. Written in 1947, Gabrielle Roy's The Tin Flute (in French Bonheur d'occasion), which chronicles the life of a young woman in the neighborhood of St-Henri, marked Québécois literature for its urban texture. The work of Mordecai Richler, highlighted by The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1959), depicts the lives of poor English-speaking residents of Mile End. Mostly Michel Tremblay perhaps best summarizes the alienation of poor working-class Montréalais at the onset of <b>the</b> Quebec <b>Quiet</b> <b>revolution.</b> <b>The</b> all-time best-selling novel in Québécois literature, Yves Beauchemin's The Alley Cat (Le Matou), depicts a relatively similar neighborhood twenty years later. The later work of Émile Ollivier, for example La Brûlerie, is a portrait of French-speaking immigrants establishing their lives in the Côte-des-Neiges neighborhood.The nineteenth-century poet Émile Nelligan, whom American critic Edmund Wilson famously called [...] "the only first-rate Canadian poet, French or English," [...] has many schools and libraries named in his honour in Montreal and around Quebec. Montreal was also the centre of literary modernism in English Canada, led by the Montreal Group of poets including A.M. Klein and F. R. Scott in the mid-1920s. Montreal hosts a number of events related to literature, including the multilingual Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival, which takes place every Spring and the Expozine alternative press fair every fall.|$|R

25|$|Christianity is the {{predominant}} religion of French Canadians, with Roman Catholicism the chief denomination. The kingdom of France forbade non-Catholic settlement in New France from 1629 onward and thus, almost all French settlers of Canada were Catholic. In the United States, some families of French-Canadian origin have converted to Protestantism. Until the 1960s, religion {{was a central}} component of French-Canadian national identity. The Church parish was {{the focal point of}} civic life in French-Canadian society, and religious orders ran French-Canadian schools, hospitals and orphanages and were very influential in everyday life in general. During <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution</b> of the 1960s, however, the practice of Catholicism dropped drastically. Church attendance in Quebec currently remains low. Rates of religious observance among French Canadians outside Quebec tend to vary by region, and by age. In general, however, those in Quebec are the least observant, while those in the United States of America and other places away from Quebec tend to be the most observant.|$|E
25|$|Many {{aspects of}} life for French-speaking Quebeckers {{remained}} dominated by the Catholic Church in the decades following 1867. The Church operated many of {{the institutions of the}} province, including most French-language schools, hospitals, and charitable organizations. The leader of the Catholic Church in Quebec was the Bishop of Montreal, and from 1840 to 1876 this was Ignace Bourget, an opponent of liberalism. Bourget eventually succeeded in gaining more influence than the liberal, reformist Institut Canadien. At his most extreme, Bourget {{went so far as to}} deny a Church burial to Joseph Guibord, a member of the Institut, in 1874. A court decision forced Bourget to allow Guibord to be buried in a Catholic cemetery, but Bourget deconsecrated the burial plot of ground, and Guibord was buried under army protection. The conservative approach of the Catholic Church was the major force in Quebec society until the reforms of <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution</b> during the 1960s.|$|E
500|$|Quebec, a {{province}} in Canada since its foundation in 1867, {{has always been}} the sole majority French-speaking province. Long ruled by forces (such as the Union Nationale) that focused on affirmation of the province's French and Catholic identity within Canada, <b>the</b> <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution</b> of the early 1960s prompted a surge in civic and economic nationalism, as well as voices calling for the independence of the province and the establishment of a nation state. Among these was René Lévesque, who would eventually found the Parti Québécois with like-minded groups seeking independence from Canada. After arriving in power in 1976, the PQ government held a referendum in 1980 seeking a mandate to negotiate [...] "sovereignty-association" [...] with Canada that was decisively defeated.|$|E
5000|$|... "The pill" [...] {{provided}} {{many women}} a more affordable {{way to avoid}} pregnancy. Before the pill was introduced many women did not look for long term jobs. Previously, the typical woman would {{jump out of the}} job market when she got impregnated and would reenter it when her child was of school attending age. Abortion was illegal and there were too many health risks involved in most illegal abortions. There was a visible trend in the increasing age of women at first marriage in the decades between 1930 and 1970 after contraception was provided to non-married females. As part of <b>the</b> woman's <b>quiet</b> sexual <b>revolution,</b> pills gave women control over their future. In a way, the ability to pursue higher education without the thought of pregnancy, gave women more equality in educational attainment. Since women could have a choice to use birth control to finish their education, a higher percentage graduated from school and college ultimately gaining professional careers.|$|R
