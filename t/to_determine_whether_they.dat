5|$|The taxonomic affinities of the broad-billed parrot are undetermined.

30|$|Lu et al. {{examined}} concurrency bug patterns, manifestation, and fix {{strategies of}} 105 randomly selected real-world concurrency bugs from four open-source applications (MySQL, Apache, Mozilla and OpenOffice) bug databases [1]. Their {{study focused on}} several aspects {{of the causes of}} concurrency bugs, and the study of their effects was limited <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> caused deadlocks or not. We use the similar study methodology to find relevant bug reports for our analysis but we provide a complementary angle by studying the effects of recent concurrency bugs with a more fine-grained classification than mapping bugs into deadlock and not-deadlock bug classes.|$|R
5|$|In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes {{and two of}} the latter's {{business}} acquaintances—John le Mesurier and George Deakin—appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal hearing <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> {{should stand}} trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was being paid £50,000 by The Sunday Telegraph for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB report {{showed that}} the plane had several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to cabin pressure {{in the months leading}} up to the accident. The NTSB was unable <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E
5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal {{whether a person}} has a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or an excess of hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound {{is often used to}} investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E
5000|$|For statewide {{and special}} elections, {{automatic}} ballot access means that no petitions {{have to be}} filed {{to gain access to}} a ballot line, and party organizations can endorse candidates through their own conventions (this does not apply to legislative candidates, who still must petition onto the ballot regardless of party endorsement, but are only required to collect a third of the signatures required of non-qualified parties). Qualified parties also are the only parties eligible to hold primary elections in the state-run primary elections.

5|$|Many endemic Mascarene birds, {{including}} the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), {{are derived from}} South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed {{that this may be}} the case for all the parrots there as well. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Newton and Gadow found the Rodrigues parrot to be closely related to the broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) due to their large jaws and other osteological features, but were unable <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> both belonged in the same genus, since a head-crest was only known from the latter.

It is found that mid-IR excesses are present {{at a level of}} (1. 8 ± 0. 4) × 10 ^? 3. While the origin of these excesses remains uncertain, it is plausible that they arise from debris discs around these stars. I note that the measured incidence is consistent with a scenario in which dust lifetimes in debris discs are determined by Poynting-Robertson drag rather than by collisions...|$|R

25|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to label the {{families}} as aquatic, terrestrial or intermediate, and an indication is given where it is thought that the species is introduced. Some introductions to Great Britain are quite ancient, dating from Roman times or even earlier, for example, Paleolithic. Those species that do not have a shell usually do not leave an archeological or fossil record, and therefore it is not always possible <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are native or introduced. Species are considered to be native, unless otherwise indicated on the list; this information is taken from Kerney, 1999, updated in the case of slugs with the opinions of Rowson et al. 2014.|$|E
25|$|It is {{straightforward}} {{to verify that}} a given graph with n vertices and m edges is claw-free in time O(n4), by testing each 4-tuple of vertices <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> induce a claw. With more efficiency, and greater complication, one can test whether a graph is claw-free by checking, for each vertex of the graph, that the complement graph of its neighbors does not contain a triangle. A graph contains a triangle {{if and only if}} the cube of its adjacency matrix contains a nonzero diagonal element, so finding a triangle may be performed in the same asymptotic time bound as n'n matrix multiplication. Therefore, using the Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm, the total time for this claw-free recognition algorithm would be O(n3.376).|$|E

40|$|Circoviruses are small, nonenveloped {{icosahedral}} animal viruses {{characterized by}} circular single-stranded DNA genomes. Their genomes are the smallest possessed by animal viruses. Infections with circoviruses, {{which can lead}} to economically important diseases, frequently result in virus-induced damage to lymphoid tissue and immunosuppression. Within the family Circoviridae, different genera are distinguished by differences in genomic organization. Thus, Chicken anemia virus is in the genus Gyrovirus, while porcine circoviruses and Beak and feather disease virus belong to the genus Circovirus. Little is known about the structures of circoviruses. Accordingly, we investigated the structures of these three viruses with a view <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are related. Three-dimensional maps computed from electron micrographs showed that all three viruses have a T= 1 organization with capsids formed from 60 subunits. Porcine circovirus type 2 and beak and feather disease virus show similar capsid structures with flat pentameric morphological units, whereas chicken anemia virus has stikingly different protruding pentagonal trumpet-shaped units. It thus appears that the structures of viruses in the same genus are related but that those of viruses in different genera are unrelated...|$|R

25|$|In the Cohen et al. study, the MOT task {{involved}} viewing eight black moving discs presented {{against a}} changing background {{that consisted of}} randomly colored checkerboard masks. Four of these discs were picked out and participants were instructed to track these four discs. The RSVP task involved viewing a stream of letters and digits presented against a series of changing checkerboards, and {{counting the number of}} times a digit was presented. In both experiments, the critical trial involved a natural scene suddenly replacing the second last checkerboard, and participants were immediately afterwards asked whether they had noticed anything different, as well as presented with six questions <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> had categorized the scene. The dual-task condition simply involved participants performing the MOT task mentioned above and a scene-classification task simultaneously.

25|$|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern find {{themselves}} on a ship that has already set sail. The audience is {{led to believe that}} the pair has no knowledge of how they got there. At first, they try <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are still alive. Eventually, they recognize that they are not dead and are on board a boat. They remember that Claudius had given them a letter to deliver to England. After some brief confusion over who actually has the letter, they find it and end up opening it. They realize that Claudius has asked for Hamlet to be killed. While Rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now, Guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and with the plans of kings. The stage becomes black and, presumably, the characters go to sleep. Hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself, an act which takes place off stage in Hamlet.|$|E
25|$|In chronic opioid users, such {{as those}} on Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy (COAT) for {{managing}} severe, chronic pain, behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One 2000 study analysed COAT patients <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The {{findings from this study}} suggest that stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in driving (this includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., Rey Complex Figure Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the WAIS-R Block Design Test) but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher order cognitive abilities (i.e., planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It {{is important to note that}} this study reveals that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on psychomotor, cognitive, or neuropsychological functioning.|$|E
25|$|The boila {{were divided}} into inner and outer boilas and it was among their ranks that the holders of the highest {{military}} and administrative posts were selected. Most likely the outer boilas resided outside the capital, while the inner ones were member of the court under the direct influence of the monarch. The bagains were the second-ranking aristocratic class and {{were divided into}} numerous ranks. The presence of two separate nobility classes is further confirmed in the Responsa Nicolai ad consulta Bulgarorum (Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgarians), where BorisI wrote about primates and mediocres seu minores. Another privileged group were the tarkhans, although from the surviving inscriptions it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> belonged to the boilas or to the bagains, or were a separate class. The original Bulgar titles {{and many of the}} institutions from the pagan era were preserved after the Christianisation of Bulgaria until the very fall of the First Empire. The beginning of the 9th century was marked with a process of incorporation of both Slavs and Byzantine Greeks in the ranks of the Bulgarian nobility and privileged classes, which increased the power of the monarch that had been previously curtailed by the leading Bulgar aristocratic families. Since that time certain Slavic titles became more prominent, such as župan, and some of them mingled forming titles like župan tarkhan.|$|E
