The property had supposedly been secured by {{an agent of the}} Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the Siwanoy people in distant Norwalk, and the local natives likely had little <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> transaction, if they even knew of it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.|$|E

25|$|It {{might seem}} unusual that Hesiod's father {{migrated}} from Asia Minor westwards to mainland Greece, {{the opposite direction}} to most colonial movements at the time, and Hesiod himself gives no explanation for it. However around 750 BC or a little later, there was a migration of seagoing merchants from his original home in Cyme in Asia Minor to Cumae in Campania (a colony they shared with the Euboeans), and possibly his move west had something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> since Euboea is not far from Boeotia, where he eventually established himself and his family. The family association with Aeolian Cyme might explain his familiarity with eastern myths, evident in his poems, though the Greek world might have already developed its own versions of them.|$|E

I'm certain the show will be as entertaining as ever". In an interview with New York Magazine, Faust stated her reasons for leaving were a combination of a hectic production schedules and a lack of creative control she had with the series. According to her husband McCracken, Faust's departure was {{due to the fact that}} as a toy company-driven show, [...] "there were things she wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> series that she just wasn't able to do", and that there is [...] "still some frustration with" [...] not being able to bring some of her ideas to screen.|$|E

[...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons.

[...] Harrison was available because SF Impulse, which he had been editing, had ceased publication in early 1967. [...] Cohen agreed to phase out the reprints {{by the end of the}} year, and Harrison took the job. [...] Cohen added Harrison's name to the masthead of two issues of Great Science Fiction, although Harrison had had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> magazine, but the reprints in Fantastic and Amazing continued and Harrison decided to quit in February 1968. [...] He recommended Barry Malzberg as his replacement. Cohen had worked with Malzberg at the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and felt Malzberg would be more cooperative than Harrison. [...] Malzberg, however, turned out to be just as unwilling as Harrison to work with Cohen if the reprints continued, and soon regretted taking the job. [...] In October 1968 Cohen refused to pay for a cover that Malzberg had commissioned; Malzberg insisted, threatening to resign if Cohen did not agree. [...] Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. [...] Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement.
