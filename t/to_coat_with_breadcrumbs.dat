50|$|Crispy Pancakes is {{the name}} of a brand of frozen savoury pancakes <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>breadcrumbs</b> {{containing}} various fillings. Past names of fillings include cheddar cheese, chicken and bacon, chicken and sweetcorn and chicken and mushroom (these were phasing out in November 2001 and finally discontinued in 2002). Crispy pancakes, packaged in Britain, are sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Italy. In Italy, they are known as Sofficini ("soft ones, fluffy ones") and are described as tomato and mozzarella, mozzarella and spinach or cheese and ham.|$|R
50|$|By using {{a baking}} sheet pan placed above the grill surface, {{as well as a}} drip pan below the surface, it is {{possible}} to combine grilling and roasting to cook meats that are stuffed or <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>breadcrumbs</b> or batter, and to bake breads and even casseroles and desserts. When cooking stuffed or coated meats, the foods can be baked first on the sheet pan, and then placed directly on the grilling surface for char marks, effectively cooking twice; the drip pan will be used to capture any crumbs that fall off from the coating or stuffing.|$|R

50|$|Initially the patties {{were made}} of ground beef or veal. The chicken version {{appeared}} probably in 1830-1840s when Darya Pozharskaya inherited the inn after her father's death. There are numerous references by the contemporaries mentioning both veal cutlets Pozharsky and their versions made of minced chicken and <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>breadcrumbs.</b> The cutlets are mentioned in particular by Leitch Ritchie (1836), Victor d’Arlincourt (1843) and Théophile Gautier (1875). The first complete recipes of Pozharsky cutlets were published in a Russian cookbook in 1853; the cookbook included a recipe for chicken cutlets and one for fish cutlets. Pelageya Alexandrova-Ignatieva notes in The Practical Fundamentals of the Cookery Art (1899-1916) that the same cutlets can also be made from game (grouse, partridge etc.).|$|R

Mouse spermatozoa preferentially bound <b>to</b> beads <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> heparin (average values ranging between 6. 2 and 8. 8 sperm per bead were obtained in different experiments) and with chondroitinsulfate (6. 2 - 7. 0), and also, although with significant differences across replicate experiments, <b>to</b> beads <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> laminin (7. 9 - 15. 6 sperm per bead) and with collagen type I (6. 1 - 18. 5).

40|$|The {{adherence}} of [3 H]thymidine-labeled Streptococcus sanguis strains to bare hydroxyapatite and <b>to</b> hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> a {{range of}} concentrations of lysozyme, poly-L-lysine, poly-L-glutamic acid, whole saliva supernatant, and combinations {{of some of the}} above was studied. Adherence of several strains of S. sanguis to bare hydroxyapatite and saliva-coated hydroxyapatite was compared. Saliva present as a pellicle on the hydroxyapatite inhibited adherence of some strains (903, M- 5, 73 X 11) and stimulated that of others (S 35, B- 4, 66 X 49). Strains 903 and S 35 were chosen for further study. Adherence of both strains was stimulated up to fivefold by the presence of adsorbed lysozyme or poly-L-lysine on the hydroxyapatite, whereas poly-L-glutamic acid inhibited adherence (80 to 95 %). Adherence of strain S 35 <b>to</b> hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> combinations of saliva and (i) lysozyme, (ii) poly-L-lysine, or (iii) poly-L-glutamic acid was unaffected compared <b>with</b> adherence <b>to</b> hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> saliva alone. In contrast, adherence of strain 903 <b>to</b> hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> combinations of saliva and either lysozyme or poly-L-lysine was inhibited up to ca. 90 % compared <b>with</b> hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> saliva alone. Strain 903 was also unaffected by combinations of poly-L-glutamic acid and saliva on the hydroxyapatite. Adherent cells of both strains were completely (greater than 90 %) eluted with high-ionic-strength buffer from either bare hydroxyapatite or hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> lysozyme alone. Adherent cells of strain S 35 were only poorly eluted (25 %) from hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> either saliva alone or saliva and lysozyme. Strain 903 elution from hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> either saliva alone or saliva and lysozyme was essentially complete. These observations were taken to indicate that the two test strains adhered to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite by different mechanisms. Protein-coated hydroxyapatite was shown not to be saturated under the conditions described here. Examination by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the variously supplemented salivary pellicles formed on the hydroxyapatite demonstrated that major changes in salivary protein composition did not occur when lysozyme, poly-L-lysine, or poly-L-glutamic acid was used to supplement saliva. Lysozyme-dependent aggregation of strain 903 was shown not to occur under the conditions of our experiments. We suggest that the basis for stimulation of adherence <b>to</b> hydroxyapatite <b>coated</b> only <b>with</b> lysozyme is an increase in the cationic surface area available for electrostatic adherence of the microorganisms.
