40|$|Intestinal {{absorption}} of <b>temocapril,</b> a prodrug of temocaprilat, was evaluated in an in situ rat jejunal perfusion model {{under various conditions}} of luminal pH and in the presence and absence of carboxylesterase-mediated hydrolysis. <b>Temocapril</b> was more eas-ily taken up by mucosal cells at a luminal pH of 5. 4 than at pH 6. 4 or 7. 4 and was extensively hydrolyzed to temocaprilat in mucosal cells. The hydrolysis was limited by the intrinsic clearance and the influx rate at luminal perfusate pHs of 5. 4 and 7. 4, respectively. Temocaprilat, derived from <b>temocapril,</b> was transported into both mesenteric vein and jejunal lumen according to pH partition the-ory. The net {{absorption of}} both <b>temocapril</b> and temocaprilat was highest at a luminal perfusate pH of 5. 4. When both the luminal and venous fluid were at pH 7. 4, temocaprilat was transported approx-imately 3 -fold faster into the lumen than into the vein, due presum-ably to the greater surface area of the brush border membrane {{because of the presence}} of microvilli. Under carboxylesterase-inhibited conditions, the hydrolysis of <b>temocapril</b> was inhibited by only 50 %. It is postulated that serine esterases located on the membranes of the epithelial cells were responsible for the residual hydrolysis.

40|$|<b>Temocapril</b> is a prodrug whose {{hydrolysis}} by carboxylesterase 1 (CES 1) {{yields the}} active ACE inhibitor temocaprilat. This molecular-dynamics (MD) study uses a resolved {{structure of the}} human CES 1 (hCES 1) to investigate some mechanistic details of <b>temocapril</b> hydrolysis. The ionization constants of <b>temocapril</b> (pK 1 and pK 3) and temocaprilat (pK 1, pK 2, and pK 3) were determined experimentally and computationally using commercial algorithms. The constants so obtained were in good agreement and revealed that <b>temocapril</b> exists mainly in three ionic forms (a cation, a zwitterion, and an anion), whereas temocaprilat exists in four major ionic forms (a cation, a zwitterion, an anion, and a dianion). All these ionic forms were used as ligands in 5 -ns MS simulations. While the cationic and zwitterionic forms of <b>temocapril</b> were involved in an ion-pair bond with Glu 255 suggestive of an inhibitor behavior, the anionic form remained in a productive interaction with the catalytic center. As for temocaprilat, its cation appeared trapped by Glu 255, while its zwitterion and anion made a slow departure from the catalytic site and a partial egress from the protein. Only its dianion was effectively removed from the catalytic site and attracted to the protein surface by Lys residues. A detailed mechanism of product egress emerges from the simulations...|$|E

40|$|Objective—Endothelial {{vasodilator}} {{functions are}} progressively impaired with aging, which may account {{in part for}} the increased incidence of cardiovascular events in elderly people. We examined what treatment could ameliorate the endothelial dysfunction associated with aging in rats. Methods and Results—Aged (12 -month-old) Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with vehicle, <b>temocapril,</b> CS- 866 (an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist), cerivastatin, or hydralazine for 2 weeks. Endothelium-dependent relaxations (EDRs) of aortas from aged rats were markedly impaired compared with EDRs of aortas from young (3 -month-old) rats. Indomethacin, NS- 398 (a cyclooxygenase [COX]- 2 inhibitor), and SQ- 29548 (a thromboxane A 2 /prostaglandin H 2 receptor antagonist) acutely restored EDRs in aged rats, suggesting an involvement of COX- 2 –derived vasoconstricting eicosanoids. Tiron, a superoxide scavenger, also partially improved EDRs, suggesting an involvement of superoxide. EDRs were significantly ameliorated in aged rats after long-term treatment with <b>temocapril</b> or CS- 866 but not after treatment with cerivastatin or hydralazine. Indomethacin induced no further improvement of EDRs after treatment with <b>temocapril</b> or CS- 866. COX- 2 protein expression and superoxide production were increased in the aortas of aged rats and were also attenuated by treatment with <b>temocapril</b> or CS- 866.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESSupplemental {{myocardial}} hypertrophy {{induced by}} insulin-like growth factor (IGF) - 1 may prevent transition from hypertrophy to heart failure under chronic mechanical overload. BACKGROUNDSeveral {{studies have suggested}} that IGF- 1 treatment may be beneficial in chronic heart failure. In addition, recent studies indicated that the amount of α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) plays a significant hemodynamic role in large animals including humans. METHODSWe treated Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats on a long-term basis with IGF- 1. The effects were compared with those produced by treatment using a sub-antihypertensive dose of <b>temocapril,</b> an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. At 11 weeks, when these rats displayed compensated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), they were randomized to three groups: 1) IGF group (3 mg/kg/day); 2) <b>temocapril</b> group (1 mg/kg/day); and 3) vehicle (control) group. RESULTSAfter 15 weeks, the control rats showed left ventricular (LV) enlargement and severe LV dysfunction and rapidly died of pulmonary congestion (mean survival time: 16. 8 ± 0. 5 weeks). The survival time was significantly shortened (15. 6 ± 0. 3 weeks) in the IGF- 1 group but significantly prolonged (19. 5 ± 0. 6 weeks) in the <b>temocapril</b> group. The rats in the IGF- 1 group showed accelerated LV dilation and dysfunction. Of the several parameters investigated, {{it was found that the}} relative amounts of MHC isoforms differed among the three groups. The α-MHC mRNA level was decreased by 52 % (p < 0. 01) in the IGF group, while it increased by 58 % (p < 0. 01) in the <b>temocapril</b> group compared with the control group. These changes were related to the progression of LV dysfunction. CONCLUSIONSSupplemental myocardial hypertrophy with long-term IGF- 1 treatment may not be beneficial if concentric LVH already exists. Our data suggest that IGF- 1 may not protect myocardial performance when its hypertrophic effect aggravates the reduction of α-MHC. By contrast, the ACE inhibitor may improve myocardial function and prognosis by preventing the down-regulation of this isoform...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: Cystic medial {{degeneration}} (CMD) is a histologic abnormality that {{is common}} in aortic diseases such as aortic dilation, aneurysm, or dissection. Although {{little is known about}} the mechanism underlying CMD, we have previously demonstrated that angiotensin II signaling via angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT 2 R) plays a central role in apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) occurring in CMD associated with Marfan syndrome. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of angiotensin II signaling in THE pathogenesis of aortic diseases associated with CMD. Method: We investigated the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), <b>temocapril</b> (n = 15), angiotensin II receptor type- 1 (AT 1 R) blocker, CS- 866 (n = 15), and vehicle control (n = 17) on 0. 25 % β-aminopropionitrile monofumarate (BAPN) -induced aortic dissection and histopathologic findings in a rat model. Results: <b>Temocapril</b> significantly prevented aortic dissection (P <. 05), CMD (P <. 01), and VSMC apoptosis (P <. 01) compared with vehicle control in BAPN-fed rats. However, CS- 866 did not show any preventive effect. Reversed transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that expression of both AT 1 R and AT 2 R was detected in control rat aortas, and that AT 2 R expression was significantly upregulated in the aortas of BAPN-fed rats (P <. 01). Blood pressure was significantly and equally lowered in both <b>temocapril</b> and CS- 866 groups compared with control. Conclusions: Differential expression of angiotensin II receptors and AT 2 R signaling are involved in the pathogenesis of CMD and aortic dissection in BAPN-fed rats. ACEIs might be of clinical value for the prevention and treatment of aortic diseases related to CMD. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 36 : 818 - 23. ...|$|E

40|$|Background—In view {{of their}} mutual crosstalk, the roles of {{angiotensin}} II (Ang II) and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) in the myocardium {{are assumed to be}} synergistic and supplemental. Methods and Results—In the phase of compensated left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of Dahl salt-sensitive rats, Ang II peptide and the ACE mRNA in the LV were increased by 1. 6 - and 3. 8 -fold, respectively. In contrast, ET- 1 peptide and the preproET- 1 mRNA remained unchanged. In subsequent congestive heart failure (CHF), Ang II and ACE mRNA did not show further increases. But ET- 1 and the mRNA were increased de novo by 5. 3 - and 4. 1 -fold, respectively. In ascending aorta–banded rats, the local activations of Ang II and ET- 1 also showed a differential time course between LV hypertrophy and CHF. Long-term treatments of Dahl salt-sensitive rats with <b>temocapril</b> (an ACE inhibitor) and with bosentan (a mixed ET receptor blocker) equally improved long-term survival. <b>Temocapril</b> reduced the LV/body weight ratio and ameliorated LV fractional shortening. Conversely, although bosentan equally improved fractional shortening, it did not reduce the increase in LV mass. Combined treatment with these 2 drugs further ameliorated the animal’s survival without additional decreases in systolic pressure. Conclusions—The pathophysiological roles in the myocardium during the transition to CHF differ qualitatively between Ang II and ET- 1. Thus, long-term therapy with a combination of ACE inhibition and ET antagonism may provide a new approach for heart failure in humans. (Circulation. 2001; 104 : 606 - 612. ...|$|E
40|$|Whether {{temporary}} angiotensin II (AngII) blockade at the prediabetic stage attenuates renal {{injury in}} {{type 2 diabetic}} OLETF rats later in life was investigated. OLETF rats were treated with an AT 1 receptor antagonist (olmesartan, 0. 01 % in food), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (<b>temocapril,</b> 0. 01 % in food), {{a combination of the}} two, or hydralazine (25 mg/kg per d) at the prediabetic stage (4 to 11 wk of age) and then monitored without further treatment until 50 wk of age. At 11 wk of age, blood glucose levels and urinary protein excretion (U proteinV) were similar between OLETF and control LETO rats. However, OLETF rats showed higher kidney AngII contents and type IV collagen mRNA expression than LETO rats at this age. These decreased with olmesartan, <b>temocapril,</b> and a combination of these but not with hydralazine. At 50 wk of age, diabetic OLETF rats showed higher BP, U proteinV, and intrarenal AngII levels than LETO rats. Temporary AngII blockade did not affect glucose metabolism or the development of hypertension in OLETF rats but significantly suppressed proteinuria and ameliorated glomerular injury. However, no parameters were affected by temporary hydralazine treatment. The present study demonstrated that intrarenal AngII and type IV collagen expression are already augmented long before diabetes becomes apparent in OLETF rats. Furthermore, temporary AngII blockade at the prediabetic stage attenuates the progression of renal injury in these animals. These data suggest that early AngII blockade could be an effective strategy for preventing the development of type 2 diabetic renal injury later in life.

Blood pressure was decreased in dogs with CS 866 and a similar decrease was observed with the use of other drugs. The diameter of the small vessels was increased in dogs with CS 866 and <b>temocapril,</b> respectively, compared with the calcium antagonist. ＜Study 2 ＞ The effects of valsartan, on blood pressure, dialysate volume, and residual renal and peritoneal function in 36 CAPD patients before and 3 months after oral administration valsartan 40 - 80 mg daily were investigated comparing with amlodipine.

If any of these factors is not suitable for a particular reaction the activity of enzyme may change. This may lead to low or over activity of enzyme which results a wide category of ailments such as diabetes, Alzeimer’s disease, lysosomal storage disorders, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and cancer.
