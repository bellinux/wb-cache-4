5|$|Pratchett's {{first two}} adult novels, The Dark Side of the Sun (1976) and Strata (1981), were both science-fiction, the latter taking place partly on a {{disc-shaped}} world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his Discworld series and novels for children, with two exceptions: Good Omens (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which {{was nominated for}} both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about <b>the</b> <b>Apocalypse</b> set on Earth, and Nation (2008), a book for young adults.|$|E
5|$|This was the {{original}} idea for the story to open the tenth season. This story took aspects from The Seventh Seal, with the ruler of the Time Lords playing a variation of Chess with Death, who was leading a Federation of Evil. The three Doctors would get transported to an Underworld-like realm, where they would face such creatures of evil like the Four Horsemen of <b>the</b> <b>Apocalypse</b> and the Seven Deadly Sins. This was deemed too expensive and not suitable for a family show.|$|E

5|$|All over Europe, strange {{weather is}} {{provoking}} panic.

5|$|Eventually, {{following}} their repeated failures before Constantinople, {{and the continued}} resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began to project the fall of Constantinople to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came {{to be regarded as}} one of the signs of the arrival of the end times in Islamic eschatology. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and <b>the</b> <b>Apocalypse</b> of Daniel, written either at about the time of the siege or a century later.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of his third edition, Erasmus had seen the Complutensian Polyglot, and used its text for improvement of his own text. In the Book of Revelation he altered his fourth edition (1527) in about 90 passages {{on the basis of the}} Complutensian text. Unfortunately Erasmus had forgotten what places of <b>the</b> <b>Apocalypse</b> he translated from Latin and he did not correct all of them. Except in the Revelation, the fourth edition differed only in about 20 places from his third (according to Mill about 10 places). The fourth edition was printed in three parallel columns, they contain the Greek, Erasmus' own Latin version, and the Vulgate.|$|E
