In the same year, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher {{initiated}} a blind auction system, through the Broadcasting Act 1990, through which companies had {{to bid for}} the regional franchises. This system was {{to be used in}} the 1991 franchise round, which caused large changes to the network. Granada Television, the franchise holder for North West England, had long thought that the North of England should consolidate to [...] "counter the potential dominance of the south east". Tyne Tees outbid their main competition by £10million; their main challenger was 'North East Television', which was backed by Granada, Border and local newspaper the Evening Chronicle. Along with HTV and Yorkshire, Tyne Tees believed that they had to bid high to win. These companies bid so high that the Independent Television Commission seriously considered rejecting <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> of each in turn and disqualifying them. However, they eventually decided in their favour. Together, the now-merged companies were committed to paying about £60million a year to the government for the right to broadcast, a substantial amount compared to the £2,000 bid by Central, ITV's largest station.|$|E
