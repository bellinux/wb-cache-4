25|$|Benefis {{reported}} excess {{revenues of}} $7 million on income of $140 million in 1997. In early 1999, Benefis {{announced it was}} suffering serious financial losses that were imperiling its ability <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> In January 1999, the company reported a loss of $3 million on revenues of $128 million in 1998, and projected a doubling of that loss in 1999 with no appreciable growth in revenues. Benefis claimed its COPA agreement did {{not account for the}} costs of consummating the merger of Columbus and Deaconess hospitals, and did not provide for adjustments to the agreement in the event competition forced changes to its business plan. The company cut costs by $17 million, saw construction costs increase by $17 million, and had not yet implemented any staff reductions. Benefis predicted losses totaling $25.7 million by 2003 unless changes to the COPA were made. After two months of negotiations, the state amended the COPA to allow Benefis to raise prices faster than originally permitted (generating $12 million in revenues), and reduce cost savings returned to the community by $39.5 million. The term of the COPA (its initial terms were to end in 2006) was not changed.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the primary}} {{concerns}} of the Communist Party are the problems of unemployment, underemployment and job insecurity, which the party understands as the natural result of the profit-driven incentives of the capitalist economy. Millions of workers are unemployed, underemployed, or insecure in their jobs, even during economic upswings and periods of 'recovery' from recessions. Most workers experience long years of stagnant and declining real wages, while health and education costs soar. Many workers are forced to work second and third jobs to make ends meet. Most workers now average four different occupations during their lifetime, many involuntarily moved {{from job to job}} and career to career. Often, retirement-age workers are forced to continue working just <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> for themselves and their families. Millions of people continuously live below the poverty level; many suffer homelessness and hunger. Public and private programs to alleviate poverty and hunger do not reach everyone, and are inadequate even for those they do reach. With capitalist globalization, jobs move from place to place as capitalists export factories and even entire industries to other countries in a relentless search for the lowest wages." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his consulting work, Usery has served on several federal labor-management commissions. One of these was the [...] "Coal Commission." [...] In the 1980s, the United Mine Workers (UMWA) and coal mining companies began to dispute {{who was responsible for}} paying medical benefits to retired miners. The issue came to a head in 1989. The Pittston Coal Company (now part of The Brink's Company) refused to make its monetary contribution to the mineworkers' retiree medical benefits fund. UMWA struck the company. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole asked Usery to mediate the dispute. Usery won both parties' agreement to form an Advisory Commission on United Mine Workers of America Retiree Health Benefits (the [...] "Coal Commission"). The investigative body, which included Usery as co-commissioner, made regulatory and legislative recommendations to resolve the retiree health benefit issue. The Coal Commission's recommendations were enacted in the Coal Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486). The Coal Act of 1992 created a Combined Benefits Fund (CBF) to provide health benefits by merging coal company retiree health programs, levying additional premiums on coal companies and working miners, and providing that unneeded accumulated interest in the CBF be used <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> for retirees whose employers no longer exist.|$|E
