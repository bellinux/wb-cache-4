40|$|A {{recently}} developed method {{based on the}} TVLine concept (Papale, 2005) allows to determine <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O and CO 2 budgets in magmas from melt inclusion data. This method, however, {{can not be easily}} applied when multiple groups of inclusions are present in the dataset. This is unfortunately a frequent occurrence in many relevant cases, including recent eruptions of Etna, Stromboli, Campi Flegrei, Vesuvius, and Kilauea volcanoes. We have developed a statistical method which allows to treat analytical uncertainties and group the data according to a probabilistic criterion. The method includes the following steps: i) hypothesize a number of pairs of <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O and CO 2 necessary to explain the observed data; ii) minimize a χ 2 -like quantity for each datum by varying the possible H 2 O-CO 2 pairs, and using a model for compositional dependent multicomponent H 2 O+CO 2 saturation in silicate melts (Papale et al., 2006). This step allows the assignment of each datum to a given <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O-CO 2 pair; iii) perform a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability of exceeding the obtained χ 2, therefore the likelihood of the assumed number of <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O-CO 2 pairs to explain the database. This sequence is repeated for many possible numbers of H 2 O-CO 2 pairs and many assumed values of analytical uncertainty characterizing the dataset. Application of the method to about 30 melt inclusion data from a recent Kilauea eruption spanning CO 2 contents in the range 10 - 300 ppm shows that a minimum of two <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O-CO 2 pairs is required. These pairs show that the melt inclusions formed under two different conditions, the ﬁrst one characterized by a few wt%, and the second one by less than 1 wt% CO 2 abundance...|$|E
40|$|Due to its low {{solubility}} in silicate melts, carbon dioxide concentrations in melt inclusions within magmatic crystals are commonly {{of the order}} of a few to a few thousands ppm, from one to several orders of magnitude less than typical concentrations of highly soluble water. CO 2 in magmas, at relatively low crystallizing pressures of tens to a few hundred MPa, is in fact mostly conﬁned in the gas phase, out of direct petrologic observation. Integration of melt inclusion data with data from summit degassing at Kilauea crater revealed that CO 2 abundance in magma is at least 0. 7 wt%, one order of magnitude larger than that in melt inclusions (Gerlach et al., 2006, doi: 10. 1029 / 2001 JB 000407). We develop here a method based on a statistical treatment of melt inclusion data, which allows the determination of the <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O and CO 2 concentration in the multiphase magma and the abundance of the gas phase at time of melt inclusion entrapment. The method is based on the use of a multicomponent nonideal saturation model (Papale et al., 2006, doi: 10. 1016 /j. chemgeo. 2006. 01. 013) and on the minimization of a χ 2 –like quantity by varying all the possible <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O–CO 2 pairs. For each <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O–CO 2 pair, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to determine the probability of exceeding the experimental χ 2. This gives both the conﬁdence on the minimum number of H 2 O–CO 2 pairs required by the data, and the conﬁdence ellipses on the <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O and CO 2 contents. The new method is applied to a set of 29 high resolution SIMS melt inclusion data from a single specimen from the 1842 - 44 eruption of Kilauea (Hauri et al., 2002, doi: S 0009 - 2541 (01) 00374 - 6), showing the existence of several magma batches with different total volatile contents. Total CO 2 abundance of 3 - 6 wt% within a degree of conﬁdence of 90 % is found to characterize the CO 2 -richest magma batch. This total amount is two orders of magnitude larger than the dissolved ones, one order of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, and 30 - 60 times more abundant than the corresponding <b>total</b> <b>H</b> 2 O content...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As part of {{an effort}} to enlarge the number of well-studied Magellanic-type galaxies, we {{obtained}} broadband op-tical imaging and neutral hydrogen radio synthesis observations of the dwarf irregular galaxy ESO 364 -G 029. The optical morphology characteristically shows a bar-like main body with a one-sided spiral arm, an approximately exponential light distribution, and offset photometric and kinematic centers. The H distribution is mildly asymmetric and, although slightly offset from the photometric center, roughly follows the optical brightness distribution, extending to over 1. 2 Holmberg radii (where µB = 26. 5 mag arcsec− 2). In particular, the highest H column densities closely follow the bar, one-arm spiral, and a third optical extension. The rotation is solid-body in the inner parts but flattens outside of the optical extent. The <b>total</b> <b>H</b> flux FH i = 23. 1 ± 1. 2 Jy km s− 1, yielding a <b>total</b> <b>H</b> mass MH i = (6. 4 ± 1. 7) × 108 M ⊙ (for a distance D = 10. 8 ± 1. 4 Mpc) and a <b>total</b> <b>H</b> mass-to-blue-luminosity ratio MH i/LB = (0. 96 ± 0. 14) M⊙/LB, ⊙ (distance independent).

We also compared the effects of SAHA to those of valproic acid (VPA), a short-chain fatty acid HDACi. SAHA and VPA induced histone H 3 and H 4 acetylation, myeloid differentiation and massive early apoptosis. The latter effects were not determined by either drug in AML cell lines, such as NB 4 or THP- 1, not expressing AML 1 /ETO. SAHA was more rapid and effective than VPA in increasing H 3 and H 4 acetylation in total Kasumi- 1 cell lysates and more effective than VPA in inducing acetylation of H 4 K 8, H 4 K 12, H 4 K 16 residues.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether heart rate variability could be reliably assessed in patients with ventricular arrhythmias and to evaluate whether it is affected by antiarrhythmic drugs. The study was based on an analysis of 239 ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings obtained from 67 patients with frequent and complex ventricular arrhythmias enrolled in the Antiarrhythmic Drug Evaluation Group (ADEG) study. In each recording, after exclusion of premature ventricular complexes, the number of times during a 24 h period in which two consecutive sinus RR intervals differed by more than 50 ms was calculated. The <b>total</b> 24 <b>h</b> count from each recording was then used as an index of heart rate variability. This method is a reliable marker of cardiac parasympathetic activity. Recordings were analyzed at baseline (n = 56), during longterm treatment with amiodarone (n = 17), flecainide (n = 22) or propafenone (n = 17) and after washout in selected patients (n = 5). Despite the presence of a different number of arrhythmias, <b>total</b> 24 <b>h</b> counts in the same patient appeared reproducible over time (r = 0. 83 between two different recordings, n = 49, p < 0. 0001). Baseline counts (median 1, 698, range 26 to 13, 648) were not correlated (r = 0. 15) with the number of arrhythmias. The three antiarrhythmic drugs had a disparate effect on <b>total</b> 24 <b>h</b> counts: no change was observed in patients treated with amiodarone (median percent change [Δ%]- 8, p = NS), whereas a significant (p < 0. 025) decrease occurred in patients treated with flecainide (median Δ%- 56 %) or propafenone (median Δ. %- 64 %). This effect was reversible after treatment was discontinued and was not related to suppression of arrhythmias because <b>total</b> 24 <b>h</b> counts were similar during treatment in the presence and absence of frequent arrhythmias. These results indicate that heart rate variability can reliably be assessed by this <b>total</b> 24 <b>h</b> counts method in patients with frequent ventricular arrhythmias.

In this paper, we give a thorough review of Bogoliubov’s method, and discuss a variational and number-conserving formulation of this theory in which the k = 0 state is restored to the Hilbert space of the interacting gas, and where, instead of diagonalizing the Hamiltonians Ĥk separately, we diagonalize the <b>total</b> Hamiltonian <b>H</b> ̂ as a whole. When this is done, we find that the ground state energy is lowered below the Bogoliubov result, and the depletion of bosons is significantly reduced with respect to the one obtained in the number non-conserving treatment.
