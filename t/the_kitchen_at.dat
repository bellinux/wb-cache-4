The lounge and dining room share a large double- sided fireplace of face-brick. Two of the former bedrooms retain built-in wardrobes, drawers and shelving.

25|$|During the Second World War, the Lateran and its related {{buildings}} were used under Pope Pius XII {{as a safe}} haven from the Nazis and Italian Fascists for numbers of Jews and other refugees. Among those who found shelter there were Meuccio Ruini, Alcide De Gasperi, Pietro Nenni and others. The Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and the sixty orphan refugees they cared for were ordered to leave their convent on the Via Carlo Emanuele. The Sisters of Maria Bambina, who staffed <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>at</b> the Pontifical Major Roman Seminary at the Lateran offered a wing of their convent. The grounds also housed Italian soldiers.|$|E

While musically Harrison {{imagined}} the composition in the style of Ray Charles, his inspiration for [...] "Something" [...] was his wife, Pattie Boyd. In her 2007 autobiography, , Boyd recalls: [...] "He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful..." [...] Boyd discusses the song's subsequent popularity among other recording artists and concludes: [...] "My favourite [...] was the one by George Harrison, which he played to me in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>at</b> Kinfauns." ...|$|E

500|$|The east range itself {{runs the}} length of {{the east side of the}} castle, and {{originally}} comprised a large hall, with a square tower house at the north-east corner. Although only the basement survives, this once formed one of the finest noble residences of its time in Scotland, and would have been similar to the contemporary buildings at Doune Castle. The basement is a single tunnel vault, with low walls subdividing the area into stores. Two large ovens and a well lie at the south end, while at the east is the 13th-century postern, blocked when the wall was thickened to support the new buildings above, and re-used as a fireplace. At the north end of the basement is a vaulted prison for freemen, and below this, a rock-cut pit, [...] square, to house prisoners of the peasant classes. Above the prison, but still within the basement, is a vaulted chapel with various ceremonial recesses, such as a sacristy and a piscina, or water basin. A private chamber for the priest is next door. The hall above is [...] by , and once had a high timber roof, and a minstrel's gallery at the south end. An ornately carved stone buffet, or cupboard, is located on this wall, which formed part of the servery next to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>At</b> the north-east corner of the castle, a tower house provided accommodation for the Lord's family and guests. Again, only the lowest floor remains, above the chapel. This probably formed a private chamber for the Lord, and was connected to the adjacent hall.|$|E
500|$|After 25 {{months of}} pre-production, filming began on August 24, 1992, on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. While Costa Rica was {{considered}} as a location given it is the story's setting, Spielberg's concerns on infrastructure and accessibility made him choose {{a place where he}} had already worked before. The three-week shoot involved various daytime exteriors for Isla Nublar's forests. On September 11, Hurricane Iniki passed directly over Kauai, which caused the crew to lose a day of shooting. Several of the storm scenes from the movie are actual footage shot during the hurricane. The scheduled shoot of the Gallimimus chase was moved to Kualoa Ranch on the island of Oahu and one of the beginning scenes had to be created by digitally animating a still shot of scenery. The opening scene was shot in Haiku, on the island of Maui, with additional scenes being filmed on the [...] "forbidden island" [...] of Niihau. Samuel L. Jackson was to film a lengthy death scene in which his character would be chased and killed by raptors, but the set was destroyed by Hurricane Iniki. By mid-September, the crew moved back to California, to shoot the raptors in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>at</b> Stage 24 of the Universal studio lot. Given the kitchen set was filled with reflective surfaces, cinematographer Dean Cundey had to carefully plan the illumination while also using black cloths to hide the light reflections. The crew also shot on Stage 23 for the scenes involving the power supply, before going on location to Red Rock Canyon for the Montana dig scenes. The crew returned to Universal to shoot Grant's rescue of Tim, using a fifty-foot prop with hydraulic wheels for the car fall, and the Brachiosaurus encounter. The crew filmed scenes for the Park's labs and control room, which used animations for the computers lent from Silicon Graphics and Apple. While Crichton's book features Toyota cars in Jurassic Park, Spielberg got a deal with the Ford Motor Company, who provided seven Ford Explorers. The Explorers were modified by ILM's crew and veteran customizer George Barris to create the illusion that they were autonomous cars by hiding the driver in the car's trunk. Barris also customized the Jeep Wranglers featured in the production.|$|E

[...] When Ker was young, {{his family moved to}} Florida, and his father worked several jobs to support the family in Dunedin, Florida; running a lawn service during the day and working at a convenience store at night. [...] After school, and during weekends and summers, Ker followed his father's steps with his work ethic. [...] In the mid-1970s, George managed <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>at</b> a sports restaurant in Clearwater, Florida, where Ker worked as a busboy while he was in high school. [...] During school semester breaks and vacations, he also waited tables and cooked in the kitchen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{setting for}} telling family stories {{becomes part of}} the tradition. It can include the family {{occasions}} where stories are told, the location and prompt for the storytelling, the family members who initiate the session as well as the designated raconteurs and custodians of the stories. [...] Each of these elements needs to be documented along with the stories themselves {{as an integral part of}} the storytelling tradition within this family. In one family following the holiday meal, the men would retire to the study and the women would move into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>At</b> some point in the cleanup, usually after the best dishes had been washed and put away, the mother would bring out a bottle of schnapps to help complete the work. This became the trigger for family stories and jokes, the laughter from the kitchen frequently bringing the men to join in the storytelling.|$|E
2500|$|Haggard {{describes}} {{feeling the}} call of God on his life after {{his first year in}} college, while he was in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>at</b> home. He had been a telecommunications major with a minor in journalism, but after this experience he believed he had been called to pastor. [...] "I was totally surprised," [...] Haggard wrote in The Life-Giving Church. [...] "I [...] [...] [...] told the Lord I wanted to serve Him. But before I mentioned this to anyone, especially to my parents, I asked the Lord to assure me by using others to confirm His calling on my life. I felt as though He consented [...] [...] [...]" [...] Within forty-eight hours, Haggard felt that he received four unsolicited confirmations: from a Sunday school teacher, a pastor, a friend, and from his father. Haggard subsequently attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma, graduating in 1978.|$|E
