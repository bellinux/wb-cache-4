5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms {{in which all the}} matches are compatible with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> finding a maximum clique in their product.|$|E
