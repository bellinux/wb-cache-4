40|$|The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (also {{known as}} the JDC) was founded on November 27, 1914, in order to {{facilitate}} and centralize the collection and distribution of funds by American Jews for Jews abroad. This collection consists of the German case files of the JDC (dating from 1929 to 1947). The records document various individuals’ immigration attempts. Although the JDC was at first reluctant to aid individuals directly, this became necessary after the outbreak of World War II. Documents concerning many prominent individuals may be found in this collection. The collection also contains a small section of Italian case files of the JDC, 1945 - 1947, for displaced persons in Italy after the war, concerning attempts to contact friends and relatives, conditions in Italy, and attempts to emigrate. The files of the New York central office of the JDC are stored in the JDC archives in New York. Records on <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>offices</b> of the JDC are now stored at the Jerusalem office of the organization. A few selected items and duplicate papers can also be found at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This research aimed to examine recruitment and training strategies and preferences for the 'Top Ten' law firms in Europe. This was done through 90 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with lawyers employed {{at the global}} firms. 40 of these were based in London, 18 in Milan and 29 in Frankfurt. A qualifications database was also compiled through {{a survey of the}} firms' websites. The websites were of 4 English and 2 American law firms ranked in the 'Top 10 ' of law firms. The data compiled for partners of the firms covered all of their EU offices and consists of over 2000 individual records. The data compiled for the associates of the firms only covers the UK, Germany and Ireland for 3 firms and consists of over 500 records. Data relating to university-level qualifications were gathered from the lawyers surveyed. Telephone interviews were also used. Project description: Global accountancy, architecture and legal professional service firms (PSFs) {{play a vital role in}} the global economy and facilitate cross border business. Their operations are, however, complicated by the fact that the home-country, predominantly US and UK, professional cultures, practices and institutions are very different to those encountered elsewhere. This project seeks to examine the way global PSFs manage such differences through the use of selective recruitment and professional education. The project uses a case study of English global law firms in Europe because of their expansive globalization strategies in the region. The project will: (1) examine the selective recruitment strategies of firms and analyse trends in relation to the universities and countries of education preferred by firms through a survey of the qualifications and biographies of partners working in <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>offices</b> of English global law firms; (2) analyse the role of in-house training programmes, as well as 'preferred' external training providers, in the management of professional cultures through interviews with partners, associates and training managers in England, Germany and Italy; (3) investigate the implications of the training programmes used by firms for the regulation of professional education through interviews with training providers and regulators of professional education...|$|E
