30|$|A {{new test}} method {{suited for the}} {{assessment}} of the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactant under sewage plant simulation conditions is proposed. The test method foresees that an accurately known amount of the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is added to the sludge inoculum, and that the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is added in two sequential steps to overcome possible interferences from unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface-activity of the surfactant <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b> By measuring the difference in the gas volumes produced in the sludge inoculum plus <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> and the corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this test allows the quantification of the anaerobic biodegradability of the <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{development}} of a new test method suited for the assessment of the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactant under sewage plant simulation conditions is based on an analysis of the existing methods, which are summarized in the Fraunhofer Report on the “Anaerobic Degradation of Detergent Surfactants” to the EU Commission (2002). As the most promising basis, the test method according to DIN 38414, part 8 was chosen. The test method was modified in that way that an accurately known amount of the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is added to the sludge inoculum, and that the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is added in two sequential steps to overcome possible interferences from unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface-activity of the surfactant <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b> By measuring the difference in the gas volumes produced (after the second addition of the <b>test</b> <b>substance)</b> in the sludge inoculum plus <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> and the corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage degree of biodegradation, this test allows the quantification of the anaerobic biodegradability of the <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b>|$|R
30|$|As {{the general}} test principal, the {{difference}} between the gas production from the bottles containing the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> and the bottles without <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> (blank) is taken as the evaluation criterion for assessing the anaerobic degradation of the <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b> Determination of the amount of gas that is dissolved in the liquid medium is neglected to keep the method as simple as possible (it is expected that neglecting to IC does cause only a relatively small error, because the ration between the volume of the liquid medium and the amount of <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> added is much lower in the AnBUSDic test compared to e.g. OECD 311).|$|R
30|$|The <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> {{should be}} {{unambiguously}} {{described by the}} sponsor {{in accordance with the}} quality assurance requirements (see Item 1). If doubtful results are obtained, the substance identity can be verified by using the retention sample. In addition, the relevant physico-chemical data of the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> (solubility in water, volatility, adsorptivity) that could possibly influence the meaningfulness of the test result should be known, as well as the purity of the <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b> Last but not least, the active substance content (resp. the content of water) is important, as this is relevant for the choice of the appropriate <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> concentration, which is a compromise between the limit of detection and toxicity inhibition (see 6.3).|$|R
30|$|To {{distinguish}} {{between these two}} possibilities we have modified the testing scheme of the DIN 38414, part 8 {{in regard to the}} <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> addition. Assuming that any unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface activity of the added surfactant takes place immediately after the addition of the surfactant, we have introduced a second <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> addition into the testing scheme. The second addition of the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> should ideally be done after the gas formation has reached the plateau phase.|$|R
50|$|With NIOSH's limited resources, Finklea {{chose to}} direct the {{researchers}} under him toward the completion of criteria documents—scientific literature surveys that determine the relative dangers of workplace <b>substances.</b> <b>Preparation</b> of the documents accounted for over 40% of NIOSH's budget.|$|R
30|$|An {{explanation}} for the overestimation of the degradation value is that the total organic carbon (TOC) value {{used to calculate the}} theoretical gas production (using Equation one from Bendt and Willing [5]) is too low and does not represent the TOC left in the system in phase 2. There was a discussion within Bendt and Willing [5] with regards to the calculation of the maximum theoretical gas production value if 100 % of the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> TOC was to be degraded. It was argued that the TOC used in the calculation of the theoretical gas production should be taken as the TOC from the second addition of <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> only. The justification was that when phase 1 reaches the plateau phase the remaining <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is no longer degradable and that the addition of the remaining phase 1 TOC to the second phase TOC (for use in calculating theoretical gas production) would lead to underestimation of the <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> degradability (i.e. a theoretical gas production value which was too large). It is suggested that in the degradation rate graph, the plateau phase does not equate to the end of <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> degradation, but rather that the degradation of sludge with and without <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> is the same (as defined by Equation four). Achieving results of up to 130 % degradation during the ring tests suggests that the degradability of <b>test</b> <b>substances</b> is being to a certain extent overestimated.|$|R

30|$|All {{participating}} laboratories ran the six <b>test</b> <b>substances</b> (five surfactants + control) {{through the}} test procedure as expected for the ring test. The TOC content of each <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> was pre-determined and provided to the participating laboratories. This information allowed the laboratories to create suitable concentrations of each <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> {{in the range of}} 200 to 800 mg/L or 150 to 500 mg/L organic carbon (OC). Laboratories were able to refine the dosing and individually determine suitable concentrations of <b>test</b> <b>substances,</b> according to their experimental set up. Any changes to the experimental set up due to equipment availability or otherwise, were pre-agreed beforehand. Each laboratory sourced their own wastewater treatment plant inocula from a nearby domestic WWTP. This was then prepared in the appropriate way according to {{the test procedure}} outlined.|$|R
30|$|In {{general the}} DIN 38414, part 8, test is more {{tolerant}} to higher <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> concentrations than the ECETOC test.

This portion of phase 2 assessed the reproducibility of the assay with a battery {{of positive and negative}} <b>test</b> <b>substances.</b> Positive agonists of the estrogen receptor included the potent reference estrogen 17 -ethinyl estradiol (EE), and the weak estrogen agonists bisphenol A, genistein, methoxychlor, nonylphenol, and o,p -DDT. The negative <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> or nonagonist was n-dibutylphthalate. The <b>test</b> <b>substances</b> were coded, and prescribed doses of each <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> were administered in 16 laboratories. Two versions of the uterotrophic assay, the intact immature and the adult ovariectomized female rat, were tested and compared using four standardized protocols covering both sc and po administration. Assay reproducibility was compared using a) EE doses identical to those used in phase 1 and in parallel dose-response studies, b) single doses of the weak agonists identical to one of five doses from the dose-response studies, and c) a single dose of the negative <b>test</b> <b>substance.</b> The results were reproducible and in agreement both within individual laboratories and across the participating laboratories for the same <b>test</b> <b>substance</b> and protocol. The few exceptions are examined in detail. The reproducibility was achieved despite a variety of different experimental conditions (e. g., variations in animal strain, diet, housing protocol, bedding, vehicle, animal age). In conclusion, both versions of the uterotrophic bioassay and all protocols appear robust, reproducible, and transferable across laboratories and able to detect weak estrogen agonists. These results will be submitted along with other data for independent peer review to provide support for the validation of the uterotrophic bioassay...|$|R
