5|$|Preliminary {{designs for}} <b>the</b> <b>Prophets,</b> {{including}} <b>the</b> Hierarchs, were done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According to The Art of Halo, <b>the</b> <b>Prophets</b> {{were designed to}} look feeble, yet sinister. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>Prophets</b> appeared to be fused to the special hovering thrones they use for transport; even in the final designs, <b>the</b> <b>Prophets</b> are made {{to be dependent on}} their technology. Special headdresses, stylized differently for each of the Hierarchs, adds personality to the aliens and a regal presence.|$|R
5000|$|The {{author of}} the Lives of <b>the</b> <b>Prophets</b> {{seems to have been}} more {{interested}} in miracles, intercessions and predictions of <b>the</b> <b>prophets</b> than in their ethical teaching.One of the more typical themes of the Lives of <b>the</b> <b>Prophets</b> is <b>the</b> interest of the author for the burial places of <b>the</b> <b>prophets.</b> Jeremias in his study examines both the archaeological and the literary evidence, in particular the Herod architectural activity and the attestations of [...] and Luke 11:47, and considers the Lives as a witness of popular devotion in the 1st century.The theme of prophets as intercessors for people long after <b>the</b> <b>prophet's</b> death is also present.A major theme is martyrdom of <b>the</b> prophets: six <b>prophets</b> are said to have been martyred.|$|R

5|$|Prophet Elijah {{was also}} {{regarded}} as a protector from the ale. As soon as he spotted an ala consuming the fertility of fields, he would summon dragons and harness them to his flying chariot. They then together attacked the demon, shooting fiery arrows at her. Instead of the dragons, <b>the</b> <b>prophet</b> could summon dragon men. They would then fall asleep, and their souls would rush to the thundering clouds to assist <b>the</b> <b>prophet</b> against the ale. A legend {{in the region of}} Leskovac has it that fighting the ale was originated by Prophet Elijah, when he, accompanied by a dragon boy, killed twelve of these demons. In the popular tradition of Slavic peoples, Prophet Elijah is a Christian replacement of the pagan Slavic thunder god Perun.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Prophets,</b> or San'Shyuum, (from {{the planet}} Janjur Qom) {{serve as the}} royal rulers of the Covenant, and were {{primarily}} designed by Shi Kai Wang and Eric Arroyo. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>Prophets</b> were built in a more unified way, with the gravity thrones they used for flotation and movement fused with <b>the</b> <b>Prophet's</b> organic structures. <b>The</b> characters were also designed to be feeble, yet sinister. <b>The</b> three <b>Prophet</b> Hierarchs were each individually designed.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{theology}} of Twelvers, the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret sharia and the esoteric meaning of the Quran.

He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E
