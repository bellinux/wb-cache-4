40|$|The {{compensatory}} {{transactions in}} the contemporary world economy become an important element of foreign trade and other forms of international cooperation such as joint ventures, licensing <b>contracts,</b> franchising or <b>turnkey</b> <b>contracts.</b> There are a lot of causes of these tendencies, for example: foreign-currency restrictions, difficult financial situation, economic stagnation, difficulties in access to the markets of developed capitalist, countries and protectionist policy.

The economic cooperation East-West is a sphere of special development of compensatory transactions. Active involvement of socialist countries in the international labour division, wide use of capital and financial markets, import of modern technology, conversion of licences and development of industrial cooperation are conducive to creating agreements on the compensatory principle.
