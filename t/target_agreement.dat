Those policies encompass a CO 2 levy, an emissions trading scheme (ETS), a renewable feed-in tariff as well as some national and international offsetting and <b>target</b> <b>agreements.</b> The policies <b>target</b> different sectors and are linked in various ways either by exchanging tradable units or by serving as exemption criteria.

40|$|In a field setting, {{physically}} attractive or unattractive {{male and}} female com-municator-subjects delivered a persuasive message to target-subjects of each sex. Results indicated that attractive (vs. unattractive) communicators induced significantly greater persuasion on both a verbal and behavioral measure of <b>target</b> <b>agreement.</b> In addition, female targets indicated greater agreement than did male targets. Data gathered from communicator-subjects during an earlier laboratory session indicated that physically attractive and unattractive com-municators differed with respect to several communication skills and other attributes relevant to communicator persuasiveness, including grade point av-erage, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, and several measures of self-evaluation. These findings suggest that attractive individuals may be more persuasive than unattractive persons partly because they possess characteristics that dispose {{them to be more}} effective communicators. Experimental evidence regarding the effect of communicator physical attractiveness on persuasion is equivocal. Although two studies have demonstrated that attractiveness can significantly enhance a male communicator's persuasiveness with both {{male and female}} message recipients (Horai, Naccari, & Fatoul-lah, 1974; Snyder & Rothbart, 1971), the majority of published experiments have failed to obtain significant attractiveness effects or have obtained interactions between attractive-ness and other variables (Chaiken, Eagly...|$|E

40|$|As {{human capital}} {{is a major}} source of {{economic}} growth in today's organizations, {{there is a need for}} well-functioning human resource practices that are designed to guide and direct the effort of employees. This thesis investigates three relevant human resource practices: subjective performance evaluations, <b>target</b> <b>agreements</b> and intra-firm trainings. Four empirical papers are presented that reveal insights about biases in performance evaluations, gender differences in manager's evaluation behavior, the determinants and effects of using <b>target</b> <b>agreements</b> and the effects of intra-firm trainings. Chapter 2 examines the often claimed conjecture that subjective performance evaluations are biased due to personal preferences of supervisors towards their subordinates. It is hence empirically analyzed whether the social proximity in a supervisor-subordinate relationship implies lenient evaluations when holding the performance of individuals constant. Based on personnel records of a call-center it is shown, while controlling for objective performance measures and using fixed effects regressions, that employees in smaller teams receive more lenient evaluations compared to employees working in larger teams. Also, a repeated appraisal by the same supervisor implies a more positive evaluation as compared to evaluations in first-time supervisor-subordinate relations. The third chapter analyzes whether female and male managers show different behavior when evaluating their subordinates. In detail, the gender difference in differentiating between employees is investigated. Higher differentiation in evaluations increases the marginal return for effort and should hence improve the incentive setting for employees. While conducting fixed effects regressions and eliminating unobserved heterogeneity between work units it is revealed that units that are supervised by female managers receive more differentiated grades than units with male supervisors. Also, female managers seem to do well in the tough part of differentiation, namely in assigning poor grades to employees. In chapter 4, an empirical analysis on the determinants and the effects of using <b>target</b> <b>agreements</b> on firm's performance is presented. Based on a large-scale survey data set of firms (IAB Panel) for the years 2005 and 2007, the company and workforce characteristics that may determine the use of <b>target</b> <b>agreements</b> in firms are analyzed. Moreover, it is shown that the introduction of <b>target</b> <b>agreements</b> seems to positively affect firm's performance. In the last chapter, the effects of employees' training participation on their absence behavior and turnover probability are being studied. Human capital theory suggests that receiving training in general skills increases their market value for other firms and should imply an increased turnover probability if wages are not adequately matched. Furthermore, accumulating human capital through training increases the employees' opportunity cost of working. Absenteeism should hence decrease persistently. Based on personnel records of a multinational firm we find that, in contrast to human capital predictions, general training leads to a decreased turnover probability. Loyalty is hence even reduced as general training may be perceived as a signal of trust in the employee. Furthermore, only a short term decrease in absenteeism is found for trained employees suggesting that employees might temporarily reciprocate to firm-sponsored trainings...|$|R

40|$|Community {{practitioners}} {{have limited}} access to validated tools to assess foundational early social communication and play skills in order to select developmentally appropriate skill targets. The {{purpose of the current}} study is to assess the feasibility and validity of a novel teacher implemented brief assessment designed to capture the presence of preschool children's nonverbal social communication and play skills in classroom settings and facilitate teachers' selection of developmentally appropriate target skills for students. Three assessments were administered with 68 preschool students with autism including two well-established research protocols: the Early Social Communication Scale (ESCS: Mundy et al., 2003) and Structured Play Assessment (SPA: Ungerer & Sigman, 1981). Eight teaching professionals then administered a novel assessment protocol with their students. In addition students received two established research protocols one addressing early social communication skills and one targeting play. On average, teachers delivered the novel assessment with 86. 57 % fidelity (SD= 8. 15 %). Logistic regression was applied to examine the probability of agreement on children's skill targets from the brief assessment between teachers and the researcher. The probability of <b>target</b> <b>agreement</b> between each of the eight teachers and the researcher varied by skill domain including: JA (0. 40 - 1. 00), BR (0. 30 - 1. 00), and play skills (0. 40 - 0. 60). Agreement on JA and BR targets was not significantly different from expected proportions of 70 % agreement and 30 % disagreement (JA: p= 0. 22; BR: p= 0. 92) while play was significantly different and below expected proportions for agreement (&# 967; 2 (1) = 17. 04, p< 0. 01). Further, agreement between researcher selected JA target skills from the brief assessment and targets obtained from the ESCS was not significantly different from expected proportions 70 / 30 (p= 0. 30) while agreement on BR targets was significantly different and below expected proportions (&# 967; 2 (1) = 1. 07 p< 0. 01). Finally, agreement between the researcher selected play target and the target obtained from the SPA was not significantly different from the expected proportion of 70 / 30 (p= 0. 96) Further, findings indicate teachers learned to administer the assessment and often select accurate JA and BR target skills yet low agreement was found for play. Further training regarding developmental play levels may enhance teachers' accurate identification of play targets...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{innovation}} and globalisation are driving profound economic, {{political and cultural}} changes. There is a widespread acknowledgement that organisations {{need to be more}} strategically flexible to cope with increased levels of competition and market change. The research reported here has two objectives. The first is that of identifying the causes of strategic flexibility in organisations, and the second being to implement methods of improving strategic flexibility. A model of decision-making behaviour has been developed, which identifies the areas of individual and group decision-making behaviour that affect strategic flexibility. The model has general applicability. A significant cause of strategic inflexibility is a behavioural. dysfunction in individuals that produces a much wider dysfunction in the organisation. The same model also provides the basis for the evaluation and improvement of such behaviours. This has {{led to the development of}} processes and tools to reduce the barriers to adopting high quality decision-making behaviour. However, individual behavioural. change, while being an essential foundation, is insufficient on its own to achieve high rates of organisational and technological adaptation at low levels of disruption. The second objective has been to implement a systematic process for integrating all players in a strategically flexible organisation. In the absence of a consistent, systematic process, particularly for organisational and technological innovation, a design model of the business has been originated and developed. This has been shown to be applicable to a wide range of organisational cultures and integrates recent trends in organisational thinking. Individual innovations in processes and tools, which have been central to the development and introduction of the design model, have been implemented in an organisation. These innovations are in the areas of innovation management, portfolio management, product targeting and <b>target</b> <b>agreement,</b> and are described to achieve wider application. The concept of the brand has been shown to be a powerful 'attractor' to develop an organisation's fundamental relationship with its environment in the long, medium and short term. Because the values of a brand represent basic human motivational values, they provide stability for long term planning and can align internal decision-making values, {{innovation and}} core competencies to the benefit of the organisation and their workers, their customers and the wider environment. The research work has shown that an organisation can meet the simultaneous requirements of design speed, knowledge reuse, semi-independent decision-making and creativity at the lowest possible level of the organisation. The concepts and tools are therefore valuable in supporting a step-change in the performance of conventional and virtual organisations. The modular partitioning of organisations, products and processes is compatible with the design model of the business, -and the strategies are synergistic. While modularity in a traditional organisation. could lead to decay and loss of strategic flexibility, its integration within the design model framework supports a dynamically unstable, but continuously innovative and long-lived organisation...|$|E

Extending the inflation averaging horizon to the medium term improves the inflation-output tradeoff by influencing inflation expectations. But how long should the medium term be? Characterizing the New Zealand economy with a small new-Keynesian model, we show that the happiest halfway house is located around a two or three year averaging horizon which leads to mild, but non-trivial, improvements in the efficiency of monetary policy. ...|$|R
