5|$|Locking {{multiple}} variables using non-atomic locks {{introduces the}} possibility of program deadlock. An atomic lock locks multiple variables all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads each need <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> the same two variables using non-atomic locks, {{it is possible that}} one thread will lock one of them and the second thread will lock the second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.|$|E

The third test, this time using an actual target consisting of an Agena-D upper stage equipped with a Zeus miss-distance transmitter, was carried out on 24 May 1963, and was a complete success. From that point until 1964, one DM-15S was kept {{in a state of}} instant readiness and teams continually trained on the missile.|$|E

5|$|The game {{belongs to}} the Chrono series and is a gaiden, or side story, to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger. It was {{released}} to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for Chrono Cross. It features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Unlike many Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers was not designed <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> after {{a certain number of}} playthroughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play today.|$|E
5|$|Weapons are {{equipped}} on both {{hands of the}} characters and are used with the circle and cross buttons. Pressing both buttons in succession is necessary to execute combos. The other buttons are used <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> focus onto an enemy, guard, dash, or manually change the camera angle. The number of attacks and blocks is limited by an energy meter for each arm, which decreases after each move but replenishes with time.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5000|$|The Lakes <b>to</b> <b>Locks</b> Passage is {{a scenic}} byway in northeastern New York in the United States and in {{southern}} Quebec in Canada. The byway unifies the interconnected waterway {{of the upper}} Hudson River, Champlain Canal, Lake George, and Lake Champlain; this waterway {{is the core of}} North America’s first [...] "super-highway" [...] between upstate New York and the Canadian province of Quebec. The initiatives of the Lakes <b>to</b> <b>Locks</b> Passage aim <b>to</b> unify the byway corridor as a single destination.

On February 24, 2013, Johansen was re-called by the Blue Jackets for the remainder of the season, which began on January 19 after an agreement was reached. In the 2013–14 season, Johansen had a break-out year, scoring 33 goals and 30 assists for a total of 63 points, a career high. He was the third Blue Jacket in franchise history to post 30 goals or more in one season.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a smokescreen. She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E

She encounters a cleaning lady, and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe, she gives the cleaning lady a message to pass along to Peter (Joshua Jackson). Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his agents <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> her up and sedate her.|$|E
