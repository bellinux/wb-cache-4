5|$|Swimwear and {{underwear}} have similar design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> comfort first.|$|E
5|$|Wood Badge {{training}} in Ireland {{goes back to}} the 1st Larch Hill of the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland, who conducted Wood Badge courses <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> the Catholic approach to Scouting. This emphasis is now disappeared since the formation of Scouting Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly evident in his development of a theology <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E

50|$|Wagoto was {{pioneered by}} Sakata Tōjūrō I, {{an actor in}} the Kamigata (Osaka-Kyoto) region. Plays <b>that</b> <b>emphasize</b> wagoto roles are {{typically}} tragic romances. Famous plays <b>that</b> <b>emphasize</b> wagoto roles include Sonezaki Shinjū (The Love Suicides at Sonezaki) and Kuruwa Bunshō (Tales of the Licensed Quarter).|$|R

5|$|The Fleet Law of 1900 {{authorized}} the French Navy to build six new battleships, {{along with a}} host of other warship types; the law signaled an end to the Jeune École doctrine <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> commerce raiding and torpedo boats instead of a battle fleet of capital ships. The first two battleships ordered, the , formed the design basis for the subsequent four of the Liberté class. The naval engineer Émile Bertin designed both the République and Liberté classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{designs of}} these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found {{the opportunity to develop}} their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} had 37 {{locations in}} 2002, 65 in 2003, and 142 by 2007. The company started franchising in 2003 and by 2007, 22 of its stores were franchises. The restaurants were redesigned in 2004 with lighter colors, new packaging, {{a greater emphasis}} on carryout orders and a floorplan <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> an open kitchen, where the saute line was visible to customers.|$|E

25|$|Manufacturers' {{marketing}} and advertising often appeals to fashion and image over fit, comfort and function. Since about 1994, manufacturers have re-focused their advertising, moving from advertising functional bras <b>that</b> <b>emphasize</b> support and foundation, to selling lingerie <b>that</b> <b>emphasize</b> fashion while sacrificing basic fit and function, like linings under scratchy lace.|$|R

5|$|The {{resulting}} Nuclear Waste Management Organization (NWMO) {{conducted an}} extensive three-year study and consultation with Canadians. In 2005, they recommended Adaptive Phased Management, an approach <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> both technical and management methods. The technical method included centralized isolation and containment of {{spent nuclear fuel}} in a deep geologic repository in a suitable rock formation, such as the granite of the Canadian Shield or Ordovician sedimentary rocks. Also recommended was a phased decision making process supported by a program of continuous learning, research and development.|$|E
5|$|At InStyle Min {{created the}} InStyle Weddings and InStyle Makeover publications. As {{editor-in-chief}} at Us Weekly from 2002 to 2009, she was influential in creating popular culture trends and an industry for celebrity gossip. Min {{also created a}} more celebrity-friendly editorial style and placed more emphasis on reality TV stars. Min was appointed to lead The Hollywood Reporter in 2010 {{as part of a}} turnaround effort, as the publication was doing poorly. She re-launched it as a glossy weekly magazine <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> in-depth news features and visuals. Min also re-worked the website. These efforts were followed by increased readership and Min's promotion to her current position in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{importance}} of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E

5|$|Hensley {{was part}} of a large family that had moved between Tennessee and Virginia, before {{settling}} in Tennessee shortly after his birth. Following his conversion, he traveled through the Southeastern United States, teaching a form of Pentecostalism <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> strict personal holiness and frequent contact with venomous snakes. Although illiterate, he became a licensed minister of the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) in 1915. After traveling through Tennessee for several years conducting Church of God-sanctioned services, he resigned from the denomination in 1922. Hensley was married four times and fathered thirteen children. He had many conflicts with his family members because of his drunkenness, frequent travels, and inability to earn steady income, factors cited by his first three wives as reasons for their divorces.|$|E
5|$|Morse died in 1940, after 34 {{years as}} director, and several {{years went by}} without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, {{formerly}} the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University) in Evanston, Illinois, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties dating back to Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement {{took advantage of the}} NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> practical learning, outdoor education—including farming—and hands-on activities like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade.|$|E
5|$|Oshii based {{the setting}} for Ghost in the Shell on Hong Kong. Oshii commented that his first thought to find {{an image of the}} future setting was an Asian city, but finding a {{suitable}} cityscape of the future would be impossible. Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model. He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E

5|$|The US, the UK, {{and most}} other NATO {{countries}} opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval. The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine {{the authority of the}} alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia, and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> conflict prevention and crisis management.|$|E
5|$|The front {{entrance}} of the 1931 office building, on {{the southeast corner of}} the block, faced south on John Street towards Downtown Seattle and had the newspaper's name etched into the stone above the main entrance; the sign was supplemented for several decades by an ornate golden sign with the newspaper's letterhead that was installed above the main entrance. The exterior of the office building had subtle details, including etched columns and aluminum grillwork on the windows, forgoing ornaments for a simpler design <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> its mass. The main entrance was behind an elaborate aluminum gate, decorated with octagons, spirals and floral patterns. At the sides of the entrance were limestone panels with floral patterns carved into relief.|$|E
5|$|The program {{originally}} focused {{almost exclusively}} on Scoutcraft skills, some elements of the Patrol Method, and First Class Boy Scout requirements. In a major cultural shift during the 1970s, Wood Badge was modified to train Scouters in eleven specific leadership competencies. The National Council has updated it several times since then, and during 2001–2002 implemented an overhaul <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> a prototypical troop as a method for teaching team leadership and problem-solving skills. The training is delivered through a lecture classroom environment and a short outdoor camping experience. It {{is a key element}} of the overall leadership training program.|$|E

5|$|The {{release of}} Barbarella and Danger: Diabolik {{led to a}} minor trend of film adaptations of comic strips <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> mild {{sadomasochism}} and late 1960s fetish gear. Diabolik {{was the first of}} three European comic strip adaptations released in 1968, the other two being Piero Vivarelli's Satanik and Roger Vadim's Barbarella. These films were followed by Bruno Corbucci's Ms. Stiletto and Corrado Farina's Baba Yaga (1973). The look of Diabolik influenced the comic series. The film's audiences could see Diabolik's mouth because Law's mask was made of latex. This resulted in the comic's artists Enzo Facciolo and Sergio Zaniboni giving up on trying to shade in his mouth and simply outlining it.|$|E
5|$|The team worked {{alongside}} {{artists and}} DJ's for incorporation of songs into the game. Neil stated they brought to artists and DJ's working prototypes {{of the game}} and hardware to show them what the sampled music and final mixes sounded like, garnering interest from these groups. This led to securing of rights from several groups for their songs, though this did occur late in the development process. Mixing with celebrity DJ's was performed either though electronic communications, or at FreeStyleGames' studios or the homes or studios of the DJ's themselves; the team outlined the goals {{of the game and}} requested mixes <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> the gameplay featured, but avoided hampering the creativity of the artists.|$|E

The contest {{featured}} two high-scoring offenses <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> different aspects of the game. These aspects were exemplified in the game, which saw Clemson pass for more yards than Virginia Tech, while the Hokies ran for more yards than the Tigers.|$|E
