The standard diode bridge rectifier system is typically very slow to respond, and presents a difficult problem in terms of control, given the non-linearities of the system in question.

In this work a converter, assumed cheaper than the regular back to back <b>converter</b> <b>setting,</b> have been investigated for a electric direct drive point absorber. Both experimental work and simulations {{are used in the}} analysis. In the experimental work, a permanent magnet generator with a 6 -pulse diode rectifier, a DC-link and a DC/DC converter equivalent, was used. Steady state, dynamic and transient measurements were preformed and a simulation model was compared to the measurements. Good results were obtained and deviations were in general small, mostly +- 3 % for voltage and current measurements and +- 8 % for torque measurements. Based on transient measurements and simulations a general linearization of the system was made in order to obtain useful information about the system. A step up converter was used in the simulation and it demonstrated stable passive loading control. By using the information obtained by the linearization, the performance of the simulation model was improved by decreasing the DC-link capacitance. The modified simulation model had significant less torque ripple than the initial. The linearization model also can been used to identify time delay represented by the power take off unit in a wave energy converter.

In these areas with large depths and hostile conditions subsea system solutions will be beneficiary. Modifications of power electronic components not intended for subsea use might yield good solutions with decreased overall cost. One suggested solution for subsea converters is to encapsulate the power electronics in a vessel with flexible walls and filled with dielectric oil, allowing the pressure on the inside to equal the ambient pressure at sea bed. This solution will reduce overall cost and increase gas field recovery. Theoretical studies on various topics associated with subsea power electronics have been carried out. Among these are topics about subsea processing systems, considerations of condition assessment and working principle of semiconductors with emphasis on the insulated gate bipolar transistor, IGBT.

40|$|In {{applications}} such as gene therapy and drug design, a key goal is to convert the disease state of diseased objects from an undesirable state into a desirable one. Such conversions may be achieved by changing the values of some attributes of the objects. For example, in gene therapy one may convert cancerous cells to normal ones by changing some genes 2 ̆ 7 expression level from low to high or from high to low. In this paper, we define the disease state conversion problem as the discovery of disease state converters; a disease state converter is a small set of attribute value changes that may change an object 2 ̆ 7 s disease state from undesirable into desirable. We consider two variants of this problem: personalized disease state converter mining mines disease state converters for a given individual patient with a given disease, and universal disease state converter mining mines disease state converters for all samples with a given disease. We propose a DSCMiner algorithm to discover small and highly effective disease state converters. Since real-life medical experiments on living diseased instances are expensive and time consuming, we use classifiers trained from the datasets of given diseases to evaluate the quality of discovered <b>converter</b> <b>sets.</b> The effectiveness of a disease state converter {{is measured by the}} percentage of objects that are successfully converted from undesirable state into desirable state as deemed by state-of-the-art classifiers. We use experiments {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} our algorithm and to show its effectiveness. We also discuss possible research directions for extensions and improvements. We note that the disease state conversion problem also has applications in customer retention, criminal rehabilitation, and company turn-around, where the goal is to convert class membership of objects whose class is an undesirable class.
