5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy {{what remained of the}} site.|$|E

5|$|By 1964 over 20,000 {{new homes}} had been built, {{transforming}} the dense overcrowded and unsanitary slums of the pre-war city into a low density, dispersed suburbia.

The Plymouth City Council allowed it <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> disrepair but it was grade II listed in 2010 by English Heritage to prevent its demolition.|$|E

They would have suffered heavy losses in Gaul before returning to Britain.|$|E

5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E

Absent from Monaco during most of the final years of his reign, he and his wife lived on their estate in France. Prince Louis died in 1949 and was succeeded by his grandson, Prince Rainier III.|$|E

5|$|In 1562 the château came briefly {{into the}} {{possession}} of the Huguenots and {{was turned into a}} state prison by Henry IV of France.

Château de Chinon was abandoned until 1793 when, during the Reign of Terror, the castle was temporarily occupied by royalist Vendeans. Soon after, the castle lapsed back into decay.|$|E

Tactical errors also showcased themselves when Reshef moved his tank brigade forward; Israeli commanders neglected to conduct reconnaissance beforehand, causing their units <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> Egyptian ambushes. In the confusion ensuing the surprise assault, no attempt was made at evacuating the Bar Lev garrison.|$|E
