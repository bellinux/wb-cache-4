5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with <b>theodolites</b> by Gambey.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using <b>theodolites.</b> Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{measurement}} of latitude {{requires an understanding}} of the gravitational field of the Earth, either to set up <b>theodolites</b> or to determine GPS satellite orbits. The study of the figure of the Earth together with its gravitational field is the science of geodesy.|$|E

A <b>theodolite</b> ring light produces a more easily visible reflection and {{eliminates the need for}} an autocollimating device. A <b>theodolite</b> ring light is a very bright light source that is well centered on the optical axis of the instrument.

25|$|Traditional {{geodetic}} instruments such as <b>theodolites</b> rely on {{the gravity}} field for orienting their vertical axis along the local plumb line or local vertical direction {{with the aid of}} a spirit level. After that, vertical angles (zenith angles or, alternatively, elevation angles) are obtained with respect to this local vertical, and horizontal angles in the plane of the local horizon, perpendicular to the vertical.|$|E
25|$|Surveying is {{the process}} by which a {{surveyor}} measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and <b>theodolites,</b> are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface {{in the form of a}} map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as geographic information systems. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, tramway tracks, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as harbors, before construction.|$|E

40|$|A {{moving target}} should be missing from a {{photoelectric}} <b>theodolite</b> tracker, when {{the clouds and}} other special conditions encountered {{in the course of}} a <b>theodolite</b> tracking a moving object, and this condition should cause the interruption of tracking process. In view of this problem, an algorithm based on the frame of parameter identification and rolling prediction to trajectory was presented to predicting the target trajectory when it missing. Firstly, the article makes a specification of photoelectric <b>theodolite</b> and it operating mechanism detailed. The reasons of flying target imaging disappear from the field of <b>theodolite</b> telescope and the traditional solution to this problem, the least square curve fitting of trajectory quadratic function of time, were narrated secondly. The algorithm based on recursive least square with forget factor, identify the parameters of target motion using the data of position from single <b>theodolite,</b> then the forecasting trajectory of moving targets was presented afterwards,in the filtering approach of past data rolling smooth with the weight of last procedure. By simulation with tracking moving targets synthetic corner from a real tracking routine of photoelectric <b>theodolite,</b> the algorithm was testified, and the simulation of curve fitting a quadratic function of time was compared at the last part. © COPYRIGHT SPIE 2015...|$|R

2500|$|In 1802, the British {{began the}} Great Trigonometric Survey of India {{to fix the}} locations, heights, and names of the world's highest mountains. Starting in {{southern}} India, the survey teams moved northward using giant <b>theodolites,</b> each weighing [...] and requiring 12 men to carry, to measure heights as accurately as possible. They reached the Himalayan foothills by the 1830s, but Nepal was unwilling to allow the British to enter the country due to suspicions of political aggression and possible annexation.

40|$|Abstract: The task of multi-sensors {{data fusion}} {{technology}} is to obtain more precise estimate of object state and light path than single sensor through {{dealing with the}} information from different sensors. The paper puts forward the ideal of applying the data fusion theory to O-E <b>theodolite</b> system, based on the data fusion theory and Kalman filter and estimate theory. At the condition of losing and covering object, the <b>theodolite</b> tracks object normally.

60|$|So {{no wonder}} the town went wild! All day in the street you could hear men talking of veins, and {{smelters}} and dips and deposits and faults,--the town hummed with it like a geology class on examination day. And there were men about the hotels with mining outfits and <b>theodolites</b> and dunnage bags, and at Smith's bar they would hand chunks of rock up and down, some of which would {{run as high as}} ten drinks to the pound.|$|E
60|$|Some time, however, {{passed before}} this came about, and {{meanwhile}} winter {{closed in on}} the prairie. It was, save for one uncertainty which greatly troubled me, a tranquil winter--for I had, in addition to promising schemes for the future, a balance in the bank--but not wholly uneventful. Before the first snow had fallen, men with <b>theodolites</b> and compasses invaded Crane Valley, and left inscribed posts behind them when they passed. This was evidently a preliminary survey; but it showed the railroad was coming at last, although, as the men could tell us nothing, there remained the somewhat important question whether it would follow that or an alternative route.|$|E

5|$|A <b>theodolite</b> can be {{considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a <b>theodolite</b> with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun.
