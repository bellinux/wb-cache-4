[...] Alito argued against the majority's reliance on trespass under modern circumstances. Specifically, {{he argued that the}} common-law property-based analysis of a [...] "search" [...] under the Fourth Amendment did not apply to such electronic situations as the one that occurred in this case. He further argued that following the doctrinal changes in Katz, a <b>technical</b> <b>trespass</b> leading to the gathering of evidence was [...] "neither necessary nor sufficient to establish a constitutional violation". In his concurring opinion Alito outlined that long-term surveillance can reveal everything about a person: ...|$|E

Causby et ux. landower domain was limited to the space below 365 feet, Justice Douglas reasoned that, should it find in the landowners' favor and accept the [...] "ancient doctrine that at common law ownership of land extends to the periphery of the universe — Cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum," [...] "every transcontinental flight would subject the operator to countless trespass suits." [...] Citizens have a right to fly in the [...] "navigable airspace" [...] Thirty one years later, in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, an English court reached a similar conclusion, finding an action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred meters above the land: [...] "if the latin [...] maxim were applied literally it would lead to the absurdity of trespass being committed every time a satellite passed over a suburban garden." [...] Parliament subsequently reinforced Berstein in the Civil Aviation Act 1982, providing that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. Objects hovering above a person's property, though attached to the ground, may constitute trespass. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an 8 foot advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. However, should the overhang fail to generate actual harm, the court may deny a plaintiff equitable relief despite the <b>technical</b> <b>trespass.</b>|$|E
