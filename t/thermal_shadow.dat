The main results are: (1) a possible detection of weak bright rings around some spot penumbrae; (2) no evidence is found for large scale photospheric brightness inhomogeneities exceeding 2 - 3 K which places tighter constraints on models of global scale convection; (3) supergranular scale continuum structures observed across the photosphere appear mainly due to random clumping of granules; (4) the one case observed of a sunspot emergence shows no <b>thermal</b> <b>shadow</b> exceeding 1. 5 K rms one day prior to umbra appearance; (5) network and faculae are found to show a small excess brightness even at mu = 1, so detection of faculae at mu = 1 by differential photometry indicates a gentler temperature gradient near tau = 1 in the facular (relative to cell) atmosphere; (6) the limb darkening study shows no significant global variations to within 0. 1 % rms...|$|E

The output power was 60 W, the surface mount can effectively improve the efficiency, reduce the heat loss. In addition to providing power performance accurately, but also can improve the heat dissipation performance. Such a solutions need to meet the following criteria: very low profile to allow efficient air flow and to prevent <b>thermal</b> <b>shadow</b> on surrounding ICs; high efficiency to minimize heat dissipation; current sharing capability to spread the heat evenly to eliminate hot spots and minimize or eliminate the need for heat sinks; complete DC/DC circuit in a surface mount package that includes the DC/DC controller, MOSFETs, inductor, capacitors and compensation circuitry for a quick and easy solution. Innovation in DC/DC Design The innovation is a modular but surface mount approach that uses efficient DC/DC conversion, precise current sharing and low thermal impedance packaging to deliver the output power while requiring minimal cooling[1]. Because of the low profile and power sharing among four devices, a system using this solution depends on fewer fans or a slower fan speed as well as few or no hea...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{infrared}} data {{become more}} popular in remote sensing investigation, for {{it could be}} acquired both in day and night. The change of temperature has special characteristic in natural environment, so the thermal infrared images {{could be used in}} monitoring volcanic landform, the urban development, and disaster prevention. Heat shadow is formed by reflecting radiating capacity which followed the objects. Because of poor spatial resolution of thermal infrared images in satellite sensor, shadow effects were usually ignored. This research focus on discussing the shadow effects of various features, which include metals and nonmetallic materials. An area-based thermal sensor, FLIR-T 360 was selected to acquire thermal images. Various features with different emissivity were chosen as reflective surface to obtain <b>thermal</b> <b>shadow</b> in normal atmospheric temperature. Experiments found that the shadow effects depend on the distance between sensors and features, depression angle, object temperature and emissivity of reflective surface. The causes of shadow effects have been altered in the experiment for analyzing the variance in thermal infrared images. The result shows that there were quite different impacts by shadow effects between metals and nonmetallic materials. The further research would be produced a math model to describe the shadow effects of different features in the future work...|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>shadows</b> which {{develop in the}} convective zone of a star around an insulating obstacle such as a horizontal band in intense magnetic field are studied. The depth of the shadow on the cool side of the obstacle is found to depend largely on {{the width of the}} obstacle multiplied by the temperature gradient. <b>Thermal</b> <b>shadows</b> pressing fields up to 10, 000 G downward against the bottom of the convective zone are produced by the broad bands of the azimuthal field in the sun's convective zone. In the third part, the time-dependent accumulation of heat beneath a thermal barrier simulating such a band in the lower convective zone of the sun is considered. The resulting Rayleigh-Taylor instability is shown to cause tongues of heated gas to penetrate upward through the field, providing the emerging magnetic fields that give rise to the activity of the sun...|$|R

The shadows produced by the inhomogeneities induce thermal gradients and therefore forced convection.

Surface albedo markings cast "thermal shadows", with strong lateral thermal gradients.

We show that the spatial extent of the structure depends mainly on the obliquity, ther- mal conductivity and heliocentric distance. In some circumstances, subsurface structure caused by the <b>thermal</b> <b>shadows</b> of surface features can be maintained for more than 10 Myr, the median transport time from the Kuiper Belt to the inner solar system.

40|$|Mineral {{identification}} and mapping of alluvial material using thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is extremely useful for tracking sediment transport, assessing {{the degree of}} weathering and locating sediment sources. As {{a result of the}} linear relation between a mineral's percentage in a given area (image pixel) and the depth of its diagnostic spectral features, TIR spectra can be deconvolved in order to ascertain mineralogic percentages. Typical complications such as vegetation, particle size and <b>thermal</b> <b>shadowing</b> are minimized upon examination of dunes. Actively saltating dunes contain little to no vegetation, are very well sorted and lack the <b>thermal</b> <b>shadows</b> that arise from rocky terrain. The primary focus of this work was to use the Kelso Dunes as a test location for an accuracy analysis of temperature/emissivity separation and linear unmixing algorithms. Accurate determination of ground temperature and component discrimination will become key products of future ASTER data. A decorrelation stretch of the TIMS image showed clear color variations within the active dunes. Samples collected from these color units were analyzed for mineralogy, grain size, and separated into endmembers. This analysis not only revealed that the dunes contained significant mineralogic variation, but were more immature (low quartz percentage) than previously reported. Unmixing of the TIMS data using the primary mineral endmembers produced unique variations within the dunes and may indicate near, rather than far, source locales for the dunes. The Kelso Dunes lie in the eastern Mojave Desert, California, approximately 95 km west of the Colorado River. The primary dune field is contained within a topographic basin bounded by the Providence, Granite Mountains, with the active region marked by three northeast trending linear ridges. Although active, the dunes appear to lie at an opposing regional wind boundary which produces little net movement of the crests. Previous studies have estimated the dunes range from 70 % to 90 % quartz mainly derived from a source 40 km to the west. The dune field is assumed to have formed in a much more arid climate than present, with the age of the deposit estimated at greater than 100, 000 years...|$|R

30|$|The {{solution}} for the shadows problem comes from the visual domain or employing multiple sensors or considering thermal imagery.

Otherwise, edge, or texture analysis, that {{has been shown to}} be robust to shadows, is applied. Stereo sensors discard the shadows simply relying on depth information, and multiple cameras are useful to build a 3 D map where the items that are projected on the ground plane of the scene are labelled as <b>shadows.</b> <b>Thermal</b> imagery is oblivious to shadows issues.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{research}} challenges of massive MIMO is to develop computationally simple ways to process {{the large number of}} signals received at the BS. The interference between antennas and users, propagation effects such as correlation, path loss and <b>shadowing,</b> <b>thermal</b> noise and signal degradation due to the hardware imperfections need to be suppressed. Linear detection techniques such as maximum radio combining (MRC) and zero forcing (ZF) are a good option in terms of computational complexity; however, their performance is not compatible with the growing demand for high data rates. The performance of linear detectors can be improved using some nonlinear sub-optimal detector based on successive interference cancellation (SIC) [8], e.g., multibranch SIC (MB-SIC) [9, 10] and multifeedback SIC (MF-SIC) [11]. However, SIC-based detectors have a considerable computational cost for high-dimensional systems. If all signals from all active users are coupled in the detection process, the BS could spend unnecessary processing resources since some types of users might not require a very high performance.|$|R
40|$|Reducing power {{transmission}} is of primary importance in future green cellular networks. First of all, the induced {{reduction of the}} interference encourages the deployment of opportunistic radios in the same spectrum. Then, it directly implies a reduction of the energy consumption. At last, electric field radiations reduction mitigates the potential risks on health. From a technical point of view, power control is however likely to degrade network performance. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of power reduction on the coverage and the capacity of cellular networks. We establish closed form formulas of outage probability by taking into account <b>shadowing,</b> <b>thermal</b> noise and base stations (BS) transmitting power impacts. We quantify the transmitting power needed for different kinds of environments (urban, rural) and frequencies and we show that the transmitting power can be optimized according to networks characteristics without decreasing the quality of service. We show at last that increasing the BS density results in a reduction of the global power density in the network. </p...|$|R
40|$|The new welding technique, "SHADOW - {{stepless}} {{high speed}} accurate and discrete one pulse welding", is introduced. SHADOW means {{the use of}} a single pulse to generate a quasi continuous weld of several millimeters in length. The processing time is defined by the pulse duration of the pulsed laser. At present, a state-of-the-art laser is capable of a maximum pulse duration of 20 ms. The variation of the laser power depending on time is a vital capability of the pulsed laser to adapt the energy deposition into the workpiece (pulse shaping). Laser beam welds of several watch components were successfully performed. Similar metals like crowns and axes made out of stainless steel have been welded using pulsed laser radiation. Applying a series of about 130 single pulses for the crown-axis combination, the total energy accumulates to 19. 5 J. The use of the SHADOW welding technique reduces the energy to 2. 5 J. While welding dissimilar metals like stainless steel and brass, the SHADOW technique has even more advantages. Gearwheels made out of brass have been joined to axes made out of stainless steel. Common pulse mode welding generates a considerable amount of contamination but SHADOW welding drastically reduces the contamination and the distortion. Laser beam welding of copper has a low process reliability due to the high reflection and high <b>thermal</b> conductivity. <b>SHADOW</b> welds of 3. 6 mm length were performed on 250 mu m thick copper plates with very high reproducibility. As a result, a pilot plant for laser beam welding of copper plates has been set up...|$|R

A survey of radiance measurements is given for four desert areas in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Australia, and the Sahel region of Africa. Each overflight provides radiance information for four scene categories: clear, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, and overcast. The data presented include the variation of radiance in each scene classification as a function of viewing zenith angle during each overflight of the five target areas. Several features of interest in the development of anisotropic models are evident, including day-night differences in longwave limb darkening and the azimuthal dependence of short wave radiance. There is some evidence that surface features may introduce <b>thermal</b> or visible <b>shadowing</b> that is not incorporated in the usual descriptions of the anisotropic behavior of radiance as viewed from space. The data also demonstrate that the ERBE scene classification algorithms give results that, at least for desert surfaces, are a function of viewing geometry...|$|R

Forest canopy cover, also known as canopy coverage or crown cover, is defined as the proportion of the forest floor covered by the vertical projection of the tree crowns. Estimation of forest canopy cover has recently become an important part of forest inventories. Using satellite imagery to estimate crown coverage has a long history. Conventional remote sensing methods assess the forest status based on qualitative data analysis derived from “training areas”. This has certain disadvantages in terms of time and cost requirements for training area establishment. Forest Canopy Density Model is one of the useful methods to detect and estimate the canopy density over large area in a time and cost effective manner. This model is based on four indices i. e. soil, <b>shadow,</b> <b>thermal</b> and vegetation. This model requires very less ground truths, just for accuracy check.

Data can be obtained as frequently as required to provide information for determination of quantitative and qualitative changes in terrain. Forests as one part of the wild life of the human societies have a special place in economic development and stability of water and soil in the countries of the world. But because of various reasons such as development of population, increasingly changing forest to the other unsuitable applications such as: agriculture, providing energy and fuel, million of hectares from this natural resource are destroyed every year and the remainder of the surfaces change quantitatively and qualitatively. For better management of the forests, the change of forest area and rate of forest density should be investigated. It is possible that there isn’t any change in the area of forest during the time but the density of forest canopy is changed. Therefore, in this research the method of Forest Canopy Density (FCD) monitoring that have been developed by other researcher is tested in an area, which is located in the north of Iran. This model calculates forest density using the four indexes of soil, <b>shadow,</b> <b>thermal</b> and vegetation. For this, the LANDSAT TM & ETM + images from different dates are used.
