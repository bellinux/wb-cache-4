Currently, the railway system of Sri Lanka {{does not have a}} correct system to monitor and indicate correct positions of trains. Therefore vehicle drivers and pedestrians imagine the location of trains and try to cross level crossings. Hence accidents happen at rail gates. A suitable security system should be arranged at rail gates. Hence this project is done to find the correct position of the train. The outcome of the research would provide a <b>time</b> <b>indicator</b> and a distance indicator are fixed at level crossings. The <b>time</b> <b>indicator</b> indicates <b>time</b> duration of trains approaching the level crossings and the distance indicator indicates the distance in between the train and the level crossing. This timely information to the people who try to cross level crossings on foot or by vehicles will be very useful to protect their lives. Also this will be a good source for Sri Lanka railway system to track trains and protect human beings. This project consists of three main subsystems such as 1. When a train passes a specified detection point, the <b>time</b> <b>indicator</b> counts down and the distance indicator indicates the distance in between the train and the level crossing. 2.

With monitor structures, the remaining life time of a system can be estimated in field use under varying load.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of travel time reliability (TTR) in route choice behaviour {{is still not}} very common in transport models, especially not in a public transport context. The reasons probably are {{that it is difficult}} to measure and that there is no agreement how it best can be represented in utility functions. Typically, it is represented by a standard deviation, however, particularly in public transport choices it is more likely that travellers think about the consequences of unreliability in travel times in terms of buffer times. This paper contributes to the literature by comparing five different model specifications of TTR in public transport route choices that are either based on standard deviations or on buffer <b>time</b> <b>indicators.</b> The models are estimated from choices observed in a stated choice experiment. To address heterogeneity, a latent class model is estimated. The results suggest that the reliability buffer <b>time</b> <b>indicator</b> outperforms the standard deviation indicator. Furthermore, the reliability buffer time parameter is only statistically significant in two of the four classes. The other two classes are particularly sensitive to making transfers and to low frequencies of public transport services, suggesting different strategies to deal with TTR. </p...|$|R
