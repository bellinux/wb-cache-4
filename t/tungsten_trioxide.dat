The structure and composition analysis of the quaternary compound, Na 0. 11 Cs 0. 22 WO 3, revealed that 93. 1 % of the hexagonal phase was formed, suggesting that both alkali metals were mainly inserted in hexagonal channel. The NIR shielding property for Na 0. 11 Cs 0. 22 WO 3 was remarkable, as this material demonstrated efficient transmittance of visible light up to 780 nm and enhancement in NIR shielding because of the blue-shifted absorption maximum in comparison to Cs 0. 33 WO 3...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{intercalation}} via spillover {{reaction in}} various <b>tungsten</b> <b>trioxides</b> {{leads to the}} formation of blue hydrogen bronzes. These reversible reactions induce changes in the W - O bond system while maintaining the W - O skeleton. The effect of the intercalation process on the host crystalline structure has been studied with respect to the v(O - W - O) stretching vibration changes and lattice parameter variations by means of infrared and X-ray diffraction measurements. Among the main results, the intercalation process is shown to be strongly influenced by the structural type of the host compound as well as its amorphous versus crystalline nature. For instance, for the ReO 3 type oxides (monoclinic and cubic WO 3) and hexagonal WO 3, v(O - W - O) shifts to higher frequency are assigned to a shortening effect of W - O bonds. A W - O bond system arrangement is also measured for the crystallized and amorphous hydrates WO 3 ·H 2 O, but no detectable changes could be found in the pyrochlore WO 3 and in the hydrate WO 3 · 1 / 3 H 2 O...|$|R
40|$|The synthesis, {{characterisation}} {{and testing}} of compounds to function as near-infrared (NIR) absorbers in a patented laser imaging process is presented. Working in conjunction with industrial partner Datalase Ltd, the project has focussed on finding materials which absorb NIR radiation for use in inks. The material is required to absorb NIR radiation from a laser and transfer it to a colour-changing pigment as heat in order to form images. The application {{of this process is}} primarily to create labels on packaging. Initially four commercial samples were analysed to provide a starting point for selecting NIR absorber candidates. Preliminary samples were synthesised and a testing procedure was established. A range of compounds were identified as potential NIR absorbers, synthesised, characterised and tested. The family of alkali metal tungsten bronzes MxWO 3 was explored with various types of M and different values of x. The effect on laser imaging performance of factors such as solid state vs solvothermal synthesis routes and particle shape were investigated. As a family they were found to generally perform well. Sub-stoichiometric <b>tungsten</b> <b>trioxides</b> WO 3 -x were also investigated but show inferior performance as NIR absorbers compared to the tungsten bronzes. Molybdenum bronzes MxMoO 3 were a natural follow-on family from the tungsten bronzes for investigation. The proved relatively difficult to synthesise in phase pure form and did not show the same level of performance as their tungsten counterparts. A phosphate tungsten bronze sample P 4 W 12 O 32 had the same issues as the molybdenum bronzes – intermediate performance and difficult synthesis which is particularly undesirable for industrial applications. A number of copper phosphates and transparent conducting oxides were also studied. These samples generally had a lower level of NIR absorbance compared to the bronze samples which led to poor imaging. Throughout the project the main characterisation techniques used were powder X-ray diffraction, UV-vis-NIR spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
