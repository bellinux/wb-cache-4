40|$|The ATR {{is one of}} the world’s premiere test {{reactors}} {{for performing}} long term, high flux, and/or large volume irradiation test programs. It is a very versatile facility {{with a wide variety of}} experimental test capabilities for providing the environment needed in an irradiation experiment. These different capabilities include passive sealed capsule experiments, instrumented and/or temperature-controlled experiments, and pressurized water loop experiment facilities. The Irradiation Test Vehicle (ITV) installed in 1999 enhanced these capabilities by providing a built in experiment monitoring and control system for instrumented and/or temperature controlled experiments. This built in control system significantly reduces the cost for an actively monitored/temperature controlled experiments by providing the <b>thermocouple</b> <b>connections,</b> temperature control system, and temperature control gas supply and exhaust systems already in place at the irradiation position. Although the ITV in-core hardware was removed from the ATR during the last core replacement completed in early 2005, it (or a similar facility) could be re-installed for an irradiation program when the need arises. The proposed Gas Test Loop currently being designed for installation in the ATR will provide additional capability for testing of not only gas reactor materials and fuels but will also include enhanced fast flux rates for testing of materials and fuels for other next generation reactors including preliminary testing for fast reactor fuels and materials. This paper discusses the different irradiation capabilities available and the cost benefit issues related to each capability...|$|E

40|$|In-core {{temperature}} measurement {{is a critical}} issue for the safe operation of nuclear reactors. Classical <b>thermocouples</b> require shielded <b>connections</b> and are known to drift under high neutron fluence. As an alternative, we propose {{to take advantage of}} the multiplexing capabilities of Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) temperature sensors to perform the in-core {{temperature measurement}}s. We first report on our irradiation experiments on multiplexed FBGs, written in different fibres, employed to measure the in-pile temperature of an air-cooled graphite-moderated nuclear reactor. For some FBGs the difference between the measurements and the readings of calibrated backup thermocouples was within the measurement uncertainty. In the worst case, the difference saturated after 30 hours of reactor operation at about 5 °C. Afterwards, we irradiated multiplexed FBG sensors in our material testing nuclear reactor, evidencing the possibility to use FBG sensing technology for in-core monitoring of nuclear reactors with specific care and in well-specified conditions...|$|R

Classical <b>thermocouples</b> require shielded <b>connections</b> and are known to drift under high neutron fluence. As an alternative, we propose {{to take advantage of}} the multiplexing capabilities of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) temperature sensors. Our experiments show that sensitivity to radiation depends on both the radiation field and the grating characteristics. For some FBGs installed in an air-cooled graphite-moderated nuclear reactor the difference between the measurements and the readings of calibrated backup thermocouples was within the measurement uncertainty. In the worst case, the difference saturated after 30 h of reactor operation at about 5 °C. To reach megagray per hour level gamma-dose rates and 1019 neutron/cm 2 fluences, we irradiated multiplexed FBG sensors in a material testing nuclear reactor. At room temperature, FBG temperature sensors can survive in such radiation conditions, but at 90 °C a severe degradation is observed. We evidence the possibility to use FBG sensing technology for in-core monitoring of nuclear reactors with specific care under well-specified conditions.
