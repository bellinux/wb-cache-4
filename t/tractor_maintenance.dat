The general model using {{the ratio of}} actual tractor age to expected life showed better accuracy (R 2 = 0. 715). The tractors classified to two groups, according to their operating age, one with tractors used under 6 years, and another used over 6 years. The cost-estimate model developed for the first group was based on accumulated operating hours, but for the second group the model was improved when The objective {{of this study was}} to develop <b>tractor</b> repairs and <b>maintenance</b> cost models using complete and accurate records of 40 tractors of Hail Agricultural Development Company (HADCO) for a period of five years. Six models were developed having the following form: the ratio of tractor age to its expected life was used. This could be explained when the tractor is new, the costs is low while increasing when the tractor getting older and major <b>maintenance</b> is needed. <b>Tractor</b> repair and <b>maintenance</b> models were developed based on tractor power. It was found that the developed models based on the ratio of the tractor age to its expected life either for tractors with 100 kW gave better estimates. But the comparison between the models of the two groups showed that big tractors have better distribution of repair and maintenance costs than smaller tractors. Comparison of this study with the similar studies showed that the cost of repair and maintenance in this study was lower than those of other studies. One of the reasons is that the data were collected from one huge project which kept excellent records of each single work done for each tractor. Beside good management of all the project inputs.

40|$|The paper {{compares the}} levels of tractor use in {{both public and private}} sectors in Borno State, Nigeria in 1984 and 1998. The major tractor {{operations}} performed in 1984, namely disc harrowing and disc ploughing, were still the important operations carried out in 1998. The available tractor makes and models rose from 12 and 31 in 1984 to 16 and 61 in 1998 respectively. Despite this increase, the specific tractor population density (STPD) decreased from 0. 28 in 1984 to 0. 22 in 1998. Also, there was a decrease in the specific tractor wattage from 16 W/ha in 1984 to 12 W/ha in 1998. This means that farm mechyanization suffered a setback during the 15 -year period, with fewer functional tractors and less power availble per 1000 ha of cultivated land. The major problems of tractor use in the State were high overhead cost, lack of spare parts of some makes and poor operation skills. Despite these odds, there was an appreciable improvement in <b>tractor</b> <b>maintenance</b> culture by both private and public sectors in the state during the 15 -year period.

A survey was carried out to determine the level of agricultural machinery management. Information used was obtained from the State Ministry of Agriculture, State Tractor Hiring and Sales Agency (ZSTHSA), and through personal visits to the 14 Local Government Areas of the State. Data were also obtained from answers to a structured questionnaire, personal contact and oral interviews with the management staff, technical staff, tractor operators and some randomly selected farmers within the State. The obtained data was analyzed using relevant statistical tools. Simple descriptive statistical tools such as averages, percentages were used. The result revealed that the State owned 77 functional farm tractors (60. 2 % of the total owned farm tractors). Spare parts are not available, owned tractors do not reach their economic life, there is no single fully equipped <b>tractor</b> <b>maintenance</b> workshop in the State, maintenance records are not kept, there is lack of technical knowledge of operating and maintaining tractors, and frequent changes of the managerial staff due to some political reasons and non-adherence to the established government policies.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 A {{large portion}} of farm {{accidents}} involves tractors. The study assumes that safety education is one method of decreasing the accident rate. The problem facing educators involves fragmentation of safety information and insufficient understanding of motivation as influenced by factors such as emotions and attitudes. The majority of literature most readily available specifically pertains to tractor safety and contains fragmented rules, laws, and facts. Some of the less widely disseminated literature deals with the psychological, physiological, and educational aspects of safety, The most recent study trends explain the psychological factors of accidents to determine why the accident happened, while earlier studies were concerned primarily with tractor and environ mental conditions The {{purpose of the study}} is the identification of safety principles which will be useful to Oregon high school teachers when teaching tractor operation to freshmen The procedure used in the study involves the development of tentative principles from safety literature. These principles are reviewed by agriculture teachers and experts in psychology, agricultural engineering, and teacher training. The revised results are the findings of this study. Twenty-two safety principles related to tractor operation and tractor safety education are developed. The psychological principles deal with decision-making, hazard perception, reaction time, stress, operator's strength, and hazard threat reduction. The physical principles deal with mechanical reliability, stability, <b>tractor</b> <b>maintenance,</b> moving parts, unattended tractor, heat, fire prevention, and roadway hazard. Educational principles identify the inadequacies of knowledge, motivation, operator needs, training in decision-making, principles and laws of learning, inspection and maintenance, and integration of safety instruction...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine agricultural mechanics units of instruction that should be included {{and the extent to which}} they should be included in the Nebraska high school vocational agriculture curriculum in the 19902 ̆ 7 s as perceived by three respondent groups. The respondent groups included 36 vocational agriculture instructors, 36 farm operators and 36 managers of mechanics related agribusinesses in Nebraska. A mailed survey was used to collect data for the study. The survey return rate for the vocational agriculture instructors was 100 percent, the return rate for the farm operators was 89 percent and the return rate for the managers of mechanics related agribusinesses was 69 percent. A scale of 1 - 4 was used by the respondents to evaluate the 47 agricultural mechanics units of instruction on the questionnaire. Means, standard deviations and analysis of variance were computed for each unit of instruction. A Cronbach Alpha Reliability Coefficient was calculated on the survey instrument, yielding an r-value of. 92. All units of agricultural mechanics instruction included in the study should be taught in the 19902 ̆ 7 s, but at varying knowledge levels, as perceived by the three respondent groups. Thirteen of the 47 units should be taught at the competency level, 32 of the units should be taught at the literacy level and two units should be taught at the awareness level in the 19902 ̆ 7 s.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the cumulative costs for repair, maintenance, the annual operating hours, tractor power and price, tractor age (years), {{and the rate of}} annual cumulative costs per kW-h was studied. Complete and accurate data recorded by Hail agricultural development company (HADCO) for 39 tractors were used in this study. The analysis showed that the average annual operating hours reduced from 1558 to 1338 as the tractor age (years) increased. Also the average annual operating hours increases with the tractor power except for huge tractors where their use was limited for high draft operations only. Based on the effect of different factors on the repair and maintenance costs, multi-linear models were developed to estimate <b>tractor</b> repairs and <b>maintenance</b> costs represented by the following function. ATC = f(N,P,AHRY,kw) Where: [ATC: accumulated repair and maintenance costs, N, P, AHRY, kW tractor age (years), tractor price, accumulated operating hours and tractor power respectively. The multi-linear models compared with exponential models which were developed in previous study. The comparison showed that there is no difference between the two models for tractors with power less than 80 kW and age of 6 years or less. But for other cases the difference from the actual costs ranged between 68. 8 to 8 % when the exponential models used, while the estimated cost was less than 2 % of the actual costs when multi-linear models used for the same tractors...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo diagnosticar o nível de satisfação dos usuários de tratores agrícolas, com relação às suas marcas e o nível de satisfação dos clientes das concessionárias de tratores agrícolas na região de Santa Maria e municípios vizinhos. Também foram objetivos, classificar os tratores amostrados quanto à potência; identificar os principais problemas dos tratores relacionando as principais marcas amostradas; levantar informações técnicas e econômicas nas concessionárias, relacionadas à manutenção mais freqüente nos tratores. A pesquisa foi realizada através da aplicação de questionários, aos proprietários de tratores agrícolas de 14 municípios da Depressão Central, abrangendo 125 propriedades rurais. Outra parte da pesquisa constituiu-se no levantamento de informações sobre manutenção dos tratores, realizado nas concessionárias de tratores agrícolas de Santa Maria. Ao final deste trabalho concluiu-se que, de maneira geral, independentemente da classe de potência dos tratores, as marcas John Deere e Massey Ferguson apresentam certa vantagem quanto à satisfação dos usuários. Quando considerada a faixa de potência dos tratores, as marcas John Deere e Massey Ferguson novamente apresentaram vantagem em relação às demais, dentro da classe de potência II. Já para a classe III, a John Deere apresentou o maior nível de satisfação dos usuários. Em relação à satisfação com as concessionárias, as Concessionárias Massey Ferguson (Itaimbé) e John Deere (Verdes Valles) aparecem com melhores índices de satisfação. Quanto à classificação dos tratores em relação à potência no motor, houve uma tendência a tratores da classe de potência II, com exceção da marca John Deere, que possui tratores maiores na sua linha. Das quatro classes adotadas pela ANFAVEA (2005), 59, 7 % dos tratores encontram-se na faixa de potência II. Por questão de representatividade, neste trabalho, foram consideradas somente duas classes de potência (II e III). Entre os problemas mais freqüentes, encontrados na pesquisa, as maiores ocorrências são relacionados à tração dianteira auxiliar (TDA), principalmente em tratores que trabalham em solos inundados (arroz irrigado), pois a infiltração de água e barro, trazem danos ao sistema. Embora fosse um dos objetivos, foi impossível comparar as informações de preço das peças e serviços das oficinas das concessionárias, devido à diferenças técnicas na constituição e plano de manutenção de cada marca de trator e pela dificuldade em obter-se informações de todos os concessionários. This {{work has}} as {{objective}} to diagnose the satisfaction level of users with the agricultural tractors, considering their brands and the satisfaction {{level of the}} agricultural tractor enterprise clients in Santa Maria region and nearby cities. Another objectives were to classify the sampled tractors {{in relation to the}} potency; to identify the main problems of the tractors, reporting the main sampled brands; to obtain technical and economical information in the enterprises about the maintenance frequency of tractors. The research was carried out through a questionnaire application to the agricultural tractor owners of 14 Central Depression cities, including 125 rural properties. Another part of the research presents the information about the <b>tractor</b> <b>maintenance</b> which was developed at agricultural tractor enterprises in Santa Maria. In the end of this work, it was concluded that John Deere and Massey Ferguson brands present some advantage in relation to the satisfaction of clients, independently of the tractor potency category. When considered the level of tractor potency, John Deere and Massey Ferguson brands presented, again, some advantages in relation to the others from the II potency category. However, John Deere presented the highest satisfaction level of the clients concerning the III potency category. Related to the enterprise satisfaction, John Deere (Verdes Valles) has the best levels of satisfaction. Related to the tractor classification concerning the machine potency, there was a tendency to II potency category tractors, except John Deere which has got bigger tractors. From the four categories adopted by ANFAVEA (2005), 59, 7 % of tractors are in the II potency category. Due to the question of significance, in this work, it was considered only I and II potency categories. Among the most frequent problems found in the research, the highest occurrences are related to the ADT (auxiliary frontal traction), mainly in the tractors which work in flooded soil (irrigated rice), since the water and mud seeping bring damages to the system.
