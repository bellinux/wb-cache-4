50|$|<b>Thriving</b> in {{positive}} psychology definitely aims to promote growth beyond survival, {{but it is}} important to note that some of the theories surrounding the causes and effects of it are more ambiguous. Literature by Carver indicates that the concept of <b>thriving</b> is a difficult one to define objectively. He makes the distinction between physical and psychological <b>thriving,</b> implying that while physical <b>thriving</b> has obvious measurable results, psychological <b>thriving</b> does not as much. This is the origin of much ambiguity surrounding the concept. Carver lists several self-reportable indicators of thriving: greater acceptance of self, change in philosophy, and a change in priorities. These are factors that generally lead a person to feel that they have grown, but obviously are difficult to measure quantitatively.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the importance of}} social support in promoting <b>thriving</b> health among indigenous Canadians, a disadvantaged population. We categorized the self-reported health status of 31625 adult indigenous Canadians as <b>thriving</b> (excellent, very good) or nonthriving (good, fair, poor). We measured social support with indices of positive interaction, emotional support, tangible support, and affection and intimacy. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to estimate odds of reporting <b>thriving</b> health, using social support as the key independent variable, and we controlled for educational attainment and labor force status. Compared with women reporting low levels of social support, those reporting high levels of positive interaction (odds ratio [OR]= 1. 4; 95 % confidence interval [CI]= 1. 2, 1. 6), emotional support (OR= 2. 1; 95 % CI= 1. 8, 2. 4), and tangible support (OR= 1. 4; 95 % CI= 1. 2, 1. 5) {{were significantly more likely to}} report <b>thriving</b> health.

O'Leary and Ickovics created a four-part diagram of the spectrum of human response to adversity, the possibilities of which include: succumbing to adversity, surviving with diminished quality of life, resiliency (returning to baseline quality of life), and <b>thriving.</b> <b>Thriving</b> includes not only resiliency, but an additional further improvement over the quality of life previous to the adverse event.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{construct}} of <b>thriving</b> as an integration of nutritional (manifested in weight), psychosocial, and lifestyle concerns of childbearing {{within the context of}} Orem’s self-care deficit theory. Provisional definitions of <b>thriving</b> in pregnancy and postpartum are proposed. Preliminary dimensions of <b>thriving</b> in postpartum are based on factor analysis of weight, lifestyle, and psychosocial data from 145 women after childbirth. Four dimensions emerged: psychosocial distress, lifestyle patterns, a weight factor, and a body image factor. Although the dimension-ality of postpartal <b>thriving</b> reported is preliminary, it provides a beginning foundation for assessment and interven-tion for postpartal women. The holistic nature of nursing requires that nurses strive to develop concepts and theories that integrate the multiple levels and domains of human health phenomena. Nursing conceptual mod-els, such as Orem’s (1995) self-care deficit theory, partially fulfill this need. Also needed are related midlevel inte-grative clinical concepts that link con-ceptual models with the phenomena of concern in nursing practice. This article explores {{the construct of}} <b>thriving</b> as a clinical concept that pertains to interre-lationships among nutritional, psycho-social, and lifestyle concerns of childbearing. First, the historical ori-gins of the construct of <b>thriving</b> are re-viewed and placed in the larger context of Orem’s self-care deficit theory. Then, the phenomenon of <b>thriving</b> during pregnancy and postpartum is deline-ated, drawing on existing research. Fi-nally, dimensions of <b>thriving</b> during postpartum are identified based on sec-ondary analysis of a postpartal data set...|$|R
