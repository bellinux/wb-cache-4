Between Powers and Escanaba, M-15 ran concurrently with M-12. The northern terminus of the highway was at Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor.

5|$|The Oriental Republic of Uruguay in South America had been, {{since its}} {{independence}} in 1828, troubled by strife between the Blanco Party and the Colorado Party. They were not {{political parties in}} the modern sense, but factions that engaged in internecine rebellion whenever the other dominated the government. <b>The</b> <b>nation</b> <b>was</b> deeply divided into Colorado and Blanco camps. These partisan groups formed in the 1830s and arose out of patron–client relationships fostered by local caudillos in the cities and countryside. Rather than a unity based upon common nationalistic sentiments, each had differing aims and loyalties informed by their respective, insular political frameworks.|$|E

The partition of Vietnam angered Ba Cụt and he vowed not to cut his hair until <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>was</b> reunified. Having fought against the Việt Minh since 1947, Ba Cụt's principal criticism of Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm's State of Vietnam government stemmed from his belief that Diệm had been too passive in rejecting the partition, and {{that half of the}} country should not have been yielded to the communists.|$|E

5|$|Adams resented Hamilton's {{influence}} with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous {{in his private}} life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and thought him too emotionally unstable to be President. Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, {{but it did not}} work. The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but not for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President. Adams resented the intrigue since he felt his service to <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>was</b> much more extensive than Pinckney's.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{sought to}} build an {{interlocking}} series of defence pacts among the remaining European countries {{as a means of}} deterring Hitler from war. He sought an agreement among Britain, France, the USSR and Poland whereby the first three would go to the assistance of Poland if her independence were threatened, but Polish mistrust of the Soviet Union caused those negotiations to fail. Instead, on 31 March 1939, Chamberlain informed an approving House of Commons of British and French guarantees that they would lend Poland all possible aid in the event of any action which threatened Polish independence. In the ensuing debate Eden stated that <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> <b>was</b> now united behind the government. Even Churchill and Lloyd George praised Chamberlain's government for issuing the guarantee to Poland.|$|E
