5000|$|The {{first chapter}} of <b>this</b> <b>story</b> begins <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the funeral of Israel Haydon’s wife of 40 years, Martha Haydon. He is in the barn on their farm {{extremely}} depressed. He thinks to himself {{that she was so}} much better than he in social situations and would have known how to handle the funeral meal. He decides to go into the main house where his sister and sister in law are waiting for him. He steps inside the house where the two women have cleaned and prepared a dinner for him. Israel does not have much appetite and discusses how he wishes his son and wife had come over. Abby and Stevens talk amongst themselves about the events of the evening. The next chapter begins the morning after the funeral. Israel and his son go on a walk, discussing everyday events. We get a short description of how Israel found out from the doctor that his wife was extremely ill and that she would not get better. We also learn that both him and his wife had inherited a small amount of money from a distant relative. William is a much stronger man than his father and it shows. Israel is known for being extremely elegant, even while working on the farm. William offers to have his father stay with him in his home, but Israel is stubborn and refuses the help. The two share an awkward moment and William drives away. As soon as he leaves, Israel breaks down in tears for his lost wife. His two sisters watch from inside the house and comment on how sad he has been. They discuss how they need to go through the late Martha’s clothing, and decide to ask William for help, as him and his mother were so close. We learn that William was quite talented at sewing and knitting as a child. Some time passes and Israel returns to his regular life. His sister leaves- and Israel hires a summer hand for help. The two have quite a strained relationship as Israel finds the boy to be lazy but it works out. [...] The next chapter of <b>this</b> <b>story</b> begins two months after the passing of Martha Haydon. William and his son are sitting on the porch of his house discussing the lack of order in his house. William says that he feels his father is angry at him for something and wishes to apologize. Israel, however, says it is simply that he is still grieving his wife. He says that he cannot maintain the state of the house the way his wife used to. William invites his father over for dinner and to see Maria Durrant, a woman that could possibly work for him as a housekeeper. Israel met her a while ago when William’s wife was sick and thinks {{she is one of the}} most able women he has ever met. When they meet, they immediately take to each other. The next morning Maria ignores Israel’s request to begin work in the afternoon, and decides to start early. She leaves William’s house and arrives at Israel’s farm. There she notices the terrible state of the garden and decides to bring it back to the state in which it was when Martha tended to it- Israel told her earlier in the evening that he wanted to do this himself but was having trouble. The fourth chapter of this book takes place entirely in Mr. Haydon’s kitchen. Martha Durrant is mending some clothing, when a visitor surprises her. The visitor is an old acquaintance of both Maria and Israel by the name of Polly Norris. She is an extremely irritating woman who is not completely sane of mind. She frequently visits people to ask for help. The two gossip a while. Polly informs Maria that there is a rumor going around that she has been at the farm for too long. People are beginning to think that she wants to marry Mr. Haydon. Polly then quickly changes the subject as she realizes that Maria is upset. She asks Maria for an old work robe to use and Maria quickly leaves the room. Their visit ends shortly after and Maria begins to cry uncontrollably. She feels that this is the first time that she has been happy in a long while. She thinks that she now has to leave the farm and go back to her brother’s house. She works extremely hard in his hotel- tending for guests and her cruel sister-in-law, and does not receive any thanks. Israel comes inside the house and Maria tells him that she needs to leave. He refuses and surprisingly tells her that he has been talking to William and they have decided that he should marry Maria, if she will accept him. She accepts his proposal without saying anything. The final chapter of <b>this</b> <b>story</b> takes place after church one Sunday. Maria and Israel are now married. Maria thinks to herself how lucky she is that she has such a loving husband. The two begin to discuss the late Martha. Maria is extremely kind when discussing her. She continually complements her ‘predecessor’ and so does Israel. Maria suggests that they should invite one of Martha’s oldest friends to the house for tea, as Martha used to. When the guest arrives a day later, Israel overhears the two ladies talking about how sad he was when Martha died. Maria comments that she is so lucky to have met him, but sad that she is not as significant as Martha. The guest comments that she has never seen Israel so happy since he was a young man. After the guest leaves Israel comes inside and tells Martha that he is so happy to have met her, that she is a “good wife”- replacing Martha with Maria once and for all.|$|R

Behindwoods gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Unlike the usual commercial masala that we get to watch every second Friday, Damaal Dumeel slips into the crux of the <b>story</b> <b>right</b> <b>after</b> the public service advertisement on smoking is played and clutches onto it right till the end.

I’m obsessed with this character and <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>right</b> now, and I think it’s going to be very unique and still fit into the overall narrative that they’re establishing. I grew up as a comic book fan, and the same things used to happen in the comic books. You’d have Wolverine’s books, and they’d be so much darker and more brutal than the X-Men books, but they’d still fit in when you open the pages of the X-Men book.

According to the historical official text of Shaolin temple, [...] "Shaolin Kung fu Manual" [...] (...) , in the Sui dynasty (581-618 AD) Shaolin monks had a selected set of 18 simple movements; until the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD) the set had developed into 18 martial postures, that were combined into a form (...) {{the number of the}} postures increased to 36 until the early Song dynasty (960 AD); and in the Jin-Yuan dynasty (1115-1368 AD) it was developed into 173 movements; finally, in the Ming dynasty the system of the 18 hands of Luohan was completed in 18 forms, each form having 18 postures, making a total of 324 postures. In Shaolin, this style is called [...] "inborn Luohan's 18 hands" [...] (...) , because it was the style with which Shaolin kung fu was born. Monk Shi Deqian, in his efforts to document Shaolin martial arts collected 8 forms of the 18 hands of Luohan into his [...] "Encyclopedia of Shaolin martial arts". Of these forms, most lineages of Shaolin monks have mostly kept only one form, mostly the first, or the eighth form. Shaolin Luohan's 18 hands movements are simple and straight. The methods are mostly done by the palms of the hands. Fists, hook hands, and other hand gestures and kicks are less used. Luohan's 18 hands are considered the elementary forms in Shaolin kung fu.|$|R

40|$|With the {{adoption}} of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, education about human rights became an important focus of the new human rights regime and a core method of spreading its values throughout the world. <b>This</b> <b>story</b> of human <b>rights</b> is consistently presented as a progressive teleology that contextualizes the expansion of rights within a larger grand narrative of liberalization, emancipation, and social justice. This paper examines the disjuncture between the grand narrative on international movements for human rights and social justice and the lived experiences of marginalized students in urban environments in the United States. Drawing on our experience as professors who teach human rights, social justice, and social movements courses at an urban, four-year college in Providence, R. I., with a student body which includes large populations of students who are of color, first-generation, economically disadvantaged, and nontraditional in other ways, we explore the relevance and impact of these grand narratives for the lives of our students and their sense of agency. In particular, we advocate for a critical and transformational approach to human rights pedagogy to counter and overcome the pervasive individualization that undergirds the grand narrative of human rights. We argue that a critical (and radical) human rights pedagogy must evaluate the position of the individual in modern life if liberation through human rights law and activism is to be possible...|$|R
