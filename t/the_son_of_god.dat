5|$|According to Maulana Muhammad Ali's Quranic commentary, there indeed existed a {{group of}} Jews who venerated Ezra as <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> According to Ali, Qastallani held that in the Kitan al-Nikah, {{that there was a}} party of Jews who held this belief.|$|E

5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E

5|$|Jesus is {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
5|$|The demon Tarakasura {{had created}} havoc in the universe, and only <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>god</b> Shiva could slay him, but Shiva {{had turned to}} ascetic ways {{after the death of}} his first wife, Sati. Kama was thus {{instructed}} by the gods to make Shiva fall in love again. Kama went to Mount Kailash with Rati and Madhu or Vasanta ("Spring"), and shot his love-arrows at Shiva (in another version of the legend, Kama entered Shiva's mind) and invoked desire. Wounded by Kama's arrows, Shiva becomes attracted to Parvati, the reincarnation of Sati, but agitated, burns Kama by a glance of his third eye.|$|E
5|$|The law {{was used}} {{in at least one}} attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658 a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> and that the miracles {{described}} in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny having said such things, but argued that he had only been responding to questions asked of him. He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War.|$|E

5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor <b>the</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E
5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E

Sanders argues that for Jesus to be hailed as <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> {{does not mean that}} he is literally God's offspring.

25|$|First, the Legio Maria church {{recognises}} salvation through Jesus Christ, <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> The discontinuity with orthodox {{theology is}} that <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> has been incarnated in multiple contexts, rejecting the orthodox doctrine of Christ taking {{a human body}} and soul for eternity. As {{we have seen in}} the above research, none of these incarnations are considered exclusive; they only serve to reveal Christ to people of different contexts. All who are saved through any of these incarnations of Christ will worship God together in heaven. Thus, for the Legio Church, salvation is found through Christ, as revealed in their particular Messias Simeo Ondeto.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{statement in}} a secondary commentary explicitly interpreting this {{to mean that}} angelic beings mated with humans {{can be traced to}} the rabbinical Targum Pseudo-Jonathan and it has since become especially commonplace in modern-day Christian commentaries. This line of interpretation finds additional support in the text of Genesis 6:4 which juxtaposes <b>the</b> <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> (male gender, divine nature) with the daughters of men (female gender, human nature). From this parallelism it could be inferred that <b>the</b> <b>sons</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> are understood as some superhuman beings.|$|R
