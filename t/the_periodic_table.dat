5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for its position in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E

This group lies in the s-block of <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide {{the best example of}} group trends in properties in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> the noble gases are exactly the members of group18 of <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table.</b> Noble gases are {{typically}} highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table.</b> Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E

5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table</b> will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E

5|$|The rows of {{the table}} are called periods; the columns are called groups.

5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table.</b> Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, in some parts of <b>the</b> <b>periodic</b> <b>table,</b> such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
