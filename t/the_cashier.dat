5|$|In Queens, New York, police chase a sedan driven {{through a}} parking garage by two men keeping a teenage boy named Tyler Carson (Cameron Monaghan) in the backseat. Police {{officers}} surround the car and draw their weapons, demanding that the men exit the car. They do, and Tyler stays in his seat. Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee over his own head, and beats himself with the pot. <b>The</b> <b>cashier</b> then electrocutes himself.|$|E

25|$|Others have {{suggested}} that fractional pricing was first adopted as a control on employee theft. For cash transactions with a round price, {{there is a chance}} that a dishonest cashier will pocket the bill rather than record the sale. For cash transactions with an odd price, <b>the</b> <b>cashier</b> must make change for the customer. This generally means opening the cash register which creates a record of the sale in the register and reduces the risk of <b>the</b> <b>cashier</b> stealing from the store owner.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{registration}} {{is done with}} the process of returning change, according to Bill Bryson odd pricing came about because by charging odd amounts like 49 and 99 cents (or 45 and 95 cents when nickels are more used than pennies), <b>the</b> <b>cashier</b> very probably had to open the till for the penny change and thus announce the sale.|$|E

50|$|The {{failure of}} a firm of De Neufville’s size - almost half {{as large as the}} Bank of Amsterdam itself - shocked the markets. The {{immediate}} victims were a group of firms known as “cashiers.” <b>The</b> <b>cashiers</b> were about 30-40 financial intermediaries whose activities formed a bridge between the large banks and merchants. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>cashiers</b> had served as brokers in the market for bank funds. By {{the last half of the}} eighteenth century, their activities had expanded to include settlement of bills denominated in current guilders, deposit taking, and even <b>the</b> issue of <b>cashier’s</b> receipts that circulated locally as bank notes. <b>The</b> <b>cashiers</b> were run hard during the first days of the crisis, as panicked holders of cashier’s receipts demanded coin from the issuers. The contraction of the bill market put the Amsterdam merchant bankers under heavy pressure, as their ability to roll over funding was several constricted.|$|R

25|$|In a {{traditional}} cash transaction, fractional pricing imposes tangible costs on the vendor (printing fractional prices), <b>the</b> <b>cashier</b> (producing awkward change) and the customer (stowing the change). These factors have become less relevant {{with the increased}} use of checks, credit and debit cards and other forms of currency-free exchange; also, the addition of sales tax makes the pre-tax price less relevant to the amount of change (although in Europe the sales tax is generally included in the shelf price).|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{increasing}} number of notes and varieties of notes, many cash drawers are designed to store notes upright & facing forward, instead of the traditional flat & facing upright position. This enables faster access to each note and allows more varieties of notes to be stored. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>cashier</b> will even divide the notes without any physical divider at all. Some cash drawers are flip top in design, where they flip open instead of sliding out like an ordinary drawer, resembling a cashbox instead.|$|E

25|$|Registers will {{typically}} {{feature a}} numerical pad, QWERTY or custom keyboard, touch screen interface, {{or a combination}} of these input methods for <b>the</b> <b>cashier</b> to enter products and fees by hand and access information necessary to complete the sale.

While customization was previously limited to larger chains that could afford to have physical keyboards custom-built for their needs, the customization of register inputs is now more widespread with the use of touch screens that can display a variety of point of sale software.|$|E
25|$|Fortunes {{changed in}} the 1840s with the {{building}} of the Scottish Central Railway which was a catalyst for economic expansion in Larbert itself. Improved transportation led to Dobbie, Forbes and Company establishing a foundry in Larbert in 1872 which manufactured stoves, ranges and light castings. Three years later, James Jones, a local businessman, opened a sawmill on land adjacent to the Dobbie Forbes and Company foundry, which grew rapidly manufacturing timber frames. By the turn of the 20thcentury, Dobbie Forbes had a payroll of more than 200employees. In 1888, a joint venture between Jones and <b>the</b> <b>cashier</b> of Dobbie, Forbes and Company, Dermont Campbell, produced the Jones and Campbell foundry on land close to the railway, which further cemented Larbert's position as a centre of heavy industry. By 1891, the parish of Larbert had a population of 900.|$|E
