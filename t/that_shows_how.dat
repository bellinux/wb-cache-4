5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Emlen and Oring {{created a}} mating systems model <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> {{resource}} distribution affects female living patterns and subsequently, mating systems. In a mating system, the limiting sex (usually females) {{is the one}} that the limited sex (usually males) tries to monopolize. The combination of resource distribution, parental care, and female breeding synchrony determines what mating strategies the limited sex will employ. Polygyny will occur when resources are localized and females form clusters, making it easier for males to control them. The various types of polygyny result because of the differential access individuals have to resources.|$|E
25|$|Elsa {{arrives in}} Storybrooke, {{hoping to find}} her sister Anna. However, things get {{complicated}} {{with the appearance of}} the Snow Queen, who seems to know both Elsa and Emma. The Snow Queen is later revealed to Elsa's aunt and one of Emma's foster mothers; she plans on making them her new sisters, despite their obvious hatred of her. The Snow Queen enacts the spell of Shattered Sight to make everyone kill each other; however, she is given a letter written by Elsa and Anna's mother <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> much she was loved. Seeing she let herself become a monster, the Snow Queen ends the spell by killing herself. At the same time, Mr. Gold plots to free himself of the Dark One dagger's control by crushing Hook's heart in a ceremony; however, Belle uses the dagger to force Gold to leave Storybrooke. Gold reunites the Queens of Darkness (Ursula, Cruella De Vil and Maleficent) to find the Author responsible for writing their stories and force him to give them happy endings. Emma also learns that her old friend Lily is Maleficent's daughter, helping the two reunite. Allying with the Author, Mr. Gold traps everyone in a new story called Heroes and Villains, where the roles are reversed. Henry frees everyone, becoming the new Author in the process. Things get worse as the darkness in Gold escapes, being revealed to be the true Dark One. To save Regina from becoming possessed by it, Emma forces the Darkness to take her instead.|$|E

It was released in June 2014. Game Informer Jeff Marchiafava wrote that the platformer was [...] "hopelessly difficult", as it required a [...] "level of perfectionism only speedrunners possess". He added that Tuffy was both what he [...] "loved and hated" [...] about the video games of his youth, between its 16-bit era art, tight platforming controls, [...] "unforgiving" [...] gameplay, and [...] "reliance on rote memorization" [...] of path through the level. Marchiafava added that gameplay trends had forgotten these types of games for a reason, and concluded that he [...] "never warmed to Tuffy" [...] despite his interest in [...] "punishing retro platformers like Spelunky and Super Meat Boy".|$|E

500|$|Publishers Weekly {{assessed}} in its book review, [...] "Taibbi, {{a writer of}} striking intelligence and bold ideas, is as hilarious as he is scathing."> The review pointed out the book's author did not seek objectivity in his work, [...] "The book is strikingly partisan, and the left-of-center readers most likely to laugh out loud will find their mirth tinged with chagrin that’s hard to digest so soon after the recounted events." [...] The review criticized the contradictory nature of Taibbi, {{as a member of}} the press himself, taking time in the book to criticize the media. The review concluded, [...] "Readers new to Taibbi will regret not reading his reporting as events unfolded, as his analysis is equal parts entertaining and enlightening." [...] Kirkus Reviews wrote that throughout the chronology of Taibbi's recounting of the 2016 campaign, the book, [...] "unfolds as a comedy that slowly turns into a horror movie." [...] Kirkus Reviews criticized the author's tone in the beginning of the book, [...] "Taibbi is cleareyed about the populist forces and fractured media landscape Trump exploited, but given his admission of underestimating Trump’s chances, his first-chapter victory lap, which annotates a chapter from his 2008 book, The Great Derangement, to show how much he’s correctly predicted, feels defensive if not unseemly."

Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly positively compared the album {{to the late}} 90's releases by Bad Boy and said that Big Sean easily outshines all the featured artists on the album. At USA Today, Edna Gunderson called this, an [...] "outstanding second album" [...] that he [...] "occasionally stumbles" [...] in an effort that is a [...] "smart set of slick club thumpers, tear-jerkers and introspective yarns." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone commented saying, [...] "The Detroit MC gets over on congeniality and crisp delivery, even when his lyrics are pro forma." [...] He also praised the album's production. At The Oakland Press, Gary Graff noted that [...] "Hall of Fame is still a solid, confident and diverse set <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>how</b> much he's grown as both an MC and a writer since 'Finally Famous' came out in 2011." [...] Andrea Aguilar of HipHopDX summarized the album stating, [...] "As a whole, the feel-good album's set of eclectic beats doesn't disappoint, but it lacks diversity. Most of Sean's content still teems with predictable material risking leaving listeners disinterested. Random skits also slightly interrupt {{the flow of the}} album, but if you're looking for motivational music centered on the money, the cars, the clothes and hoes, this album is sure to get plenty of replays on your iPod and local radio stations alike." ...|$|E
