25|$|Increases in {{aircraft}} weight {{during the}} design phase {{led to a}} <b>take-off</b> <b>thrust</b> requirement {{which could not be}} met by the engine. The required shortfall of 20% was met with the introduction of partial reheat which was produced by SNECMA.|$|E
25|$|A partial reheat (20% thrust boost) was {{installed}} {{to give the}} required <b>take-off</b> <b>thrust.</b> It was also used for transonic acceleration from just below Mach 1 up to Mach 1.7; the engine supercruised above that speed and at cruise the thrust through the engine mounts contributed 8% of the thrust from the complete propulsion system.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the potential for increases in thrust of up to 30%, the EJ200 engine {{has the potential to}} be fitted with Thrust Vectoring Nozzles (TVN), that the Eurofighter and Eurojet consortium have been actively developing and testing, primarily for export, but also for future upgrades of the fleet. TVN could reduce fuel burn on a typical Typhoon mission by up to 5%, as well as increase available thrust in supercruise by up to 7% and <b>take-off</b> <b>thrust</b> by 2%.|$|E
500|$|Between [...] and [...] {{down the}} runway, the {{aircraft}} reached take-off speed, lifted off the ground, and began climbing normally as the crew retracted the landing gear. Upon climbing through , the aircraft began banking to the right. The climbing bank {{continued to increase}} at a rate which alarmed witnesses, and soon after the aircraft rolled through 90° (at which point the wings were vertical to the ground). At a height of around , with all four engines producing <b>take-off</b> <b>thrust,</b> the nose began to fall. Moments later the right wing and nose impacted the ground, causing the fuselage to cartwheel over, before the aircraft came to rest, with the correct side up. It was immediately engulfed in flames. All {{three members of the}} flight crew were instantly killed. Although emergency services at Long Island MacArthur promptly responded to the crash, the aircraft was destroyed by the post-crash fire.|$|E
500|$|F-84G: Single-seat {{fighter-bomber}} {{capable of}} delivering the Mark 7 nuclear bomb using the LABS, J35-A-29 engine, autopilot, capable of inflight refueling using both the boom (receptacle in left wing leading edge) and drogue (probe fitted to wingtip fuel tanks), introduced the multi-framed canopy which was later retrofitted to earlier straight-winged F-84s. A total of 3,025 were built (1,936 for NATO under MDAP). The larger engine {{had a higher}} airflow at its <b>take-off</b> <b>thrust</b> than the intake had been designed for. This caused higher flow velocities, increased pressure losses and thrust loss. Commencing with block 20, auxiliary [...] "suck-in" [...] doors were added ahead of the wing leading edge to regain some of the thrust loss. At high engine rpm and low aircraft speeds, such as take-off, the spring-loaded doors were sucked open by the partial vacuum created in the duct. When the aircraft reached sufficient airspeed the ram pressure rise in the duct closed the auxiliary doors. F-84G 51-1343 was modified with a periscope system to test the periscope installation proposed for the Republic XF-103.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} insure {{satisfactory}} turbine performance under five turbojet-engine operating conditions, turbine design requirements were determined {{for the following}} operating conditions: <b>take-off,</b> maximum <b>thrust</b> at altitude, altitude cruising at rated rotative speed, altitude cruising with maximum-thrust exhaust nozzle area, and engine acceleration at 80 percent equivalent design rotative speed. If cruising is to be at rated engine speed, both cruising and take-off {{should be considered in}} turbine design. Design requirements for the other conditions are nearly identical. Without compressor-exit bleed, a turbine cannot accelerate this compressor at 80 percent of rated speed; with 28. 6 -percent bleed, the design requirements are within those for take-off...|$|R
5000|$|... the French {{aircraft}} designer, had {{the idea}} to use vectored <b>thrust</b> for vertical <b>take-off</b> aircraft. This <b>thrust</b> would come from four centrifugal blowers shaft driven by a Bristol Orion turboprop, the exhaust from each blower being vectored by rotating the blower scrolls. Although the idea of vectoring the thrust was quite novel, the engine proposed {{was considered to be}} far too heavy.|$|R
50|$|Most {{currently}} operational {{vectored thrust}} aircraft use turbofans with rotating nozzles or vanes to deflect the exhaust stream. This method can successfully deflect thrust through {{as much as}} 90 degrees, relative to the aircraft centerline. However, the engine must be sized for vertical lift, rather than normal flight, which results in a weight penalty. Afterburning (or Plenum Chamber Burning, PCB, in the bypass stream) is difficult to incorporate and is impractical for <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>thrust</b> vectoring, because the very hot exhaust can damage runway surfaces. Without afterburning {{it is hard to}} reach supersonic flight speeds. A PCB engine, the Bristol Siddeley BS100, was cancelled in 1965.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{continued to}} roll {{well to the}} left of center of the closed runway. The flight's second officer now said to the captain, [...] "No visibility here", and the captain exclaimed [...] "Oh Jesus Christ!", presumably seeing a parked dump truck overlapping the left shoulder of Runway 23L that the plane was about to hit. Three seconds before impacting this dump truck, the crew did apply go-around power, attempting to leave the ground. The aircraft's nose was pulled up 10-11 degrees. [...] <b>Take-off</b> <b>thrust</b> was not sufficient to lift the aircraft past the truck. The DC-10's right main landing gear impacted the hood of the parked dump truck, separated from the aircraft, and hit the right tailplane and elevator. The impact of the landing gear shattered the truck, fatally injuring its driver, and creating a debris field 400m by 100m in area.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 September 1947, the P.1040 prototype, VP401, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Hawker N.7/46 after the related naval specification, conducted its maiden flight from RAF Boscome Down, piloted by Bill Humble. Three days later, VP401 flew to Farnborough to continue trials. A month after the first flight, the existence of the P.1040 was revealed to the general public. Early flight trials encountered aerodynamic-related teething problems, such as airframe vibrations and tail buffeting, which led to a redesign of the rear jetpipe fairings and the addition of a bullet-shaped anti-shock body on the tail to correct these issues. Other minor issues were addressed, including high stick forces and windshield distortion; VP401 needed long takeoff runs which were attributed to the [...] "low-thrust" [...] Nene 1. The Nene 2/Mk.101 for production aircraft would have a higher <b>take-off</b> <b>thrust.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce {{was also}} working {{on a series of}} triple-spool designs as {{replacements}} for the Conway, which promised to deliver higher efficiencies. In this configuration, three groups of turbines spin three separate concentric shafts to power three sections of the compressor area running at different speeds. In addition to allowing each stage of the compressor to run at its optimal speed, the triple-spool design is also more compact and rigid, although more complex to build and maintain. Several designs were being worked on at the time, including a 10,000lbf (44kN) thrust design [...] known as the RB203 intended to replace the Rolls-Royce Spey. Work started on the Conway replacement engine in July 1961 and a twin-spool demonstrator engine to prove the HP compressor, combustor, and turbine system designs, had been run by 1966. Rolls-Royce chose the triple-spool system in 1965 as the simplest, lowest cost {{solution to the problem of}} obtaining lower fuel consumption and reduced noise levels at a constant power setting. Work on the RB211 as essentially a scaled-down RB207 began in 1966-7 with the first certificated engines being scheduled to be available by December 1970 at 33,260lb <b>take-off</b> <b>thrust</b> and at a price of $511,000 each.|$|E
40|$|Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) {{have many}} {{potential}} {{applications in the}} maritime industry and ocean science. To subsist in the ocean space, an ASV must {{have the ability to}} scavenge energy from the surrounding environment. Waves are an abundant source of energy on the ocean surface and a suitable resource for an ASV to scavenge. Flapping foils have been shown to generate thrust in a wavy flow and power in a uniform flow. The aim of this experimental study is to investigate the relationship between flapping foil propulsion and power generation in the context of ASVs. Initial experiments incorporating fully passive flapping foils submerged at the bow and stern of a surface vessel in head waves were performed in a towing tank. The spring-loaded foils were located at the end of rigid pivot arms protruding at the bow and abaft of the vessel. The pivot arms were free to rotate about a location beneath the keel line and restrained by adjustable rotational dampers. In this free condition, wave energy is recovered in the form of work applied by the flapping foils through the rotary dampers which were used to simulate the damping effects of a power <b>take-off</b> device. <b>Thrust</b> was generated under conditions when the pivot arm was fixed. This system, referred to as the Flapping Energy Utilization and Recovery (FLEUR) system, could serve as a dualpurpose wave energy scavenging propulsor and power generator for long-endurance ASVs...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{turbine engines}} {{routinely}} experience the ingestion of debris resulting in "foreign object damage‟ FOD. The ingestion of foreign object into aircraft engines leads to severe structural damage {{of the fan}} or compressor blades. Foreign object damage by hard particles mostly occurs during motion of the aircraft on the airfield, during take-off and during landing. Typical objects ingested are stones and other debris; sizes in the millimeter regime form the airfield. The worst case condition is experienced during <b>take-off</b> maximum <b>thrusts</b> leads to maximum impact velocity. Typical impact velocities are in the regime of 100 – 400 m/sec, depending on the types of engine and impact location on the blades. Foreign object damage does not always lead to sudden catastrophic failure, yet such damage can have a detrimental effect on the fatigue strength of fan and compressor aero foils. However complex stress fields and geometry of the aerofoil {{make it difficult to}} use of simple notch analysis. For finding the stress concentration factor on the notches grinded on the typical aerofoil FOD damaged gas turbine compressor blade closed form solutions are difficult proportion. In this paper a finite element analysis is carried out by idealization of the typical aerofoil to rectangular cantilever plate with single edge U-notches for finding the stress concentration factor and is then compared with the standard stress concentration data by R. E. Peterson. The study can then be extended to a typical aerofoil...|$|R

The experimental investigation indicated that total-pressure recoveries comparable withose attainable with well designed nose inlets were obtained with the side inlets when all the boundary layer ahead of the inlets was removed. Serious drag penalties resulted at a Mach number of 2. 0 from the use of blunt-cowl leading edges. However, sharp-lip inlets produced large losses in <b>thrust</b> for the <b>take-off</b> condition.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{obstacle to}} routine space access is the specific energy limitations associated with chemical fuels. In {{the case of}} vertical <b>take-off,</b> the high <b>thrust</b> needed for vertical liftoff and acceleration to orbit translates into power levels in the 10 GW range. Furthermore, useful payload mass fractions are possible only if the exhaust particle energy (i. e., exhaust velocity) {{is much greater than}} that available with traditional chemical propulsion. The electronic binding energy released by the best chemical reactions (e. g., LOX/LH 2 for example, is less than 2 eV per product molecule (approx. 1. 8 eV per H 2 O molecule), which translates into particle velocities less than 5 km/s. Useful payload fractions, however, will require exhaust velocities exceeding 15 km/s (i. e., particle energies greater than 20 eV). As an added challenge, the envisioned hypothetical RLV (reusable launch vehicle) should accomplish these amazing performance feats while providing relatively low acceleration levels to orbit (2 - 3 g maximum). From such fundamental considerations, it is painfully obvious that planned and current RLV solutions based on chemical fuels alone represent only a temporary solution and can only result in minor gains, at best. What is truly needed is a revolutionary approach that will dramatically reduce the amount of fuel and size of the launch vehicle. This implies the need for new compact high-power energy sources as well as advanced accelerator technologies for increasing engine exhaust velocity. Electromagnetic acceleration techniques are of immense interest since they can be used to circumvent the thermal limits associated with conventional propulsion systems. This paper describes the Magnetohydrodynamic Augmented Propulsion Experiment (MAPX) being undertaken at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). In this experiment, a 1 -MW arc heater is being used as a feeder for a 1 -MW magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accelerator. The purpose of the experiment is to demonstrate that an MHD accelerator can be an effective augmentation system for increasing engine exhaust velocity. More specifically, the experiment is intended to show that electromagnetic effects are effective at producing flow acceleration whereas electrothermal effects do not cause unacceptable heating of the working fluid. The MHD accelerator was designed as an externally diagonalized segmented Faraday channel, which will be inserted into an existing 2 -tesla electromagnet. This allows the external power to be connected through two terminals thereby minimizing the complexity and cost associated with powering each segment independently. The design of the accelerator and other components in the flow path has been completed and fabrication activities are underway. This paper provides a full description of MAPX including performance analysis, design, and test plans, and current status...|$|R

The research aimed to identify how much the LTO (Landing-Take-Off) emission activity in I Gusti Ngurah Rai Bali International Airport. The purpose of this research was to identify how much the emission is and the effect of LTO activities towards the ambient air condition of CO and NOx around the airport.
