5|$|In 1896, Baden-Powell was {{assigned}} to the Matabeleland region in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as Chief of Staff to Gen. Frederick Carrington during the Second Matabele War, and it was here (in June, 1896) that he first met and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Africa. This was a formative experience for Baden-Powell not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills, Burnham augmented Baden-Powell's woodcraft skills, inspiring him and sowing seeds for both the programme and for the code of honour later published in Scouting for Boys. Practised by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally little known to the British Army but well-known to the American scout Burnham. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting. Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham, and it was here that Baden-Powell acquired his Kudu horn, the Ndebele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island to wake the first Boy Scouts and <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> together in training courses.|$|E

25|$|Their friends used jokingly <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> William and Mary, and to {{maintain}} {{that they had been}} crowned together like their royal prototypes. Nothing that either of them wrote will live, but they were so industrious, so disinterested, so amiable, so devoted to the work of spreading good and innocent literature, that their names ought not to disappear unmourned.|$|E
25|$|The above {{descriptions}} are flexible. For {{most teams}} today, the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities {{and are often}} called the wings, as do the power forward and center, who are often called post players. While most teams describe two players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center, on some occasions teams choose <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> by different designations.|$|E

25|$|There are an {{overwhelming}} number of mathematical models which {{are referred to as}} Boussinesq equations. This may easily lead to confusion, since often they are loosely referenced to as the Boussinesq equations, while in fact a variant thereof is considered. So it is more appropriate <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> Boussinesq-type equations. Strictly speaking, the Boussinesq equations is the above-mentioned set B, since it is used in the analysis in the remainder of his 1872 paper.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the medical}} community, {{professionals}} {{are trained to}} use alternative terms such as [...] "briefs" [...] rather than [...] "diapers" [...] {{for the sake of}} dignity, as the term [...] "diapers" [...] is associated with children and therefore may have a negative connotation. In practice, though, most health care workers are accustomed <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> <b>them</b> diapers, especially those that resemble children's diapers.|$|R

25|$|Osbourne's father, Don Arden, was a {{rock and}} roll {{entrepreneur}} who managed Black Sabbath and sacked Ozzy Osbourne from the group. He resented his daughter for dating Ozzy and managing his career. While visiting her parents, her mother's dogs attacked her and it was some time before her mother appeared <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> off. She was pregnant {{at the time and}} subsequently lost the baby. She soon lost contact with her father and did not speak to him for 20 years.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{several of}} the indoor arenas would be {{assembled}} elsewhere in the UK. The construction of the Aquatics Centre and the Velopark was confirmed before London won the Games, so {{it might be more}} accurate <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> legacies of the bid rather than of the Games. While the legacy venues would be tailored to London's ongoing needs, some of them would be expensive for that purpose. For example, London will have paid for an 80,000-seat athletics stadium, but will only possess a 25,000-seat stadium.|$|E
25|$|As of November 13, 2015, {{there are}} nine {{lawsuits}} pending against Cosby. Judith Huth and Chloe Goins are both suing Cosby for damages related to their alleged sexual assaults. Although {{the statute of limitations}} has run out for most other accusers to sue directly for their alleged assault, multiple accusers have filed defamation lawsuits claiming that Cosby continued <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> liars through 2014: Janice Dickinson, Renita Hill, Kristina Ruehli, and Katherine McKee have filed individual lawsuits. Tamara Green, Therese Serignese, Linda Traitz, Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Louisa Moritz, and Angela Leslie are also involved in a combined lawsuit against Cosby.|$|E

50|$|The term {{originates}} with experimental psychologist Linda Bartoshuk who {{has spent}} much of her career studying genetic variation in taste perception. In the early 1990s, Bartoshuk and her colleagues noticed some individuals tested in the laboratory seemed to have an elevated taste response and took <b>to</b> <b>calling</b> <b>them</b> supertasters. This increased taste response is not the result of response bias or a scaling artifact, but appears to have an anatomical/biological basis.|$|R

25|$|He comprehended at {{last that}} I {{wanted to see}} a grisette. Then he showed me dozens of them. They were like nearly all the Frenchwomen I ever saw—homely. They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug noses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good {{breeding}} could overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting; they were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; I knew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly and finally, to my thinking it would be base flattery <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> immoral.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of these {{external}} defeats, the Guangxu Emperor initiated the Hundred Days' Reform of 1898. Newer, more radical advisers such as Kang Youwei were given positions of influence. The emperor issued a series of edicts and plans were made to reorganize the bureaucracy, restructure the school system, and appoint new officials. Opposition from the bureaucracy was immediate and intense. Although she {{had been involved in}} the initial reforms, the empress dowager stepped in <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> off, arrested and executed several reformers, and took over day-to-day control of policy. Yet many of the plans stayed in place, and the goals of reform were implanted.|$|E
25|$|The Acoli {{migrated}} {{south to}} northern Uganda {{from the area}} now known as Bahr el Ghazal in South Sudan by about 1,000 AD. Starting in the late seventeenth century, a new sociopolitical order developed among the Luo of northern Uganda, mainly characterized by the formation of chiefdoms headed by Rwodi (sg. Rwot, 'ruler'). The chiefs traditionally came from one clan, and each chiefdom had several villages made up of different patrilineal clans. By the mid-nineteenth century, about 60 small chiefdoms existed in eastern Acoliland. During {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century, Arabic-speaking traders from the north started <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> Shooli, a term which was transformed into 'Acoli'.|$|E

The thing is: Never Trump is over. Never Trump was about the GOP primary and the general election, not the presidency. The Left wants to claim {{it must be a}} {{permanent}} movement, denying the legitimacy of Trump’s election forever, or we were never serious. Well, that’s not what we — or at least I — signed up for. ...I’ll say it again: I’m going <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>’em</b> like I see ’em and wait and see if I was wrong about Trump. So far, I’ve said that most of his cabinet picks have been a pleasant and welcome surprise. But he’s also done plenty of things that make me feel like I had him pegged all along. We only have one president at a time — and the guy isn’t even president yet. I’ll give him a chance. But I won’t lie for him either." ...|$|R

25|$|Ghiberti won the competition. His {{first set}} of Baptistry doors took 27 years to complete, after which he was {{commissioned}} to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground {{for many of the}} artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of linear perspective, the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art. They were a unifying factor, a source of pride and camaraderie for both the city and its artists. Michelangelo was <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> the Gates of Paradise.|$|E
25|$|Alipin – Today, {{the word}} alipin (or oripun in the Visayas) means slave and that’s how the Spaniards {{translated}} it, too, but the alipins {{were not really}} slaves in the Western sense of the word. They were not bought and sold in markets with chains around their necks. A better description would be <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> debtors. They could be born alipins, inheriting their parents' debt, and their obligations could be transferred from one master to another. However, it was also {{possible for them to}} buy their own freedom. A person in extreme poverty might even want to become an alipin voluntarily – preferably to relatives who saw this as a form of assistance rather than punishment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of all this, Lou Pearlman in 1992 placed {{an ad in the}} Orlando Sentinel to compose a vocal group. McLean, who was the first to {{audition}} for Pearlman in his living room, became the group's first member. In January 1993, Pearlman held an open casting call and hundreds of young performers auditioned at his blimp hangar in Kissimmee. Eventually, Carter, Dorough, and Richardson were selected after meeting Pearlman's expectations. Littrell flew from Kentucky to Orlando to formally join the group on April 20, 1993, a day after receiving a phone call from Richardson about it. Thus, April 20 became their anniversary date. Pearlman decided <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> Backstreet Boys, after Orlando's Backstreet Market, an outdoor flea market near International Drive which was also a teen hangout.|$|E

5000|$|Religious {{suffering}} is, at one and {{the same}} time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. <b>To</b> <b>call</b> on <b>them</b> <b>to</b> give up their illusions about their condition is <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on <b>them</b> <b>to</b> give up a condition that requires illusions.|$|R
