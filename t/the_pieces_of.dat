5|$|The raid {{was entirely}} successful. The {{airborne}} troops suffered relatively few casualties, and <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the radar they brought back, {{along with a}} captured German radar technician, allowed British scientists to understand enemy advances in radar and to create countermeasures to neutralise them.|$|E
5|$|After Hamilton's {{death in}} 1804, Elizabeth {{endeavored}} {{to preserve his}} legacy. She re-organized all of Alexander's letters, papers, and writings {{with the help of}} her son, John Church Hamilton, and persevered through many setbacks in getting his biography published. She was so devoted to Alexander's memory that she wore a small package around her neck containing <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> a sonnet which Alexander wrote for her during the early days of their courtship.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} morning, Comic Book Guy tells Bart that he {{no longer}} has <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> paper but refuses to reveal to whom he sold it. Bart walks home in the rain, then in his room he prays to God for his soul. Suddenly, a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> paper with <b>the</b> words [...] "Bart Simpson's soul" [...] floats down from above. Bart discovers that Lisa had purchased <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> paper. While she explains philosophers' opinions on the human soul, Bart happily eats up <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> paper.|$|R
5|$|Martorana placed <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> marble in a {{way that}} looked artistic. In 1947, a {{pedestal}} of granite taken from the Mellon Mansion was erected on the northern end of the oval. On top of it was placed a life-size bronze statue of Christ with open arms. On Armistice Day, November 11, 1951, the monument was dedicated to the defenders of the United States.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} {{received}} puzzles in the game involves arranging <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> a dialogue between the sculpted heads of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. The player listens to the randomly ordered statements made by each head, then decides how to chronologically arrange the statements to form a coherent conversation based on context.|$|E
5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a rotor within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all four sides of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> four ellipses. Because of its 120Â° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E

When he did go on, he took the {{greatest}} care not to shake off that <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bark, for he didn't know but that any minute {{he might want to}} hide under it again. At last he reached the Smiling Pool and slipped into the water, leaving <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bark on <b>the</b> bank. Thereafter, when he wanted to go on land, he would first make sure that no one was watching. Then he would crawl under <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bark and get it on his back. Wherever he went he carried <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bark so as to have it handy to hide under.|$|R

5|$|Cortex sends his loyal Lab Assistants to find <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the map {{scattered}} throughout the big City {{and bring them to}} him. Now that the contestants know about the map, the Viscount decides to reveal his true intentions: the Super Big Power Crystal can grant a single wish who whoever obtains it, and the Viscount is willing to give a large sum of money to those who help him find it. Finding the Power Crystal is impossible without the Final Key, so the Viscount boards his plane to travel to the North Atlantic Ocean in search for the Final Key. But the plane is full, and only a select number of the contestants are able to board. Propelled to the skies by an explosive volcano, the contestants are able to board the Viscount's plane.|$|E
5|$|Numerous easter {{eggs and}} secrets {{were added to}} the game to fuel the {{exploration}} efforts and wild speculation of many gamers. One of the most notable features is <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> cheese hidden on every level. These were deliberately placed by one of the game's artists as a graphical oddity for the player's confusion. The face of actor Robin Williams was used for Daniel Carrington, while the face of Shigeru Miyamoto along with faces of other Nintendo executives and game journalists can be seen on enemy guards and as selectable avatars in the multiplayer mode. The ranking system of the Combat Simulator awards a special username and password to skilled players. Rare had originally intended these details to allow access to password-protected parts of the official Perfect Dark website, but these sections were never implemented.|$|E
5|$|Raynor is {{the protagonist}} and player {{character}} of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. Over {{the course of}} the campaign Raynor's Raiders (as his army is known) fight the Zerg and Mengsk's empire simultaneously. At the behest of a group known as the Moebius Foundation, the Raiders gather <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> a Xel'Naga artifact, until it is revealed that the foundation is actually led by Valerian Mengsk, Arcturus's son. Valerian intends to use the artifact's power to destroy the Queen of Blades, proving to the empire's citizens that he will be a worthy successor to the throne. Raynor begrudgingly finishes assembling the artifact and joins the imperial army in an assault on the Zerg homeworld of Char, but not before uncovering proof of Mengsk's treachery on Tarsonis and broadcasting it across the sector. The Terran forces on Char use the artifact to partially restore Kerrigan's humanity, significantly weakening her, but Raynor refuses to kill her.|$|E
50|$|Mr Allen owned a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> {{land and}} a {{workshop}} in Derby, which had windows overlooking and receiving light from <b>the</b> first <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land. He sold the workshop to Mr Burrows, and <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land to Mr Wheeldon. Mr Wheeldon's widow (Mrs Wheeldon, the plaintiff) built on <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land, and it obstructed {{the windows of}} Mr Burrows' workshop. In response, Mr Burrows dismantled Mrs Wheeldon's construction, asserting an easement over the light passing through Wheeldon's lot. Mrs Wheeldon brought an action in trespass.|$|R

60|$|And the Star-Child {{entered the}} cavern, {{and in its}} {{farthest}} corner he found <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> red gold. So {{he put it in}} his wallet, and hurried to the city. And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, 'Give me <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> red money, or I must die,' and the Star-Child had pity on him again, and gave him <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> red gold, saying, 'Thy need is greater than mine.' Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him.|$|R
5|$|T'Pol, {{working out}} in the gym, also keeps urging Archer to {{apologize}} to the Kreetassans for Porthos' behavior, but Archer resists because he blames them for Porthos' illness. In the end, Porthos recovers following a pituitary transplant from an alien chameleon. Finally swallowing his pride, Archer then goes down to the Kreetassan capital and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves slicing a tree trunk with a chainsaw, arranging <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> wood in a complex pattern on the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the crew finally manage to procure three plasma injectors prior to their departure.|$|E
5|$|The VOR/DME {{system was}} {{tested by the}} Civil Aviation Administration on 7 May and found to be working correctly. AIBN {{established}} a base of operations at the hangar at BrÃ¸nnÃ¸ysund Airport and used a helicopter to freight <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the wreck there and bodies to Trondheim University Hospital for identification. Technical investigations started on 9 May. The aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder. Both were found intact and were decoded at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in the United Kingdom. Improper use of the microphone {{made it difficult to}} hear the captain's voice, but it was possible to reconstruct the conversations and line of events. A memorial service was held on 10 May and was attended by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland. The last Home Guard personnel concluded their work on 11 May and the police concluded their investigations at Torghatten on 13 May.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an oblique, isometric format and is set inside a haunted castle. As Sir Arthur Pendragon, the player's main objective is to collect sixteen pieces of a key before midnight, which when all connected will form {{the shape of a}} pentacle. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the pentacle are guarded by various magical creatures, some of which can be defeated by casting spells, others requiring accurately timed attacks and nimble dodging. Once a piece is obtained, the player must take it to a specific chamber within the castle. Once all pentacles have been placed in their chambers, the player can establish the whereabouts of the Staff of Karnath, which must be destroyed before midnight.|$|E

5|$|The main character, Gabriel Belmont (voiced by Robert Carlyle), is {{a member}} of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who protect and defend {{innocent}} people against the supernatural creatures. Gabriel's wife Marie (Natascha McElhone) was brutally murdered by one of them, and her soul cannot leave as it is trapped in limbo. Because she is now neither alive nor dead, she realizes what is at stake and guides Gabriel to his destiny to save the world as he investigates the dark spell. He travels the destroyed land, meeting other characters, such as the oldest living member of his order, Zobek (Patrick Stewart, who additionally narrates the game). Two masks referred to as the God and Devil Masks lie at the center of the plot, with the God Mask having powers to resurrect the dead. Gabriel intends to defeat the three factions of the Lords of Shadow in order to obtain <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the God Mask and bring back his deceased wife.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. <b>The</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{used those}} days {{to design the}} {{structure}} of the game and segmented the concept into four ideas: world, objective, path to achieve the objective, and obstacles. He envisioned a three-dimensional cube world as the setting and adapted part of the film's plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal. Warshaw then conceived that E.T. would need to assemble a special phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal. He considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the movie, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Feeling more adversity was needed, Warshaw included a time limit for players to accomplish the goal. Pits were devised as an element to hide <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the phone as well as expand the game's world.|$|E
50|$|The rukh is also {{identified}} in the Ethiopian holy book Kebra Negast as the agent responsible for delivering <b>the</b> blessed <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood to King Solomon which enabled the great king to complete <b>the</b> Temple. This <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood also {{is said to have}} transformed the Queen of Sheba's foot from that of a goat to that <b>of</b> a human. <b>The</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood that <b>the</b> rukh brought was therefore given an honored place in the Temple and decorated with silver rings. According to tradition, these silver rings were given to Judas Iscariot as payment for betraying Jesus; <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood became Jesus's cross.|$|R
50|$|After 1686, <b>the</b> old <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> eight {{remained}} <b>the</b> standard coin in the Spanish colonies. Because <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> eight had <b>the</b> same {{intrinsic value}} as the thaler (dollar) coins familiar to English colonists in North America, {{it was being}} called a Spanish dollar {{by the end of}} the 17th century and <b>the</b> older term <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> eight gradually fell into disuse.|$|R

Heading to the Cosmic Egg, the party are stopped by Hatanaka, who reveals {{himself to be}} the willing Mirage Master of Gharnef: the two are planning to perform the Opera of Shadows, summoning Medeus to consume the real world's Performa. The group recover Dragonstones from the conquered Idolosphere realms and restore Tiki's memory: she reveals that they must find <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> the Fire Emblem and perform the Opera of Light to summon {{the power of the}} Divine Dragon Naga, the only force capable of stopping Medeus. Collecting the Fire Emblem pieces, they learn the story of the Hero-King Marth, a warrior from ancient times who bested and sealed away Gharnef and Medeus. The group encounter and defeat Hatanaka and Gharnef, but their sacrifice coupled with the offering of Marth's soul completes the Opera of Shadows and summons Medeus. Traveling to the final Idolasphere realm, Itsuki is fatally injured by Medeus, but the Fire Emblem gems free Marth's soul, which saves Itsuki and allows the group to perform the Opera of Light and defeat Medeus. The Mirages, with their memories restored and Medeus gone forever, return with Tiki to their native realm.|$|E
5|$|Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of Singapore {{respectively}} guarantee {{freedom of}} speech and expression and freedom of assembly to Singapore citizens. However, the PEMA and POA, which require permits to be obtained before public meetings and assemblies can be held, were enacted pursuant to exceptions to these rights. Article 14(2)(a) provides that Parliament may by law restrict the right to free speech to protect, among other things, Singapore's security and public order, and to prevent incitement to any criminal offence. Under Article 14(2)(b), the right of assembly may also be limited for public order reasons. As Speakers' Corner was intended to increase avenues available for the exercise of free speech, <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> subsidiary legislation regulating the venue were issued to provide that public speaking and demonstrations there are not subject to the PEMA and POA if the conditions specified in the subsidiary legislation are complied with. Speakers' Corner has been criticized as a token gesture, though others have pointed to its use by civil society activists as evidence that it has widened the political space in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|At {{a charity}} event held by Stark Industries, {{reporter}} Christine Everhart informs Stark that his company's weapons, including the Jericho, were recently {{delivered to the}} Ten Rings and {{are being used to}} attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging a coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two F-22 Raptor fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has {{the rest of the group}} killed. Stane has a massive new suit reverse engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Pepper to hack into its database. She discovers Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stane's activities.|$|E
