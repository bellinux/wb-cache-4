50|$|Russell cord is {{a finely}} <b>corded</b> <b>fabric,</b> {{generally}} constructed with a cotton warp and worsted weft (filling). Two or more warp threads are woven {{together to form}} the cord, thus the cord lines run warp-wise. Russell cord is visually similar to a very narrow-waled corduroy called pincord, but it is heavier and more sturdy. It is usually woven using 40% cotton and 60% wool (or similar compositions depending on the weaver). It is mainly used {{in the making of}} quality black academical dress, as well as clerical dress and legal dress in the United Kingdom. It is woven using thicker strands so is heavier than princetta.|$|R
5000|$|Grosgrain , also gros-grain and, rarely, gros grain, {{is a type}} {{of fabric}} {{characterized}} by its ribbed appearance. In grosgrain, the weft is heavier than the warp, creating prominent transverse ribs. It is called a [...] "corded" [...] fabric since the weft resembles a fine cord. Grosgrain is a plain weave <b>corded</b> <b>fabric,</b> with heavier <b>cords</b> than in poplin but lighter than in faille. Grosgrain has a very dull appearance with little luster but is very strong. It is a firm, close-woven, fine-corded fabric. While grosgrain fabric is generally black, it can be many different colors, and grosgrain ribbon comes in a large variety of colors and patterns.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} viscose fibres from the <b>tyre</b> <b>cord</b> type varying in {{mechanical}} parameters and titre were compounded with polypropylene to produce fibre reinforced composites. Single fibre strength is analysed in detail and conclusions are drawn {{with respect to}} effective strength values in composite applications. Composites were analysed in terms of tensile and impact properties. Correlations between single fibre and composite properties are studied. High fibre elongation leads to favourable composite impact properties via high composite elongations at break. Using water as a plastisizing agent increasing fibre elongation, notched Charpy impact strength can be improved by more than 50 %. Using a modified rule of mixtures and a shear lag model for the composite modulus it was shown how a titre reduction improves the composite stiffness by an increased interfacial area. A direct fibre-composite strength correlation was not found...|$|R
50|$|After the war mills {{continued}} {{to be an important}} part of the county's economy. Thomaston Mills was a major employer in the county from its beginning in 1899 until 2001, before the company moved to Mexico. Martha Mills, a manufacturer of tire <b>cord</b> <b>fabric,</b> began operation in 1927 and ceased operations in 2006 (Martha Mills was bought by B. F. Goodrich in 1929, and later WesTek in 2008). In the 1920s the peach industry thrived in Upson County, but peaches all but vanished in the county with the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, as orchard laborers found work in the mills. Peach orchards were cut down to make room for timber stands.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine the content of benzene {{in the air and}} solvents and thinners used by 231 workers in 40 small or large workplaces in Istanbul and Izmit. The benzene value in the air of a <b>tyre</b> <b>cord</b> manufacturing factory where two cases of acute leukaemia were recorded in a six year period was 110 ppm. In nine of 47 thinners (19. 1 %) the benzene content ranged between 0 % and 6. 4 % whereas it was between 0. 7 % and 7. 64 % in 26 of 34 solvents used. A haematological study on 231 workers showed that there were mild abnormalities in 14 workers including leucopaenia in nine (3. 9 %), thrombocytopaenia in four (2. 16 %), and pancytopaenia in one (0. 54 %). This study shows that despite the considerable decrease in the content of benzene in the solvents and thinners available in Istanbul and Izmit the percentages of benzene in most of the materials are still above permissible limits...|$|R

Both countries are members of BIMSTEC. Indian Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi, P.V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and Manmohan Singh, have visited Thailand, which were reciprocated by contemporary Thai Prime Ministers Chatichai Choonhavan, Thaksin Sinawatra, and Surayud Chulanont. In 2003, a Free Trade Agreement was signed between the two countries. India, is the 13th largest investor in Thailand. The spheres of trade are in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, nylon, <b>tyre</b> <b>cord,</b> real estate, rayon fibres, paper grade pulps, steel wires, and rods.

40|$|Spun {{cellulose}} fibres {{from the}} viscose, lyocell and carbamate processes {{have been used}} to reinforce thermoplastic commodity polymers, such as polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE) and (high impact) polystyrene (HIPS) as well as poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) for injection moulding applications. A specially developed double pultrusion technique has been employed for compounding. Fibres were analysed in single fibre tensile tests. Strength, stiffness, impact strength, and heat distortion temperature (HDT) were determined for injection-moulded standard test specimen and structural features were revealed by scanning electron microscopy. A strong reinforcing effect was observed in all cases. In particular, high tenacity <b>tyre</b> <b>cord</b> rayon gives excellent composite strength and impact strength, often doubling or tripling the pristine matrix values. In the case of PP, Lyocell type fibres provide enhanced stiffness and HDT, and thus the combination of both fibre types leads to a balanced composite property profile. The PE case is very similar to PP. For HIPS mainly strength and stiffness is increased, while for TPE the property profile is changed completely. With PLA, a biogenic and biodegradable composite with excellent mechanical properties is presented...|$|R

40|$|Two {{factors are}} driving {{advances}} in synthetic fibre yarns, cords and rope technology. The {{first is the}} development and exploration of first and second generation synthetic fibres {{and the introduction of}} new rope constructions that offer the potential for major improvements in rope properties. The second is the growing range of synthetic fibre engineering applications being studied. A number of major ventures have already been brought to realisation. For example, the US Navy interest in mooring a large “air-base ” in deep water in the Pacific and the exploitation of oil fields in greater water depths (500 – 3000 m) makes light weight fibre ropes an attractive practical alternative to wire ropes or chains. Fibre structures are also replacing steel wire structures in some other traditional uses and have the potential for important advances in <b>tyre</b> <b>cords,</b> medical ligaments, bridges, textile architectural buildings, towed arrays, space structures and other engineering applications. Polymeric fibres have complex mechanical properties and fibre structures can be geometrically complex involving interactions between millions of fine fibres. These features lead to the major difficulty of predicting fibre structure performance when subjected to complex loading over long periods of time. As a result the traditional practice for structural engineers is to use designs based o...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} three-point flexure tests on hybrid I- and Π-beams, {{made out of}} {{multi-layer}} carbon fiber/epoxy resin (including twill woven fabric CF 3031 / 5284 and unidirectional <b>cord</b> <b>fabric</b> U 3160 / 5284) reinforced composites, processed using the RTM (resin transfer molding) technique. Static bending properties were determined and failure initiation mechanism was deduced from experimental observations. Failure mode of the tested hybrid RTM-made I-beams can be reckoned to be characteristic of the delamination from the cutout edge within the web and the debonding propagation along the interface between the inverted triangular resin-rich zone and the adjacent curved web until local buckling within the curved webs around the conjunction fillet region. In contrast, as distinct from hybrid RTM I-beams subjected to three-point bending loading, hybrid RTM-made Π-beams in three-point flexure tests experienced the resin debonding in the inverted triangular resin-rich zones and the debonding propagation along the interface between the inverted triangular resin-rich zone and the adjacent curved web until complete separation of the curved web from the flange. Progressive damage models (PDMs) were presented to predict failure loads and process of hybrid RTM-made I- and Π-beams under three-point flexure. Good correlation was achieved between experimental and numerical results...|$|R

5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and <b>corded</b> cotton <b>fabric</b> for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|R
