2500|$|Memory lapses {{can be both}} {{aggravating}} {{and frustrating}} but they are due to the overwhelming amount of information that is being taken in by the brain. Issues in memory can also be linked to several common physical and psychological causes, such as: anxiety, dehydration, depression, infections, medication side effects, poor nutrition, vitamin B12 deficiency, psychological stress, substance abuse, chronic alcoholism, thyroid imbalances, and blood clots in the brain. [...] <b>Taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> body and mind with appropriate medication, doctoral check-ups, and daily mental and physical exercise can prevent some of these memory issues.|$|E
2500|$|Though Maywood {{officials}} {{stopped short}} of filing for bankruptcy or even giving up the city's municipal status, the city still faces a serious problem with a huge deficit. The city did keep a few employees as independent contractors when they outsourced most city functions to Bell and police duties to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. In September 2010, the troubled nearby city of Bell agreed to cancel the contract to handle the day-to-day operations of neighboring Maywood. Maywood has been overrun with political crises — from recalls to a city clerk {{accused of trying to}} contract a hit man to kill Councilman Aguirre. In early 2006, a newly elected Aguirre called Maywood a [...] "sanctuary city" [...] for illegal immigrants, stating: [...] "I think we needed to amplify the debate by saying that no human being is illegal. These people are here ... making your clothes, shining your shoes and <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kids. And now you want to develop this hypocritical policy?" ...|$|E

40|$|The {{contemporary}} Western {{preoccupation with}} risk assessment is profound. However, {{this does not}} mean that the concept of risk is a useful theoretical tool for understanding contemporary society in general. The talk of a risk society is part of a tendency to take risk as an all-embracing category with little attention paid either to the distinction between abstract risk and risk assessment, or to different formations of risk in time and place. We argue that a fundamental shift in the communication of risk has also emerged, particularly in the context of the war on terror. Most of the classical risk communication literature is concerned with persuading people that the authorities or companies have the expertise to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> some problem: "there is a risk", it says, we can never manage it completely, but be reassured that we are <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> it on <b>your</b> behalf". With the emergence of the war on terror, a number of changes have occurred. Governments in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and elsewhere stress the novelty and radical emergence of terrorism-as-risk, in part by ignoring history and concentrating on the symptoms to maintain a continuing sense of danger. Second, the prior emphasis on experts and expert systems for generating risk assessment is being actively undermined by ideologues. These changes represent a disturbing shift from the dominance of the Enlightenment idea of trusting in science and knowledge to accepting a post-Enlightenment idea that authority and ideology are all that can ever underpin the assessment of abstract risk, particularly in the case of terrorism...|$|R
