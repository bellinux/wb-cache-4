As Katharine watched him, she was seized with preliminary symptoms of his own panic. At the same time she was convinced that, should he find the right page, take out his spectacles, clear his throat, and open his lips, a chance that would never come again in all their lives would be lost to them both.|$|E
60|$|What {{a paradise}} this gallery is for French students, or foreigners who sojourn in the capital! It is hardly {{necessary}} {{to say that}} the brethren of the brush are not usually supplied by Fortune with any extraordinary wealth, or means of enjoying the luxuries with which Paris, more than any other city, abounds. But here they have a luxury which surpasses all others, and spend their days in a palace which all the money of all the Rothschilds could not buy. They sleep, perhaps, in a garret, and dine in a cellar; but no grandee in Europe has such a drawing-room. Kings' houses have, at best, but damask hangings, and gilt cornices. What are these to a wall covered with canvas by Paul Veronese, or a hundred yards of Rubens? Artists from England, who have a national gallery that resembles a moderate-sized gin-shop, who may not copy pictures, except under particular restrictions, and on rare and particular days, may revel here to their hearts' content. Here is a room half a mile long, with as many windows as Aladdin's palace, open from sunrise till evening, and free to all manners and all varieties of study: the only puzzle to the student is <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> he shall begin upon, and keep his eyes away from the rest.|$|E

60|$|The {{plan was}} divulged to {{one after another}} of such men as the conspirators {{supposed}} most worthy of confidence in such a desperate undertaking, and meetings for consultation were held to determine what plan to adopt for finally accomplishing their end. It was agreed that Caesar must be slain; but the time, the place, {{and the manner in}} which the deed should be performed were all yet undecided. Various plans were proposed in the consultations which the conspirators held; but there was one thing peculiar to them all, which was, that they did not any of them contemplate or provide for any thing like secrecy in the commission of the deed. It was to be performed in the most open and public manner. With a stern and undaunted boldness, which has always been considered by mankind as truly sublime, they determined that, in respect to the actual execution itself of the solemn judgment which they had pronounced, there should be nothing private or concealed. They thought over the various public situations in which they might find Caesar, and where they might strike him down, only <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> which would be most public of all. They kept, of course, their preliminary counsels private, to prevent the adoption of measures for counteracting them; but they were to perform the deed in such a manner as that, so soon as it was performed, they should stand out to view, exposed fully to the gaze of all mankind as the authors, of it. They planned no retreat, no concealment, no protection whatever for themselves, seeming to feel that the deed which they were about to perform, of destroying the master and monarch of the world, was a deed in its own nature so grand and sublime as to raise the perpetrators of it entirely above all considerations relating to their own personal safety. Their plan, therefore, was to keep their consultations and arrangements secret until they were prepared to strike the blow, then to strike it in the most public and imposing manner possible, and calmly afterward to await the consequences.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem is}} that of {{inconsistency}} between forecasts. Because of these problems, it is often necessary to combine forecasts of different technologies.

50|$|The cardiac {{electrophysiology}} study (EPS) typically {{measures the}} response of the injured or cardiomyopathic myocardium to PES on specific pharmacological regimens in order to assess the likelihood that the regimen will successfully prevent potentially fatal sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation VF (VF) in the future. Sometimes a series of EPS drug trials must be conducted to enable the cardiologist <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> regimen for long-term treatment that best prevents or slows the development of VT or VF following PES. Such studies may also be conducted {{in the presence of a}} newly implanted or newly replaced cardiac pacemaker or AICD.|$|E
50|$|The Documentary Branch of the Academy first {{votes to}} select ten {{pictures}} for preliminary nomination, after which {{a second round}} of balloting is conducted to select the five documentary nominees.

50|$|It wasn’t until {{recently}} that bilingualism {{had really been}} accepted as a contributing factor to cognitive development. Ellen Bialystok, was, and is a big game changer in this field.

There {{have been a number of}} studies showing how bilingualism contributes to the executive function of the brain, which is the main center at which cognitive development happens.According Bialystok in “Bilingualism and the Development of Executive Function: The Role of Attention”, children who are bilingual, have to actively filter through the two different languages <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> they need to use, which in turn makes the development stronger in that center.|$|E
5000|$|Theory curbing is a {{solution}} proposed by Thomas Eiter, Georg Gottlob, and Yuri Gurevich. The {{idea is that the}} model that circumscription fails <b>to</b> <b>select,</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> in which both [...] and [...] are true, is a model of the formula that is greater (w.r.t. the extension of [...] ) than both the two models that are selected. More specifically, among the models of the formula, the excluded model is the least upper bound of the two selected models. Theory curbing selects such least upper bounds models in addition to the ones selected by circumscription. This inclusion is done until the set of models is closed, {{in the sense that it}} includes all least upper bounds of all sets of models it contains.|$|E
50|$|In this {{scenario}} {{the front desk}} count-holder represents a counting semaphore, the rooms are the resource, and the students represent processes/threads. The value of the semaphore in {{this scenario}} is initially 10, with all rooms empty. When a student requests a room, they are granted access, {{and the value of}} the semaphore is changed to 9. After the next student comes, it drops to 8, then 7 and so on. If someone requests a room and the resulting value of the semaphore would be negative, they are forced to wait until a room is freed (when the count is increased from 0). If one of the rooms was released, but there are several students waiting, then any method can be used <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who will occupy the room (like FIFO or flipping a coin). And of course, a student needs to inform the clerk about releasing his/her room only after really leaving it, otherwise, there can be an awkward situation when such student {{is in the process of}} leaving the room (s/he is packing his/her textbooks, etc) and another student enters the room before s/he leaves it.|$|E

50|$|Sovereign Hill: The {{players were}} taken to the gold rush town of Sovereign Hill and told <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> among them who would most enjoy {{dressing}} up in period costume. Mal was chosen, and he was told to disguise himself {{in such a way that}} the players would not be able to recognize him. He had all the costumes and makeup from Sovereign Hill at his disposal. Mal arranged to have as many people as possible around him, and discovered an actor on site that greatly resembled him. He lent the actor some of his jewellery and shaved off his distinctive goatee to try to complete the misdirection. The others had five minutes to gaze out from a height upon the main square in Sovereign Hill, where they were told Mal was hiding. If they found him, they'd add $5,000 to the kitty, but if they chose someone thinking it was Mal and it wasn't, or ran out of time, they'd win nothing and Mal would win a free pass through to the next episode. The players thought they'd found him just as their time ran out, but they were incorrect in their guess. Mal had in fact not dressed in period costume at all - he had posed as a cameraman.|$|E
5000|$|On Day 44, {{the divide}} {{in the house}} was officially taken down, and the [...] "Rich & Poor" [...] twist ended. That same night, they learned that they must select two Housemates to be given a video message from home. In {{exchange}} for this, the two selected Housemates would be the nominees for eviction that week, and the nominations on Monday would be cancelled. Ultimately failing to make a decision, the group chose to pull straws, resulting in Kate and PJ being selected. This meant that they would receive their messages, and would face the public vote that week. On Day 45, Tim was reprimanded by Big Brother for stealing two bottles of alcohol. On Day 47, Housemates were given a new task, known as [...] "Master and Slave," [...] in which one Housemate would be the master and the other would be the slave; the following day, the roles were reversed. Masters could demand slaves to do anything for them, with the slaves having to comply. Following this task, the Housemates had <b>to</b> <b>select</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> Housemate who they felt best played the role of the slave; they chose Kate.
