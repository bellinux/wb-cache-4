5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> <b>up</b> images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E

Initially, the Government of Queensland intended to uphold a contract clause that stated a second AFL team in Queensland must play all home games at the Gabba until 2016. The clause was later loosened and the AFL sought out joint funding for the redevelopment of Carrara Stadium. The AFL was able <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> <b>up</b> the funds needed for the redevelopment but it would all hinge on whether the Queensland Labor Party would be re-elected in the 2009 state election.|$|E

25|$|Back at UNIT, Captain Mike Yates and Sergeant Benton were {{watching}} {{the end of the}} broadcast as it went dead. In the morning they arrive at the village just as a heatwave engulfs the village. The Brigadier finds himself unable to enter the village, as there is an invisible dome-shaped barrier, 10 miles in diameter and one mile high, surrounding it that causes anything trying to enter to heat up and burst into flame. The barrier is centred on the church. He contacts Yates and is briefed on the situation while the Doctor and Jo return to the dig where they find a small spaceship in the mound, which has been condensed. From this, the Doctor realises that the Master is trying <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> <b>up</b> an ancient and all-powerful demon, who is seen on Earth to be the Devil, but actually an alien. The Doctor explains that the Dæmons have influenced Earth throughout its history, becoming part of human myth, and see the planet as a giant experiment. The Master has called the Dæmon up once, and right now, it is so small as to be invisible. The third summoning, however, could signal the end of the experiment, and the world.|$|E
5000|$|In linguistics, an epithet {{only can}} be a metaphor, {{essentially}} a reduced or condensed use of apposition. Epithets are sometimes attached to a person's name or appear in place {{of his or her}} name, as what might be described as a glorified nickname or sobriquet. An epithet is linked to its noun by long-established usage. Not every adjective is an epithet. An epithet is especially recognizable when its function is largely decorative, such as if [...] "cloud-gathering Zeus" [...] is employed other than in reference <b>to</b> <b>conjuring</b> <b>up</b> a storm. [...] "The epithets are decorative insofar as they are neither essential to the immediate context nor modelled especially for it. Among other things, they are extremely helpful to fill out a half-verse", Walter Burkert has noted.|$|R

60|$|But seems it likely, thought I, that one, who, {{according}} to his own account, has conducted himself so heroically in rescuing the brigantine, should be the victim of such childish terror at the mere glimpse {{of a couple of}} sailors in an open boat, so well supplied, too, with arms, as he was, to resist their capturing his craft, if such proved their intention? On the contrary, would it not have been more natural, in his dreary situation, to have hailed our approach with the utmost delight? But then again, we were taken for phantoms, not flesh and blood. Upon the whole, I regarded the narrator of these things somewhat distrustfully. But he met my gaze like a man. While Annatoo, standing by, looked so expressively the Amazonian character imputed to her, that my doubts began to waver. And recalling all the little incidents of their story, so hard <b>to</b> be <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> on the spur of a presumed necessity to lie; nay, so hard <b>to</b> be <b>conjured</b> <b>up</b> at all; my suspicions at last gave way.

25|$|It {{is at this}} point, the {{beginning}} of 1907, that I propose to bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> <b>up</b> a quintet of Dionysiac Demoiselles on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has gone before. It does not. For all that the Demoiselles is rooted in Picasso's past, {{not to speak of}} such precursors as the Iron Age Iberians, El Greco, Gauguin and Cézanne, it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since Giotto. As we will see in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of 20th-century art. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the stock}} markets history, {{there have been}} dozens of scandals {{involving}} listed companies, stock investing methods and brokerage. A classical case related to insider trading of listed companies involved Raj Rajaratnam and its hedge fund management firm, the Galleon Group. On Friday October 16, 2009, he was arrested by the FBI and accused of conspiring with others in insider trading in several publicly traded companies. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara put the total profits in the scheme at over $60million, telling a news conference {{it was the largest}} hedge fund insider trading case in United States history. A well publicized accounting fraud of a listed company involved Satyam. On January 7, 2009, its Chairman Raju resigned after publicly announcing his involvement in a massive accounting fraud. Ramalinga Raju was sent to the Hyderabad prison along with his brother and former board member Rama Raju, and the former CFO Vadlamani Srinivas. In Italy, Parmalat's Calisto Tanzi was charged with financial fraud and money laundering in 2008. Italians were shocked that such a vast and established empire could crumble so quickly. When the scandal was made known, the share price of Parmalat in the Milan Stock Exchange tumbled. Parmalat had sold itself credit-linked notes, in effect placing a bet on its own credit worthiness in order <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> <b>up</b> an asset out of thin air. After his arrest, Tanzi reportedly admitted during questioning at Milan's San Vittore prison, that he diverted funds from Parmalat into Parmatour and elsewhere. The family football and tourism enterprises were financial disasters; as well as Tanzi's attempt to rival Berlusconi by buying Odeon TV, only to sell it at a loss of about €45 million. Tanzi was sentenced to 10 years in prison for fraud relating to the collapse of the dairy group. The other seven defendants, including executives and bankers, were acquitted. Another eight defendants settled out of court in September 2008.|$|E

In the Rolling Stone {{review of the}} album, critic Christian Hoard wrote: [...] "Adam Levine's urban-romantic swoonings work best when his band really gets up on the good foot, as on 'This Love', which uses piano and James Brown-like guitars to create a foundation on which Levine can obsess about beauty (including his own)." [...] Jason Thompson of PopMatters noted that on the songs [...] "This Love" [...] and [...] "Must Get Out", keyboardist Jesse Carmichael [...] "manages <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> <b>up</b> both the productions of Britney Spears and The New Radicals respectively". Sam Beresky of the Daily Lobo, who was less enthusiastic about the album, complimented the band on [...] "This Love", in which he noted, [...] "...'This Love', is a happier version of the first with a great backbeat reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's 'Superstition'. It might make a foot tap, a head nod or even a booty shake if played at a loud volume." ...|$|E

500|$|Cliff Martinez {{composed}} the film's soundtrack, which {{was his first}} score for Soderbergh since Solaris in 2002. Given that the pacing of the music was one of Soderbergh's biggest concerns, Martinez needed to maintain a brisk pace throughout the soundtrack, while also conveying fear and hope within the music. [...] "I tried to create the sound of anxiety. And at key, strategic moments I tried to use the music <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> <b>up</b> the sense of tragedy and loss." [...] Martinez incorporated orchestral elements, and fused them with the predominantly electronic sounds of the score. He noted that the [...] "sound palette for Contagion came by way of combining three very different approaches Steven went through as he was cutting the film." [...] Martinez received a rough cut for the film in October 2010, which contained music that was imbued with elements of The French Connection (1971) and Marathon Man (1976). He [...] "loved" [...] those two soundtracks, and composed a few pieces in their style. A few months later, he acquired a new cut, which included music influenced by German electronic group Tangerine Dream. Toward the end, Soderbergh changed again and used contemporary soundtrack music that was [...] "more energetic and more rhythmic". Ultimately, Martinez used aspects of all three approaches: [...] "I reasoned that combining them would not only be effective but would give the score a style all its own." ...|$|E

[...] He continued, [...] "Such vivid contrasts in the film's approach to its subject lead to its downfall. Any effect the disgustingly boring and extremely brutal murder scenes have go to waste seconds later when director Charles B. Pierce leads the picture {{into some of the}} type of poor comedy relief that one is used to seeing in budget pictures of the '60s. As a result, the film is unable <b>to</b> <b>conjure</b> <b>up</b> any mood or suspense." [...] He concludes with, [...] "All in all, the picture is an unpleasant little film and Pierce, after going overboard on the blood and gore scenes, never seems to be able to decide as to how serious the picture should be," [...] and that [...] "both mature and immature minds should avoid the film." [...] A reporter in El Paso, Texas, gave it a mixed review, writing that [...] "this mixture of humor with fact saved 'The Town...' as it wakes the audience when things begin to lag." [...] He goes on to write, [...] "All things considered, the movie is entertaining and would appeal to those who savor unsolved murder mysteries." ...|$|E

He was a great day-dreamer, a seer of fit and beautiful and humorous visions, but hardly a great artist; hardly, in the manful sense, an artist at all. He pleased himself, and so he pleases us. Of the pleasures of his art he tasted fully; but of its toils and vigils and distresses never man knew less. A great romantic—an idle child.|$|R
