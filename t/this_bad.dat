25|$|However, {{in spite}} of <b>this</b> <b>bad</b> press, and unlike the NFL's {{previous}} rivals, the AFL was able to survive and grow, and began to prosper in the mid-1960s after the relocation of the Chargers and Texans to non-NFL markets, the sale and rebranding of the New York Titans (to the Jets), and the Jets' signing of University of Alabama quarterback Joe Namath to an unprecedented $427,000 contract. The league's financial survival was also buoyed by NBC's $36 million, five-year contract to televise AFL games beginning in 1965.|$|E
25|$|The p-value was {{introduced}} by Karl Pearson in the Pearson's chi-squared test, where he defined P (original notation) as {{the probability that the}} statistic would be at or above a given level. This is a one-tailed definition, and the chi-squared distribution is asymmetric, only assuming positive or zero values, and has only one tail, the upper one. It measures goodness of fit of data with a theoretical distribution, with zero corresponding to exact agreement with the theoretical distribution; the p-value thus measures how likely the fit would be <b>this</b> <b>bad</b> or worse.|$|E

25|$|The {{squadron}} was reformed at Charmy Down on 20 September 1941 {{and equipped}} with the then brand new two-engined Westland Whirlwind four-cannon fighter. The squadron became operational with them on 20 October and flew its first mission (a mandolin) four days afterwards. Unfortunately the new CO, , was killed four days after this in a mid-air collision with a new pilot. Two days later another pilot crashed into the sea. After <b>this</b> <b>bad</b> start, No. 137 became non-operational for a period before resuming with coastal missions on 11 November. On one such mission on 12 February 1942, to escort some destroyers, they met by accident the fighter screen around the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau, losing four pilots in the event.|$|E
25|$|Compounding <b>this</b> <b>bad</b> {{feeling was}} the fact that the harvests had been poor and taxes had risen. The rise in food prices and the luxury {{displayed}} on the occasion of the royal wedding increased tensions among the common people. A particular point of tension was an open-air cross erected on the site of the house of Philippe de Gastines, a Huguenot who had been executed in 1569. The mob had torn down his house and erected a large wooden cross on a stone base. Under the terms of the peace, and after considerable popular resistance, this had been removed in December 1571 (and re-erected in a cemetery), which had already led to about 50 deaths in riots, as well as mob destruction of property. In the massacres of August, the relatives of the Gastines family were among the first to be killed by the mob.|$|E

500|$|His 1994 film I'll Do Anything, {{starring}} Nick Nolte, {{was conceived}} and filmed by Brooks as an old-fashioned movie musical and parody of [...] "Hollywood lifestyles and movie clichés", costing $40 million. It featured songs by Carole King, Prince, and Sinéad O'Connor, among others, with choreography by Twyla Tharp. When preview audience {{reactions to the}} music were overwhelmingly negative, all production numbers from the film were cut and Brooks wrote several new scenes, filming them over three days and spending seven weeks editing the film down to two hours. Brooks noted: [...] "Something like this not only tries one's soul – it threatens one's soul." [...] While {{it was not unusual}} for Brooks to edit his films substantially after preview screenings on this occasion he was [...] "denied any privacy" [...] because the media reported the negative reviews before its release and [...] "it had to be good enough to counter all <b>this</b> <b>bad</b> publicity."

It was Michael Piller's suggestion that Gowron should die, and this idea made its way into the episode via Moore's screenplay.

2500|$|Through the 1980s, Community High's {{programs}} {{continued on}} {{much as they}} had in the heady days of the 1970s, even as the experimental educational philosophies of the 1970s receded elsewhere in the state and the nation. During this decade, the school had a much lower profile in Ann Arbor, and it was often stereotyped as a haven for misfits or drug users, with its detractors affixing unflattering nicknames such as [...] "Commie High" [...] or [...] "Community Get-High School." [...] <b>This</b> <b>bad</b> reputation meant that anyone who wanted or needed to be there could do so, and it became a haven, instead, for students with a strong desire to create their own educational direction. It was known as a place with no cliques, and by the seventeenth year of its existence, there had been a grand total of two physical confrontations between students in the school's entire history. During the 199192 academic year, CHS temporarily moved to alternate facilities at Stone School in eastern Ann Arbor while its downtown building was renovated and expanded. The year was marred by a series of conflicts that arose between CHS students and students in adult-education programs already located at Stone School, and the alternate location made it difficult to maintain programs that depended on CHS's downtown setting. Still, through the 1980s the school continued to draw a steady stream of enthusiastic applicants dissatisfied with the strictures of the city's traditional high schools.|$|E
