40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{how social}} investors evaluate {{the integrity of}} social entrepreneurs. Based on an experiment with 40 professionals and 40 students, we investigate how five attributes of <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> contribute to <b>the</b> assessment of integrity. These attributes are <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur's</b> personal experience, professional background, voluntary accountability efforts, reputation and awards/fellowships granted to <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur.</b> We find that social investors focus largely on voluntary accountability efforts of <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> and <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur's</b> reputation when judging integrity. For an overall positive judgment of integrity, it was sufficient if either reputation or voluntary accountability efforts of <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> were high. By comparing professionals with students, we show that experience leads to a simpler decision model focusing on key attributes.

40|$|Micro{{economic}}s {{should reflect}} the central economic role of <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur.</b> I describe a {{general theory of}} the firm in which entrepreneurs, firms, markets and organizations are endogenous. <b>The</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> makes a fundamental economic contribution by establishing a firm, which in turn creates markets and organizations. <b>The</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> faces three types of competition. In type-I competition, <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> competes with other <b>entrepreneurs</b> to establish <b>the</b> most efficient new firm.

A basic general equilibrium model illustrates the main points of the theory. In the model, consumers choose between being establishing firms and working for firms.

25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} colonial period, Massachusetts {{leveraged}} its strong seafaring tradition, advanced shipbuilding industry, {{and access to the}} oceans to make the U.S. the pre-eminent whaling nation in the world by the 1830s. Whale oil was in demand chiefly for lamps. By the 1750s whaling in Nantucket had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending for years at a time and with vessels traveling as far as South Pacific waters. The British Navy captured most of the whalers during the revolution, {{but at the same time}} many whalers refitted out as privateers against the British. Whaling recovered after the war as New Bedford became the center. Whalers took greater economic risks to turn major profits: expanding their hunting grounds and securing foreign and domestic workforces for the Pacific. Investment decisions and financing arrangements were set up so that managers of whaling ventures shared their risks by selling some equity claims but retained a substantial portion due to moral hazard considerations. As a result, they had little incentive to consider the correlation between their own returns and those of others in planning their voyages. This stifled diversity in whaling voyages and increased industry-wide risk. After 1860 kerosene replaced whale oil—concurrent with the devastation of the whaling fleet by Confederate commerce raiders—and <b>the</b> <b>entrepreneurs</b> shifted to manufacturing.|$|E
