25|$|In {{relation}} to clemency pleas, in Yong Vui Kong the Court of Appeal {{was of the}} view that any right to disclosure of material relating to Article 22P(2) of the Constitution could only {{be based on a}} right of hearing of a clemency case. Since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to petition for clemency and/or a right to be heard during the clemency process, it follows that no such right of disclosure exists under Article 22P.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, Wittgenstein often {{uses the}} device of framing {{many of the}} remarks as a {{dialogue}} between himself and a disputant. For example, Remark 258 proposes a thought experiment in which a certain sensation {{is associated with the}} sign S written in a calendar. He then sets up a dialogue in which the disputant offers a series of ways of defining S, and he meets each with a suitable objection, so drawing the conclusion that in such a case <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> definition of S.|$|E

Although these are the basic coverages, expanded forms of residential owner's policies exist that cover additional items of loss.|$|E
25|$|The Constitutional Court of Hungary {{is one of}} {{the highest}} level actors {{independent}} of the politics in the country. The Constitutional Court serves as the main body {{for the protection of the}} Constitution, its tasks being the review of the constitutionality of statutes. The Constitutional Court performs its tasks independently. With its own budget and its judges being elected by Parliament it does not constitute a part of the ordinary judicial system. The constitutional court passes on the constitutionality of laws, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> of appeal on these decisions.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that the Lode was navigable beyond Soham. Lighters brought cargoes of corn to a water mill at Soham, and later brought coal when steam engines replaced the water wheel. Barley and timber were other important cargoes. Railways did not reach Soham until 1879, and resulted in the rapid demise of water-borne transport. Commercial traffic ceased about 1900, and the lode was described as un-navigable in a report by H. Dunn in 1906. There was a sluice at the entrance to the lode, with two sets of mitre gates, pointing in opposite directions, one to prevent flood waters from the Great Ouse entering the lode, and the other to raise the water level in the lode to make navigation easier. When the Anglian Water Authority was created by Act of Parliament in 1977, the lode was not listed as a navigation, and their successors, the Environment Agency, have taken this to mean that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> of navigation.|$|E

25|$|Most cases {{begin in}} {{district}} court, which is subdivided into state district court and local district court. State district courts exercise district-wide {{jurisdiction over the}} districts created by the General Assembly, and local district courts are presided over by part-time judges who may privately practice law. 25 state district court judges preside over 15 districts, with more districts created in 2013 and 2017. There are 28 judicial circuits of Circuit Court, with each contains five subdivisions: criminal, civil, probate, domestic relations, and juvenile court. The jurisdiction of the Arkansas Court of Appeals {{is determined by the}} Arkansas Supreme Court, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> of appeal from the Court of Appeals to the high court. The Arkansas Supreme Court can review Court of Appeals cases upon application by either a party to the litigation, upon request by the Court of Appeals, or if the Arkansas Supreme Court feels the case should have been initially assigned to it. The twelve judges of the Arkansas Court of Appeals are elected from judicial districts to renewable six-year terms.|$|E
2500|$|Many U.S. jurisdictions {{permit the}} seating of an {{advisory}} jury {{in a civil}} case in which <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to trial by jury to provide non-binding advice to the trial judge, although this procedural tool is rarely used. [...] For example, a judge might seat an advisory jury to guide the judge in awarding non-economic damages (such as [...] "pain and suffering" [...] damages) in a case where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to a jury trial, such as (depending on state law) a case involving [...] "equitable" [...] rather than [...] "legal" [...] claims.|$|E

50|$|In some {{versions}} of social contract theory, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rights</b> {{in the state}} of nature, only freedoms, and it is the contract that creates rights and obligations.

50|$|Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal & Mining Co., 382 P.2d 109 (Okl. 1962) <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to {{specific}} performance {{to cover up}} land again, given that the value was the same after it had been strip mined, whether it was covered with grass or not.|$|R
2500|$|Another type of {{fractional}} ownership, {{not part}} of a securitized business plan is Tenancy in Common, which is grounded in the real property laws of most, if not all states. The main difference is <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> of survivorship to the sponsor or other owners if one or more of owners were to pass away. Where there are similarities with the equal sharing of operational expenses, rental income and access, the striking difference is free transferability of the owner's interest in the property without regard to the other owners in the property.|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, {{taxpayers have}} argued that section 6702, the [...] "frivolous {{argument}}" [...] penalty statute, is itself unconstitutional. That argument was rejected in Hazewinkel v. United States (taxpayer's arguments—that sections 6702 and 6703 violate both procedural and substantive due process because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to a prior hearing, and that the word [...] "frivolous" [...] is unconstitutionally vague—were rejected). See also Pillsbury v. Commissioner, {{a case in which}} taxpayer Leecil Pillsbury's argument—that section 6702 violates the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause of the Constitution—was ruled to be without merit.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S., {{an accused}} person is {{entitled}} to a government-paid defense attorney {{if he or she}} is in jeopardy of losing his or her life and/or liberty. Those who cannot afford a private attorney may be provided one by the state. [...] Historically, however, the right to a defense attorney has not always been universal. [...] For example, in Tudor England criminals accused of treason were not permitted to offer arguments in their defense. [...] In many jurisdictions, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to an appointed attorney, if the accused is not in jeopardy of losing his or her liberty.|$|E

In a statement issued the next day, UCI Chancellor Drake called the students' behavior [...] "intolerable," [...] saying that [...] "Freedom of speech {{is among the most}} fundamental, and among the most cherished of the bedrock values our nation is built upon." [...] UCI Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky also condemned the disruptions. He stated, [...] "Imagine if they had brought their own speaker and that person had been shouted down. There would be no free speech. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to a 'heckler's veto.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Even if {{benefits}} are improperly denied, {{the insurance company}} cannot be sued for any resulting injury or wrongful death, {{regardless of whether it}} acted in bad faith in denying benefits. [...] Insurers operating ERISA plans enjoy several immunities not available to other types of insurance companies. [...] ERISA preempts all conflicting state laws, including state statutes prohibiting unfair claims practices and causes of action arising under state common law for insurance bad faith. [...] <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> to a jury trial in ERISA benefits actions. Although Americans normally take for granted the right to testify on their behalf, plaintiffs have no right to present live testimony in ERISA bench trials, in which the judge simply reads through the documents that formed the record originally before the ERISA plan administrator and performs de novo review. [...] Finally, punitive damages are not allowed in actions for ERISA benefits.|$|E
