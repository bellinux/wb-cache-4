40|$|International audienceProviding {{students}} with appropriate additional <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> a <b>course</b> (i. e., readings) requires cognitively demanding human activity. Moreover, {{the content of}} such readings might not be adequate to the ongoing student understanding of the course. Systems that provide such readings are either traditional hypertexts using links designed by hand, or adaptive hypertexts using a sophisticated model of the student. The method described here uses LSA, a statistical procedure devoted to the semantic comparison of texts. The method mimics some characteristics of human discourse understanding through a simplified version of the Construction-Integration model. This method thus retrieves <b>course</b> readings <b>from</b> the web that {{take into account the}} ongoing comprehension of the course by the student...|$|R

Soft computing technologies offer adaptability as a characteristic feature and thus permit the tracking {{of a problem}} through a changing environment. Besides some recent developments in areas like rough sets and probabilistic networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary algorithms, and artificial neural networks are core ingredients of soft computing, which are all bio-inspired and can easily be combined synergetically. This book presents a well-balanced integration of fuzzy logic, evolutionary computing, and neural information processing. The three constituents are introduced to the reader systematically and brought together in differentiated combinations step by step.

40|$|Abstract Assessing free-text responses, like essays, is a {{demanding}} task {{even for a}} human. To reduce the costs of essay grading, methods to automate the assessment process have been developed. Approaches based on surface features and content have been introduced. We present a method for evaluating the content of essays based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which was originally developed for information retrieval and has successfully been applied for assessment of essays in several applications. We use LSA to compare the conceptual similarity between the essays and selected <b>text</b> passages <b>from</b> the <b>course</b> material covering the essay assignment-specific subject matter. In our experiment {{the correlation between the}} scores given by the system and human grader varied from 0. 78 to 0. 82...|$|R

Course description This course {{will focus on the}} importance that risk management strategies have gained {{in the criminal justice system}} during the last three decades. Major themes will include the following: the emergence of the risk society; the spreading phenomena of the fear of crime in modern society and its impact on criminal policy; the social construction of crime as a risk instead of a moral transgression; the use of actuarial and statistical tools in the field of criminal justice and corrections. The main objectives of the course are: 1. To provide a contextualized understanding of the social, cultural, political and economic implications of risks and risk technologies in society in general; 2. To review and analyze the place that risk management occupies in the field of criminal justice. Course format The course will combine lectures from the professor, student presentations, and class discussions using the <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> the <b>Course</b> Reader. This is a seminar class, and as such students are expected to arrive in class prepared to participate to discussions. Students should prepare for each class by carefully reading the required material in advance. Course materials A Course Reader is available at Rytec Printing, 404 Dalhousie Street.

40|$|Master's thesis in Literacy StudiesThis {{thesis is}} a study of a Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) project in a 9 th grade Norwegian EFL class. History, namely the Second World War from the {{perspective}} of young people’s experiences, was taught with English as the language of instruction. CLIL is a content-driven approach where the main emphasis is on using a different language than the mother tongue as a tool for teaching and learning about another subject; the focus is on meaning and not the forms of language. CLIL creates a dual benefit of developing both language and content knowledge. The thesis aimed to investigate the teacher’s motives for initiating the project, the pupils’ and teacher’s expectations, experiences and challenges, and how the project benefited the pupils. It is a case study based on multiple methods. Two pupil questionnaires were used, one in the initial stage of the project and one after the project had ended. Thirteen lessons were observed, including observing the pupils giving oral presentations on topics they had been working on connected to the overall theme. The presentations were recorded and transcribed. In addition, the teacher was interviewed both before the project started and after it had ended and five pupils were also interviewed {{at the end of the}} project. One of the main findings was that the teacher played a central role. The project was implemented on the teacher’s initiative and interest in the topic and her view that textbook-based teaching was too limited. Finding and assessing appropriate materials for a mixed ability class was a major challenge. These included extracts from books written for native-speakers, <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> <b>course</b> books for the age group, and films on the subject. The teacher experienced the project to be generally rewarding for her and beneficial for the pupils. The pupils’ expectations and experiences were mainly positive. For most of the pupils, learning about WWII in English was not regarded as difficult in general, although some of the texts were regarded as difficult. The pupils were mostly focused on the subject matter and not the fact that they were using English to learn about it. The use of films and activities related to them were what they liked most, while giving oral presentations, reading and writing were less popular activities. The project promoted communicative engagement in classroom discussions. Vocabulary connected to the topic was one of the areas in which the pupils developed their language, but most of them did not feel that they had developed their language in other ways. CLIL has primarily been used at the upper secondary level in Norway. This study has shown that CLIL also has a potential with young Norwegian EFL learners...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of rectifiable sets through {{the existence of}} densities is a pearl of geometric measure theory. The difficult proof, due to Preiss, relies on many beautiful and deep ideas and novel techniques. Some of them have already proven useful in other contexts, whereas others {{have not yet been}} exploited. These notes give a simple and short presentation of the former and provide some perspective of the latter. This <b>text</b> emerged <b>from</b> a <b>course</b> on rectifiability given at the University of Zürich. It is addressed both to researchers and students; the only prerequisite is a solid knowledge in standard measure theory. The first four chapters give an introduction to rectifiable sets and measures in Euclidean spaces, covering classical topics such as the area formula, the theorem of Marstrand and the most elementary rectifiability criterions. The fifth chapter is dedicated to a subtle rectifiability criterion due to Marstrand and generalized by Mattila, and the last three focus on Preiss' result. The aim is to provide a self-contained reference for anyone interested in an overview of this fascinating topic...|$|R
40|$|Neste artigo, pretendemos demonstrar parte dos resultados obtidos em dissertação de mestrado defendida em 2010, na qual foram analisadas as atividades didáticas de textos argumentativos escritos da coleção Português: Linguagens, destinada ao ensino médio. O objetivo é analisar como essa obra didática ensina a produzir textos argumentativos escritos. Em diálogo com os resultados, propomos um encaminhamento teórico-metodológico para o ensino da escrita argumentativa, na perspectiva dialógica, tendo como recorte a atividade didática O artigo de opinião e a perspectiva da construção de sentidos por parte do aluno. Considerando, a partir da análise, que as questões apresentadas na sequência não possibilitam ao aluno vivenciar as práticas sociais da escrita argumentativa, a sugestão didática aqui proposta procura interligar procedimentos de leitura e de interpretação com os conhecimentos necessários para a produção de textos argumentativos, de forma a possibilitar o estudo da língua na totalidade do enunciado. In this article, {{we intend}} to show part of the results {{obtained}} in the present author’s Master’s thesis, defended in 2010, in which the didactic activities of the argumentative <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> the <b>course</b> book series Português: Linguagens, for high school education, were analyzed. The objective is to analyze how this course book teaches the production of written argumentative texts. Dialoguing with the results, we propose a theoretical-methodological approach to teach argumentative writing, in the dialogic perspective, having as an excerpt the didactic activity Opinion Article (O artigo de opinião) and the perspective of building meanings by the students. Taking into account that, from the analysis, the questions presented in the course book sequence do not allow the student to live the social practices of argumentative writing, the didactic suggestion here proposed tries to link reading and interpretation procedures with the necessary knowledge {{for the production of}} argumentative texts, so as to make it possible the study of a language in the totality of the utterance...|$|R
40|$|This book {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the mathematical theory of disorder effects on quantum spectra and dynamics. Topics covered range from the basic theory of spectra and dynamics of self-adjoint operators through Anderson localization-presented here via the fractional moment method, up to recent results on resonant delocalization. The subject's multifaceted presentation is organized into seventeen chapters, each focused on either a specific mathematical topic or on a demonstration of the theory's relevance to physics, e. g., its implications for the quantum Hall effect. The mathematical chapters include general relations of quantum spectra and dynamics, ergodicity and its implications, methods for establishing spectral and dynamical localization regimes, applications and properties of the Green function, its relation to the eigenfunction correlator, fractional moments of Herglotz-Pick functions, the phase diagram for tree graph operators, resonant delocalization, the spectral statistics conjecture, and related results. The <b>text</b> incorporates notes <b>from</b> <b>courses</b> that were presented at the authors' respective institutions and attended by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. It has been almost 25 years since the last major book on this subject. The authors masterfully update the subject but more importantly present their own probabilistic insights in clear fashion. This wonderful book is ideal for both researchers and advanced students. -Barry Simon, California Institute of Technology...|$|R

The sample of the study consists of two classes of English reading comprehension  Course, Level one with 60 EFL students, 30 in the control group and 30 in the experimental group. Those students were belonging to the Department of English Language and Literature. The researchers choose the reading <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> reading comprehension <b>course</b> which was published by Macmillan Education LTD, intermediate level (2001). The researchers construct a multiple-choice reading comprehension test to assess the students reading comprehension.

The results reveal that the scores of the experimental group on the post-test were significantly higher than those of the control group. These results prove that teaching on the basis of the Swains’ push out hypothesis was successful to develop the students’ reading comprehension as well as their performance...|$|R
