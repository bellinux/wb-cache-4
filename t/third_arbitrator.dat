5000|$|On {{the death}} of Seoán Ó Raghillaigh II, the Bishop of Kilmore, in 1476, Cormac Mác Shamhradháin was {{appointed}} as the new bishop on 4 November 1476 by Pope Sixtus IV.On the same date the Pope gave him a dispensation for his illegitimacy. Due to the small revenues of the diocese, Cormac was also allowed to retain his office of Prior of Drumlane. On 6 November 1476 Cormac was licensed to be consecrated as bishop by whichever bishops he chose. [...] However immediate objections were raised to his appointment (perhaps {{because of the fact}} that he was illegitimate), which resulted in a schism which would disrupt the Diocese of Kilmore for the next 35 years. When the Archbishop of Armagh Ottaviano Spinelli de Palatio held his first Provincial Council at Drogheda in July 1480, neither Cormac nor his rival and successor Tomás Mac Brádaigh was present at the Council. As a result of the objections, Cormac’s appointment as Bishop of Kilmore was revoked on 20 October 1480 and Tomás Mac Brádaigh, the Archdeacon of Kilmore, was appointed as the new bishop by Pope Sixtus IV. The Pope of course had already given Cormac dispensation for his illegitimacy when appointed bishop so the decision may best be viewed as a political struggle between the Lords of West Kilmore, the O’Rourkes, who backed the candidacy of their client sept of the McGoverns against the Lords of East Kilmore, the O’Reillys, who backed their client sept of the Bradys for the bishopric. Cormac however did not accept the decision and appealed the matter on several occasions and still asserted himself as Bishop of Kilmore at his death in December 1511. On 25 November 1482 Primate Octavian arranged a meeting between the two rivals at Inismor in Lough Gowna in order to come to a settlement. At the meeting, in return for certain payments from Tomás Mac Brádaigh, Cormac undertook to renounce all his emoluments from the two rural deaneries of Drumlane and Rossinver Dartry and also to refrain from seeking any further apostolic letters against the new bishop and to abide by the pledges given on his behalf by any nobles or poets. In the document Cormac is referred to as Prior of Drumlane. On 21 November 1483 the Consistorial Archives refer to Cormac as Electus Kilmorensis which probably meant Cormac was regarded as the Deputy Bishop of Kilmore with some rights, perhaps being in charge of the Breifne O’Rourke part of the Diocese from Drumlane westwards. The confusion about who was bishop was still ongoing in 1487 where the preface to the Thebaid of Statius stated- [...] "This book was written a.d. 1487… and at the same period there were two bishops in the bishopric of Kilmore, to wit, Cormac, son of the bishop Magauran, and Thomas son of Andrew MacBrady, each one of them alleging that he himself is bishop there."An attempt to resolve the impasse was made at the Provincial Council of Armagh held in 1489 at St. Mary’s Church, Ardee, County Louth under the presidency of Dr. John Payne, Bishop of Meath. The Council appointed said Dr. Payne together with Bishop Uilliam Ó Fearghail of Ardagh to look into the matter. These two bishops met and co-opted the new bishop of Clogher John Edmund de Courcy as a <b>third</b> <b>arbitrator.</b> Their decision was that they [...] "adjudged the rule, administration and property of said church to said Thomas, and the proceedings regarding them of said Cormac they declared to be rash, unlawful and de facto presumptuous, and imposed on Cormac perpetual silence, which sentence not having been appealed against, in rem transivit indicatam". However that Cormac refused to take this decision lying down is evident from his attendance at the Provincial Synod of 1492 and the attendance at the Synod of Drogheda on 6 July 1495 of both Cormac and Thomas where they were styled as- [...] "Thomas et Cormac gratia divina Kilmorensis Episcopi" [...] (Tomás and Cormac, by the grace of God, Bishops of Kilmore). [...] and [...] No records of attendance survive for the subsequent Provincial Councils of 1498 and 1501. At those of 1504 and 1507, Cormac was absent but Tomás Mac Brádaigh was present.|$|E

40|$|The Chaco War (1932 - 1935) was {{a border}} war fought between Bolivia and Paraguay over the Chaco Boreal, a {{vast expanse of}} land in the centre of South America that was (and still is) {{traditional}} indigenous territory. This thesis analyzes a document published by the League of Nations on the conflict, The Report of the League of Nations Commission on the Chaco Dispute Between Bolivia and Paraguay, from the perspective of critical border studies. The League of Nations considered itself a disinterested <b>third</b> party <b>arbitrator</b> in the dispute. The central argument of this thesis is that the League was not a disinterested party and that its Report on the Chaco War is not a neutral retelling of the events of the Chaco War. Rather, the League’s Report is an expression of dominant Western border-making practices and exemplifies {{the way in which the}} border discourses of the interwar period failed to recognize indigenous sovereignty with respect to land, law and custom. This thesis therefore inquires into the relationship between borders and spatial imaginaries as embedded in three discourses of indigenous dispossession: the doctrine of just war, the legal principle of uti possidetis de jure and the legal concept of terra nullius. The work of Carl Schmitt is used to highlight the links between these border-making discourses and indigenous dispossession. Schmitt’s concept of the nomos is discussed in relation to the spatial order of the League of Nations and its attempts to uphold the Westphalian paradigm of international law while simultaneously claiming to be a humanitarian institution...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} measure the impact of monopsony power on baseball players with less than six years of experience. Past research indicates that players with less than six years of experience have lower salaries than players with the same productivity and {{more than six years}} of experience. To try and combat monopsonistic behavior, baseball player 2 ̆ 7 s formed the Players 2 ̆ 7 Union and instituted an arbitration process. Through this process, a <b>third</b> party <b>arbitrator</b> listens to cases from both a player and owner and then chooses either the player 2 ̆ 7 s or the owner 2 ̆ 7 s salary bid. While this process is intended to help players gain market power, it is still unclear whether the actual process is effective. Therefore, it is important to evaluate trends in players 2 ̆ 7 salaries before, during, and after arbitration in order to see if further changes in the arbitration process need to be made. To do this, 19 outfielders who have filed for and received an arbitration hearing during the time frame of 1990 - 2003 are examined following their career throughout their pre-arbitration (first three years), arbitration year (after third year), and post-arbitration years (after fourth year on). By using the human capital model, three ratios of the players 2 ̆ 7 actual salaries during these years to a predicted free agent salary are estimated. The prediction that the ratios should increase throughout these three periods, {{due to the fact that}} the players gain more market power, is supported by the results. In fact, the ratios of actual to predicted salary increase from 0. 27 in pre-arbitration years, to 0. 97 in the arbitration year, to over 1. 2 in post-arbitration years. This indicates that the players face substantial monopsony power in the pre-arbitration year followed by a decrease in monopsony power through the arbitration process and post-arbitration years...|$|R
40|$|An optimistic fair {{exchange}} (OFE) protocol is {{an effective}} tool helping two parties exchange their digital items in an equitable way with assistance of a trusted <b>third</b> party, called <b>arbitrator,</b> who is only required if needed. In previous studies, fair exchange is usually carried out between individual parties. When fair exchange is carried our between two members from distinct groups, anonymity of the signer in a group could be necessary for achieving better privacy. In this paper, we consider optimistic fair exchange of ring signatures (OFERS), i. e. two members from two different groups can exchange their ring signatures in a fair way with ambiguous signers. Each user in these groups has its own public-private key pair {{and is able to}} sign a message on behalf of its own group anonymously. We first define the security model of OFFERS in the multi-user setting under adaptive chosen message, chosen-key and chosen public-key attacks. Then, based on verifiable encrypted ring signatures (VERS) we construct a concrete scheme by combining the technologies of ring signatures, public-key encryption and proof of knowledge. Finally, we show that our OFERS solution is provably secure in our security model, and preserving signer-ambiguity of ring signatures.

40|$|Fifteen years ago, {{sociologist}} Yves Dezalay {{and lawyer}} Bryant Garth wrote an enormously successful {{book in which}} they asked a simple but important question: What sort of people become successful arbitrators? The main result of their research was to identify two quite different generations of arbitrators. The first they called the ‘Grand Old Men'. They were people who had risen {{to the top of}} their national legal professions, but had not specialized in the field of arbitration; men whose general legal and social aura made them credible arbitrators. The second generation, which prevailed at the time of Dezalay and Garth's study, were assigned the name of ‘Technocrats', in the sense of technical experts. Successful arbitrators of that generation typically acquired their credentials through activities in the field of international arbitration. They usually had a career almost entirely dedicated to arbitration. Now, how have things changed in the last fifteen years? This is the question this article seeks to address.

50|$|In {{preparation}} for a United States census in 1830, the Maine Legislature sent John Deane and Edward James to the disputed area to document the numbers of inhabitants and to assess the extent of what they considered to be British trespass. During that summer, several residents {{of the west bank}} of the Saint John at Madawaska filed requests for inclusion of their land in Maine. Acting on advice from Penobscot County, Maine, officials, they called a meeting to select representatives preparatory to incorporating Madawaska as a town. A local resident from the east bank of the Saint John river alerted local representatives of the New Brunswick militia, who entered the hall during one of these meetings and threatened to arrest any resident attempting to organize. The meetings continued, however, even as more militiamen arrived. New Brunswick authorities arrested some residents, others fled to the woods, and local Americans sent letters to the Maine authorities in Augusta.

40|$|Online dispute {{resolution}} can be roughly categorised in into online negotiation, online mediation, and online arbitration. Online negotiation means direct {{communication between the}} parties via electronic means. Online mediation involves a neutral third party communicating with and between the parties by online means to facilitate negotiation and encourage the parties to reach a settlement. Online arbitration involves a neutral <b>third</b> party, the <b>arbitrator,</b> with the competence to hear the arguments of the parties and {{make a decision on}} the merits of the dispute. In online arbitration process, submission of documents, text-based hearings, and live hearings may be carried out via electronic communication over the internet. In ODR processes, certain principles have to be followed. The neutrals must be impartial and independent. The ODR services must be affordable for the parties. The {{dispute resolution}} process must be transparent. The proceedings must be fair. As far as effectiveness is concerned, the dispute resolution process should not be protracted beyond a reasonable period of time, and the result must be implemented effectively. In Taiwan, ODR can serve as an alternative to civil proceedings to avoid complicated legal issues and enhance consumer confidence. The Taiwanese laws do not prohibit the conducting of ADR processes over the internet. The legal status of electronic signature and electronic document in ODR proceedings is also recognised.

40|$|Arbitration is {{a method}} of private, binding and {{enforceable}} dispute resolution. A neutral <b>third</b> party called <b>arbitrator</b> renders an award after hearing testimony and argument from each party. Therefore, the qualification of the arbitrator is important to render a valid award. Under the Arbitration Act 1952, there are circumstances that can cause award to be set aside. The Arbitration Act 1952 had clearly expressed that arbitral award may be set aside when the arbitrator has misconducted himself or the proceedings. However, the Act does not provide any definition {{on the meaning of}} arbitrator?s misconduct. Hence, this research intends to identify the judicial interpretations of arbitrator?s misconduct in arbitration proceedings. This research was carried out mainly through documentary analysis of relevant case reported in law journals. The analysis showed that there were five main judicial interpretations on arbitrator?s misconduct which included breach of the rules of natural justice, failure to consider all matters referred to by the parties, ignored the condition in the contract, bias, and contravention of the rules of evidence. There are many interpretations on arbitrator?s misconduct in arbitration proceedings. Most of the cases interpreted arbitrator?s misconduct more to his wrongful behaviour, action and the way he conduct the proceedings. Therefore, there is absolutely no easy answer. The arbitrator would be wise to remember that they must always conduct the proceeding in a proper manner...|$|R
40|$|How {{to sign an}} {{electronic}} contract online between two parties (say Alice and Bob) in a fair manner is an interesting problem, and has been studied for a long time. Optimistic Fair Exchange (OFE) is an efficient solution to this problem, in which a semi-trusted <b>third</b> party named <b>arbitrator</b> is called in to resolve a dispute {{if there is one}} during an exchange between Alice and Bob. Recently, several extensions of OFE, such as Ambiguous OFE (AOFE) and Perfect AOFE (PAOFE), have been proposed to protect the privacy of the exchanging parties. These variants prevent any outsider including the arbitrator from telling which parties are involved in the exchange of signatures before the exchange completes. However, in PAOFE, AOFE, and all the current work on OFE, the arbitrator can always learn the signer 2 ̆ 7 s signature at (or before) the end of a resolution, which is undesirable in some important applications, for example, signing a contract between two parties which do not wish others to find out even when there is a dispute that needs a resolution by the arbitrator. In this work, we introduce a new notion called Privacy- Preserving Optimistic Fair Exchange (P 2 OFE), in which other than Alice and Bob, no one else, including the arbitrator, can collect any evidence about an exchange between them even after the resolution of a dispute. We formally define P 2 OFE and propose a security model. We also propose a concrete and efficient construction of P 2 OFE, and prove its security based on the Strong Diffie-Helllman and Decision Linear assumptions in the standard model...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem to}} allow two parties (say Alice and Bob) {{to sign an}} {{electronic}} contract online fairly is an interesting problem {{and it has been}} studied for a long time. Optimistic fair exchange (OFE) is an efficient remedy to this problem, which incorporates a semi-trusted <b>third</b> party called <b>arbitrator,</b> who will be called in to resolve a dispute during an exchange between Alice and Bob. It {{should be noted that the}} arbitrator is not required to be fully trusted, or else such an entity may not be available in practice. To reduce the trust level of the arbitrator, the requirement that the arbitrator should not be able to produce a full signature without the signer 2 ̆ 7 s content has been proposed in literature. Nevertheless, we observe that the existing OFE models do not capture the realistic situation that the arbitrator itself should not be able to generate a partial signature on a new message. This requirement is essential since we only put a partial trust towards the arbitrator, but on the other hand, we also assume that the arbitrator will not do such a forgery. Therefore, to reflect this situation, we propose an enhanced model of OFE that explicitly captures this requirement. We demonstrate the difference between our enhanced model and the existing chosen-key model through a concrete OFE scheme that serves as a counter example. Since our model is strictly stronger than the existing model, we investigate the security of the existing schemes in our enhanced model. Interestingly, we show that OFE schemes based on verifiably encrypted signature and those based on ring signature can remain secure in our enhanced model given slight modifications to the primitives...|$|R
40|$|Third {{parties are}} {{very common in}} modern cryptography, both in {{symmetric}} cryptographic applications (e. g., a key distribution protocol and a non-repudiation protocol) and public key cryptographic systems (e. g., the certi cate authority and the private key generator in identity-based cryptography). A widely used approach is to assume that a third party has {{a certain level of}} trust, but is not fully trusted. In this thesis, we present several new results about cryptosystems, which do not require any fully trusted third party. We provide detailed schemes and security analysis on server-aided veri cation signatures, certi cate-based signatures and encryption, and optimistic fair exchange. The computational cost required by cryptographic protocols is a signi cant burden to power-constrained devices such as smart cards and mobile terminals. Serveraided computation is a promising solution to mitigate this issue by employing a powerful server to carry out costly cryptographic computation. Such techniques require an additional care since servers cannot be fully trusted. In this thesis, we investigate the issues of server-aided veri cation signatures, i. e., using server(s) to assist signature veri cation. Several notions in digital signatures with server-aided veri cation are formally de ned, based on di erent trust levels of the server. As instances, we provide server-aided veri cation protocols for Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature (with the random oracle assumption) and Waters signature (without the random oracle assumption). As cryptographic primitives, certi cate-based public key cryptography (CB-PKC) and certi cateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) are used to ease certi cate management and solve key escrow problems due to the trust third party in identitybased public key cryptography. As one of features, the signature veri cation (resp. encryption) does not require public key authenticity check. In this thesis, we {{take a closer look at}} the relationship between certi cateless cryptosystem and certi catebased cryptosystem, present the security de nitions of certi cate-based signatures and certi cate-based encryption, and provide generic constructions of certi catebased signatures from certi cateless signatures and certi cate-based encryption from certi cateless encryption, respectively. The proposed generic constructions are proven to be secure in the random oracle model. An off-line trusted <b>third</b> party (<b>arbitrator)</b> plays an important role in optimistic fair exchange (OFE), which allows two parties to exchange their digital items in a fair way. As one of the fundamental problems in secure electronic business and digital rights management, OFE has been studied intensively since its introduction. This thesis introduces and de nes a new property for OFE: Strong Resolution- Ambiguity. We show that many existing OFE protocols have the new property, but its formal investigation has been missing in those protocols. We prove that in the certi ed-key model, an OFE protocol is secure in the multi-user setting if it is secure in the single-user setting and has the property of strong resolutionambiguity. An OFE protocol has the property of strong resolution-ambiguity if one can transform a partial signature σʹ into a full signature σʹ using signer 2 ̆ 7 s private key or arbitrator 2 ̆ 7 s private key, and given such a pair (σʹσ), it is infeasible to tell which key is used in the conversion. Our result not only simpli es the security analysis of OFE protocols in the multi-user setting but also provides a new approach for the design of multi-user secure OFE protocols. In addition, a new OFE protocol with strong resolution-ambiguity is proposed. Our analysis shows that the protocol is setup-free, stand-alone and multi-user secure without the random oracle assumption...|$|R
