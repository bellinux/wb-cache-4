50|$|To {{secure the}} shaft and housing of the {{steering}} column in place during normal driving conditions, a <b>tolerance</b> <b>ring</b> is fitted between the two parts. The <b>tolerance</b> <b>ring</b> is designed to axially slip at a predetermined torque level, enabling the shaft to slide inside its housing in a crash, absorbing impact energy to protect the driver.|$|E
50|$|A common {{device to}} enhance car safety is the {{collapsible}} steering column. This {{is designed to}} collapse {{in the event of}} a collision to protect the driver from harm. The column can collapse after impact with a <b>tolerance</b> <b>ring</b> inserted between the inner shaft of the steering column and the external housing. The wavelike protrusions on the circumference of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>ring</b> act as a spring to hold the two parts in place in normal driving conditions. At a specific level of force, for example {{in the event of a}} collision, the <b>tolerance</b> <b>ring</b> allows the inner shaft to slip inside the housing, so the column can collapse, absorbing energy from the impact.|$|E

50|$|In {{most modern}} Electric Power Steering (EPS) systems, the motor housing {{is a part}} of the rack casting which is usually made from {{lightweight}} materials, such as aluminum alloys. The stators are traditionally press fitted into the housing. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>rings</b> can be used instead of press fitting. With their wavelike protrusions, <b>tolerance</b> <b>rings</b> generate a retention force when compressed between the housing and the stator. These protrusions act as springs and allow the mating components to expand and contract at different rates while still providing the required retention force.|$|R
50|$|This is an {{electric}} motor to automate the opening and closing of the car trunk door. When the trunk door lowers, if a sensor detects an obstruction such as a bag or hand, it will signal the motor to stop. The <b>tolerance</b> <b>ring</b> protects the motor and gearing from excessive force, acting as a clutch. If the trunk is subjected to a force opposite to the motion (i.e. when someone is manually opening the trunk when it is automatically closing), the <b>tolerance</b> <b>ring</b> will allow the components to slip against each other, at certain torque levels. This protects the other components in the trunk mechanism.|$|E
50|$|This is the {{stationary}} {{part of the}} motor. The <b>tolerance</b> <b>ring</b> is used to secure the stator within the frame. It acts as a cushion when the AC motor is in operation to absorb vibration for noise-free AC performance.|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure the}} armrest stays in place {{when it is}} stowed away by the {{passenger}} and does not fall down when the car travels over rough terrain, a <b>tolerance</b> <b>ring</b> is used at the pivot.

50|$|<b>Tolerance</b> <b>Rings</b> are {{radially}} sprung rings {{that are}} press fitted between two mating components {{to act as}} frictional fasteners. They are flexible shims designed to fix two cylindrical parts together. The wavelike protrusions that run around the circumference of the ring generate a retention force to provide an optimal fit between the two mating components {{without the need for}} adhesive or excessive assembly force, simplifying the process for manufacturers. They allow for any misalignment caused by thermal expansion or excessive vibration. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>rings</b> can be used as bearing mounts and as a means of dealing with torque transfer, torque overload protection and axial slip between mating components. They are often used to isolate undesirable vibration in engines and electric motors, for noise-free mechanism operation in passenger vehicles and domestic appliances, where noise reduction has become a major trend in recent years. Modifications to <b>tolerance</b> <b>rings</b> can be made to tune the dynamic stiffness and, therefore, the frequencies that can be isolated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tolerance</b> <b>rings</b> {{can be used}} to {{eliminate}} noise completely, simply by taking up clearance between mating components, which could otherwise lead to rattling in the system as the parts are not completely constrained.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tolerance</b> <b>rings</b> {{are used}} as an {{electric}} motor stator mount in electric power steering (EPS) to protect the system from torque overload {{in the event of}} back-driven shocks through the steering system. They do this by allowing the drive shaft to slip inside the gear so the gear teeth are not damaged, which strengthens the longevity of the EPS system.|$|R
40|$|Salt {{stress is}} a {{detrimental}} factor for plant growth and development. The response to salt stress {{has been shown}} to involve components in the intracellular trafficking system, as well as components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In this article, we have identified in Arabidopsis thaliana a little reported ubiquitin ligase involved in salt stress response, which we named STRF 1 (Salt <b>Tolerance</b> <b>RING</b> Finger 1). STRF 1 is a member of RING-H 2 finger proteins and we demonstrate that it has ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. We also show that STRF 1 localizes mainly at the plasma membrane and at the intracellular endosomes. strf 1 - 1 loss of function mutant seedlings exhibit accelerated endocytosis in roots, and have altered expression of several genes involved in the membrane trafficking system. Moreover, protein trafficking inhibitor, BFA treatment has increased BFA bodies in strf 1 - 1 mutant. This mutant also showed increased tolerance to salt, ionic and osmotic stresses, reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species during salt stress, and increased expression of AtRbohD, which encodes a NADPH oxidase involved in H 2 O 2 production. We conclude that STRF 1 is a membrane trafficking-related ubiquitin ligase, which helps the plant to respond to salt stress by monitoring intracellular membrane trafficking and ROS productio...|$|E

40|$|Tolerance range {{selection}} of topologically optimized structures {{with the effects}} of uncertainties of manufacturing process Arshad Javed and BK Rout Robust design methods for topology optimization have received significant attention from researchers in recent years. There are various attempts in past to handle the manufacturing uncertainty of the topologically optimized components. In the present work, same issue is dealt by introducing a method of probabilistic distribution of material. Here, help from Karhunenâ€“Loeve expansion of stochastic process, coupled with Monte Carlo method is taken. The proposed method retains the uncertainty characteristic of the specific manufacturing processes such as etching, e-beam lithography, laser micro machining, and milling. Hence, this method offers larger flexibility to the designer. The simulation for manufactur-ing uncertainty is utilized to determine the optimal tolerance range of the factors for robust and targeted performance, which is almost nonexistent in the literature. The methodology for tolerance range selection is capable to incorporate uncertainty of multiple factors simultaneously. In this method cross array design of experiment approach is used to analyze the effect of tolerance of each factor.

50|$|Their {{lightweight}} properties {{have also}} made <b>tolerance</b> <b>rings</b> attractive to automotive manufacturers as they seek to enhance car performance while complying with government requirements for reductions in carbon emissions. In the European Union, regulations on car emissions have been introduced by the European Commission, restricting {{the amount of carbon}} dioxide (CO2) emissions that a car can emit. Since 2015, EU law requires that new cars do not emit more than 130 grams per kilometer of carbon dioxide (CO2). If that limit is breached then manufacturers can face fines. From 2021 the new mandatory emission target will be a fleet average of 95 grams per kilometer. China is beginning to introduce legislation to create a National Standard, based on carbon emission reduction regulations already in effect in Europe. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires automotive companies to average carbon dioxide (CO2) tailpipe emissions at 101 grams per kilometer (163 grams/mile) by model year 2025. These regulations require car manufacturers to reduce the weight of their engines and vehicles to enhance fuel efficiency. According to the EPA estimations, every 10 per cent drop in car mass decreases fuel use between 5 and 10 per cent.|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} produce {{precision}} ring shaped parts using the turning process depends significantly on the workholding characteristics. Workholding parameters such {{as the number of}} jaws and chucking force are known to influence the roundness <b>tolerance</b> of <b>ring</b> shaped parts commonly used in bearing applications. Experimental trial and error methods are often used in practice to optimize the workholding parameters to achieve the desired part quality. This thesis develops a systematic mathematical approach for optimizing these parameters using a finished cut roundness prediction model and a model for determining the reaction force between the chuck jaws and the ring. The roundness prediction model is verified through experiments for different cutting conditions. The optimization approach takes as input the required roundness tolerance, geometry and mechanical properties of the ring, cutting forces, and the coefficient of friction between the jaws and the ring. The output consists of the minimum number of jaws and the range of acceptable chucking forces that satisfy the required tolerance while preventing slip of the ring. Simulation examples are used to illustrate the proposed workholding optimization approach for a hard turning application. In addition, based on the optimization model, the thesis proposes a novel concept of dynamic chucking force control that promises to yield part roundness that is superior to conventional chucking. M.

50|$|In {{regions that}} use the US Letter paper format by 11 inches (215 by 280 mm); United States, Canada, and in part Mexico and the Philippines), a three-hole {{standard}} is widely used. The holes are positioned symmetrically, with the centers 4.25 in apart. The diameter of the holes varies between manufacturers, with typical values being 1/4 to 5/16 in. The 5/16 value is most commonly used, as it allows for looser <b>tolerances</b> in both <b>ring</b> binder and paper punching. The distance of the hole center to the paper edge also varies, with 1/2 in being a typical value. Unlike ISO 838, this 3-hole system appears to have no well-established official specification, and is a de facto standard established by custom and tradition.

In this parameter regime the dominant emittance growth mechanism is intra-beam scattering. Intense synchrotron radiation damping from wigglers is required to counteract its effect. Here the overall optimization of the wiggler parameters is described, taking into account state-of-the-art wiggler technologies, wiggler effects on dynamic aperture, and problems of wiggler radiation absorption. Two technical solutions, one based on superconducting magnet technology the other on permanent magnets are presented. Although dynamic aperture and <b>tolerances</b> of this <b>ring</b> design remain challenging, benefits are obtained from the strong damping.

5000|$|The {{glass master}} is rotated in the {{electroforming}} tank while a pump circulates the electroforming solution {{over the surface}} of the master. As the electroforming progresses, nickel is not electroplated onto the surface of the glass master, since that would preclude separation. Plating is rather eschewed through passivation and, initially, because the glass is not electroconductive. Instead, the metal coating on the glass disc, actually reverse-plates onto the nickel (not the mandrel) which is being electrodeposited by the attraction of the electrons on the cathode, which presents itself as the metal-coated glass mistress, or, premaster mandrel. Electroplating, on the other hand, would have entailed electrodepostion directly to the mandrel along with the intention of it staying adhered. That, and the more rigorous requirements of temperature control and purity of bathwater, are the main differences between the two disciplines of electrodeposition (invented by Luigi Brugnatelli and often credited to another Luigi - Sr. Galvani). The metal stamper first struck from the metal-coated glass is the metal master (and we shouldn't make a master from another master as that would not follow the nomenclature of the sequence of siring that is germane to electroforming) This is clearly a method opposite to normal electroplating. Another difference to electroplating is that the internal stress of the nickel must be controlled carefully, or the nickel stamper will not be flat. The solution cleanliness is important but is achieved by continuous filtration and usual anode bagging systems. Another large difference is that the stamper thickness must be controlled to Â±2% of the final thickness so that it will fit on the injection moulding machines with very high <b>tolerances</b> of gassing <b>rings</b> and centre clamps. This thickness control requires electronic current control and baffles in the solution to control distribution ...|$|R
40|$|Self-assembling {{materials}} have gained {{attention in the}} field of nanotechnology due to their potential to be used as building blocks for fabricating complex nanoscale devices. The biological world is abundant with examples of functional self-assembling biomolecules. Proteins are one such example, found in a variety of geometries and shapes. This research is focussed on the use of ring-shaped self-assembling proteins, called Lsm proteins, as componentary for applications in bionanotechnology. Lsm proteins were used because of their spontaneous association into stable <b>rings,</b> <b>tolerance</b> to mutations, and affinity to RNA. This thesis primarily focussed on the thermophilic LsmÎ± (from Methanobacterium. thermoautotrophicum) that assembles as heptameric rings. The oligomeric state of the heptameric protein, and hence the diameter of its central cavity, was manipulated by judiciously altering appropriate residues at the subunit interface. LsmÎ± presented a complex set of interactions at the interface. Out of the mutations introduced, R 65 P yielded a protein for which SEC and SAXS data were consistent with a hexameric state. Moreover, key residues, L 70 and I 71, were identified that contribute to the stability of the toroid structure. Covalent linking of rings provided nanotubular structures. To achieve this, the surface of the LsmÎ± ring scaffold was modified with Cys residues. This approach {{led to the formation of}} novel LsmÎ± nanotubes approximately 20 nm in length. Importantly, the assembly could be controlled by changing the redox conditions. As an alternative method to manipulate the supramolecular assembly, His 6 -tags were attached at the termini of the LsmÎ± sequence. The higher-order organisation of the constructs was influenced by the position of the His 6 -tag. The N-terminally attached His 6 -tag version of LsmÎ± showed a metal-dependent assembly into cage-like structures, approximately 9 nm across. This organisation was highly stable, reproducible, and reversible in nature. The results presented in this thesis aid the understanding of generating complex nanostructures via in vitro self-assembly. The LsmÎ± rings were assembled into higher-order architectures at the quaternary level by employing protein engineering strategies. Future work is necessary to functionalise these supramolecular structures; however, this study confirms the potential role of LsmÎ± proteins as a molecular building block in bionanotechnology...|$|R
40|$|A high-strength, low-weight {{pressure}} vessel dome was {{designed specifically to}} house a high-pressure [2, 000 psi (approx. = 13. 8 MPa) ] electrolyzer. In operation, the dome is filled with an inert gas pressurized to roughly 100 psi (approx. = 690 kPa) above the high, balanced pressure product oxygen and hydrogen gas streams. The inert gas acts to reduce the clamping load on electrolyzer stack tie bolts since the dome pressure acting axially inward helps offset the outward axial forces from the stack gas pressure. Likewise, radial and circumferential stresses on electrolyzer frames are minimized. Because the dome is operated at a higher pressure than the electrolyzer product gas, any external electrolyzer leak prevents oxygen or hydrogen from leaking into the dome. Instead the affected stack gas stream pressure rises detectably, thereby enabling a system shutdown. All electrical and fluid connections to the stack are made inside the pressure dome and require special plumbing and electrical dome interfaces {{for this to be}} accomplished. Further benefits of the dome are that it can act as a containment shield in the unlikely event of a catastrophic failure. Studies indicate that, for a given active area (and hence, cell ID), frame outside diameter must become ever larger to support stresses at higher operating pressures. This can lead to a large footprint and increased costs associated with thicker and/or larger diameter end-plates, tie-rods, and the frames themselves. One solution is to employ rings that fit snugly around the frame. This complicates stack assembly and is sometimes difficult to achieve in practice, as its success is strongly dependent on frame and <b>ring</b> <b>tolerances,</b> gas pressure, and operating temperature. A pressure dome permits an otherwise low-pressure stack to operate at higher pressures without growing the electrolyzer hardware. The pressure dome consists of two machined segments. An O-ring is placed in an O-ring groove in the flange of the bottom segment and is trapped by the flange on the top dome segment when these components are bolted together with high-strength bolts. The pressure dome has several unique features. It is made (to ASME Pressure Vessel guidelines) in a high-strength aluminum alloy with the strength of stainless steel and the weight benefits of aluminum. The flange of the upper dome portion contains specially machined flats for mounting the dome, and other flats dedicated to the special feedthroughs for electrical connections. A pressure dome can be increased in length to house larger stacks (more cells) of the same diameter with the simple addition of a cylindrical segment. To aid in dome assembly, two stainless steel rings are employed. One is used beneath the heads of the high-strength bolts in lieu of individual hardened washers, and another is used instead of individual nuts. Like electrolyzers could be operated at low or high pressures simply by operating the electrolyzer outside or inside a pressurized dome...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of tolerance {{is a major}} limitation to the clinical application of the vasodilator glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) for chronic management of angina pectoris. It is {{associated with an increased}} oxidative stress. In view of the relaxation and antioxidant properties of flavonoids, it is hypothesized that the naturally occurring compounds may have the potentials to prevent and/or reverse GTN tolerance. The present study examined this hypothesis in isolated rat aortae of male Sprague Dawley rats (8 weeks old). In study I, the properties of GTN-induced relaxation and tolerance was studied. GTN-induced relaxation was entirely mediated through activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Prior exposure of isolated aortae to GTN (3 Ã—ã€– 10 ã€—^(- 5) M) for an hour resulted in reduced relaxation to subsequent additions of GTN; the impaired relaxation was more prominent in aortae without endothelium. While sodium nitroprusside, deta-NONOate and acetylcholine also caused relaxation by activating sGC, their responses were not altered by prior exposure to GTN. Therefore, it appears that sGC activity and its downstream signaling was not affected during GTN tolerance. The ability of apocynin (an antioxidant), but not the combination of DETCA and tiron (which eliminate superoxide anions), to prevent GTN tolerance suggests a possible involvement of peroxide compounds in its development. In study II, the effects of pre- and post-treatment of aorta with 10 flavonoids on GTN tolerance were examined. Among them, only apigenin, when applied before and present during the GTN incubation, prevented the {{development of}} <b>tolerance.</b> In aortic <b>rings</b> that were exposed previously to GTN, not only apigenin but also kaempferol, quercetin and genistein significantly improved the subsequent relaxations to GTN. Structure activity relationship analysis revealed that the C 2 =C 3 functionality may be essential for reversing GTN tolerance, while the positioning of B-ring in C 3 or the presence of a bulky glycoside group at C 3 would greatly reduce this function. Apigenin {{is the only one of}} the 10 flavonoids that can both prevent and reverse GTN tolerance. In study III, its effects on the enzymes that were proposed to be responsible for the bioactivation and hence tolerance of GTN, namely aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), were examined. ALDH inhibitor attenuated GTNâ€“induced relaxation in rings without and with GTN tolerance; its inhibitory effect was minimally prevented by pre-incubation with apigenin. Moreover, apigenin pre-incubation had no effect on ALDH activity, which was reduced during GTN tolerance. These results suggest that apigenin did not prevent GTN tolerance through activation of ALDH. Prior exposure to GST inhibitor also resulted in reduced relaxation to GTN; this inhibition was reversed in aortae treated with apigenin after GST exposure. As such, GST inhibition may account for the development of tolerance and its reversal may underlie the restoration of relaxation to GTN by the flavonoid in tolerant aorta. Taken in conjunction, the results reported in this thesis suggest that apigenin is effective in preventing and reversing GTN tolerance. GST but not ALDH in vascular smooth muscle appears to be involved in the beneficial effect of apigenin.
