5|$|Although he venerated Scott's {{writing skill}} {{and use of}} history as backdrop, Balzac worked to more {{accurately}} depict the turbulence of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>heart</b> – {{and its effect on}} history. He considered Scott's view of women unrefined, and believed this led to a stale representation of human behavior as a result. In Les Chouans, Balzac places the romance of Montauran and Marie de Verneuil {{at the center of the}} narrative, around which all other elements revolve.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>heart</b> in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E

On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{sought to}} find out whether G-protein-coupled {{receptor}} kinase (GRK) activity is also increased in <b>the</b> aging <b>human</b> <b>heart.</b> BackgroundIn <b>the</b> aging and failing <b>human</b> <b>heart,</b> cardiac beta-adrenoceptors (beta-AR) are desensitized. In heart failure (HF), an increase in cardiac GRK activity considerably contributes to this beta-AR desensitization. MethodsWe assessed GRK activity (by in vitro rhodopsin phosphorylation) in the right atria (RA) from 16 children (mean age 9 ± 2 years) and 17 elderly patients (mean age 67 ± 2 years) without apparent HF and in the RA from four patients with end-stage HF. ResultsCytosolic and membranous GRK activities in the RA from children were not significantly different from those in elderly patients; in contrast, cytosolic and membranous GRK activities in the RA from patients with end-stage HF were significantly increased. ConclusionsIn contrast to <b>the</b> failing <b>human</b> <b>heart,</b> in <b>the</b> aging <b>human</b> <b>heart,</b> GRK activity is not increased. Thus, GRK activity appears to not {{play an important role in}} beta-AR desensitization in <b>the</b> aging <b>human</b> <b>heart...</b>|$|R

25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{about whether or not}} Ibn al-Nafis participated in {{dissection}} to come to his conclusions about pulmonary circulation. Although he states in his writings that he was prevented from practicing dissection because of his beliefs, other scholars have noted that al-Nafis must have either practiced dissection or seen a human heart in order to come to his conclusions. According to one view, his knowledge about <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>heart</b> could have been derived from surgical operations rather than dissection. Other comments found in al-Nafis’s writings such as dismissing earlier observations with a reference to dissection as proof, however, support the view that he practiced dissection in order to come to his conclusions about <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>heart</b> and pulmonary circulation. Ibn al-Nafis’s comments to the contrary and the alternate explanations, however, keep his possible practice of dissection in question.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken to assess left ventricular-arterial coupling relations in <b>the</b> normal <b>human</b> <b>heart</b> under varying loading conditions and inotropic states and thereby to establish whether the working point of <b>the</b> normal <b>human</b> <b>heart</b> is at optimal output or mechanical efficiency under basal hemodynamic conditions. In 22 patients with an atypical chest pain syndrome who had normal coronary arteriograms, left ventricular (LV) pressures, volumes, ejection fractions, and masses at cardiac catheterization, we acquired radionuclide angiograms in duplicate simultaneously with micromanometer LV pressures. These values were derived under control conditions and during methoxamine and nitroprusside infusions with heart rate held constant by right atrial pacing. Seven other patients underwent the same protocol but, in addition, we acquired these parameters during a steady-state, intravenous infusion of dobutamine (5 [mu]g/kg/min). The interaction of LV chamber elastance (Ees) and effective arterial elastance (Ea) revealed that <b>the</b> normal <b>human</b> <b>heart</b> was operating at an Ees/Ea ratio of 1. 62, a stroke work of 76 +/- 31 gm-m, and a mechanical efficiency (stroke work to pressure-volume area ratio [SW/PVA]) of 0. 65 +/- 0. 10. With {{an increase in}} LV load, the Ees/Ea ratio approached 1 (p p p es/Ea ratio increased to slightly above 2. 0 (p p p es/Ea, LV stroke work, and SW/PVA over a similar range of LV loading conditions, but enhanced inotropy improved the energy transfer from the left ventricle to the arterial system at comparable Ees/Ea ratios without affecting mechanical efficiency. In conclusion, these data indicate that <b>the</b> normal <b>human</b> <b>heart</b> operates at neither optimal output nor efficiency. The working point, however, more closely approximates maximal mechanical efficiency than maximal LV output, but <b>the</b> normal <b>human</b> <b>heart</b> operates over a narrow range of LV SW values...|$|R

25|$|Self-repairing – Although {{of limited}} extent {{compared}} to well vascularised tissue (e.g. muscle), the valve leaflets do retain some capacity for repair {{due to the}} presence of regenerative cells (e.g. fibroblasts) in the connective tissue from which the leaflets are composed.
