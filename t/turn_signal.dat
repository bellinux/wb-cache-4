5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing can in <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing earnings and to beat analyst targets.|$|E
25|$|In {{vehicles}} {{with a separate}} left and right green <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> tell-tale on the dashboard, both left and right indicators may flash to provide visual indication of the hazard flashers' operation. In {{vehicles with}} a single green <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> tell-tale on the dashboard, a separate red tell-tale must be provided for hazard flasher indication. Because the hazard flasher function operates the vehicle's left and right turn signals, a left or a right <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> function may not be provided while the hazard flashers are operating, although the vehicle may activate the indicator {{and return to the}} hazard flashing phase once the indicator is deactivated.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> have {{advantages}} over conventional <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> in terms of their geometric visibility and conspicuity in several important situations. This study was designed to (1) develop methods for evaluating the effects of mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> on both the frequency and severity of relevant crashes, and (2) provide an illustrative application of these approaches. We presented arguments suggesting that a viable approach involves a longitudinal comparison of the crash experience of vehicle models that had an abrupt year-to-year change from 0 % to 100 % installation. Several crash scenarios were identified that might be sensitive to the presence of mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> including changing lanes, merging, making turns, and leaving a parked position. We identified 13 vehicle models in the U. S. that had the desirable abrupt change in the installation of mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals.</b> An illustrative analysis was then performed on the crash experience of these 13 vehicle models using the North Carolina crash database. The results indicate a tendency for vehicles with mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> to be less likely involved in turn-signal-related crashes, but the effect was not statistically significant. Furthermore, the results were inconclusive concerning the possibility of a reduction in crash severity for vehicles with mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals.</b> As manufacturers adopt mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> on more vehicle models, the target population of vehicles for a crash analysis will increase. At that point, the approach illustrated in this report could be used to perform a more definitive analysis of the safety benefits of mirrormounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that, as expected, fast-rise signals (such as LEDs and neon lamps) lead to shorter reaction time than slower-rise signals (such as incandescent lamps). The present study, in two converging experiments, investigated whether rapid rise time makes <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> more resistant to masking from an adjacent headlamp. The first experiment used a method of limits to obtain luminous intensity thresholds for LED and incandescent <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> {{in the presence of}} headlamp glare. In the second experiment, subjects judged the relative conspicuity of simultaneously presented LED and incandescent <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> when they flanked an illuminated headlamp. The results of the two experiments were consistent: There was no difference between the two light sources in either detection threshold or judged conspicuity. These results suggest that faster rise time does not affect the resistance of <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> to headlamp masking...|$|R
25|$|In most countries, cars must be {{equipped}} with side-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> repeaters to make the turn indication visible laterally (i.e. {{to the sides of}} the vehicle) rather than just to the front and rear of the vehicle. These are permitted, but not required in the US. As an alternative in both the United States and Canada, the front amber side marker lights may be wired to flash with the turn signals, but this also is not mandatory. In recent years, many automakers have been incorporating side <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> devices into the side view mirror housings, rather than mounting them on the vehicle's fenders. Some evidence suggests these mirror-mounted turn signals may be more effective than fender-mounted items.|$|E

40|$|September 2003. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 27) <b>Turn</b> <b>signals</b> {{mounted on}} exterior rearview mirrors {{are increasingly being}} used as original equipment on passenger cars and light trucks. The potential for mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> (MMTS) to improve the geometric visibility of <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> is examined in this report. A survey of U. S. and European regulations showed that the <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> of a vehicle that is minimally compliant with U. S. regulations are not visible to a driver of a nearby vehicle in an adjacent lane. Measurements of mirror location and window geometry were made on 74 passenger cars and light trucks, including 38 vehicles with European-style side repeaters. These data were combined with data on driver eye locations from two previous studies to assess the relative visibility of MMTS and conventional signals. Simulations were conducted to examine the potential for signals to be obstructed when a driver looks laterally through the passenger-side window. With a vehicle population that is fifty percent light trucks, MMTS are visible 52 percent more often than European side repeaters in this scenario. Based on the lateral visibility analysis, the optimal height for geometric visibility of a signal in the adjacent-vehicle scenario is 124 cm above the ground, approximately the average height of a light truck mirror. A plan-view eccentricity analysis showed that an MMTS is {{much closer to the}} viewing driver’s forward-directed line of sight than rear-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> when the viewing driver’s vehicle is in or near the blind zone between the signaling driver’s mirror and direct peripheral fields of view. The report concludes that MMTS can improve the geometric visibility of <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> in the adjacent-vehicle scenario that is believed to precede many lane-change/merge crashes. Further research will be necessary to determine if improved geometric visibility is accompanied by improved detection of <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> by viewing drivers, and whether improved detection of <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> has important safety implications...|$|R
