5|$|Dunrobin Castle {{was built}} {{in the midst of a}} tribal society, with Norse and Gaelic in use at the time. Robert the Bruce planted <b>the</b> <b>Gordons,</b> who {{supported}} his claim to the crown, at Huntly in Aberdeenshire, and they were created Earls of Huntly in 1445. The Earldom passed to the Gordon family in the 16th century when the 8th Earl of Sutherland gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to Adam Gordon. After the 8th Earl died in 1508, Elizabeth's elder brother was declared heir to the title, but a brieve (writ) of idiocy brought against him and his younger brother by <b>the</b> <b>Gordons</b> meant that the possession of the estate went to Adam Gordon in 1512.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Batgirl {{comic book}} was relaunched with Stephanie Brown {{starring}} {{as the title}} character. Although Oracle initially tries to discourage Brown from crime-fighting, she eventually comes to accept her as Batgirl. In addition, she also mentors the Calculator's daughter, Wendy Harris, who was crippled following an attack at Titans Tower. Oracle later takes {{a job as an}} assistant professor at Gotham University. During the Green Lantern limited series Blackest Night, Hal Jordan crashes into the Bat-Signal after a fight with the Black Lantern Martian Manhunter. Oracle and Commissioner Gordon are both present. Origins & Omens hints towards an involvement in the storyline. After sending Green Lantern's intel to every superhero community across the planet of the Black Lanterns, <b>the</b> <b>Gordons</b> find themselves being attacked by the original Dark Knight's deceased rogue gallery members, who are all reanimated by the Black Lantern Corps. Oracle and her father are forced to fight for their lives as they witness the Black Lanterns massacring everyone on sight at Gotham Central. During the crisis, Oracle is rendered unconscious by an explosion and is possessed by Deadman, who uses Oracle's body to save Commissioner Gordon from the reanimated King Snake and the Trigger Twins. After being rescued by Batman, Robin, and Red Robin, <b>the</b> <b>Gordons</b> were attacked by Batman and Red Robin's parents with their saviors, the reanimated Graysons and the Drakes. While Grayson and Drake battle the Black Lanterns, Robin takes <b>the</b> <b>Gordons</b> to their underground base where Alfred tends her and her father's wounds.|$|E
5|$|In 1518, in {{the absence}} of Adam Gordon, the castle was {{captured}} by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. <b>The</b> <b>Gordons</b> quickly retook the castle, captured Alexander and placed his head on a spear on top of the castle tower. Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden. During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended {{with the addition of a}} large house, built around a courtyard to the south-west.|$|E

He was then promoted to local lieutenant colonel on 17 October 1931 and awarded a brevet majority on 1 January 1933. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1934 King's Birthday Honours. His secondment ended on 19 November 1934 and he returned to regimental duty with <b>the</b> <b>Gordons</b> in his substantive rank of captain. He retired in April 1935 to begin a career with the Sudan Political Service and spent five years as District Commissioner in Darfur.|$|E
25|$|In September 1946, the pub reopened {{under the}} {{ownership}} of the Lim family, who bought the hotel from <b>the</b> <b>Gordons.</b> The Lims operated the hotel for nearly 20 years, selling it in 1965. During this period, the hotel was a popular 'watering hole' frequently attended by crocodile shooters, buffalo hunters and mining prospectors, {{as well as the}} local office workers and bank staff.|$|E
25|$|The fiery {{enthusiasm of}} <b>the</b> <b>Gordons</b> and other clans often carried the day, but Montrose relied more upon the disciplined {{infantry}} from Ireland. His strategy at Inverlochy, and his tactics at Aberdeen, Auldearn and Kilsyth furnished {{models of the}} military art, but above all his daring and constancy marked him out {{as one of the}} greatest soldiers of the war. His career of victory was crowned by the great Battle of Kilsyth on 15 August 1645.|$|E

25|$|In December 1896 he was {{appointed}} as a piper in the battalion's band. <b>The</b> <b>Gordons,</b> in common with other Highland regiments of the time, maintained a pipe band in each battalion for both ceremonial and military purposes; the pipers were trained infantrymen, and accompanied the main force on operations. The following year, the 1st Battalion was assigned {{as part of the}} force for the Tirah campaign, an expedition into the mountains to secure the Khyber pass and the northern approaches to India.|$|E
25|$|In 1638, after King Charles I had {{attempted}} to impose an Episcopalian version of the Book of Common Prayer upon the reluctant Scots, resistance spread throughout the country, eventually culminating in the Bishops' Wars. Montrose joined the party of resistance, and was for some time {{one of its most}} energetic champions. He had nothing puritanical in his nature, but he shared in the ill-feeling aroused by the political authority King Charles had given to the bishops. He signed the National Covenant, and was sent to suppress the opposition which arose around Aberdeen and in the country of <b>the</b> <b>Gordons.</b> Three times Montrose entered Aberdeen, where he succeeded in his object, on the second occasion carrying off the head of <b>the</b> <b>Gordons,</b> the Marquess of Huntly, as a prisoner to Edinburgh (though in so doing, for the first and last time in his life, he violated a safe-conduct). He was a leader of the delegation who subsequently met at Muchalls Castle to parley regarding the 1638 confrontation with the Bishop of Aberdeen. With the Earl Marischal he led a force of 9000 men across the Causey Mounth through the Portlethen Moss to attack Royalists at the Bridge of Dee. These events played a part in Charles I's decision to grant major concessions to the Covenanters.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, Findlater re-enlisted in the Army, {{returning}} to his old regiment. He was posted to the 9th Battalion of <b>the</b> <b>Gordons,</b> a New Army battalion in 15th (Scottish) Division, where he was appointed as the sergeant piper (or pipe major), the battalion's senior piper. He served with the regiment through its first year in France, including the Battle of Loos, before being invalided home in December 1915. He continued to farm at Forglen, and {{was a member of the}} local pipe band at Turiff; from 1927 to 1940 he served as its pipe major. He died in early 1942, shortly after his seventieth birthday, of a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|Gordon died at Cairness and was {{survived by}} his wife. He had no issue with her and in his will left most of his estate, {{including}} a large landholding in Jamaica, to an illegitimate son called Charles Wilkinson, who later took the surname Gordon. His existence {{seems to have been}} a secret from the rest of the family as he had been brought up by a tutor in Elgin. The inheritance caused much scandal and led to a long period of litigation within the family. Thomas Gordon’s historical library and manuscripts were sold in March 1850, and his antiquities in the following June, although some items remained at Cairness House until 1938, after the last of <b>the</b> <b>Gordons</b> sold the estate.|$|E
25|$|Having been {{promoted}} to commodore on 7 March 1706 Gordon joined the Royal William, which sailed from Leith accompanied by the Royal Mary (Captain Hamilton).

However, faithful Captain Gordon was in capturing French and Ostend privateers, out of which he could make handsome awards of prize money, he was not averse to letting a French ship land Jabobite political agents at Slains Castle to visit the Countess of Errol. <b>The</b> <b>Gordons</b> and Errols, who were closely connected, played their part in Scottish history though not always on the monarch's side. There were fourteen signals agreed upon by Commodore Gordon and the captain of the French frigate Audacious, which brought over Hooke, whereby they could recognise each other.|$|E

25|$|John de Moravia, 9th Earl of Sutherland (also {{known as}} John Sutherland), chief of Clan Sutherland died in 1514 leaving no heir. He was succeeded by {{his younger sister}} Elizabeth de Moravia, 10th Countess of Sutherland. Elizabeth married Adam Gordon who was a younger son of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, chief of the {{powerful}} Clan Gordon. Elizabeth and Adam Gordon’s son, Alexander Gordon, Master of Sutherland, would become the legal heir to the Earldom of Sutherland, however this was disputed by others. Firstly, John Mackay of Strathnaver, chief of the Clan Mackay rose up in opposition to <b>the</b> <b>Gordons</b> who had taken power in Sutherland. Mackay fought {{against the forces of}} Elizabeth de Moravia and Adam Gordon at the Battle of Torran Dubh in 1517 where Mackay was defeated. The Sutherland force had been led by Elizabeth’s younger half-brother Alexander Sutherland, who she had persuaded to resist Mackay. However, shortly afterwards Alexander Sutherland married a sister of John Mackay, and according to one account Mackay tampered with Alexander Sutherland to renew his claim to the Earldom. Alexander Sutherland then claimed the Earldom of Sutherland for himself as the rightful heir.|$|E

500|$|The {{remaining}} Highlanders, {{now under}} the command of Lieutenant Colonel James Hughes-Hallet of the Seaforths, had been lying prone under a harsh summer sun {{for most of the day}} with the Boers still attempting to encircle them from the south.

This unexpected move left many of the field guns which had been advanced to the front line over the course of the morning exposed to the Boers.

40|$|A {{reconnaissance}} of {{the land}} forms and Quaternary sediments of <b>the</b> uppermost <b>Gordon</b> River Valley and adjacent Guelph River Valley indicates {{that at least two}} and probably three glaciations are represented. The most striking landforms produced by glacial erosion of the King William Range appear to date from glaciations that predate those recorded during this survey. When the ice cover was most extensive, <b>the</b> <b>Gordon</b> Glacier was nourished partly by diffluent ice from the Derwent and Guelph Valleys, but during the late Last Glacial Stage <b>the</b> <b>Gordon</b> Glacier was nourished primarily by local sources. The glacial sediments as far as 11 km from the head of <b>the</b> <b>Gordon</b> Valley are weathered to only a moderate extent and appear much younger than the heavily weathered drifts that define the maximum glacier limits in almost all other Tasmanian valleys studied previously. This suggests that the tills identified to date in <b>the</b> <b>Gordon</b> Valley are not likely to represent the maximum down-valley extent of <b>the</b> <b>Gordon</b> Glacier. ...|$|R
