40|$|Background. Haemovigilance is {{a system}} {{consisting}} of the detection, collecting and analysis of information regarding unwanted and unexpected effects of blood transfusion that {{make it possible to}} take action in order to improve blood trasfusion safety. In a broader sense, it is defined as a set of surveillance procedures covering the whole <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> from the collection of blood to the follow-up of recipients. In some European countries a haemovigilance system based on legislation was introduced during the last ten years, European Haemovigilance Network was organised and some results from the existing surveillance systems were reported. The paper presents haemovigilance activities in Slovenia. Conclusions. In Slovenia, many elements of haemovigilance are already included in the blood <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain,</b> but no unique system of data collection exists. We expect a new legislation on blood transfusion to help us with introducing a data collection system, analysis and activities in order to further improve blood transfusion safety. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of UHF {{electromagnetic}} fields produced by a RFID reader on a blood bag are evaluated numerically in several configurations. The results of the simulation, field level and distribution, specific absorption rate (SAR), and heating time show that an exposure to a typical reader field leads to a temperature increase smaller than 0. 1 C and to a SAR smaller than 1 W/kg. As a consequence, no adverse biological effects occur during a typical UHF RFID reading cycle on a blood bag. Therefore, the blood contained in a bag traced using UHF-RFID is as safe as those traced using barcodes.

40|$|Abstract: This paper mainly {{deals with}} the Implementation of RFID in health care. It is {{primarily}} driven {{by a desire to}} improve patient safety and enhance the efficiency of the supply chain. This guideline, following a short technical overview and some examples from industry, assesses high level advantages and disadvantages of using RFID in transfusion medicine and identifies specific areas where RFID solutions might beneficially apply. It covers the use of RFID in the blood product supply chain from bag manufacturing to the donor and to the patient. This paper has focused on RFID solution components and a number of technical recommendations including choice of the radio frequency to be applied, tag capacity, functionality, and data structure to be considered when deploying RFID technology for transfusion medicine. The data structure of the blood bag tag accommodates the needs of all stakeholders in the <b>transfusion</b> medicine supply <b>chain,</b> including: RFID tag manufacturers, bag manufactures, blood centers, and hospital transfusion services. RFID may also increase accuracy of tracking time and temperature and reduce product waste, thus increasing quality and availability of blood products for patients. RFID technology can help ensure appropriate transfusion of the right blood to the right patient, thus reducing errors at the bedside and increasing patient safety...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{assessing}} the knowledge, attitudes, practices and behaviors among blood donors in South Kivu and identify {{risk factors for}} viral markers. Methods: a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study involved 595 blood donors {{in the city of}} Bukavu (Head city of the province of South Kivu) in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Results: our sample consisted of 70. 3 % men with a median age of 23 and 77 % of young people fewer than 30 years. The score of knowledge and attitude of blood donor's volunteer on blood safety were assessed at 23. 5 % and 79. 1 %. A statistically significant difference was observed between the loyal and new blood donors volunteer (25. 1 % vs 64. 6 % p < 0. 001); between blood donors volunteer of low and high education level (p = 0. 04). Motivation to donate blood in 95. 9 % of cases respect ethical rules of donation. The prevalence of viral markers in blood donors is as follows: 4. 8 % hepatitis B, 3. 9 % hepatitis C, 1. 6 % HIV. For HIV, the low level of education and replacement blood donors are most at risk, the antigen of hepatitis B is observed in blood donors over 30 years, blood donors living couple. Conclusion: general knowledge on blood safety is very low in the first link in the <b>chain</b> <b>transfusion</b> (blood donors).

40|$|Hemovigilance is the {{systematic}} monitoring of adverse reactions and {{incidents in the}} <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> {{in order to make}} recommendations for safety improvement. EU member states must have a reporting system for serious adverse reactions or events which might have an effect on quality or safety of blood components. The thesis presents an analysis of routinely collected data on occurrence of blood donation complications and risk factors. A study of procedural and follow-up data from a cohort of related peripheral blood stem cell donors gave no indication of unacceptable risks. In transfused patients an exploratory case-control study found previously undescribed associations with patient characteristics. Using national hemovigilance data the reduction of the risk of TRALI following implementation of male-only plasma was estimated as 33 %.

40|$|Introduction. The {{concept of}} blood safety {{includes}} the entire <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> {{starting with the}} collection of blood from the blood donor, and ending with blood transfusion to the patient. The concept involves quality management system as the systematic monitoring of adverse reactions and incidents regarding the blood donor or patient. Monitoring of near-miss errors show the critical points in the working process and increase transfusion safety. Objective. The aim {{of the study was}} to present the analysis results of adverse and unexpected events in transfusion practice with a potential risk to the health of blood donors and patients. Methods. One-year retrospective study was based on the collection, analysis and interpretation of written reports on medical errors in the Blood Transfusion Institute of Vojvodina. Results. Errors were distributed according to the type, frequency and part of the working process where they occurred. Possible causes and corrective actions were described for each error. The study showed that there were not errors with potential health consequences for the blood donor/patient. Errors with potentially damaging consequences for patients were detected throughout the entire <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain.</b> Most of the errors were identified in the preanalytical phase. The human factor was responsible for the largest number of errors. Conclusion. Error reporting system has an important role in the error management and the reduction of transfusion-related risk of adverse events and incidents. The ongoing analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the entire process and indicates the necessary changes. Errors in transfusion medicine can be avoided in a large percentage and prevention is costeffective, systematic and applicable...|$|E
40|$|Background: The 2011 Dutch Blood Transfusion Guideline for {{hospitals}} incorporates seven internal quality indicators {{for evaluation of}} the hospital <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain.</b> The indicators aim to measure guideline compliance {{as shown by the}} instatement of a hospital transfusion committee and transfusion safety officer (structural indicators), observance of transfusion triggers and mandatory traceability of labile blood components (process indicators). Study Design and Methods: Two voluntary online surveys were sent to all Dutch hospitals for operational years 2011 and 2012 to assess compliance with the guideline recommendations. Results: Most hospitals had a hospital transfusion committee and had appointed a transfusion safety officer (TSO). In 2012, only 23 % of hospitals complied with the recommended minimum of four annual transfusion committee meetings and 8 h/week for the TSO. Compliance with the recommended pretransfusion haemoglobin threshold for RBC transfusion was achieved by 90 % of hospitals in over 80 % of transfusions; 58 % of hospitals measured the pretransfusion platelet count in over 80 % of platelet transfusions and 87 % of hospitals complied with the legally mandatory traceability of blood components in over 95 % of transfusions. Conclusion: With the current blood transfusion indicators, it is feasible to monitor aspects {{of the quality of the}} hospital <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> and blood transfusion practice and to assess guideline compliance. The results from this study suggest that there are opportunities for significant improvement in blood transfusion practice in the Netherlands. These indicators could potentially be used for national and international benchmarking of blood transfusion practice...|$|E

40|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, attention was focused on the restructuring and reorganization of nationally supported safe and sustainable blood supply systems. Networking and human capacity building in transfusion medicine were developed through World Health Organization initiatives.

40|$|Patient {{safety is}} a new area gaining ground and many followers. In the past two decades, many {{international}} organizations have developed initiatives to increase knowledge in this area. We might consider that patient safety focuses {{on the study of}} the impact of adverse events resulting from the provision of health care for patients. This dimension cuts across all healthcare areas because every care is always underlying the risk-benefit binomial. Transfusional medicine is no exception. Transfusion safety includes not only the safety of blood and blood components as a therapeutic product, but also the safety of the transfusion process. The transfusion process involves a large set of steps and actors, which generates a complex network of processes’ interactions and multidisciplinary professionals. This complexity provides an environment prone to the occurrence of adverse events. The majority of these events are the result of errors occurring throughout the <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> and may {{have a negative impact on}} the health of the patient.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Blood {{transfusion}} has health-related, economical {{and safety}} implications. In order to optimise the <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain,</b> comprehensive research data are needed. The Dutch Transfusion Data warehouse (DTD) project aims {{to establish a}} data warehouse where data from donors and transfusion recipients are linked. This paper describes {{the design of the}} data warehouse, challenges and illustrative applications. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative data on blood donors (eg, age, blood group, antibodies) and products (type of product, processing, storage time) are obtained from the national blood bank. These are linked to data on the transfusion recipients (eg, transfusions administered, patient diagnosis, surgical procedures, laboratory parameters), which are extracted from hospital electronic health records. APPLICATIONS: Expected scientific contributions are illustrated for 4 applications: determine risk factors, predict blood use, benchmark blood use and optimise process efficiency. For each application, examples of research questions are given and analyses planned. CONCLUSIONS: The DTD project aims to build a national, continuously updated transfusion data warehouse. These data have a wide range of applications, on the donor/production side, recipient studies on blood usage and benchmarking and donor-recipient studies, which ultimately can contribute to the efficiency and safety of blood transfusion...|$|E
40|$|Background. The risk {{of severe}} adverse events to blood {{transfusion}} is very low. More frequent are adverse events to transfusion, {{which are not}} severe, but must also be treated.

40|$|Background: A {{haemovigilance}} system {{makes it possible}} to identify critical points in blood <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> from blood collection to the patient and to introduce new measures, thus creating conditions for better transfusion safety. Methods: Data on haemovigilance in Slovenia in years 2003 – 2010 were obtained from annual reports. The collected data were systematically and chronologically arranged, displayed in tables and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results: From 2003 to 2010, there were 1, 333 adverse reactions reported: 511 allergic, 25 anaphylactoid, 604 febrile nonhaemolytic, 22 haemolytic reactions, 4 TRALI, 69 TACO, 11 suspected transfusion-transmitted infections and 74 cases classified as others. From 2003 – 2010, 104 (7. 8 %) reactions were considered severe. There are considerable differences among Slovenian hospitals as to the number of reports, ranging from 0. 4 to 3. 1 per 1, 000 blood components issued in 2010. Severe adverse events were reported, such as wrong blood in test tubes and incorrect blood component transfused. There were also some severe adverse reactions reported during the collection of blood from donors, defective plastic blood bags, positive test results and adverse events during the storage and distribution of blood.

40|$|Context: Certain quality {{indicators}} are mandatory {{in the maintenance}} and improvement of quality in blood transfusion. Monitoring of such indicators should be done regularly and deficiencies are to be corrected for effective blood transfusion services. Aims: To study the usefulness of monitoring of the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) core indicators in blood transfusion and in the maintenance of hemovigilance. Settings and Design: Hemovigilance is a "quality process" to improve quality and increase the safety of blood transfusion. It covers and surveys all activities of the blood <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> from donors to recipients. Core indicators′ monitoring {{is a part of}} the hemovigilance process. Materials and Methods: A 2 -year retrospective study was conducted in a blood storage unit of a NABH accredited tertiary care hospital of a metropolitan city. Four NABH core indicators in blood transfusion were observed and monitored by the clinical and blood storage unit staff of different levels. Results: It was observed that there was an improvement in quality by core indicators monitoring with decreased wastage of blood and blood components, decreased average turnaround time for issue of blood and blood components, and lesser number of transfusion reactions. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that monitoring of NABH core indicators results in the enhancement of quality and safety in blood transfusion services, reducing the incidence of transfusion reactions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{further reduce}} the risk of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) transmission by blood transfusion, nucleic acid testing (NAT) can be employed. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in the Netherlands of employing a triplex NAT assay aimed at HBV nucleic acid detection in individual donations (ID-NAT) or in minipools of 6 donations (MP- 6 -NAT), compared to a triplex NAT assay in minipools of 24 donations (MP- 24 -NAT). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A mathematical model was made of the whole <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> from donors to recipients of blood in the Netherlands. The annual number of avoided HBV transmissions was estimated with the window-period incidence model. The natural history of a HBV infection in recipients is described by a Markov model. RESULTS: The ICER of adding HBV MP- 6 -NAT or HBV ID-NAT in the Netherlands is Euro 303, 218 (95 % confidence interval [CI], Euro 233, 001 -Euro 408, 388) and Euro 518, 995 (95 % CI, Euro 399, 359 -Euro 699, 120) per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. The ICER strongly correlates with the age of transfusion recipients. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of additional HBV NAT is limited by the limited loss of life caused by HBV transmission. Despite a higher effectiveness, HBV ID-NAT is less cost-effective than MP- 6 -NAT due to higher costs. A future equivalent participation of immigrants from HBV-endemic countries in the donor base renders HBV NAT only slightly more cost-effectiv...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Within {{the context}} of {{transfusion}} safety, the immunohematological study of donors and recipients of blood products is currently the most fragile link in the <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> of the public blood bank network of Minas Gerais. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work {{was to provide a}} critical and situational overview of the physical and operational infrastructure of the transfusion services in the state. Method: This was an observational cross-sectional, evidence-based study covering 226 transfusion services; only 19 belong to the Hemominas Foundation and 207 are non-Hemominas transfusion services. The investigation involved the application of questionnaires and red cell panel tests. RESULTS: The results revealed considerable non-compliance with the national law and with the norms of Hemominas. These findings were obtained for the two groups studied; however the frequencies were higher among non-Hemominas transfusion services. CONCLUSION: The study provides information about the situation of the physical and operational infrastructure of transfusion services that may be used to help plan effective measures for improvement and {{serve as the basis for}} an evaluation of the impact of future interventions regarding the quality, reliability and safety of transfusions. As primordial factors, we propose compliance with the law, qualified personnel and investment in further qualifications, a review of training methods, and more rigorous inspection of transfusion services.

40|$|Objective: RFID offers great {{opportunities}} to health care. Nevertheless, prior experiences {{also show that}} RFID systems have not been designed and tested {{in response to the}} particular needs of health care settings and might introduce new risks. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a framework that can be used to assess the performance of RFID systems particularly in health care settings. Methods: We developed a framework describing a systematic approach that can be used for assessing the feasibility of using an RFID technology in a particular healthcare setting; more specific for testing the impact of environmental factors on the quality of RFID generated data and vice versa. This framework is based on our own experiences with an RFID pilot implementation in an academic hospital in The Netherlands and a literature review concerning RFID test methods and current insights of RFID implementations in healthcare. The implementation of an RFID system within the blood <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> inside a hospital setting was used as a show case to explain the different phases of the framework. Results: The framework consists of nine phases, including an implementation development plan, RFID and medical equipment interference tests, data accuracy- and data completeness tests to be run in laboratory, simulated field and real field settings. Conclusions: The potential risks that RFID technologies may bring to the healthcare setting should be thoroughly evaluated before they are introduced into a vital environment. The RFID performance assessment framework that we present can act as a reference model to start an RFID development, engineering, implementation and testing plan and more specific, to assess the potential risks of interference and to test the quality of the RFID generated data potentially influenced by physical objects in specific health care environments.

40|$|Background: Hemovigilance is an {{organized}} system of surveillance throughout the <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> intended to evaluate information {{in order to}} prevent the appearance or recurrence of adverse reactions related to the use of blood products. Objective: The aims of this study were to assess the late reporting of incidents related to possible seroconversion in respect to age, marital status and ethnical background, annual variations in late reporting, the number of reports opened and closed, seroconversion of donors and transfusions of blood products within the window period. Methods: This retrospective, descriptive study used data on blood donations in the blood bank in Uberaba during the period from 2004 to 2011. Some socio-epidemiological characteristics of the donors and serology test results of donors and recipients were analyzed in respect to the late reporting of incidents related to possible seroconversion. The Chi-square test, odds ratio and a regression model were used for statistical analysis. Results: From 2004 to 2011, the blood bank in Uberaba collected 117, 857 blood bags, 284 (0. 24 %) of which were investigated for late reported incidents. The profile of the donors was less than 29 years old, unmarried and non-Whites. Differences in age (p-value < 0. 0001), marital status (p-value = 0. 0002) and ethnical background (p-value < 0. 0001) were found to be statistically significant. There was no statistical difference between men and women (0. 24 % and 0. 23 % respectively; p-value = 0. 951). The number of late reported incidents increased until 2008 followed by a downward trend until 2011. There were twelve cases of seroconversion in subsequent donations (seven human immunodeficiency virus, four hepatitis B and one hepatitis C) with proven human immunodeficiency virus infection after screening of only one recipient.

40|$|Background. Even though blood {{transfusion}} {{is a relatively}} safe form of therapy, because of the eventual administrative errors in the <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> between the blood donor and the recipient of blood, transfusion errors still occur. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} ensure an utmost extent of safety and reliability of all transfusion related procedures. The safety of {{blood transfusion}} can be improved by preventive actions, i. e. implementation of the total quality management concept, haemovigilance and virtual transfusion laboratory. In the resulting system, the information web, robotics, computer sciences and communication technologies ensure safe and reliable identification of the patients, blood donors, corresponding test samples and blood products. Apart form this; the modern technologies enable the automation of laboratory testing, the integrity of laboratory results and enable an optimal use of blood. Conclusions. For an improved transfusion safety in Slovenia, adoption of corresponding prevention as well as haemovigilance is necessary. Identification errors can be prevented by implementation of the wristbands systems with the code bars for the tagging of the patient and his biological samples, whereas the administrative errors in the blood bank and transfusion laboratory can be prevented by implementation of information systems and automation. We assume that the virtual transfusion laboratory will {{become an integral part of}} the new Slovenian transfusion web and will speed up, unify and simplify today’s methods of ordering and administering blood products. To the attending physician, it will enable the choice of optimal transfusion therapy schedule and at the same time, it will enable the supervision of individual orders, deviations and indications, all of which is needed in order to analyse and improve the quality and the costs of the treatment. These services represent the first obligatory step for the modernisation of the transfusion medicine and accordingly, of the Slovenian health system in sense of the total quality assurance. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background. Due to the {{administrative}} {{errors in the}} <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> between the blood donor and the patient, transfusion errors still occur. Usually, they are caused by the misidentifications of the patient, his blood samples and respective blood components. A reliable identification can only be reached by an appropriate informatization of the whole process by implementation of information networks and communication technologies. Methods. An information system covering all modern standards of safety and enabling integrity of patient records as well as faster and efficient transfusion was prepared. The system is enabling the rational use of the blood as well as assuring the obligatory haemoviligilance, as foreseen by the current law. The whole system is modular, consisting of terminals, supportive equipment, networking systems and servers. Additional hardware are the electronic code bar readers. Mobile terminals (Palm Pocket PCs) are wirelessly connected to the data network using the IEEE 802. 11 b WLAN technology in a wireless connection. All elements are included into the communication network with the servers contain data bases of blood donors, blood components and the patients; they execute the algorithms of the blood transfusion process support and enable the authentication. At {{the same time they}} enable the corresponding interfaces adapted to the users and terminals. For the connection of elements, corresponding interfaces are used. Results. The application is supporting the whole system of ordering, issuing and transfusion of a blood component. Its main characteristics are the bar-coded wristband for patient identification, coding of the blood samples with the same bar code that is unmistakably connected with the patient, and electronic ordering of blood component via a handheld device at the patient’s side. By means of which identity of the patient and the blood component can be matched right before the intended transfusion. Similarly, the handheld device can also be used for the posttransfusion procedures including the transfusion report as well as adverse effects reports. Conclusions. We expect that a similar system of transfusion safety assurance and haemovigilance is essential for the quality work at the hospital wards and will be set up soon, thereby enabling a safer and better transfusion therapy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aims: In {{this study}} we have {{evaluated}} the various adverse reactions related to transfusion occurring in our institution as a pilot institutional effort toward a hemovigilance program. This study will also help in understanding the problems faced by blood banks/Transfusion Medicine departments in implementing an effective hemovigilance program. Materials and Methods: All the adverse reactions related to transfusion of whole blood and its components in various clinical specialties were studied {{for a period of}} 1 year. Any transfusion-related adverse event was worked up in accordance with guidelines laid down by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and departmental standard operating procedures. Results: During the study period from November 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012, 45812 components were issued [30939 WB/PRBC; 12704 fresh frozen plasma (FFP); 2169 platelets]. Risk estimation per 1000 units of red cells (WB/PRBC) transfused was estimated to be: 0. 8 for febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR), 0. 7 for allergic reaction, 0. 19 for acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AcHTR), 0. 002 for anaphylactoid reactions, 0. 1 for bacterial sepsis, and 0. 06 for hypervolemia and hypocalcemia. 0. 09 is the risk for delayed transfusion reaction and 0. 03 is the risk for transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Risk estimate per 1, 000 units of platelets transfused was estimated to be 1. 38 for FNHTR, 1. 18 for allergic reaction, and 1 in case of bacterial sepsis. Risk estimation per 1, 000 units of FFP was estimated to be 0. 15 for FNHTR and 0. 2 for allergic reactions. Conclusions: Factors such as clerical checks at various levels, improvement in blood storage conditions outside blood banks, leukodepletion, better inventory management, careful donor screening, bedside monitoring of transfusion, and documentation of adverse events may decrease transfusion-related adverse events. Better coordination between transfusion specialists and various clinical specialties is the need of the hour and it will help in making the whole <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> safe and effective. There is a need for a hemovigilance program at the national level so that true incidence and the spectrum of adverse events due to transfusion are known and policies formulated to minimize the risks associated with it...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Within {{the context}} of {{transfusion}} safety, the immunohematological study of donors and recipients of blood products is currently the most fragile link in the <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> of the public blood bank network of Minas Gerais. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work {{was to provide a}} critical and situational overview of the physical and operational infrastructure of the transfusion services in the state. Method: This was an observational cross-sectional, evidence-based study covering 226 transfusion services; only 19 belong to the Hemominas Foundation and 207 are non-Hemominas transfusion services. The investigation involved the application of questionnaires and red cell panel tests. RESULTS: The results revealed considerable non-compliance with the national law and with the norms of Hemominas. These findings were obtained for the two groups studied; however the frequencies were higher among non-Hemominas transfusion services. CONCLUSION: The study provides information about the situation of the physical and operational infrastructure of transfusion services that may be used to help plan effective measures for improvement and {{serve as the basis for}} an evaluation of the impact of future interventions regarding the quality, reliability and safety of transfusions. As primordial factors, we propose compliance with the law, qualified personnel and investment in further qualifications, a review of training methods, and more rigorous inspection of transfusion services. As a suggestion, we propose the establishment of an External Quality Control Program in Immunohematology for the entire network of blood banks in the state and the adoption of the methods presented in this study as a tool to monitor transfusion service performance. INTRODUÇÃO: No contexto da segurança transfusional, o estudo imuno-hematológico do doador e do receptor de hemocomponentes é hoje o elo mais frágil da cadeia transfusional na hemorrede pública de Minas Gerais. OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste trabalho foi traçar panorama crítico e situacional da infraestrutura física e operacional das Agências Transfusionais (ATs) do estado. Método: Estudo observacional transversal, baseado em evidências, abrangeu 226 ATs, sendo 19 próprias da Fundação Hemominas (PH) e 207 não próprias da Hemominas (NPH), com aplicação de questionários e testes de painel de hemácias. RESULTADOS: Os achados do presente estudo mostraram percentuais expressivos de não conformidades com a legislação vigente no país e com as normas estabelecidas pela Hemominas. Estas foram encontradas nos dois grupos estudados, com algumas exceções, apresentando maiores frequências entre as ATs NPH. CONCLUSÃO: O estudo possibilitou o conhecimento da situação da infraestrutura física e operacional das ATs, podendo subsidiar o planejamento de ações efetivas de melhorias, bem como servir de base para avaliar o impacto de futuras intervenções, com vistas à qualidade, confiabilidade e segurança transfusional. Para isto, propôs como fatores primordiais, o cumprimento da legislação vigente, recursos humanos qualificados e investimentos na sua capacitação, revisão das metodologias de treinamento e maior rigor nas verificações e inspeções das ATs. Como sugestão, propõe ainda a criação, pela Hemominas, de Programa de Controle de Qualidade Externo em Imunohematologia para toda hemorrede do estado e adoção da metodologia deste estudo como instrumento de monitoramento da performance das ATs...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{transfusion}} is {{an important}} medical treatment for many and diverse patients groups, saving lives but sometimes also causing adverse transfusion reactions in transfusion recipients. For this reason blood use should ideally be as low as possible. The fact that significant differences exist {{in the amount of}} blood used between countries, hospitals and even within hospitals, indicates that there is room for improvement. Moreover, there are likely to exist unrecognized risk factors in donors and blood products that might affect patient outcomes. In order to study these various aspects and the interplay between them, data on the complete <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> are needed. Therefore the Dutch Transfusion Data warehouse (DTD) was set up, in which data from the national blood bank and a (growing) number of Dutch hospitals are linked. These data have a broad range of applications: identifying risk factors, predicting future blood use, benchmarking blood use, and optimizing process efficiency. A structured stepwise approach is applied to validate data quality, addressing external validity (e. g. concordance with external reports, previous studies and expert feedback) and internal validity (e. g. completeness, uniformity and plausibility). In addition, an algorithm is developed to identify –out of all diagnostic and procedural data available– the most likely indication (i. e. reason) for transfusion. The algorithm was evaluated against a gold standard based on expert review and adjusted accordingly. The final algorithm was able to predict the majority of cases correctly (about 75 %). However, before implementation of the algorithm it should be optimized and externally validated in independent hospital datasets. New hospitals are included in the DTD continuously. Different strategies for selecting hospitals for inclusion in the DTD are simulated to compare their effect on representativeness for the Netherlands. The ‘maximum varation’ strategy, which is to include hospitals that differ from each other maximally (the smallest and largest hospitals), resulted in highest representativeness. Finally, analyses of donor and patient data show trends in blood use and in the donor population composition. Over the past 20 years, the use of red blood cell units (RBCs) decreased. Retrospective analysis of various patient revealed that RBC use changed from largely surgical to predominantly medical blood use, suggesting a more restrictive transfusion policy for surgical patients as well as an increase in medical indications for transfusion. A special group of donors provide antibdies that are required for ReshusD (RhD) -negative women pregnant with a RhD-positive child in order to prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn. Due {{to the success of the}} RhD prevention program, the number of naturally immunized women has decreased, thereby also reducing the number of potential donors. Various donor recruitment scenarios were compared by simulating donor population size and age using data on Dutch anti-RhD donors in 1994 - 2013. This relatively simple simulation model could sufficiently accurately describe and predict the size of the anti-RhD donor population and the impact of ageing. Recommendations for research topics and possible extensions of the DTD offer a perspective on future applications of the data following the process from collection to reflection...|$|E

Approach: Descriptive ex post facto survey design. Methods: A total of 264 purposively selected blood prescribing clinicians and nurses from the four Human Development Index (HDI) groups of countries (low, medium, high, and very high) participated in this study. Three research questions were answered, while seven null hypotheses were tested at 0. 05 level of significance. Descriptive statistical tools (frequency counts and percentage) were used to analyze demographic backgrounds; inferential statistics – Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze hypotheses. Results: Quality of clinical blood use was positively and significantly correlated with the level of awareness (r= 0. 137; p= 0. 03; df= 262) and accessibility (r= 0. 184; p= 0. 01; df= 262) to e-continuous learning among clinicians/nurses. There was {{a significant difference in the}} levels of awareness (F[3, 260]= 53. 942, p= 0. 01), accessibility (F[3, 260]= 38. 582, p= 0. 01), and utilization (F[3, 260]= 24. 858, p= 0. 01) of continuous e-learning and education among clinicians/nurses based on HDI grouping, particularly between very high and low HDI. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the levels of accessibility (F[6, 257]= 6. 444, p= 0. 01) and utilization (F[6, 257]= 13. 704, p= 0. 01) of continuous e-learning and education among clinicians based on clinical specialty/department and a significant difference in the quality of clinical blood use based on clinical specialty/department (F[6, 257]= 9. 677, p= 0. 01). Conclusion and recommendations: The higher the HDI level the better is the awareness, accessibility, and utilization of continuous education, both through e-learning and conventional in teaching curricula. This has an immediate impact on the quality of clinical care and in particular on supportive hemotherapy and the development of patient blood management systems.
