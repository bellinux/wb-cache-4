5|$|The bark beetle, {{elm leaf beetle}} and the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) {{are among}} the species that attack elm trees. Bark beetles (Scolytidae) carry Dutch elm disease as <b>they</b> <b>move</b> from {{infected}} breeding sites to healthy trees. The disease has devastated elm trees across Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{high-pressure}} {{areas are}} associated with cold air masses which push away out of polar regions during the winter when there is less sun to warm neighboring regions. These Highs change character and weaken once <b>they</b> <b>move</b> further over relatively warmer water bodies.|$|E

5|$|Movements of grey-headed {{flying foxes}} are {{influenced}} by the availability of food. Their population is very fluid, as <b>they</b> <b>move</b> in response to the irregular blossoming of certain plant species. They are keystone pollinators and seed disperses over 100 species of native trees and plants. The grey-headed flying fox is a partial migrant that uses winds to facilitate long-distance movement. It does not migrate in a specific direction, but rather in the direction that will be the most beneficial at the time.|$|E
5|$|Of the two {{theories}} on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle, the older is the Norwegian Cyclone Model, developed during World War I. In this theory, cyclones develop as <b>they</b> <b>move</b> up and along a frontal boundary, eventually occluding and reaching a barotropically cold environment. It was developed completely from surface-based weather observations, including descriptions of clouds found near frontal boundaries. This theory still retains merit, {{as it is}} a good description for extratropical cyclones over continental landmasses.|$|E

5|$|Order Bdellonemertea. Includes seven species, {{of which}} six live as commensals in {{the mantle of}} large clams and one in that of a {{freshwater}} snail. The hosts filter feed and all the hosts steal food from them. These nemerteans have short, wide bodies and have no stylets but have a sucking pharynx and a posterior stucker, with which <b>they</b> <b>move</b> like inchworms.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>move</b> {{deeper into}} the woods {{the next day and}} locate what appears to be an old {{cemetery}} with seven small cairns and set up camp nearby. Later that night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping from all directions but assume the noises are from animals or locals. The following day, they attempt to hike back to the car, but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. That night, they again hear twigs snapping but fail to find the source of the noises.|$|E
5|$|American {{astronomer}} Edwin Hubble {{observed that}} the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their redshifts. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster <b>they</b> <b>move</b> away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the Copernican principle (that the Earth is not {{the center of the}} universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.|$|E
5000|$|She married Hugh [...] "Lefty" [...] Miller, and <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> to Paris together. Shortly {{after their}} arrival, war broke out, and <b>they</b> <b>moved</b> back to New York, where she {{continued}} to work as an artist.|$|R

5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} of a typical Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips and a small nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when <b>they</b> <b>move,</b> and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
5|$|As <b>they</b> <b>move</b> {{around the}} city in the van, they pick up {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with the men. She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Ogle Tayloe married Julia Maria Dickinson on November 8, 1824. Although Tayloe {{preferred}} {{to live at}} Windsor, his estate in King George County, Virginia, his wife asked that <b>they</b> <b>move</b> into the city, where she was more comfortable. The house was constructed on Lots 10 and 11 in Square 221. At {{the time of the}} building's construction in 1828, the expanse of the city from 15th Street NW (one block east of the home) to 17th Street NW from the White House north to H Street NW was a flat field bare of trees and shrubs.|$|E

5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares <b>they</b> <b>move</b> forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on a fork in the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest II is a {{role-playing}} video game. It {{allows the}} player to control {{more than one}} character, each of whom has their own characteristics, {{and it is the}} first game in the Dragon Quest series to do so. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members {{during the course of the}} game. The player controls his or her characters as <b>they</b> <b>move</b> in the game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.|$|E
5|$|Dredd {{suspects}} Ma-Ma {{is desperate}} to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson reads Kay's mind and learns that Peach Trees is {{the centre of}} Slo-Mo production and distribution. Anderson suggests they hide while awaiting assistance, but Dredd insists <b>they</b> <b>move</b> up the tower and pursue Ma-Ma. Judges Volt and Guthrie respond to Dredd's call, but Ma-Ma's computer expert denies them entry by persuading them the security system is malfunctioning. A pair of armed teens confront Dredd and Anderson, allowing Kay to disarm and overpower Anderson. Kay then escapes with her as hostage, and takes her to Ma-Ma's base on the top floor.|$|E
