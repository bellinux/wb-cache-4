5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{idea for}} the game was {{inspired}} by , a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix half-jokingly by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, {{some aspects of the}} music, and a weak and confusing plot. Despite these flaws, in general they found the game <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> and addictive, and to {{have a great deal of}} replay value.|$|E
5|$|Many {{reviews for}} DJ Hero felt the {{addition}} of the non-scoring freeform samples during certain parts of mixes were unnecessary and difficult to use, and with the limited number of samples available, ultimately would lead to overuse and make the mixes sound worse. Reviewers were critical of the game's lackluster multiplayer modes. The DJ-vs-DJ mode was considered poor as both players play the same mix, in consideration of current band-based music games where different players can play different parts of a song. This leads to minimal engagement between players, with each just attempting to maximize their score whenever possible on the controller. While some reviewers considered the DJ-vs-Guitar modes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun,</b> others felt it was more a novelty due to the current tracks offered for this mode in the game. The game's graphics were also considered as a negative, often using many strobing lights and creating concerns about possible epilepic seizures that could occur while watching the game. The character designs of the non-celebrity avatars also continued to have the same Muppet-like appearances that occur in the Guitar Hero series, and are overly stereotyped.|$|E

5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room {{while they were}} changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun,</b> crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E

[...] Shoe Shop also starred Walters as a mad shoe shop saleswoman and Wood as her customer. In the sketch she delivers Wood a pair of high-heeled shoes, though Wood requested a flat pair. Walters snaps off the heels and replies, [...] "flatter now".|$|E

500|$|According to Canham, he {{met with}} Elliott in December 1968 and offered him the job of {{associate}} athletic director. [...] Canham told Elliott he could stay on as coach if he wanted, but Canham could not promise him that the job of associate athletic director would still be open in another couple of years. [...] Canham said: [...] "Bump smiled at me and said, ‘I don’t {{have to think about}} it.’ [...] He was ready to get out. [...] I did not force him, and I mean that in all honesty. [...] But the job had ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> for him." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Bernarr Macfadden's Teck Publications, {{the owner}} of Amazing Stories, was running into {{financial}} difficulties, and in 1938 the magazine was sold to Ziff-Davis, a Chicago-based publisher. [...] Raymond Palmer, the editor, was a local fan. [...] Under Sloane Amazing had been dull; Palmer wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun,</b> and soon transformed the magazine, publishing escapist stories. [...] He was unable to make Amazing into a real rival to Astounding, and Ashley speculates that Bernard G. Davis, who ran the editorial offices of Ziff-Davis, may have instructed Palmer to focus on entertainment rather than on serious science fiction.|$|E
500|$|The episode's musical style varies significantly. Buffy's opening number, [...] "Going Through the Motions", was {{influenced}} heavily by the Disney song [...] "Part of Your World" [...] sung by Ariel in The Little Mermaid. Whedon {{wanted to use}} a similar opening in which the heroine explains her yearning. While singing her song, Buffy fights three vampires and a demon who themselves break into a choreographed dance; Whedon wanted this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> but not distracting. The song ends with chord influences from Stephen Schwartz's Pippin and a visual tribute to Disney: as Buffy stakes a vampire, it turns to dust that swirls around her face.|$|E

500|$|One of The Thousand-Year Doors main features, {{the use of}} a paper-based {{gameplay}} mechanic, {{was welcomed}} by reviewers. When referring to the paper theme, 1UP commented that [...] "It's a cohesive, clever approach that turns the game's visual style into more than just a look." [...] Critics also commented extensively on the game's battle system, which deviated from traditional RPGs. GameSpy praised the use of timing in the battle system, stating that [...] "these twitch elements were designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> and engaging, and they succeed wonderfully at this." [...] Reviewers also praised the concept of having an audience to reward or berate Mario during battle.|$|E
500|$|Roberts and showrunner Steven Moffat {{wanted to}} bring Craig back, having enjoyed [...] "The Lodger" [...] and Corden's performance. Though [...] "Closing Time" [...] was {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun,</b> with comedy built around the double act of Smith and Corden, it contains themes and an epilogue that lead into the finale. The episode marks the first appearance of the Cybermats in the revival of Doctor Who, and they were appropriately redesigned. Much of the episode was filmed in a department store and a private home in Cardiff at night, with shooting going early into the morning. [...] "Closing Time" [...] was watched by 6.93 million viewers in the UK and received generally positive reviews from critics; while the performances, comedy, and emotional moments were praised, many critics were not pleased with the usage of the Cybermen.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{complained that}} Conan copied many ideas from God of War. [...] Game Informer {{referred}} to this imitation as [...] " [...] groveling at Kratos' feet, begging for gameplay wisdom". [...] A few reviewers, however, found this forgivable and stated that the game was made <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> without any higher ambitions. [...] Conans camera system irritated several critics for failing to provide an adequate view of the situation at certain critical moments. [...] Its puzzles were oversimple and lacked clear directions for proceeding to the next step. [...] The artificial intelligence for the adversaries in the game {{was found to be}} predictable and flawed by a few critics. [...] In addition, they found the final encounter with Graven to be overlong and frustrating. [...] Calling the fight [...] "as painful as a trip to the proctologist", IGN and Game Informer judged it {{to be one of the}} worst boss fights in video game history.|$|E

500|$|FreeSpace was Volition's first project {{after the}} split from Parallax Software, which also spawned Outrage Entertainment. It {{is not part}} of the canon of the Descent {{computer}} game series, and contained none of its ideas and only small portions of its code. It was only prefixed with Descent to avoid trademark issues with Mijenix Corporation's [...] "FreeSpace", a disk compression utility. Volition also used the term [...] "FreeSpace" [...] in the game to initially describe what became later known as subspace. The game was conceived by Adam Pletcher, with all the features of space simulator games his team had found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun.</b> The games [...] and Wing Commander were their primary inspirations, and those influences made their way into the game's flight model, along with the influence of historical WWII dogfights. Themes from the fiction of Star Wars, , and Ender's Game form a part in shaping the background and story of the FreeSpace world. The chaotic battles between masses of ships commonly found in science-fiction anime became one of the features of FreeSpace.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} overall well {{received}} by game critics. Greg Miller of IGN considered the title to be [...] "one {{of the best}} PlayStation 3 games to date". Core to the game's success, according to reviewers, were the basic mechanics of the game. [...] Giant Bomb's Brad Shoemaker considered that Sucker Punch had [...] "nailed the basic gameplay elements", tying all the {{various aspects of the}} game together. The mixture of Cole's powers with the Karma elements of the game were also praised. The powers and Karma system were seen to bring difficult choices to how the player approach battles. Both sides of the Karma system were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> to play. The mission structure was considered a strong asset of the game. According to X-Play's Matt Kiel, the missions forced the player to consider the full extent of Cole's powers through their difficulty but provided [...] "generous" [...] checkpoints to prevent too much frustration with the game. Reviewers cited the variation in side missions and how they related to the main story as positive aspects of the game.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Bob Sertner {{wanted the}} film to have higher-end special effects to mimic the quality of those seen in feature films. [...] To do this, the film uses visual computer effects created by special effects company Area 51 FX, which created over 100 different shots using the digital modeling program LightWave 3D. During shooting, special effect supervisor Craig Weiss noted that the scenes with Randy Quaid were particularly difficult to capture on film due to his appearing in multiple scenes where his character was chased by twisters and surrounded by their destructive aftermaths. The actors also faced new challenges, as the film often replaced traditional green screen setup, where the special effects were added during editing, with live shots taken with the effects {{in place at the}} same time. Nancy McKeon, who was pregnant with her first child during production, filmed some of her scenes using a green screen. She found the experience <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun,</b> noting that it challenges actors to use their imaginations while performing. She also found it easy to play a television reporter due to her being a self-admitted [...] "news junkie." ...|$|E

500|$|Concerning the game's playability, the Japanese {{release was}} judged [...] "impossible to play" [...] by GameSpot and IGN, which both felt the Western {{versions}} were an improvement, {{even though the}} game was still [...] "far more sensitive than it ought to be". Still, Game Revolution found the car default settings unbalanced and hard to re-adjust properly, and criticized the game's inconsistent AI, like Allgame and IGN. Famitsu reported long load times and a high difficulty level, noting that the game was aimed more toward fans of sim racing than fans of arcade-style gameplay, due {{to the difficulty of}} steering. Game Informer and GameZone echoed Famitsus review, stating that the load times quickly become a [...] "game-ending nightmare", and calling the game's handling [...] "touchy", [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "revolutionary", but acknowledging that most players would simply find it too challenging and frustrating <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun.</b> While Game Informer alleged that [...] "there is a masterpiece for driving simulator buffs buried in here", Allgame was much more negative, stating that the cars [...] "seem overly light on their tires" [...] and that it [...] "feels like you're driving on ice".|$|E
500|$|... 1602 {{received}} mixed praised {{upon its}} release with Comics Bulletin stating [...] "Is 1602 good? Yes, it's damn good. Is it revolutionary or even ground breaking? No. Sorry, but I can't {{go so far}} as to call a glorified What If? series anything more than what it is; a well done re-imagination of the Marvel Universe." [...] Entertainment Weekly declared that the combination of writing and moody artwork meant [...] "the Marvel Universe hasn't been this engrossing in ages." [...] ShakingThrough.net noted that fans looking for elements of Gaiman's The Sandman would be disappointed; [...] "It's not a senses-shattering Marvel epic, but then it's not meant to be. It's nothing more or less than a chance to enjoy reinterpretations of some familiar characters." [...] UGO Networks concurred, stating [...] "there doesn't need to be a 'point' in re-imagining familiar icons — it's simply meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun.</b> [...] The result of 1602 is agreeable entertainment." [...] The series won several awards, including the Quill Book Award for Graphic Novels. The first issue was also awarded the 2003 Diamond Distributors Gem Award as [...] "Comic of the Year".|$|E
500|$|Cool World {{opened at}} sixth on the North American box office, with $5.5 million. Its {{lifetime}} gross was $14.1 million, {{a little more}} than half its reported $28 million budget. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes collected a sample of 45 reviews and judged 4% of them to be positive. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Cool World [...] "misses one opportunity after another", describing it as [...] "a surprisingly incompetent film". Deseret News reviewer Chris Hicks described it as [...] "a one-joke movie – and it's a dirty joke. [...] And much of what's going on here seems more angry and nasty than inspired or funny." [...] Variety reviewer Brian Lowry compared the film to an extended music video, praising the soundtrack and visuals, but panning the story. Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "too serious <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fun</b> [...] too goofy to take seriously", and the lead characters as [...] "unlikable and unappealing". The Washington Post reviewer Hal Hinson wondered [...] "whether Kim Basinger is more obnoxious as a cartoon or as a real person," [...] and felt that the combination of animation and live action was unconvincing. Contributing to the low box office was the fact the studio withdrew all advertising support after the opening weekend.|$|E
