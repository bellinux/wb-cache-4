50|$|Following the {{experience}} with AVR, a full scale power station (the <b>thorium</b> <b>high-temperature</b> <b>reactor</b> or THTR-300 rated at 300 MW) was constructed, dedicated to using thorium as the fuel. THTR-300 suffered a number of technical difficulties, and owing to these and political events in Germany, was closed after only four years of operation. One cause for the closing was an accident on 4 May 1986 with a limited release of the radioactive inventory into the environment. Although the radiological impact of this accident remained small, it is of major relevance for PBR history. The release of radioactive dust {{was caused by a}} human error during a blockage of pebbles in a pipe. Trying to restart the pebbles' movement by increasing gas flow led to stirring up of dust, always present in PBRs, which was then released, radioactive and unfiltered, into the environment due to an erroneously open valve.|$|E
40|$|The failure {{probability}} {{of the top}} structure of plants of the <b>thorium</b> <b>high-temperature</b> <b>reactor</b> series 300 (THTR- 300) and the planned high-temperature reactor 500 under consideration is being quantified {{as part of this}} study for beyond-design events using probabilistic methods. The top structure is studiet because this component is exposed to a high thermal load {{in the case of a}} beyond-design event if it causes the failure of the forced cooling. Failure of this structure will cause the top reflector to wholly or partially fall onto the core surface, which will result in a drastic change of the physical boundary conditions of the reactor. Quantification of the failure probabilities for different beyond- design events will establish periods during which measures for component preservation can be initiated. Boundary conditions for operator action can be derived from the margins for action determined to describe possibly conflicting aims with respect to plant and component preservation on the one hand and the prevention of radioactive releases on the other...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to facilitate a better understanding of the fuel-cycle and nuclear material disposition issues associated with high-temperature gas reactors (HTGRs). This paper reviews the nuclear fuel cycles supporting early and present day gas reactors, and identifies challenges for the advanced fuel cycles and waste management systems supporting the next generation of HTGRs, including the Very High Temperature Reactor, which is under development in the Generation IV Program. The earliest gas-cooled reactors were the carbon dioxide (CO 2) -cooled reactors. Historical experience is available from over 1, 000 reactor-years of operation from 52 electricity-generating, CO 2 -cooled reactor plants that were placed in operation worldwide. Following the CO 2 reactor development, seven HTGR plants were built and operated. The HTGR came about from the combination of helium coolant and graphite moderator. Helium was used instead of air or CO 2 as the coolant. The helium gas has a significant technical base due to the experience gained in the United States from the 40 -MWe Peach Bottom and 330 -MWe Fort St. Vrain reactors designed by General Atomics. Germany also built and operated the 15 -MWe Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor (AVR) and the 300 -MWe <b>Thorium</b> <b>High-Temperature</b> <b>Reactor</b> (THTR) power plants. The AVR, THTR, Peach Bottom and Fort St. Vrain all used fuel containing thorium in various forms (i. e., carbides, oxides, thorium particles) and mixtures with highly enriched uranium. The operational experience gained from these early gas reactors can be applied to the next generation of nuclear power systems. HTGR systems are being developed in South Africa, China, Japan, the United States, and Russia. Elements of the HTGR system evaluated included fuel demands on uranium ore mining and milling, conversion, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication; fuel management in-core; spent fuel characteristics affecting fuel recycling and refabrication, fuel handling, interim storage, packaging, transportation, waste forms, waste treatment, decontamination and decommissioning issues; and low-level waste (LLW) and high-level waste (HLW) disposal...|$|E

As part of the viability study, an initial analysis of the reactor core physics performance was performed, including coolant reactivity effects, fuel burnup cycle length, and transient behaviors. Considerable attention was given to the coolant void reactivity feedback effects, which are highly dependent on salt composition and core geometry. The coolant void coefficient ranges from negative for lighter element salts such as lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride, to substantially positive for heavier element salts such as sodium fluoride and zirconium fluoride. Due to the large thermal inertial of the graphite-moderated core and coolant pool, and the excellent passive decay heat removal characteristics of the system, temperature transients appear to be very slow and relatively benign.

40|$|A combined-cycle {{power plant}} is {{described}} that uses (1) heat from a <b>high-temperature</b> nuclear <b>reactor</b> to meet base-load electrical demands and (2) {{heat from the}} same <b>high-temperature</b> <b>reactor</b> and burning natural gas, jet fuel, or hydrogen to meet peak-load electrical demands. For base-load electricity production, fresh air is compressed; then flows through a heat exchanger, where it is heated to between 700 and 900 C by heat provided by a <b>high-temperature</b> nuclear <b>reactor</b> via an intermediate heat-transport loop; and finally exits through a high-temperature gas turbine to produce electricity. The hot exhaust from the Brayton-cycle gas turbine is then fed to a {{heat recovery steam generator}} that provides steam to a steam turbine for added electrical power production. To meet peak electricity demand, the air is first compressed and then heated with the heat from a <b>high-temperature</b> <b>reactor.</b> Natural gas, jet fuel, or hydrogen is then injected into the hot air in a combustion chamber, combusts, and heats the air to 1300 C-the operating conditions for a standard natural-gas-fired combined-cycle plant. The hot gas then flows through a gas turbine and a heat recovery steam generator before being sent to the exhaust stack. The higher temperatures increase the plant efficiency and power output. If hydrogen is used, it can be produced at night using energy from the nuclear reactor and stored until needed. With hydrogen serving as the auxiliary fuel for peak power production, the electricity output to the electric grid can vary from zero (i. e., when hydrogen is being produced) to the maximum peak power while the nuclear reactor operates at constant load. Because nuclear heat raises air temperatures above the auto-ignition temperatures of the various fuels and powers the air compressor, the power output can be varied rapidly (compared with the capabilities of fossil-fired turbines) to meet spinning reserve requirements and stabilize the electric grid. This combined cycle uses the unique characteristics of <b>high-temperature</b> <b>reactors</b> (T> 700 C) to produce electricity for premium electric markets whose demands can not be met by other types of nuclear reactors. It may also make the use of nuclear reactors economically feasible in smaller electrical grids, such as those found in many developing countries.
