40|$|The {{mandarin}} horticultural {{group is}} an important component of world citrus production for the fresh fruit market. This group formerly classified as C. reticulata is highly polymorphic and recent molecular studies have suggested that numerous cultivated mandarins were introgressed by C. maxima (the pummelos). C. maxima and C. reticulata are also the ancestors of sweet and sour oranges, grapefruit, and therefore of all the "small citrus" modern varieties (mandarins, <b>tangors,</b> tangelos) derived from sexual hybridization between these horticultural groups. Recently, NGS technologies have greatly modified how plant evolution and genomic structure are analyzed, moving from phylogenetics to phylogenomics. The objective of this work was to develop a workflow for phylogenomic inference from Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) data and to analyze the interspecific admixture along the nine citrus chromosomes for horticultural groups and recent varieties resulting from the combination of the C. reticulata and C. maxima gene pools. A GBS library was established from 55 citrus varieties, using the ApekI restriction enzyme and selective PCR to improve the read depth. Diagnostic polymorphisms (DPs) of C. reticulata/C. maxima differentiation were identified and used to decipher the phylogenomic structure of the 55 varieties. The GBS approach was powerful and revealed 30, 289 SNPs and 8, 794 Indels with 12. 6 % of missing data. 11, 133 DPs were selected covering the nine chromosomes with a higher density in genic regions. GBS combined with the detection of DPs was powerful for deciphering the "phylogenomic karyotypes" of cultivars derived from admixture of the two ancestral species after a limited number of interspecific recombinations. All the mandarins, mandarin hybrids, tangelos and <b>tangors</b> analyzed displayed introgression of C. maxima {{in different parts of the}} genome. C. reticulata/C. maxima admixture should be a major component of the high phenotypic variability of this germplasm opening up the way for association studies based on phylogenomics...|$|R
50|$|Citrus {{trees are}} not {{generally}} frost hardy. Mandarin oranges (C. reticulata) {{tend to be}} the hardiest of the common Citrus species and can withstand short periods down to as cold as −10 C, but realistically temperatures not falling below −2 C are required for successful cultivation. Tangerines, <b>tangors</b> and yuzu can be grown outside even in regions with more marked sub-freezing temperatures in winter, although this may affect fruit quality. A few hardy hybrids can withstand temperatures well below freezing, but do not produce quality fruit. Lemons can be commercially grown in cooler-summer/moderate-winter, coastal Southern California, because sweetness is neither attained nor expected in retail lemon fruit. The related trifoliate orange (Citrus trifoliata) can survive below −20 C; its fruit are astringent and inedible unless cooked but a few better-tasting cultivars and hybrids have been developed (see citranges).The trees thrive in a consistently sunny, humid environment with fertile soil and adequate rainfall or irrigation. Abandoned trees in valleys may suffer, yet survive, the dry summer of Central California's Inner Coast Ranges. At any age citrus grows well enough with infrequent irrigation in partial shade, but the fruit crop is smaller. Being of tropical and sub-tropical origin, oranges, like all citrus, are broadleaved and evergreen. They do not drop leaves except when stressed. The stems of many varieties have large sharp thorns. The trees flower in the spring, and fruit is set shortly afterward. Fruit begins to ripen in fall or early winter months, depending on cultivar, and develops increasing sweetness afterward. Some cultivars of tangerines ripen by winter. Some, such as the grapefruit, may take up to eighteen months to ripen.|$|R
40|$|Most {{cultivated}} Citrus species {{originated from}} interspecific hybridisation between four ancestral taxa (C. reticulata, C. maxima, C. medica, and C. micrantha) with limited further interspecific recombination due to vegetative propagation. This evolution resulted in admixture genomes with frequent interspecific heterozygosity. Moreover, {{a major part}} of the phenotypic diversity of edible citrus results from the initial differentiation between these taxa. Deciphering the phylogenomic structure of citrus germplasm is therefore essential for an efficient utilization of citrus biodiversity in breeding schemes. The objective of this work was to develop a set of species-diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the four Citrus ancestral taxa covering the nine chromosomes, and to use these markers to infer the phylogenomic structure of secondary species and modern cultivars. Species-diagnostic SNPs were mined from 454 amplicon sequencing of 57 gene fragments from 26 genotypes of the four basic taxa. Of the 1, 053 SNPs mined from 28, 507 kb sequence, 273 were found to be highly diagnostic for a single basic taxon. Species-diagnostic SNP markers (105) were used to analyse the admixture structure of varieties and rootstocks. This revealed C. maxima introgressions in most of the old and in all recent selections of mandarins, and suggested that C. reticulata × C. maxima reticulation and introgression processes were important in edible mandarin domestication. The large range of phylogenomic constitutions between C. reticulata and C. maxima revealed in mandarins, tangelos, <b>tangors,</b> sweet oranges, sour oranges, grapefruits, and orangelos is favourable for genetic association studies based on phylogenomic structures of the germplasm. Inferred admixture structures were in agreement with previous hypotheses regarding the origin of several secondary species and also revealed the probable origin of several acid citrus varieties. The developed species-diagnostic SNP marker set will be useful for systematic estimation of admixture structure of citrus germplasm and for diverse genetic studies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Utilizou-se o método de cultivo {{in vitro}} de segmentos de epicótilo em meio com colchicina (0, 025, 0, 05 e 0, 1 %), por diversos períodos (1, 2, 3, 7 e 14 dias), com subseqüente regeneração de brotações em meio sem a presença do alcalóide.

The {{objective}} of this work was to obtain autotetraploid plants of 'Murcott' <b>tangor,</b> 'Ponkan' mandarin and 'Pêra-de-abril' sweet orange {{to be used in}} crosses with diploid cultivars, aiming to produce triploid seedless hybrids.

All shoots obtained were micro-grafted, acclimatized and transferred to a greenhouse. The evaluation of the ploidy level of the plants was performed by flow citometry technique. Colchicine was toxic to the explants of three varieties, and caused the reduction on the average number of shoots regenerated per explant as well as an increase in the percentage of non-responsive explants when comparing with the control plants. Among four plants of sweet orange obtained, two of them showed to be autotetraploid. The only plant of <b>tangor</b> obtained also showed to be autotetraploid. These plants presented thicker and roundisher leaves displaying deeper green color. The methodology used resulted efficient for obtaining tetraploid plants...|$|E
40|$|Nucellar {{tissues of}} seven Citrus {{varieties}} were introduced onto three growth media to produce embryogenic callus. The media tested were: EME [MT, modified, {{with the addition}} of malt extract (500 mg. L- 1) ]; 1 / 2 -EME [half concentration of MT macronutrients + half concentration of BH 3 macronutrients + 500 mg. L- 1 malt extract + 1. 55 g. L- 1 of glutamine]; and EBA [EME + 0. 44 muM 6 -benzyladenine + 0. 04 muM 2, 4 D]. Soft friable calli were obtained from 'Cravo' and 'Ponkan' mandarins (Citrus reticulata, Blanco), 'Murcott' <b>tangor</b> (Citrus reticulata Blanco x Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck), 'Serra d'água' and 'Valencia' sweet oranges (Citrus sinensis, L. Osbeck) 120 days after callus induction. 'Natal' and 'Pera' sweet oranges (Citrus sinensis, L. Osbeck) produced hard non-friable calli in this period. EME and 1 / 2 -EME media had the best results for 'Cravo' mandarin, 'Ponkan' mandarin and 'Serra d'água' sweet orange, whereas EBA was the best media composition to induce soft friable calli on 'Murcott' <b>tangor</b> and 'Valencia' sweet orange. Friable callus cultures of 'Cravo' and 'Ponkan' mandarins, and 'Murcott' <b>tangor</b> yielded high quality protoplasts after isolation.
