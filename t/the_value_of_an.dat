5|$|AOL is an {{internet}} company founded in 1985 as Quantum Computing Services. Each acquisition {{is for the}} respective company in its entirety. The acquisition date listed is {{the date of the}} agreement between AOL and the subject of the acquisition. The value of each acquisition is listed in US dollars because AOL is headquartered in the United States. If <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acquisition is not listed, then it is undisclosed.|$|E
5|$|After the {{valuable}} coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe {{for the previous}} years in one sum. Historians estimate that the peasant families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay this amount, especially because they also had to pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E
5|$|In 694, Ine {{extracted}} {{compensation of}} 30,000 pence from the Kentishmen {{for the death}} of Mul; this amount represented <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aetheling's life in the Saxon system of Weregild. Ine appears to have retained control of Surrey, but did not recover Kent. No king of Wessex was to venture so far east until Egbert, over a hundred years later.|$|E
50|$|Currency {{converters}} {{are often}} used as <b>a</b> means <b>of</b> checking <b>the</b> relative <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> currency before exchanging it into another currency. This is useful for the traveler because the traveler can check <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign county’s currency before exchanging money. These programs list <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foreign country’s currency relative to the traveler’s own currency.|$|R

30|$|To {{estimate}} the permeability using SDR model in routine mode (Eq.  2), <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> should be calculated using core permeability data and geometric mean of transverse relaxation time (T 2 gm). To calculate <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>A,</b> {{it is needed}} to put <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> permeability in Eq.  2 and draw diagram kcore againstϕ ^ 4 · T_ 2 gm^ 2. Then, {{the slope of the}} best linear fit of the data with zero intercept represents <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> as in Fig.  8. According to the coefficient of determination 0.96, this <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>A,</b> i.e., 0.0939 can be used for the samples.|$|R
5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the Patriotic Party was {{that before the}} treaty is signed, {{they need to see}} more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing international situation (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) suddenly and temporarily increased <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist Patriotic Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals were exchanged between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most of the demands the Polish side was finding difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|Davis fell in {{love with}} Sarah Knox Taylor, {{daughter}} of his commanding officer, future president Zachary Taylor. Both Sarah and Davis sought Taylor's permission to marry. Taylor refused, as he did not wish his daughter to have the difficult life of a military wife on frontier army posts. Davis's own experience led him to appreciate Taylor's objection. He consulted with his older brother Joseph, and they both began to question <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Army career. Davis hesitated to leave, but his desire for Sarah overcame this, and he resigned his commission in a letter dated April 20, 1835. He had arranged for the letter to be sent to the War Department for him on May 12 when he did not return from leave; he had made no mention to Taylor of his intention to resign. Against his former commander's wishes, on June 17, he married Sarah in Louisville, Kentucky. His resignation became effective June 30.|$|E

30|$|With {{the amount}} <b>of</b> SP increasing, <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> increases.

30|$|Then, we {{know that}} <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and B that {{minimise}} E[C] depend on E[a], E[b], E[c], PG(x) and PH(y); that is, {{even if we do}} not know the predictions g and h, we can determine <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and B that minimise E[C] if we know the prediction error distributions PG(x) and PH(y).|$|R

30|$|As can be observed, an {{increase}} in F from 0.55 to 0.60 reduces e_T from 0.70 to 0.67, as well as R which declines from 8.64 % to 6.80 %. Note that <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> temporary job to the firm (Π ^T) is higher than <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> permanent job (Π ^P), thus rationalizing why all new jobs are created under TC.|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} literature {{over the}} past thirty years has evaluated tradeoffs between money and fatality risks. These values in turn serve as estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> statistical life. This article reviews more than 60 studies of mortality risk premiums from ten countries and approximately 40 studies that present estimates of injury risk premiums. This critical review examines <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> econometric issues, the role of unionization in risk premiums, and the effects <b>of</b> age on <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> statistical life. Our meta-analysis indicates <b>an</b> income elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> statistical life from about 0. 5 to 0. 6.

25|$|Motorola {{replaced}} the MC68008 with the MC68HC001 in 1990. This chip resembled the 68HC000 in most respects, but its data bus could operate in either 16-bit or 8-bit mode, depending on <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> input pin at reset. Thus, like the 68008, {{it could be}} used in systems with cheaper 8-bit memories.|$|E
25|$|With wear in use, {{the paint}} wears off {{around the edges}} and {{displays}} a characteristic wear pattern that reveals the paint colors underneath.

25|$|People contributed in {{the form}} of cash, {{construction}} materials or labor, and even vacant lots for the building of schools. Community support for the building of schools was such that by 1906, there were already 99 schools in Nueva Ecija.

25|$|Systems of {{constructive}} set theory, such as CST, CZF, and IZF, embed their set axioms in intuitionistic {{instead of}} classical logic. Yet other systems accept classical logic but feature a nonstandard membership relation. These include {{rough set theory}} and fuzzy set theory, in which <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> atomic formula embodying the membership relation is not simply True or False. The Boolean-valued models of ZFC are a related subject.|$|E
25|$|If {{building}} a bigger network {{is one reason}} to subsidize adoption, then stimulating value adding innovations is the other. Consider, for example, <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> operating system with no applications. While Apple initially tried to charge {{both sides of the}} market, like Adobe did in figure 2, Microsoft uncovered a second pricing rule: subsidize those who add platform value. In this context, consumers, not developers are the money side.|$|E
25|$|School {{districts are}} rarely {{precisely}} coextensive with the cities, towns, villages, or hamlets that bear the same name, meaning {{that a person}} living in one hamlet or village might {{send their children to}} a school associated with a different hamlet or village. Residents pay school taxes to the same school district in which they live and any children living with them attend school. All tax-paying residents are eligible for the STAR Program tax rebate, which in effect lessens <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individual's primary residence to lessen the tax burden on the residence.|$|E
