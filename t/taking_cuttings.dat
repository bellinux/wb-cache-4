2500|$|Auxins are {{compounds}} that positively influence cell enlargement, bud formation and root initiation. They also promote {{the production of}} other hormones and in conjunction with cytokinins, they control the growth of stems, roots, and fruits, and convert stems into flowers. [...] Auxins were the first class of growth regulators discovered. They affect cell elongation by altering cell wall plasticity. They stimulate cambium, a subtype of meristem cells, to divide and in stems cause secondary xylem to differentiate. Auxins act to inhibit the growth of buds lower down the stems (apical dominance), and also to promote lateral and adventitious root development and growth. [...] Leaf abscission is initiated by the growing point of a plant ceasing to produce auxins. [...] Auxins in seeds regulate specific protein synthesis, as they develop within the flower after pollination, causing the flower to develop a fruit to contain the developing seeds. Auxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, synthetic auxin herbicides including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have been developed and used for weed control. Auxins, especially 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when <b>taking</b> <b>cuttings</b> of plants. [...] The most common auxin found in plants is indole-3-acetic acid or IAA. The correlation of auxins and cytokinins in the plants is a constant (A/C = const.).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental study, development of mathematical model and parametric optimization for surface roughness in turning D 2 steel using TiN coated carbide insert using Taguchi parameter design and response surface methodology. The experimental plan and analysis {{was based on}} the Taguchi L 27 orthogonal array <b>taking</b> <b>cutting</b> speed (v), feed (f) and depth of cut (d) as important cutting parameters. The influence of the machining parameters on the surface finish has also been investigated and the optimum cutting condition for minimizing the surface roughness is evaluated. The optimal parametric combination for TiN coated cutting insert is found to be v 3 -f 1 -d 3. The ANOVA result shows that feed the most significant process parameter on surface roughness followed by depth of cut. The cutting speed is found to be insignificant from the study. The RSM model shows good accuracy between predicted values and experimental values with 95 % confidence intervals and adequate. It is concluded that the developed RSM model can be effectively utilized to predict the surface roughness in turning D 2 steel...|$|R
40|$|In today’s world AISI 304 {{stainless}} steel contributes to {{almost half of the}} world’s production and consumption for industrial purposes. Austenitic steels are hard materials to machine due to their high strength, high ductility and low thermal conductivity. This paper reports an experimental study on performance characteristics of AISI 304 {{stainless steel}} during CNC milling process. In milling process the surface roughness (SR) and material removal rate (MRR) are the most important performance characteristics, which are influenced by many factors like cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The selection of these parameters at optimum level plays a vital role in getting minimum surface roughness and maximum MRR. This paper presents multi-objective optimization of milling process parameters using Grey-Taguchi method in machining of AISI {{304 stainless steel}}. The experiments are conducted based on Taguchi’s L 27 orthogonal array by <b>taking</b> <b>cutting</b> speed, feed rate and depth of cut at three levels. The Grey relational analysis is used to obtain the relation between the machining parameters and performance characteristics. The complete experimental results are discussed and presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to fit the degradation model proposed by Orskov & McDonald (1979) to data of an in situ degradability trial. Neutral detergent fiber degradations (NDF) of coast cross grass (Cynodon dactylon x Cynodon nlemfunensis) were submitted to twelve cutting ages (30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300, 330 and 360 days) in a complete block design. At each cutting age, NDF degradation was investigated using nine incubation times (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours) in a split-plot design, <b>taking</b> <b>cutting</b> age as main plots and incubation time as subplots. Each plot comprised a non-lactating cow with a permanent ruminal fistula. Variances of the parameter estimates were also obtained, as well as expressions for the estimation of confidence intervals for parameters in the model. A good fit of the model to the data of neutral detergent fiber degradability in the most cutting ages was found. The cutting ages of the coast cross grass influenced the degradability of different fractions, benefiting early stages. In advanced cutting ages the parameters estimates were less precise...|$|R
