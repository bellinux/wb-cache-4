5|$|The {{circular}} keep {{was turned}} into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original interior walls and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on rails and could retract into <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> different storeys were linked by a spiral staircase. The ground floor of the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar running up through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the natural light from the atrium and skylights, the building is further illuminated inside by lightboxes and screens {{that are part of}} the artwork. Other interior details include steel mesh, a central courtyard, panels of stainless steel, pillars with burnished steel, and excerpts from the United States Constitution on the wall. Also, the areas leading into the elevators have clear panels in <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> main staircase is also constructed partly of transparent materials, with the steps made of gray slate. The exterior ribbons of stainless steel also extend into the lobby of the building.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{learns that}} Derek and Sharon {{will be going}} away from town for a few days, with Sharon leaving one {{afternoon}} and Derek the next day. While Sharon is {{on her way to}} pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was seeing Lisa. However, Sharon sees through her lie and attempts to call the police, but Lisa tackles her to <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two engage in a fistfight. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he calls Detective Reese and they both head toward the house. Lisa runs to the attic and Sharon pursues her. Sharon leads her to a weak spot in the attic floor, where Lisa falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an attempt to grab Lisa and lift her up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her. Seeing that the floor is beginning to buckle, Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa falls and smashes onto the glass table below. A chandelier falls from the ceiling onto Lisa, eventually killing her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house. As soon as Detective Reese goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions, Derek soon arrives; he and Sharon then tearfully embrace one another.|$|E

25|$|On June 6, 2007, Bork {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} New York City against the Yale Club over an {{incident}} that had occurred a year earlier. Bork alleged that, while trying to reach the dais to speak at an event, he fell, because of the Yale Club's failure to provide any steps or handrail between <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dais. (After his fall, he successfully climbed to the dais and delivered his speech.) According to the complaint, Bork's injuries required surgery, immobilized him for months, forced him to use a cane, and left him with a limp. In May 2008, Bork and the Yale Club reached a confidential, out-of-court settlement.|$|E
25|$|According to West German {{figures in}} late 1944 the Soviets transported 27,000 to 30,000 ethnic Germans, a {{majority}} of whom were women aged 18 to 35, to the Ukraine and the Donbass for forced labour; about 20% (5,683) were reported dead or missing. Data from Russian archives published in 2001, based on an actual enumeration, put the number of German civilians deported from Yugoslavia to the USSR in early 1945 for reparations labour at 12,579, where 16% (1,994) died. After March 1945, a second phase began in which ethnic Germans were massed into villages such as Gakowa and Kruševlje that were converted into labour camps. All furniture was removed, straw placed on <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> expellees housed like animals under military guard, with minimal food and rampant, untreated disease. Families were divided into the unfit women, old, and children, and those fit for slave labour. A total of 166,970 ethnic Germans were interned, and 48,447 (29%) perished. The camp system was shut down in March 1948.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the south}} exit {{close to the}} main bar, {{opposite}} end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until a minute before 9 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed any available fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room's drop ceiling to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers could not suppress the fast-growing fire. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01p.m. and was on the scene by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could already see smoke coming from the building.|$|E
500|$|Though few {{remains of}} it were found, the great kiva's roof was most likely flat rather than domed, as was typical of smaller kivas in the canyon. It was {{supported}} by four large posts, upon which four more beams were attached. This formed the roof's main structure, which {{was covered with a}} layer of secondary beams, then juniper splints and bark, before being finished with clay. It is not known if the roofs of great kivas were constructed level with the exterior walls or raised above them, but it is believed that the space between <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roof in Chetro Ketl's great kiva was probably not much more than what would be required for average standing height, approximately [...]|$|E

Anderson had a dark gray balloon manufactured by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. A [...] cube-shaped balloon was somewhat unusual, but the Manhattan Project's AAA priority rating ensured prompt delivery with no questions asked. A block and tackle was used to haul it into place, with the top secured to the ceiling and three sides to the walls. The remaining side, the one facing the balcony from which Fermi directed the operation, was furled like an awning. A circle was drawn on <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stacking of graphite blocks began {{on the morning of}} 16 November 1942. The first layer placed was made up entirely of graphite blocks, with no uranium. Layers without uranium were alternated with two layers containing uranium, so the uranium was enclosed in graphite. Unlike later reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system, as it was only intended to be operated at very low power.|$|E
500|$|The wounded {{were set}} upon {{the beach in}} {{preparation}} for the boat trip to New York, but Ebenezer Ledyard, the brother of William Ledyard, offered himself as hostage. The British took the wounded to Ebenezer Avery's house and placed Ebenezer Avery and other wounded inside and had them [...] "parolled". The house was later set on fire with the men inside and [...] "with difficulty extinguished". In the battle, Avery was shot in the neck [...] "which cut the cords, and left him senseless as one of the dead." [...] Hempstead said that thirty-five men had been laid upon <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British left them, unattended and uncovered, until Dr. Downer and Dr. Prentiss arrived. Ebenezer Avery recovered, but lost his hearing, and continued to live in the house until his death on January 11, 1828 at age 81. The blood stains were still visible {{at the time of the}} centennial of the battle in 1881, but no longer are present. In 1896, the Thomas Starr Society placed a memorial tablet on the site.|$|E
500|$|To lend {{a strong}} air of realism to Gordon's death, {{the scene was}} created by {{combining}} various special effects during filming with post-production visual effects. Plastic razor wire with blood tubing aided in the initial phases of the decapitation; it would slightly sink into Brown's neck as pressure was applied, forcing out the fake blood. For the aftermath, Brown laid down on <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> visual effects department removed his head from the shot and recreated it as a three-dimensional model. The department decided to [...] "push {{it a little bit}} farther" [...] by having the head rocking into place and the mouth twitching, but Standards and Practices found it too graphic and forced them to remove the motion. Established in the first-season episode [...] "Dead Man's Blood" [...] were the shark-like teeth of vampires, and the design has been subtly improved with each vampire episode. Though the special effects makeup department used molds of the actors' mouths to create the fanged acrylic dentures, McNab noted that {{it was very difficult to}} speak while wearing them. Blood-like makeup around the actors' mouths helped to round out the vampiric visages.|$|E
