50|$|Finnish has {{a number}} of momentane markers; they differ in the valency and voice of the verbs they produce, but all {{indicate}} sudden, short-lived occurrences; for example, the verb ammahtaa (to dash ahead suddenly; not said of a person) is an anticausative, momentane version of ampua (to shoot). Another example is the verb katsaista (to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look),</b> which is a momentane version of katsoa (to look). For semantic reasons, not all momentane markers can be used with all verbs; for example, an anticausative marker can only be used with verbs representing occurrences that can happen accidentally or on their own. Verbs with momentane markers are considered independent words, and native speakers rarely analyze them, but do synthesize them. Often the parent verb is not in use, leaving only the derived forms such as the momentane.|$|E

30|$|Before {{we start}} with a more {{detailed}} description of the algorithm, we <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> over the fence into the field of mathematical morphology and its application to image processing. There, watershed algorithms are a well known and extensively studied tool for image segmentation. The basic idea is that a grayscale image {{can be thought of as}} a topographic relief. A drop of water that falls somewhere onto this relief will follow the line of steepest descent until it reaches a local minimum. All points that connect to the same local minimum in that manner form a catchment basin. The watershed algorithm therefore segments the picture into catchment basins. The boundaries of the catchment basins are the actual watersheds. This technique is usually applied to the magnitude of the images gradient. In this way, the watershed lines trace regions of high gradients and segment the original image it into connected regions of small gradients. An excellent overview of the watershed techniques used in image processing is given by Roerdink and Meijster (2000).|$|E

The discovery of the “deposit multiplier ” in the 1920 s as well as the developing understanding of open market operations had a very large influence on the post-WWII theory of central bank control of the money supply. While post-war “Keynesian” economists were skeptical of the potency of monetary policy, the Monetarist approach gradually gained adherents and came completely to dominate thinking about monetary policy by the last quarter of the 20 th century. However, Monetarism experienced a quite remarkable turn-around of fortunes at the end of the century.

40|$|The {{trouble with}} housing {{policy is that}} housing {{politics}} is just so damn hard. What might seem like self-evident solutions will affect the wellbeing (perceived or otherwise) of over eight million Australian households, {{the vast majority of}} which are home owners who have, on average, nearly half of their household wealth invested in their home. When we talk about improving housing affordability, what we mean is slowing down house price growth and, with it, the growth of the investments and wealth of almost seven out of every 10 households. That’s a hard sell. Trouble is, all this individual investment in housing wealth is causing pretty serious problems for non home owners and future generations. Because the housing market is interlinked, the astronomical growth in house prices is locking future generations out of home ownership, driving up rents and linking the financial security (investment) of households to their physical security (housing), an inherently risky strategy if one <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> at the United States.

Generally, household consumer product manuals contain a contents section and there are other sections such as safety rules, technical features, the use of the product, the use of the accessories, maintenance and cleaning.

In order to understand these registers there are three contextu-al parameters which are field, tenor and mode variables. Field of discourse refers to the subject and focus of interaction. Tenor of discourse marks the relationship between the interactants. Mode of discourse refers to spoken or written interaction. These three contextual parameters are represented through three meanings; ideational, interpersonal and textual. Concerning the linguistic analysis of the study, Halliday’s systemic functional grammar is applied to operational manuals.

40|$|Abstract—In {{graphical}} user interfaces, when users want {{to operate}} on a file, they usually double-click the file icon to launch the associated application and open the file. Several file operations {{are available in the}} context menu by right-clicking, such as printing and deleting. However, if the user wants to perform some simple operations, such as copying the file contents, opening the file by an application and then selecting a menu, can be cumbersome. Furthermore, operations in the context menu are limited. Thus, in this paper we present Icons++, a user interface which allows users to perform the file operations they want in a quick way by using icons. Through the use of Icons++, users can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> at the file contents, {{and at the same time}} they can perform often-used file operations with only one click, without opening the file by a relevant application.

Then we <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> at a general spectral based analysis/synthesis approach to process audio signals and how to extract features {{that can be used in}} the content-based transformation context. Using this analysis/synthesis approach we give some examples on how content-based transformations can be applied to modify the basic perceptual axis of a sound and how we can even combine different basic effects in order to perform more meaningful transformations.

These structural sections are succinct and articulate well how you arrive at your seal design charts. Per our phone conversation, I saw nothing that should be of major concern. I am including only the two files on which I've made comments (mainly editorial). Response Thank you for your prompt review of the NIOSH report “Explosion pressure design criteria for new seals in U. S. coal mines. ” Your assurance {{of the absence of}} major blunders in the structural dynamics area is most appreciated. With regard to the simple seal design charts, we acknowledge their simplicity and the presence of potentially non-conservative assumptions within our analysis. We do not intend for these charts to become a substitute for proper structural analysis and site specific design of seals. Their intent is to show approximately the kind of seal necessary to resist the three design pressures using a variety of typical seal materials. This approximate seal thickness information is vital for a decision to 1) seal with monitoring, 2) seal without monitoring or 3) continue ventilating an area. We are sincere in our intent to collaborate with Sandia National Laboratories to further examine the structural design of mine seals. Tentatively, we envision two objectives for structural analysis and design work, first to selectively verify a few points on the design charts and second to develop practical methods to protect seals from transient dynamic pressures due to reflected blast or shock waves. For the case of unmonitored sealed area atmospheres, we believe it is necessary to design for the constant volume explosion pressure, since {{there appears to be no}} way to avoid it. However, there may be simple ways to protect such seals from transients with simple countermeasures that are well developed for other applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between historians and archives is generally taken for granted. But this impression is misleading. Across the world, {{the building of}} archival collections involves a complicated process of selection and destruction. Traditionally, historians do not really know how this process is being conducted and very often a good proportion of them believe that all documents should be kept. The evolution {{of history and the}} questioning of the archives by philosophers cannot be ignored and these have changed the {{relationship between}} historians and archives. However, the construction of tomorrow’s archives is happening right now, and historians should be prepared {{to find a way to}} participate in this operation. The role of archivists is central in the whole process. In the past, archivists generally received a basic training as historians, but since the 1950 s, they have been more and more involved with other disciplines like library or information sciences. They became professionals in a new discipline. Historians should take notice of this reality and be prepared to work with archivists on an equal footing. They must learn what archivists are doing and join them to help create archival collections for the future.
