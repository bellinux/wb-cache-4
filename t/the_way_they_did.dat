5|$|As Ziva and Tony {{drive home}} from the airport, she divulges the reason for her resentment of the new director: Orli Elbaz {{was the reason for}} her parents' divorce. She {{discloses}} that she had always believed that it was a political strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now thinks that it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli. When she adds that she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although World War I {{was already}} a few years ago, its {{economic}} impact was not yet over. The cycling companies were still not able to sponsor the cyclists in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> before the war, so as in 1919, 1920 and 1921 they bundled their forces under the nick La Sportive. The cyclists were divided in two categories, this time named 1ère classe (first class), the professionals, and 2ème classe (second class), the amateurs.|$|E
25|$|Various {{schools of}} thought have emerged {{surrounding}} several key questions surrounding the Cultural Revolution, seeking to explain why events unfolded <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> why it began in the first place, and what it was. The movement's complexities contain many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven to fruition {{by a series of}} grassroots-led popular uprisings against the Communist establishment. While Mao's leadership was pivotal {{at the beginning of the}} movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision. In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a much more decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning a large number of 'local revolutions' which differed in their nature and goals.|$|E

Lamounier declared he was not surprised that things turned out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> as, in his words, [...] "with what I knew of them, I think it's quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family, they don't measure the consequences {{to get what they}} want.

500|$|Despite vows by {{prosecutors}} and heads {{of federal law}} enforcement agencies that the decision would not change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> undercover operations, there were some noticeable, {{at least at the}} federal level. Later versions of the Attorney General's Guidelines on FBI Undercover Operations, widely emulated by other federal agencies, show some changes in language from those published before Jacobson. [...] "Entrapment should be avoided", became [...] "entrapment must be avoided", and investigators were told it must be apparent to them that the activity they were investigating was illegal, rather than just corrupt. A definition of entrapment was included that used the same language as the decision.|$|E
500|$|... "The Stolen Eagle" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer and co-creator Bruno Heller and directed by Michael Apted, who also directed the following two episodes. Heller said {{the era of the}} Roman Empire was [...] "pivotal in Western history. If things hadn't turned out <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> at that particular point, the world that we live in now would be very different." [...] He decided {{to tell the story of}} the series from the perspectives of two common soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo. According to Heller, [...] "They are the only two ordinary soldiers mentioned by Caesar in his book, so the idea was to do a sort of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern take. I essentially took the seed of that idea to try to tell a big historical epic, but from the street level, the everyman's point of view." ...|$|E

500|$|While filming in St. Louis and Detroit, Reitman {{placed an}} ad in the paper asking if people who {{recently}} lost their job wanted to be in a documentary about job loss. He specified [...] "documentary" [...] in the ad so that actors would not respond. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it had been. The film crew received a startling 100 responses, including 60 people filmed (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis). Twenty-two are seen in the film. The interviews ran for about ten minutes on {{what it is like to}} lose their job in this poor economy, and after that they would [...] "fire" [...] them on camera and ask them to either respond <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they wished they had responded.|$|E
500|$|Zap2it writer Rick Porter said he {{was glad}} to see Ben and Leslie come {{together}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> particularly because he feared the no-dating rule would become an [...] "artificial barrier" [...] that dragged out the romance subplot. Porter also praised Rob Lowe's performance, and said it made the character likeable even as he kept Leslie and Ben apart. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called it a [...] "stellar" [...] episode that was [...] "loose, silly, rich with details and heart". While he said the episode included good [...] "outrageous comedy", he said the script strives on the more subtle scenes about Leslie and Ben coming together, along with Chris' constant interruptions. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic was underwhelmed by the Know Ya Boo story, but strongly praised Leslie and Ben's scenes, which he said were both touching and very funny. He particularly praised the way [...] scene when Ben describes his feelings for Leslie through his description to the baseball tournament panel about why he loves Pawnee.|$|E
500|$|Billy Mays, a {{television}} advertisement salesman, {{is the first}} dead celebrity featured in the episode, and plays {{a large role in}} the early part of the script. Mays' son, Billy Mays III, a self-proclaimed South Park fan, said he loved [...] "Dead Celebrities", and found its portrayal of his father tasteful and respectful. He said, [...] "South Park gets a little edgy sometimes, but at their core, they're just social satire, you know? I think it was natural for them to do a dead celebrities episode with this whole summer and how it's been, and I think <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> it was pretty tasteful for the most part." [...] The spirit of David Carradine is shown wearing lingerie and with a noose around his neck, a reference to his June 3, 2009, death by autoerotic asphyxiation. Among the others featured in the episode were actress Farrah Fawcett, journalist Walter Cronkite, disc jockey Adam Goldstein (DJ AM), politician Ted Kennedy, actress Beatrice Arthur, television personality Ed McMahon, actor Patrick Swayze, actress Natasha Richardson, hot dog magnate Oscar G. Mayer, Jr. and actor/chef Dom DeLuise.|$|E

[...] In contrast to her previous album, which was darker because Goodrem had written about her cancer battle, Delta reflects changes in her personal life; her parents had divorced, she let her mother Lea stand down as her manager as well as discussed her relationship with pop-singer Brian McFadden, whom Delta co-wrote the majority of the songs on the album.|$|E
