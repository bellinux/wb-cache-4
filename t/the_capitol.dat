5000|$|The architects who {{designed}} <b>the</b> New <b>Capitol</b> were given <b>the</b> starting assumption that <b>the</b> Old <b>Capitol</b> [...] - [...] {{which had to}} remain in use until <b>the</b> New <b>Capitol</b> was completed [...] - [...] would be removed. Therefore, the design of <b>the</b> New <b>Capitol</b> in no way reflected {{the style of the}} old one. The site design, also, was prepared under the assumption that the space occupied by <b>the</b> Old <b>Capitol</b> would be vacant. Since the preservation movement did not begin until after <b>the</b> New <b>Capitol</b> had been competed, and the demolition was being prepared for, {{it was too late to}} make any changes to either <b>the</b> New <b>Capitol</b> or <b>the</b> site.|$|R

In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage.|$|E

5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b> No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested they keep <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b> Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> the secondary target.|$|E
