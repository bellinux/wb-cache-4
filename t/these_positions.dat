Operations of <b>these</b> <b>positioning</b> systems are summarized using flowcharts and figures.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} monolithic flexure {{mechanisms in}} general and in detail with their advantages and disadvantages. They are produced by electro-discharge machining (EDM), mostly wire-EDM. The fundamental possibilities for calculation are given for leaf spring type mechanisms and flexures with semicircular notch hinges. The paper contains different design examples of flexure mechanisms in connection with piezoactuators, especially for the generation of rotary motions and clamp motions. Additionally it offers the design of two positioning systems for precise rotary motion. <b>These</b> <b>positioning</b> systems consist mainly of such flexure mechanisms and piezoelectric actuators. Graphics and photos illustrate their structure. The concluding diagram shows what a high angular resolution (0. 025 seconds of arc) could be measured for <b>these</b> <b>positioning</b> systems, because of their structure with piezoelectric actuators in connection with flexure mechanisms. It confirms the suitability of flexure mechanisms for precise motion transmission systems...|$|R

5|$|At a {{professional}} level, most matches produce {{only a few}} goals. For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, {{but a number of}} specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in <b>these</b> <b>positions</b> are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. <b>These</b> <b>positions</b> are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a formation. Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper.

Though {{there are a variety of}} positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, <b>these</b> <b>positions</b> are not defined or required by the Laws.|$|E
