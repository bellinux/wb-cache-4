5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of <b>the</b> <b>troop.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Court of Honour is {{a regular}} meeting of Patrol Leaders (PLs) and <b>the</b> <b>Troop</b> Scouter, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of decisions regarding troop discipline, patrol management, troop programme and other matters. <b>The</b> <b>Troop</b> Scouter is the only adult leader regularly attending these meetings, although the Court of Honour may invite other Scouters to attend. <b>The</b> <b>Troop</b> Scouter has the right to veto decision, but should generally only act in an advisory role, allowing the Scouts themselves to make important decisions.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>troop</b> is the {{fundamental}} unit of Boy Scouting. <b>The</b> <b>troop</b> size can vary from a minimum of five Scouts to several dozen. Each troop is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, private school, labor group or religious institution. The chartered organization is responsible for providing a meeting place and promoting a good program. A chartered organization representative manages the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>troop,</b> the chartered organization, and the BSA.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>troops</b> of <b>the</b> field {{armies and}} of the border armies had {{different}} arrangements for their accommodation. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> of <b>the</b> field armies were often billeted on the civilian population, while <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> of <b>the</b> border armies had permanent bases.|$|R
50|$|After {{the ships}} landed at White's Ferry, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> marched south {{into the center}} of the town without meeting resistance. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> were {{quartered}} on the 1500 acre estate of Nathaniel Ray Thomas and other private Loyalist homes in Marshfield. Captain Balfour placed <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> at <b>the</b> disposal of town authorities for purposes of keeping order. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> were to be stationed in the town indefinitely.|$|R
50|$|The {{police and}} <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> {{conducted}} a cordon and search operation {{and the government}} announced that <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> had killed 30 terrorists.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>troop</b> was {{reactivated}} on 13 February 1947 in Boston, Massachusetts. However, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> {{did not see}} {{any significant}} actions during its post war years, still {{a part of the}} 94th Infantry Division, which itself was never called on for service. <b>The</b> <b>troop</b> was moved to Cohasset, Massachusetts in 1953, remaining there for another six years as an inactive reserve unit until 1959, when it was again disbanded and inactivated.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> {{returned}} home and began the process of demobilization. It inactivated on 8 October 1945 at Camp Shelby, Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> {{was sent}} to Yugoslavia, where it raided {{numerous}} Dalmatian islands held by the Germans. In the Autumn of 1944, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> was part of Operation Infatuate to capture the island of Walcheren {{at the head of}} the Scheldt Estuary, alongside Free Norwegian and British Commandos. The unit later moved into Germany.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} legends behind Manneken Pis, {{but the most}} famous is the one about Duke Godfrey III of Leuven. In 1142, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> of this two-year-old lord were battling against <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> of <b>the</b> Berthouts, the lords of Grimbergen, in Ransbeke (now Neder-Over-Heembeek). <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> put <b>the</b> infant lord in a basket and hung the basket in a tree to {{encourage}} them. From there, the boy urinated on <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> of <b>the</b> Berthouts, who eventually lost the battle.|$|R
50|$|January 16, 1899, <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> at Macon, Ga., and <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> at Albany, Ga., {{were made}} a {{separate}} brigade of the Second Corps.|$|R
50|$|There {{were reports}} that Burmese troops from central Myanmar had started to march towards Yangon. <b>The</b> <b>troops</b> were from <b>the</b> Central Command based in Taungoo and the South East Command.

5|$|Scoutmasters and assistants {{should then}} attend Scoutmaster and Assistant Scoutmaster Specific Training and Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills for further {{instruction}} in Scouting and outdoor skills. This completes Basic Leader Training for these positions and the Trained emblem may be worn. <b>The</b> <b>troop</b> committee chairman and members should attend <b>the</b> <b>Troop</b> Committee Challenge for instruction in administering the program. This completes Basic Leader Training for these positions and the Trained emblem may be worn.|$|E
5|$|The main Animal Lifestyles exhibit {{consists}} of a troop of hamadryas baboons. Zoo visitors may observe <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> in a large glassed-in gallery which looks out into a rocky outcrop. Small caves in the outcrop lead to interior burrows where the animals may avoid inclement weather. The rear wall of the gallery illustrates common forms of baboon signalling and behavior, along with other social aspects of the animals. Ample seating allows visitors to observe <b>the</b> <b>troop.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{youth leader}} of <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> {{is the senior}} patrol leader (SPL), elected by the Scouts in <b>the</b> <b>troop.</b> He is {{responsible}} for the overall performance of <b>the</b> <b>troop,</b> runs troop meetings and ensures that the program for troop meetings and other activities is carried out. He is advised by the Scoutmaster. There may also be one or more assistant senior patrol leaders. Each patrol elects a patrol leader who then appoints an assistant patrol leader and other positions within the patrol. Together, the senior patrol leader, assistant senior patrol leader and patrol leaders make up the patrol leaders council (PLC), the group of Scouts that is responsible for developing the troop's program with the advice of the Scoutmaster.|$|E
50|$|Che {{suddenly}} left <b>the</b> Temple <b>Troop</b> {{and joined}} <b>the</b> resident city <b>troop,</b> who {{were said to}} be former members of his wandering band. In their second visit, <b>the</b> Temple <b>Troop</b> came into conflict with <b>the</b> city <b>troop</b> and among <b>the</b> fighters at <b>the</b> city <b>troop's</b> front line, was Che. As <b>the</b> two <b>troops</b> fought, Che suddenly switched again and sided with <b>the</b> Temple <b>Troop,</b> attacking <b>the</b> city <b>troop.</b> Che and Temple Troop were forced to retreat.|$|R

5|$|There {{are other}} youth {{positions}} of responsibility in a troop; {{the use of}} these positions is dependent on the size of <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> and the program. The junior assistant Scoutmaster (JASM) is a 16- or 17-year-old Scout who performs the same duties as an assistant Scoutmaster; the scribe takes minutes at patrol leaders council meetings and troop meetings and is often responsible for taking attendance and collecting money or dues; the quartermaster maintains the troop's equipment; the librarian maintains <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> library; the chaplain aide works with <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> chaplain and promotes the religious program in the troop; <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> historian maintains photos and records of troop functions, meetings and outings; a den chief works with a den of Cub Scouts, assisting the den leaders and helps retain Cub Scouts when they cross over into Boy Scouts; <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> guide is a senior Scout who provides guidance to new Scout patrols; the Leave No Trace Coordinator ensures the Scouts are trained in and follow Leave No Trace Guidelines; the Order of the Arrow representative provides a line of communication between the Order of the Arrow and the troop; the bugler provides music as needed; the instructor teaches Scout skills. These troop positions are appointed by the senior patrol leader with the advice and counsel of the Scoutmaster, except for the Junior Assistant Scoutmaster, who is appointed by the Scoutmaster.|$|E

5|$|At 05:00 on 23 March the regiment, {{the first}} mounted force, began {{to cross the}} river. They were passing beyond the {{infantry}} forward troops by 07:30. Two troops from the 11th Squadron were dispatched {{to the east and}} another north-east. One troop, twenty men, encountered a force of sixty Turkish cavalry and charged them, armed only with rifles and bayonets. <b>The</b> <b>troop</b> killed twenty cavalrymen and captured seven, in exchange for the death of one man, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> leader who had ordered the charge. <b>The</b> <b>troop</b> sent north had forced a machine-gun post covering the river to withdraw, but the gun and its crew were later captured by men from the 4th Squadron. While this move had been progressing, <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> of the 11th Squadron had been sent north from the crossing. At the same time the 3rd and 4th Squadrons galloped north to take the Turkish defenders at Ghoraniyeh from the rear. At 09:00 the leading troops, without loss, captured the first Turkish outpost with seventeen prisoners. One troop of the 3rd Squadron dismounted and captured two machine-gun posts overlooking the crossing, which allowed the rest of the squadron to drive off the remaining defenders. While the 3rd Squadron concentrated on the crossing the 4th Squadron was ordered to gallop and capture the village of Shunet Nimrin, but were unable to approach the village when confronted by heavy artillery fire. The day's battle cost the regiment one dead and two wounded. By that night the bridge at Ghoraniyeh was completed and the remainder of the ANZAC Mounted Division were crossing at Hajlah.|$|E

50|$|The Royal Artillery Band {{does not}} take a direct role in <b>the</b> <b>Trooping</b> <b>the</b> Colour parade. <b>The</b> <b>Trooping</b> <b>the</b> Colour as seen on Horse Guards Parade is a ceremony, which {{involves}} {{the whole of the}} Brigade of Footguards, the Household Cavalry, and nowadays, also <b>the</b> King's <b>Troop</b> (as head of Her Majesty's Household Troops). While other regiments and corps hold similar trooping-the-colour ceremonies, that of the Guards is held annually to celebrate the official birthday of Her Majesty the Queen. The Royal Artillery Band is nevertheless always very much in evidence on the day of <b>the</b> <b>Trooping</b> <b>the</b> Colour, by taking part in the Royal Birthday gun salute given by <b>the</b> King's <b>Troop</b> in Hyde Park.|$|R
5|$|Eldred {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Oceanside, Long Island, New York by his mother after his father died. Eldred’s older brother, Hubert W. Eldred, was {{instrumental}} in starting Troop 1 of Oceanside, Long Island, New York in November 1910. Troop1 was fully uniformed and their appearance so impressed Chief Scout Executive James E. West that he asked <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> to serve as honor guard for the visit of Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting. West paid the expenses for <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> to travel to New York harbor for Baden-Powell's arrival {{in the morning of}} January 31, 1912. Baden-Powell inspected Troop1, and spoke with Eldred at some length. It is uncertain how Baden-Powell found out that Eldred's Board of Review was that afternoon, but he ended up attending it and being part of the Board of Review.|$|E
5|$|In August 1912, Eldred was camping with <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> in Orange Lake, New York. While {{swimming}} in the lake, fifteen-year-old Melvin Daly, another Scout who was a non-swimmer, began to drown. Eldred rescued Daly {{with the assistance of}} Merritt Cutler. Chief Scout Seton presented Eldred with the Honor Medal for this action.|$|E
5|$|In late February 1944, Mahan was {{in action}} with the Seventh Fleet {{supporting}} <b>the</b> <b>troop</b> landing at Los Negros Island in the Admiralty Islands.

50|$|Mohan Singh's speech, in Hindustani, was short. He told <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> {{of forming}} <b>the</b> Indian National Army {{to fight for}} an {{independent}} India, and invited <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> to join it. As an Indian Jawan present at the time remembers, Mohan Singh's speech was powerful and touched a chord, and <b>the</b> <b>troops</b> responded with wild enthusiasm and excitement.|$|R

5|$|The adult {{leader of}} a Scout Troop is <b>the</b> <b>Troop</b> Scouter (TS), {{assisted}} by Assistant Troop Scouters (ATS) and Junior Assistant Troop Scouters (JATS). Scout Troops often give their adult leaders nicknames related to their branch of Scouting (Land Scout, Air Scout, or Sea Scout).|$|E
5|$|The olive baboon {{lives in}} groups of 15 to 150, {{made up of a}} few males, many females, and their young. Each baboon has a social ranking somewhere in the group, {{depending}} on its dominance. Female dominance is hereditary, with daughters having nearly the same rank as their mothers, and adult females forming the core of the social system. Female relatives form their own subgroups in <b>the</b> <b>troop.</b> Related females are largely friendly to each other. They tend to stay close together and groom one another, and team up in aggressive encounters within <b>the</b> <b>troop.</b> Female kin form these strong bonds because they do not emigrate from their natal groups.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>troop</b> {{program and}} {{activities}} {{are determined by}} the senior patrol leader and the patrol leaders council under the oversight of the Scoutmaster. Troops generally hold meetings weekly, although they can be irregular during the summer. Troop meeting activities may vary from training in Scout skills to planning camping trips or playing games.|$|E
