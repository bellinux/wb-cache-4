5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> {{was launched}} on 3 June 1940.

5|$|Near 4:00 PM, with {{fourteen}} batteries {{destroyed and}} an hour left until dark, Ivry decided to call off <b>the</b> <b>operation,</b> assuming the optimal result had been achieved and that the Syrians would move more SAMs into place the next day. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> was stopped shortly after 4:00 PM.

5|$|Resistance to <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> by {{the chosen}} units meant {{that much of}} the {{preparation}} was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear to what extent <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> contributed to his decision. Despite its limited impact, <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the groundwork for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E

Gleijeses stated that while the freighter {{was on its way}} to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked him to sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Dean Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that due to Somoza spreading the word about the coup, the State Department decided that the cover of <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> had been lost.

Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees who had fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting. Initial public outcry denounced the launching of <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes. The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> and described the acts of violence {{carried out by the}} army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> continued until the first week of May.|$|E

5|$|After its {{removal from}} Operation Varsity, the {{division}} remained in reserve as the Allied armies advanced even further into Germany, moving to Oise, France, on 3 April for supply and administrative tasks. The division {{was scheduled to}} participate in several other airborne operations; however, these were all cancelled before they could take place. The first of these was Operation Arena, which envisioned landing between six and ten divisions into what was termed a 'strategic airhead' in the Kassel region of Northern Germany; the planners of the operations envisioned that <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> would deny a large swathe of territory to the German defenders and give the Allied armies a staging area for further advances into Germany. The 13th was chosen to participate, along with the 17th, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions and the British 6th and 1st Airborne Divisions. A preliminary date for 1 May was set for <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> once all of the required airborne and air-landed infantry divisions had been located and supplied, but it was ultimately cancelled on 26 March due to the rapid movement of Allied ground forces negating the need for <b>the</b> <b>operation.</b> Two other airborne operations were planned to include the 13th. Operation Choker II was to be an airborne landing on the east bank of the Rhine near Worms, Germany; planning for <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> got to an advanced stage, and the division was only hours from taking off from airfields in France when <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> was cancelled due to Allied ground forces overrunning the proposed landing areas. Operation Effective was designed to land the 13th south of Stuttgart, seize a nearby airfield and create an airhead for further forces to land in near the Black Forest. <b>The</b> <b>operation</b> was scheduled for 22 April, but was cancelled on 18 April due to Allied units encircling the Black Forest region and making it unnecessary.|$|E

The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the Lowestoft raid, Admiral Reinhard Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> in mid-May, by which time the mine damage to Seydlitz {{was scheduled to be}} repaired—Scheer was unwilling to embark on a major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. On 9 May, however, several battleships developed problems with their engines, which delayed <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> further, to 23 May. On 22 May, Seydlitz was still not fully repaired, and <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> was again postponed, this time to 29 May. At noon on 29 May, the repairs to Seydlitz were finally completed, and the ship returned to the I Scouting Group. The plan called for Hipper's battlecruisers to steam north to the Skagerrak, with the intention of luring out a portion of the British fleet so it could be destroyed by Scheer's waiting battleships.|$|E

The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E
