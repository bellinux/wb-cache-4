5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the TCSEC's precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes - the highest of which, A1, is featurally identical to B3, differing only in documentation standards - the more recently introduced Common Criteria (CC) - which derive from a blend of more or less technically mature standards from various NATO countries - provide a more tenuous spectrum of seven [...] "evaluation classes" [...] that intermix features and assurances in an arguably non-hierarchical manner and lack the philosophic precision and mathematical stricture of the <b>TCSEC.</b> In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the [...] "target of evaluation" [...] (TOE) and support - even encourage - an intermixture of security requirements culled {{from a variety of}} predefined [...] "protection profiles." [...] While a strong case can be made that even the more seemingly arbitrary components of the <b>TCSEC</b> contribute to a [...] "chain of evidence" [...] that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning.|$|E
50|$|The XTS-400 {{has been}} preceded by several {{evaluated}} ancestors, all {{developed by the}} same group: Secure Communications Processor (SCOMP), XTS-200, and XTS-300. All of the predecessor products were evaluated under Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (<b>TCSEC)</b> (a.k.a. Orange Book) standards. SCOMP completed evaluation in 1984 at the highest functional and assurance level then in place: A1. Since then the product has evolved from proprietary hardware and interfaces to commodity hardware and Linux interfaces.|$|E
50|$|<b>TCSEC</b> - The United States Department of Defense DoD 5200.28 Std, {{called the}} Orange Book {{and parts of}} the Rainbow Series. The Orange Book {{originated}} from Computer Security work including the Anderson Report, done by the National Security Agency and the National Bureau of Standards (the NBS eventually became NIST) in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The central thesis of the Orange Book follows from the work done by Dave Bell and Len LaPadula for a set of protection mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Lampson's {{definition}} of a covert channel was paraphrased in the <b>TCSEC</b> specifically to refer to ways of transferring information from a higher classification compartment to a lower classification. In a shared processing environment, {{it is difficult to}} completely insulate one process from the effects another process can have on the operating environment. A covert channel is created by a sender process that modulates some condition (such as free space, availability of some service, wait time to execute) that can be detected by a receiving process.|$|E
50|$|Unlike earlier criteria, {{notably the}} <b>TCSEC</b> {{developed}} by the US defense establishment, the ITSEC did not require evaluated targets to contain specific technical features {{in order to achieve}} a particular assurance level. For example, an ITSEC target might provide authentication or integrity features without providing confidentiality or availability. A given target's security features were documented in a Security Target document, whose contents had to be evaluated and approved before the target itself was evaluated. Each ITSEC evaluation was based exclusively on verifying the security features identified in the Security Target.|$|E
5000|$|BAE Systems offers XTS-400, a {{commercial}} system that supports MLS {{at what the}} vendor claims is [...] "high assurance". Predecessor products (including the XTS-300) were evaluated at the <b>TCSEC</b> B3 level, which is MLS-capable. The XTS-400 has been evaluated under the Common Criteria at EAL5+ against the CAPP and LSPP protection profiles. CAPP and LSPP are both EAL3 protection profiles that are not inherently MLS-capable, but the security target for the Common Criteria evaluation of this product contains an enriched set of security functions that provide MLS capability.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, MAC was {{strongly}} associated with Multi-Level Security (MLS) {{as a means of}} protecting US classified information. The Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (<b>TCSEC),</b> the seminal work on the subject, provided the original definition of MAC as [...] "a means of restricting access to objects based on the sensitivity (as represented by a label) of the information contained in the objects and the formal authorization (i.e., clearance) of subjects to access information of such sensitivity". Early implementations of MAC such as Honeywell's SCOMP, USAF SACDIN, NSA Blacker, and Boeing's MLS LAN focused on MLS to protect military-oriented security classification levels with robust enforcement.|$|E
5000|$|Amon Ott's RSBAC (Rule Set Based Access Control) {{provides}} a framework for Linux kernels that allows several different security policy / decision modules. One of the models implemented is Mandatory Access Control model. A general goal of RSBAC design {{was to try to}} reach (obsolete) Orange Book (<b>TCSEC)</b> B1 level. The model of mandatory access control used in RSBAC is mostly the same as in Unix System V/MLS, Version 1.2.1 (developed in 1989 by the National Computer Security Center of the USA with classification B1/TCSEC). RSBAC requires a set of patches to the stock kernel, which are maintained quite well by the project owner.|$|E
5000|$|Central to {{the concept}} of U.S. Department of Defense-style [...] "trusted systems" [...] is the notion of a [...] "reference monitor", which is an entity that {{occupies}} the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is (a) tamperproof, (b) always invoked, and (c) small enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured. Per the U.S. National Security Agency's 1983 Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (<b>TCSEC),</b> or [...] "Orange Book", a set of [...] "evaluation classes" [...] were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system.|$|E
50|$|Customers that deploy trusted {{operating}} systems typically {{require that the}} product complete a formal computer security evaluation. The evaluation is stricter for a broader security range, which are the lowest and highest classification levels the system can process. The Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (<b>TCSEC)</b> was the first evaluation criteria developed to assess MLS in computer systems. Under that criteria {{there was a clear}} uniform mapping between the security requirements and the breadth of the MLS security range. Historically few implementations have been certified capable of MLS processing with a security range of Unclassified through Top Secret. Among them were Honeywell's SCOMP, USAF SACDIN, NSA's Blacker, and Boeing's MLS LAN, all under <b>TCSEC,</b> 1980s vintage and Intel 80386-based. Currently, MLS products are evaluated under the Common Criteria. In late 2008, the first operating system (more below) was certified to a high evaluated assurance level: Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) - EAL 6+ / High Robustness, under the auspices of a U.S. government program requiring multilevel security in a high threat environment. While this assurance level has many similarities to that of the old Orange Book A1 (such as formal methods), the functional requirements focus on fundamental isolation and information flow policies rather than higher level policies such as Bell-La Padula. Because the Common Criteria decoupled TCSEC's pairing of assurance (EAL) and functionality (Protection Profile), the clear uniform mapping between security requirements and MLS security range capability documented in CSC-STD-004-85 has largely been lost when the Common Criteria superseded the Rainbow Series.|$|E
