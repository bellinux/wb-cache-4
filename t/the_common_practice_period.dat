The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on what is known as <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period.</b> Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E

The works from the first period adhere to the romantic tradition, thus employing <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period</b> harmonic language.

50|$|Use of {{the terms}} quartal and quintal arises from a contrast, {{compositional}} or perceptual, with traditional tertian harmonic constructions. Listeners familiar with music of <b>the</b> (European) <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period</b> perceive tonal music as that which uses major and minor chords and scales, wherein both the major third and minor third constitute the basic structural elements of the harmony.|$|R

25|$|The name {{suspended}} {{derives from}} an early polyphonic technique developed during <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> in which a stepwise melodic progress to a harmonically stable note in any particular part was often momentarily delayed or suspended by extending {{the duration of the}} previous note. The resulting unexpected dissonance could then be all the more satisfyingly resolved by the eventual appearance of the displaced note. In traditional music theory the inclusion of the third in either chord would negate the suspension, so such chords would be called added ninth and added eleventh chords instead.|$|E
25|$|The major time {{divisions}} {{of classical music}} up to 1900 are the early music period, which includes Medieval (500–1400) and Renaissance (1400–1600) eras, and <b>the</b> <b>Common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> which includes the Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1730–1820) and Romantic (1780–1910) eras. Since 1900, classical periods have been reckoned more by calendar century than by particular stylistic movements that have become fragmented and difficult to define. The 20th century calendar period (1901–2000) includes most of the early modern musical era (1890–1930), the entire high modern (mid 20th-century), and the first 25 years of the contemporary (1945 or 1975–current) or postmodern musical era (1930–current). The 21st century {{has so far been}} characterized by a continuation of the contemporary/postmodern musical era.|$|E

2500|$|In {{music of}} <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> cadences {{are divided into}} four types {{according}} to their harmonic progression: authentic, plagal, half, and deceptive.

5000|$|In {{the history}} of European art music, <b>the</b> term <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period</b> refers to <b>the</b> era between the {{formation}} and {{the dissolution of the}} tonal system. Though there are no exact dates for this phenomenon, most features of the common-practice period persisted from the mid to late baroque period, through the Classical and Romantic periods, or roughly from around 1650 to 1900. While certain prevailing patterns and conventions characterize the music of this period, the time period also saw considerable stylistic evolution. Some conventions evolved during this period that were rarely employed at other times during what may still be labeled [...] "common practice" [...] (for example, Sonata Form). Thus, the dates 1650-1900 are necessarily nebulous and arbitrary borders that depend on context. The most important unifying feature through this time period concerns a harmonic language to which modern music theorists can apply Roman numeral analysis.|$|R
5000|$|Tonality is the {{arrangement}} of pitches and/or chords of a musical work in a hierarchy of perceived relations, stabilities, attractions and directionality. In this hierarchy, the individual pitch or triadic chord with the greatest stability is called the tonic. The root of the tonic chord forms the name given to the key; so in the key of C major, the note C is both the tonic of the scale and {{the root of the}} tonic chord (C-E-G). Simple folk music songs often start and end with the tonic note. <b>The</b> most <b>common</b> use of <b>the</b> term [...] "is to designate {{the arrangement}} of musical phenomena around a referential tonic in European music from about 1600 to about 1910" [...] Contemporary classical music from 1910 to the 2000s may practice or avoid any sort of tonality—but harmony in almost all Western popular music remains tonal. Harmony in jazz includes many but not all tonal characteristics of <b>the</b> European <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> sometimes known as [...] "classical music".|$|R

Hugh’s eldest son, Robert, inherited his Norman lands in the Ouche valley in Normandy, while Ivo de Grandmesnil became Sheriff of Leicester, and master of Earl Shilton manor. Following a long futile war with his brother William Rufus, Duke Robert through his tardiness failed to take the English crown.|$|R
2500|$|This {{passage is}} often overlooked, {{because it is}} brief, and located {{at the very end}} of the introduction. It is even {{indicated}} by Caccini as a [...] "note"; an aside or addendum to the main purpose. It is important to observe, however, that the first explanation of this practice is in the context of an essay about vocal expression and intelligibility.

2500|$|Encompassing a {{wide variety}} of post-Romantic styles {{composed}} through the year 2000, 20th-century classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, neoclassical, neoromantic, neomedieval, and postmodern styles of composition. Modernism (1890–1930) marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period,</b> such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. The high-modern era saw the emergence of neo-classical and serial music. A few authorities have claimed high-modernism as the beginning of postmodern music from about 1930. Others have more or less equated postmodern music with the [...] "contemporary music" [...] composed from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century.|$|E

2500|$|Goldman {{argues that}} [...] "historically {{the use of}} the IV chord in {{harmonic}} design, and especially in cadences, exhibits some curious features. By and large, one can say that the use of IV in final cadences becomes more <b>common</b> in <b>the</b> nineteenth century {{than it was in the}} eighteenth, but that it may also be understood as a substitute for the ii chord when it precedes V. It may also be quite logically construed as an incomplete ii7 chord (lacking root)." [...] The delayed acceptance of the IV–I in final cadences is explained aesthetically by its lack of closure, caused by its position in the circle of fifths. The earlier use of IV–V–I is explained by proposing a relation between IV and ii, allowing IV to substitute for or serve as ii. However, Nattiez calls this latter argument [...] "a narrow escape: only the theory of a ii chord without a root allows Goldman to maintain that the circle of fifths is completely valid from Bach to Wagner", or <b>the</b> entire <b>common</b> <b>practice</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R

40|$|At a {{very basic}} level, {{a piece of music}} can be defined as an {{organised}} arrangement of sounds occurring both sequentially (as in melody) and concurrently (as in harmony). As music evolved into a science and an established form of art, people started studying the characteristics of these sounds and drew sets of guidelines and rules, that if followed would produce pieces of music that are aesthetically more pleasing than others. Early examples can be seen in Pythagoras’ observations and experiments with blacksmiths’ hammers. Allegedly some 2500 years ago, he was walking by a blacksmith’s shop when he heard the ringing tones of hammers hitting an anvil. Upon further observation, he realised that a hammer weighing half as much as a previous one sounded twice as high in pitch (an octave – ratio 2 : 1). A pair of hammers whose weights had a ratio of 3 : 2 sounded a fifth apart. Eventually he {{came to the conclusion that}} simple ratios sounded good. In this paper, we are concerned with the generation of musical phrases constrained by the rules that governed music developed during <b>the</b> so called <b>Common</b> <b>Practice</b> <b>Period</b> (CPP). This period refers to an era in musical history spanning from the 17 th to the early 20 th centuries [2] and included the Baroque and Romantic styles amongst others.
