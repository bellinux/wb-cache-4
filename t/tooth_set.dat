60|$|I confess, we find {{among the}} Jews, {{as well as}} other nations, that men did sell themselves; but, it is plain, this was only to drudgery, not to slavery: for, it is evident, the person sold was not under an absolute, {{arbitrary}}, despotical power: for the master could not have power to kill him, at any time, whom, at a certain time, he was obliged to let go free out of his service; and the master of such a servant was so far from having an arbitrary power over his life, that he could not, at pleasure, so much as maim him, but the loss of an eye, or <b>tooth,</b> <b>set</b> him free, Exod. xxi.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom" [...] {{was a bad}} baby, {{from the}} very {{beginning}} of his usurpation. He would cry for nothing; he would burst into storms of devilish temper without notice, and let go scream after scream and squall after squall, then climax the thing with [...] "holding his breath"--that frightful specialty of the teething nursling, in the throes of which the creature exhausts its lungs, then is convulsed with noiseless squirmings and twistings and kickings in the effort to get its breath, while the lips turn blue and the mouth stands wide and rigid, offering for inspection one wee <b>tooth</b> <b>set</b> in the lower rim of a hoop of red gums; and when the appalling stillness has endured until one is sure the lost breath will never return, a nurse comes flying, and dashes water in the child's face, and--presto! the lungs fill, and instantly discharge a shriek, or a yell, or a howl which bursts the listening ear and surprises the owner of it into saying words which would not go well with a halo if he had one. The baby Tom would claw anybody who came within reach of his nails, and pound anybody he could reach with his rattle. He would scream for water until he got it, and then throw cup and all on the floor and scream for more. He was indulged in all his caprices, howsoever troublesome and exasperating they might be; he was allowed to eat anything he wanted, particularly things that would give him the stomach-ache.|$|E

5000|$|Set: The {{degree to}} which the teeth are bent out {{sideways}} away from the blade, usually in both directions. In most modern serrated saws, the teeth are set, so that the kerf (the width of the cut) will be wider than the blade itself. This allows the blade to move through the cut easily without binding (getting stuck). The set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make. For example, a rip saw has a <b>tooth</b> <b>set</b> that is similar to the angle used on a chisel, so that it rips or tears the material apart. A [...] "flush-cutting saw" [...] has no set on one side, so that the saw can be laid flat on a surface and cut along that surface without scratching it. The set of the blade's teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} wear rates and optimal replacement intervals for the teeth of an Optima 62 cubic yard dipper with a PD Ab/Wr wear package in operation at the Morenci Mine. The current replacement strategy {{is to change the}} entire set of nine teeth when significant wear is observed or when teeth or adapters are found to be missing. Over an 8 week period, 13 change-outs of teeth sets were recorded. For eight of these change-outs, a laser profile was taken of each tooth upon removal to determine metal loss. A technique known as 2 ̆ 7 grouped failure data with multiple suspensions 2 ̆ 7 was applied to quantify the failure rates of the teeth. Failure rate functions were also determined for subgroups including the outer four teeth located near the dipper wing shrouds and the inner five teeth located nearest to the dipper center line. Weibull cumulative distribution functions were fitted to the dipper teeth failure data. Wear rates for the outer four teeth located next to the dipper wing shrouds were found to lag those experienced by the five center teeth of the dipper by ∼ 83, 000 tons. A group replacement strategy whereby entire tooth sets are changed out was found to give better cost per ton performance when compared with a staged policy whereby the outer four teeth are changed out at double the replacement interval of the inner five teeth. Potential exists to reduce unplanned maintenance downtime by decreasing the average replacement interval for dipper teeth sets from 255, 000 tons to 200, 000 tons. This is equivalent to reducing the replacement interval from one <b>tooth</b> <b>set</b> every 4 days of continuous operation to one <b>tooth</b> <b>set</b> every 3 days of continuous operation. The benefits of adopting such a strategy are estimated at a saving of US 300, 000 per shovel per year...|$|E
40|$|Carcharias vorax (Le Hon, 1871) {{is poorly}} defined with one single tooth only. The holotype {{could not be}} found in the Type Collection of the IRScNB (Brussels) and {{recognition}} of the holotype is impossible based on the poor drawing in Le Hon (1871). A neotype and paraneotype are designated for the lost holotype. A temporary outcrop at a construction site southeast of the city of Antwerp is chosen as type locality. The basal part of the Middle Miocene Antwerpen Sands Member is selected as type horizon. An artificial <b>tooth</b> <b>set</b> is constructed and illustrated, confirming the attribution of this species to the genus Carcharias. Carcharias vorax (Le Hon, 1871) appears to be closely related to Carcharias cuspidatus (Agassiz, 1843) and seems to have a restricted geographical and temporal distribution, focused on the North Sea Basin only during the Burdigalian-Tortonian interval. The disappearance of Carcharias vorax during the Late Miocene is discussed. A maximum total body length of approximately 280 cm is estimated for this Miocene shark species...|$|E

40|$|This report evaluates {{biological}} material from reindeer harvested in Svalbard and discusses application areas {{for research and}} management. A collection of lower jaws located at the University of Oslo (UiO) covers most of the period 1984 – 2009. Some material is, however, currently missing from the collection. The available samples have been analysed for jaw length and age (based on <b>tooth</b> <b>set</b> and counts of cementum annuli) by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA). A subset of the material has also been analysed previously (by different personnel) for molar height and dressed weight. The hunting material has broad applicability for research and management and represents an important resource for studying jaw lengths (i. e. body growth) in relation to climate, population density, hunting area, and sex and age structure of the harvested population. Based on preliminary analyses, there is clear variation between subpopulations and also clear climate signals in body growth. Though limited by a smaller sample size, similar information {{can be obtained from}} molar heights (e. g. tooth wear variation with sex, age, and climate) and dressed weights. Furthermore, the hunting statistics reflect spatiotemporal variation in sex-age distribution (of harvested animals) that could be of great interest for the management of this species on Svalbard. A standardised procedure for collection and handling of the material, including continuous sample analysis, is highly recommended...|$|E
