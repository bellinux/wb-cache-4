40|$|This essay {{presents}} empirical {{tests of}} one of the conclusions from Bryan Caplan's 2007 book The Myth of the Rational Voter. Caplan claims that voters suffer from systematic biases about economic policy that through elections affects economic policy negatively. I derive three hypotheses from Caplan's theory and test them on a cross-country panel of 19 countries covering the time 1973 to 2009. The hypotheses stipulate that increased <b>turnout</b> <b>lead</b> to lower economic freedom, lower levels of foreign aid and higher inflation. After controlling for country specific effects turnout {{does not seem to have}} the effect stipulated in the three hypotheses...|$|E
40|$|Some US {{states have}} {{introduced}} measures to increase voter participation. I develop a formal model of elections {{to study how}} these measures affect political outcomes. I find that at high enough levels, measures to increase <b>turnout</b> <b>lead</b> to candidates converging at the median voter’s ideal point, as candidates switch from choosing policies that motivate their partisan base to competing over centrist voters. At intermediate levels, however, different measure can result in drastically different political outcomes. Also, counter-intuitively, voter turnout is non-monotonic in measures to increase turnout: since these measures decrease {{the difference between the}} candidates ’ political positions, they decreases benefit of voting. Empirically, I find that congressional representatives from states that have introduced measures to increase turnout have become less polarized. ...|$|E

40|$|Some epistemic {{approaches}} to democracy evince an exclusivistic approach to voting participation whereby high turnout elections {{are thought to}} produce adverse outcomes. On this view, high turnout introduces greater input from less politically competent citizens which, in turn, leads to bad governance. I challenge these claims from both an empirical and normative perspective by defending procedural democracy against epistemic democracy. I {{argue that it is}} mistaken to privilege epistemic considerations over other values that democracy is meant to serve, in this case, political equality, liberty and representativeness. Further, {{it is not clear that}} high voter <b>turnout</b> <b>leads</b> to worse government. In sum, (electoral) epistemic democracy is hard to justify given that (a) even in theory it is unconvincing as a form of democracy and (b) even on its own terms it is not demonstrably better than procedural democracy at ‘performing’ democracy.

50|$|When low turnout {{reflects}} {{cultural values}} of disenchantment or indifference, the election {{may not be}} an accurate reflection of the will of the people. Low <b>turnouts</b> can <b>lead</b> to unequal representation among various parts of the population.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{hypothesis}} that high voter <b>turnout</b> <b>leads</b> to increased leisure. The path is hypothesized to begin with high voter turnout, which creates a political environment that enables strong labor protection. The path then extends from collective bargaining to income equality, which is the final necessary step to increasing leisure time. This study examines data on voter turnout, collective bargaining coverage, income equality {{as measured by the}} GINI Index and hours worked in order to determine if a significant relationship exists between voter turnout and the number of hours worked. Twenty nations were used in this study: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States. It was concluded that although significant relationships were found to exist between each of the variables studied, there is no significant statistical relationship between voter turnout and the number of hours worked per capita within each country...|$|R

5000|$|Turnout {{comparisons}} {{cannot be}} solely {{based on the}} number of registered voters because Americans who are registered to vote are more likely to vote in an election, since they already took the time to register. The methods used to calculate voter <b>turnout</b> can <b>lead</b> to higher numbers because additional factors are considered. Many Americans do not take the effort to figure and find out how and where to register, as some see it as a burden.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} concern that imbalances in voter turnout across race and class have led to biased outcomes in American democracy. Yet empirical tests have generally found that the unrepre-sentative nature of the electorate has little effect on who wins and loses elections. We challenge this finding by arguing that existing research minimizes the chances of finding bias because it focuses largely on national elections where turnout is relatively high and where minority groups are gener-ally too small {{a percentage of the}} population to sway elections. By focusing on city elections we find that lower <b>turnout</b> <b>leads</b> to substantial reductions in the representation of Latinos and Asian Ameri-cans on city councils and in the mayor’s office. For African Americans district elections and off-cycle local elections are more important barriers to representation. At its core democracy rests on the vote. The vote is the primary tool for citi-zens to control their government. Through the vote citizens communicate infor-mation about their interests, preferences, and needs and make important decisions about who to elect to office. Nevertheless, most Americans do not vote when given the opportunity. At best roughly half of eligible voters vote in national con-tests. At worst, fewer than 10 % of adults vote in local elections (Bridges 1997; Hajnal, Lewis, and Louch 2002). Even more importantly, those who do turn out to vote look very different from those who do not. Study after study of Ameri-can elections has found that individuals with ample resources vote much more regularly than those with few resources—the poor, racial, and ethnic minorities and the less educated (Rosenstone and Hansen 1993; Verba and Nie 1972; Verba...|$|R
40|$|Basic Downsian theory predicts {{candidate}} convergence {{toward the}} views of the median voter in two-candidate elections. Common journalistic wisdom, moreover, leads us to expect these centripetal pressures to be strongest when elections are expected to be close. Yet, the available evidence from the US Congress disconfirms this prediction. To explain this counterintuitive result, we develop a spatial model that allows us to understand the complex interactions of political competition, partisan loyalties, and incentives for voter <b>turnout</b> that can <b>lead</b> office-seeking candidates, especially candidates in close elections, to emphasize policy appeals to their voter base rather than courting the median voter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that those with higher SES {{characteristics}} tend to vote at higher rates in U. S. elections. Over the past several decades many proponents of eased voter registration requirements have predicted that liberalizing voter registration laws will significantly improve turnout, especially among the least well-educated and the poor. In this article we offer a rational choice model of <b>turnout</b> that <b>leads</b> us to expect the greatest turnout gains from virtually eliminating voter registration costs will instead accrue to those with medium income and education. We test this prediction longitudinally over the period 1972 – 1992 using a vast survey and a natural experiment comparing voters in states that adopted election day registration (EDR) with those residing in states maintaining more traditional closing dates. Contrary to much of the literature, citizens with medium education and medium income voted more under EDR, as the model predicts. We conclude that the methods used here better capture and empirically identify the curvilinear relationship between voter registration laws and the turnout probabilities at various SES levels. 1...|$|R
25|$|Assuming {{that low}} turnout is a {{reflection}} of disenchantment or indifference, a poll with very low turnout may not be an accurate reflection of the will of the people. On the other hand, if low turnout {{is a reflection}} of contentment of voters about likely winners or parties, then low turnout is as legitimate as high turnout, as long as the right to vote exists. Still, low <b>turnouts</b> can <b>lead</b> to unequal representation among various parts of the population. In developed countries, non-voters tend to be concentrated in particular demographic and socioeconomic groups, especially the young and the poor. However, in India, which boasts an electorate of more than 814 million people, the opposite is true. The poor, who comprise the majority of the demographic, are more likely to vote than the rich and the middle classes, and turnout is higher in rural areas than urban areas. In low-turnout countries, these groups are often significantly under-represented in elections. This has the potential to skew policy. For instance, a high voter turnout among the elderly coupled with a low turnout among the young may lead to more money for retirees' health care, and less for youth employment schemes. Some nations thus have rules that render an election invalid if too few people vote, such as Serbia, where three successive presidential elections were rendered invalid in 2003.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades a number of {{countries}} in the developed world have experienced a drop in voter turnout. The public sector is in the end run by politicians who are elected by the people and for that reason it is interesting to study how a variation in turnout will affect public policy outcome. The purpose of this master’s thesis is to investigate the potential causal link that runs between voting system, turnout and policy by empirically testing the Meltzer & Richard’s theory from 1981. I use Swedish and Finnish municipal panel data and apply IV-regression. The constitutional change in 1970 when Sweden changed from having separate election days for the central and the local governments into having one joint election day, is used as instrument for turnout. I find that an increased <b>turnout</b> rate also <b>leads</b> to higher local tax rate indicating that turnout actually has an impact on policy outcome...|$|R
40|$|Should voter {{awareness}} {{policies and}} get-out-the-vote movements be promoted? We address this question using {{a model of}} political advertising that incorporates both the mobilization and the persuasion aspects of advertising. An uncertainvoter model of two-candidate political competition is proposed, where candidates have fixed symmetric ideological positions and unknown qualities and can use political advertising, to inform voters about their qualities. By reducing or eliminating voters’ uncertainty about who the right candidate is, political advertising can both mobilize citizens and change their minds about which candidate to vote for. We characterize the equilibrium and conduct comparative static analysis allowing us to evaluate the effect of voter awareness policies or the activity of get-out-the vote movements on political advertising, turnout, and electoral outcomes. We find that, although successful at increasing voter <b>turnout,</b> they may <b>lead</b> to either an increase or a decrease in political advertising {{as well as in}} the probability that the candidate preferred by a majority of (all informed) citizens is elected...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} costs {{incurred}} by railway companies is the maintenance of turnouts. This situation occurs because the large dynamic forces between the wheels of a train and the rails of a turnout cause excessive wear, rolling contact fatigue and rapid degradation of other components. A thorough understanding of the dynamic interaction between a train and a <b>turnout</b> could <b>lead</b> to a better design of the corresponding vehicle/track or of the damage mechanisms and subsequently to a smarter maintenance planning. Such an insight can be obtained through a detailed model of the train-turnout interaction. Such models {{exist in the literature}} for vehicle-track interaction, but they have some shortcomings when it comes to train-turnout interaction. This leads to the following research questions: 1. How to model the wheel rail contact? In this thesis different models are presented for the search of the contact location {{as well as for the}} normal and the tangential contact problem. Especially the relation between the contact models and vehicle dynamic simulation is investigated. 2. How to model the interaction between the wagons of the train? A quasi static approach has been presented and the results have been compared to results obtained through dynamic simulation. The analysis of the contact models in this dissertation will help researchers choose between the different contact models and their interaction with vehicle dynamic software. This should enable researchers to accurately model the contact in turnouts so that the deterioration mechanisms in turnouts can be understood. In turn, this understanding should lead to better maintenance and associated cost savings. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The United States has lower turnout {{than almost}} all other {{long-term}} democracies. Low turnout in the U. S. has been blamed {{on a number}} of factors, but many authors have asserted that the personal burden placed on most voters to register in advance of the election and the need (in many states) for continued reregistration are major causes of low U. S. turnout. It is also well-known that those with higher SES characteristics tend to vote at higher rates. Indeed, the SES gap in turnout rates is higher in the United States than in other democracies. This fact has been a major concern for those who view political participation as a hallmark of democracy. Those concerned with low levels of U. S. turnout, particularly by the poor and the less well educated, have predicted that liberalizing U. S. voter registration laws will significantly improve turnout, and that the gains will be especially great among the groups who now vote at the lowest rates. Here we offer a rational choice model of <b>turnout</b> that <b>leads</b> us to expect the greatest turnout gains from virtually eliminating voter registration costs in the United States will instead accrue to those with medium income and education.

40|$|In this dissertation, I write three {{papers on}} American politics. The first essay, ``Do Americans Respond to Presidential Pork?,'' {{examines}} {{the impact of}} presidential pork, party identification, and citizen ideology on presidential vote choice and voter turnout. It could be possible that increased government spending in a person's local area will increase his income and thus induce him to evaluate the incumbent presidential candidate through retrospective economic pocketbook voting. I also give a counter reasons of why voters would not respond to presidential pork: Americans do not {{pay much attention to}} how much the government is spending in their local area especially when people weigh heavily their ideology and party ID when making vote and turnout decisions. I then find, contrary to previous studies, strong evidence that voters do not respond to pork by changing their who they will vote for but find some evidence that people do respond by turning out to vote. My statistical analysis reveals that pork barrel spending did not switch people's vote choice in favor of the incumbent candidate in the 1988, 2008, and 2012 presidential elections. In fact, I find that the absolute level of spending in per capita terms for a county actually hurt McCain 2008. I do find that pork slightly increases the probability that a person turns out to vote for McCain 2008. But even though the results are statistically significant, they are not substantively significant enough to believe that presidential pork has a huge mobilizing effect for the candidate of the incumbent party. Furthermore, when I analyze the 1988 election between Bush and Dukakis with ANES data, I find that pork has no statistically significant effect on <b>turnout.</b> This <b>leads</b> me to conclude that presidential pork has no significant influence over vote choice or voter turnout. In the second paper, ``A Factional Theory of Parties,'' I investigate the conditions under which groups in society coalesce to form large-tent parties previous to any election. I construct a formal model where groups seek to win office to implement their ideal points. These groups can either run on their own in the election or form coalitional parties. Each group has activists who are able to influence independent voters by contributing campaign resources. Coalitional parties can form in two cases. First, if there are no intense policy demanders (groups who care mostly about one policy dimension), then groups will coalesce and combine activist resources only if their influence in campaigning is significant. Second, if there are many policy dimensions and intense policy demanders then the influence of activists can be very weak and coalitional parties will still form. The reason why they form is very similar to vote-trading (logrolling). And coalitions need not be minimal winning in my model. In the third paper, ``Who Are the Moderates?,'' I investigate which Americans are extreme in their political opinions. I focus on two schools of thought: the political economy school and the public opinion school. The political economy tradition argues that people are mainly interested in their material interest: rich people want less income redistribution and poor people want more. Thus, rich people should be conservative and poor people should be liberal. The public opinion tradition argues that the more politically informed a person is the more likely she is to agree with her partisan affiliation. I extend this to imply that more informed {{people are more likely to}} be extreme in their political beliefs. Since Liberal and Conservative ideologies hold policy positions on many different issues (the economy, abortion, immigration, gay marriage, the environment), I do a study of how income and political knowledge effects a person's opinion on specific issues. I find support for both of these schools of thought on public opinion...|$|R
