He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E

25|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for base money, the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. <b>To</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> assets, new central bank money is generated in the seller's loro account, increasing the total amount of base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Large {{quantities}} of goods were in Britain or in transit when Washington suddenly and unexpectedly terminated Lend-Lease on 21 August 1945. The British economy had been heavily geared towards war production (around 55% GDP) and had drastically reduced its exports. The UK therefore relied on Lend-Lease imports to obtain essential consumer commodities {{such as food}} while it {{could no longer afford}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> items using export profits. The end of lend-lease thus came as a great economic shock. Britain needed to retain some of this equipment in the immediate post war period. As a result, the Anglo-American loan came about. Lend-lease items retained were sold to Britain at the knockdown price of about 10 cents on the dollar giving an initial value of £1.075 billion.|$|E
25|$|The HBC {{built a new}} {{much larger}} Fort Vancouver in 1824 {{slightly}} upstream of Fort Astoria {{on the north side}} of the Columbia River (they were hoping the Columbia would be the future Canada–U.S. border). The fort quickly became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to the Pacific (via Cape Horn) to drop off supplies and trade goods in their trading posts in the Pacific Northwest and pick up the accumulated furs used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> supplies. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Russian Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle in about 1840, Fort Vancouver and its Factor (manager) watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, 6 ships, and about 600 employees.|$|E

500|$|The Gold Rush stimulated economies {{around the}} world as well. Farmers in Chile, Australia, and Hawaii found a huge new market for their food; British {{manufactured}} goods were in high demand; clothing and even prefabricated houses arrived from China. The return of large amounts of California gold <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> goods raised prices and stimulated investment and the creation of jobs {{around the world}}. Australian prospector Edward Hargraves, noting similarities between the geography of California and his home country, returned to Australia to discover gold and spark the Australian gold rushes. [...] Preceding the Gold Rush, the United States was on a bi-metallic standard, but the sudden increase in physical gold supply increased the relative value of physical silver and drove silver money from circulation. [...] The increase in gold supply also created a monetary supply shock.|$|E

As he completed his fifth trip to Iowa, party officials in the state remarked that he was [...] "making inroads" [...] in the state, commenting that [...] "Democrats are looking for somebody who is new and fresh." [...] The candidate revealed his economic goals during a speech, stating [...] "that creating opportunity for middle-class Americans will be a centerpiece of my campaign." [...] He then listed his objectives including: tax credits to pay for college tuition of low to mid-level income Americans, covering insurance costs of small businesses for its sickest employees, and incentives for saving and buying automobiles with [...] "good gas mileage."

In 1887, {{shortly after his}} retirement, {{he wrote a letter}} to the editor of The Times addressing some of the highly publicized problems of desertions from the ranks. [...] "War Office civilians," [...] he wrote, [...] "like the plan of indiscriminate enlist, as it swells their list of recruits. [...] Then, when the list of deserters grows, they put on long faces, and say, 'it must be those wicked officers.' [...] The officers would stop this plan in a day if they were allowed." [...] The problem with recruiters, Phipps maintained, lay in the need for quantity, not quality. [...] "What fools you civilians are <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> blackguards," [...] he wrote. [...] "If you would let the officers select their men, for the first year or so, you would have fewer men on paper, fewer men in prison, and just as many men for service....I will then give you another hint for saving money...why not do away with the Inspector-General of Recruiting, and spend his pay in horse artillery, who would be very ornamental and very serviceable? What use is the Inspector General?" [...] He had retired from active service in 1883, and Phipps fully retired in 1887, after attaining the rank of colonel.|$|E

He and Keays began working as a writing team. Ford's arrival filled the gap left by Bowers' departure and made possible their transition from pop band to rock group.

The Manchukuoan pilots were given the estimated arrival time of the bombers and would take off about twenty minutes before they were due to arrive, climbing to 7,000 meters to make head-on passes before the B-29s got out of range. Some Manchukuoan pilots were also given kamikaze training and at least one downed a B-29 by crashing a Ki-27 into it. By the time the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation was launched by the Soviet Red Army in August 1945, the Manchukuo Air Force had practically ceased to exist, although there were isolated incidents of Manchukuoan planes attacking Soviet aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Some [...] "hospital services" [...] {{can be done}} as {{inpatient}} services, {{which would}} be reimbursed under Part A; or as outpatient services, which would be reimbursed, not under Part A, but under Part B instead. The [...] "Two-Midnight Rule" [...] decides which is which. In August 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a final rule concerning eligibility for hospital inpatient services effective October 1, 2013. Under the new rule, if a physician admits a Medicare beneficiary as an inpatient with an expectation that the patient will require hospital care that “crosses two midnights,” Medicare Part A payment is “generally appropriate.” However, if it is anticipated that the patient will require hospital care for less than two midnights, Medicare Part A payment is generally not appropriate; payment such as is approved will be paid under Part B. The time a patient spends in the hospital before an inpatient admission is formally ordered is considered outpatient time. But, hospitals and physicians can {{take into consideration the}} pre-inpatient admission time when determining if a patient’s care will reasonably be expected to cross two midnights to be covered under Part A. In addition to deciding which trust fund is used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>these</b> various outpatient vs. inpatient charges, the number of days for which a person is formally considered an admitted patient affects eligibility for Part A skilled nursing services.|$|E
