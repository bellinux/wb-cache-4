2500|$|Ocean's lyrics {{deal with}} themes of love, longing, misgiving, and nostalgia. His debut single [...] "Novacane" [...] juxtaposes the {{numbness}} and artificiality {{of a sexual}} relationship with that of mainstream radio, while [...] "Voodoo" [...] merges themes of spirituality and sexuality, and is an eccentric take on such subject matter common in R The latter song was released by Ocean on his Tumblr account and references both the traditional spiritual [...] "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" [...] and the female anatomy in its chorus: [...] "she's got <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in her juicy fruit / he's got <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in his pants / he wrapped <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in a wedding band / then put <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> on her hands / she's got <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in her hands / he's got <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>wide</b> <b>world</b> in his hands." [...] Certain songs on channel ORANGE allude to Ocean's experience with unrequited love. Culture critic Nelson George asserts that, along with Miguel, Ocean has [...] "staked out ground where [...] not competing with those hit-driven [...] acts" [...] and is [...] "cultivating a sound that balances adult concerns with a sense of young men trying to understand their own desires (an apt description of Ocean, particularly)." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} issues raised by {{checking}} potential update anomalies of a web site. It is of course impossible to control the updates for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web. However, it is conceivable to provide tools for pointing out potential missing updates for a given web site (i. e, a set of Web pages, for instance related to a given matter or to a given institution, which is under the control of a web site manager). The assumption that we make in this paper is that modeling the semantics of the considered Web site is possible, while modeling the semantics of the sources outside of it, which can be connected to it, is not possible. Therefore, two different update problems have to be distinguished, depending on whether the updates that have to be done inside the web site are triggered by changes occuring inside or outside the web site. 1 Introduction The <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web(WWW) is a tremendous source of information which {{can be viewed as a}} large, heterogeneous and distributed databas [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|In July 2012 Winick {{announced}} that he was leaving Catwoman after issue #12, in order to create an all-ages, original graphic novel called Hilo (pronounced [...] "High-Low"), a move that Winick explained was inspired a year or so prior when his then-seven-year-old son asked to read his work. Not having age-appropriate material for him, Winick gave him Jeff Smith's Bone, which both father and son enjoyed, and decided to create an all-ages story that his son could read. The full color series, whose tone and visuals Winick describes as [...] "part E.T., part Doctor Who, part Peanuts and Calvin and Hobbes", stars a small town boy named D.J. whose life takes an unexpected turn when a mysterious boy named Hilo falls from the sky, and takes D.J. and his friend Gina on adventures that include robots, aliens and a quest to save the world. The series represents Winick's first artwork since 2002's The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius: Gorilla Warfare, as well as his first children's book. It is published by Random House, with the first book published in September 2015. The deal is for three books, though Winick plans to have a total of six graphic novels by the time the story is finished, and hopes to release a book every six months. The first two volumes of the Hilo series, Hilo, the Boy Who Crashed to Earth and Hilo, Saving <b>the</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>World,</b> are New York Times bestsellers.|$|E

40|$|As a <b>whole,</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web {{displays}} a striking ``rich get richer'' behavior, {{with a relatively}} small number of sites receiving a disproportionately large share of hyperlink references and traffic. However, hidden in this skewed global distribution, we discover a qualitatively different and considerably less biased link distribution among subcategories of pages [...] -for example, among all university homepages or all newspaper homepages. While the connectivity distribution over the entire web is close to a pure power law, we find that the distribution within specific categories is typically unimodal on a log scale, with the location of the mode, and thus the extent of the ``rich get richer'' phenomenon, varying across different categories. Similar distributions occur in many other naturally-occurring networks, including research paper citations, movie actor collaborations, and US power grid connections. A simple generative model, incorporating a mixture of preferential and uniform attachment, quantifies the degree to which the rich nodes grow richer, and how new (and poorly-connected) nodes can compete. The model accurately accounts for the true connectivity distributions of category-specific web pages, the web as a whole, and other social networks...|$|R

5000|$|In 2016, India {{also put}} {{forwarded}} {{a new plan}} to control internet usage of its netizen's. Accessing or pop-ups from ad services or malware infection of websites banned in India might invite 3 years of jail sentence and a fine of Rs 3 lakh. As of now URLs and websites were blocked using DNS-filtering. This means the DNS of the blocked site was added to a list maintained by the internet service provider and whenever a user tried connecting to that site, the DNS server of the internet service provider would block that request. The respected officials suspect netizens are circumventing these measures knowingly or unknowingly. Government also intends to provide wide educative information classes, provision of free operating system with utilities for malware free access to internet and for computerized activities of daily life as a primary method. Currently the government are joining hands with media content providers and internet service providers like big companies Tata Communications and Airtel to manage a number of internet gateways in India. Though many legal, technical and social action groups consider this as a threatening approach. Many social action groups say that these as inappropriate time and money spend while real issues like unemployment, access to education, freedom of practicing religion, women and children safety, drug use are ever rising. Lawyers with technical background say this might be warning message and DNS filtering is a better practice for enforcing Anti-piracy laws in current India. Some of them are also wary about how will these actions get reflected in terms hostility towards human rights, implications of these fines, profiteering stakeholders agendas, is it the government's first step to a long term plan [...] "monitoring <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>wide</b> web" [...] as China does. Many of these services are malvertising, click away access and pops ups, how does the government intend to tackle these issues and problems with the current plan that is heavily in favor of corporation's margin and doesn't cater to its users needs. Other groups express their fear and uneasiness whether these will lead to emergency era like arrests where anything that government bodies believe is an [...] "offence under the laws of India, including {{but not limited to}} under Sections 63, 63-A, 65 and 65-A of the Copyright Act, 1957".|$|R
40|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web is a {{powerful}} tool for education. Educators can, with the touch of a few keystrokes, have access to contemporary information and materials to assist them in the teaching and learning process. Yet many teachers find the <b>world</b> <b>wide</b> web a daunting maze full of dead ends and unrealised opportunities despite the best efforts of search engines to locate the most appropriate sites. Most teachers do not have the skills or the time to view and evaluate even {{a small fraction of the}} results from search engines, let alone adapt these materials so that they are suitable for classes which they teach. The situation is often worse for school children searching for materials for school projects and science fairs or information to help them with their homework. The students are bombarded by the results of search engines, unaware of the reliability issues of the sites they visit and frustrated by highly technical jargon. To complicate matters further, the needs of teachers and students are rarely the same. Despite these substantial problems, there are many sites that are excellent sources of information and materials for teachers and students. Locating them is often more a case of good fortune than good planning in the selection of key words and phrases. A considerable effort has gone into creating sites to assist renewable energy educators and their students, but there is no overview available to guide beginners to the best sources. It is wasteful of time and resources for energy teachers and students to have to search <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web to find the best sources, although for advanced or esoteric subjects this may still be necessary. One possible solution to this problem is a one-stop shop for teachers and students. This could be single site with an index and links to major <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web resources. The framework for this project already exists within ISES. WIRE, the Worldwide Information system for Renewable Energy could provide the host for this service to ISES members and users. This paper aims to discuss what makes some sites more useful than others and provides examples of the types of information and sites which are most suitable for both teachers and students seeking resources on renewable energy, energy efficiency and global warming. We will also discuss some simple guidelines and strategies, which could be used to create sites and resources, which are suitable for use by educators and students to assist the integration of the <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> Web into the renewable energy classroom...|$|R
