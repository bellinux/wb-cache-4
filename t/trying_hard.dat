He {{had just taken}} an outstanding catch to dismiss Allan Border in a World Series Cup match, when he hurt his leg badly.

25|$|Jousting is a martial game or hastilude {{between two}} {{horsemen}} wielding lances with blunted tips, often {{as part of}} a tournament. The primary aim was to replicate a clash of heavy cavalry, with each opponent <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> to strike the opponent while riding towards him at high speed, if possible breaking the lance on the opponent's shield or jousting armour, or unhorsing him. The joust became an iconic characteristic of the knight in Romantic medievalism. The participants experience close to three and a quarter times their body weight in G-forces when the lances collide with their armor.|$|E
25|$|Higgins had a poor 2011/2012 season, {{reaching}} {{only two}} quarter finals of major ranking events. His season-best performance was reaching the semi-finals of the Masters, where he lost 4–6 to Shaun Murphy. Before {{the start of}} his World Championship title defence, he admitted that his performance levels had not been good enough and that he had not been <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> enough, managing just one or two days of practice a week. In {{the first round of the}} tournament, he came from 6–8 down to defeat Liang Wenbo 10–9. He then played Stephen Hendry in the second round, the first time the two players had ever met in a World Championship, but Hendry thrashed the defending champion 13–4, with Higgins calling it the worst he had ever played at the Crucible. He finished the season ranked world number five.|$|E

[...] With the peloton not <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> to chase them, they built a ten-minute lead {{by the middle of}} the stage. In the second half of the stage, there was some sunshine, but also strong crosswinds: with Sky, Tinkoff and Etixx–Quick-Step working hard at the front of the peloton, there were splits in the group. Alexander Kristoff was in the second group on the road, but he was able to get back to the front as the groups came together.|$|E

[...] Heather Phares of AllMusic was also critical about Willett throughout the album, finding his voice [...] "unfettered to the point of grating ("Something Is Not Right with Me")" [...] and lyrics to be [...] "overworked instead of clever ("Against Privacy")" [...] but found some of the songs carried sharp songwriting skills ("Golden Gate Jumpers") and flair ("I've Seen Enough") concluding that [...] "Cold War Kids deserve credit for their ambitions, but there's a fine line between <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> and trying too hard.

Friday {{reported}} back for pre-season training in bad condition, and although Hurley claimed that Friday was <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> to regain fitness, the forward was having trouble with his asthma, had lost some of his pace and was obviously unfit. Although his performances during August quickly improved, they were still not up to his previous standard and the Evening Post revealed on the 30th that Reading were preparing to sell him [...] "to a First Division club". After scoring in two successive Reading home wins on 4 and 7 September, against Walsall and Wrexham respectively, Friday {{took part in a}} third consecutive victory on the 13th, away against Northampton Town. After this he missed two matches, according to the Post because he was suffering from flu, and {{when he returned to the}} team was far from his best; [...] "Suddenly he had lost a yard and his control of the ball was not as good", Hurley recalled.|$|E
500|$|... "No Surprises", {{recorded}} {{in a single}} take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, creating an [...] "ethereal" [...] effect. Yorke identified {{the subject of the}} song as [...] "someone who's <b>trying</b> <b>hard</b> to keep it together but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, [...] "a heart that's full up like a landfill"; according to Yorke, the song is a [...] "fucked-up nursery rhyme" [...] that [...] "stems from my unhealthy obsession {{of what to do with}} plastic boxes and plastic bottles... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how we deal, that's how I deal with stuff, I bury it." [...] The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, [...] "even when the subject is suicide... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer." ...|$|E
