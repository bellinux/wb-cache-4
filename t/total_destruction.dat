40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} exergy destroyed by {{operation of a}} conventional steam power plant is computed via an exergy cascade. An order of magnitude analysis shows that exergy destruction is dominated by combustion and heat transfer across temperature differences inside the boiler, and conversion of energy entering the turbine/generator sets from thermal to electrical. Combustion and heat transfer inside the boiler accounts for 53. 83 percent of the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction.</b> Converting thermal energy into electrical energy is responsible for 41. 34 percent of the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction.</b> Heat transfer across the condenser accounts for 2. 89 percent of the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction.</b> Fluid flow with friction is responsible for 0. 50 percent of the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction.</b> The boiler feed pump turbine accounts for 0. 25 percent of the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction.</b> Fluid flow mixing is responsible for 0. 23 percent of the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction.</b> Other equipment including gland steam condenser, drain cooler, deaerator and heat exchangers are, in the aggregate, responsible for {{less than one percent}} of the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction.</b> An energy analysis is also given for comparison of exergy cascade to energy cascade. Efficiencies based on both the first law and second law of thermodynamics are calculated for a number of components and for the plant. The results show that high first law efficiency does not mean high second law efficiency. Therefore, the second law analysis has been proven to be a more powerful tool in pinpointing real losses. The procedure used to determine <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction</b> and second law efficiency can be used in a conceptual design and parametric study to evaluate the performance of other steam power plants and other thermal systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{necessity}} of air-conditioning causes the enormous energy use of underground train stations. Exergy and thermoeconomic analysis {{is applied to}} the annual operation of the air-conditioning system of a large underground train station in Taiwan. The current installation and the monitored data are taken to be the base case, which is then compared to three different optimized designs. The total revenue requirement levelized cost rate and the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction</b> rate are used to evaluate the merits. The results show that the cost optimization objective would obtain a lower total revenue requirement levelized cost rate, but at the expense of a higher <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction</b> rate. Optimization of thermodynamic efficiency, however, leads to a lower <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction</b> rate, but would increase the total revenue requirement levelized cost rate significantly. It has been shown that multi-objective optimization would result in a small marginal increase in total revenue requirement levelized cost rate, but achieve a significantly lower <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction</b> rate. Results in terms of the normalized total revenue requirement levelized cost rate and the normalized <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction</b> rate are also presented. It has been shown by second law analysis when applied to underground train stations that lower annual energy use and lower CO 2 emissions can be achieved...|$|R

5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed {{in preparation for a}} possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the <b>total</b> <b>destruction</b> of the attackerâ€”the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, German {{forces were}} {{defeated}} in the second battle of El Alamein, thwarting Hitler's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East. Overconfident in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940, Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning, with damaging consequences. In December 1942 and January 1943, Hitler's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost <b>total</b> <b>destruction</b> of the 6th Army. Over 200,000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235,000 were taken prisoner. Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk. Hitler's military judgement became increasingly erratic, and Germany's military and economic position deteriorated, as did Hitler's health.|$|E

40|$|The <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction</b> {{occurring}} in a component {{is not only}} due to the component itself (endogenous exergy destruction) but is also caused by the inefficiencies of the remaining system components (exogenous exergy destruction). Hence {{care must be taken}} in using the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction</b> of a component for making decisions to optimize the overall energy system. In this paper, a complex industrial plant is analyzed by splitting the componentâ€™s exergy destruction into its endogenous part (the part resulting totally from the componentâ€™s irreversibilities) and its exogenous part (resulting from the irreversibilities of the other components within the system). It is observed that the steam generator has the dominant effect. From the <b>total</b> exergy <b>destruction</b> in the steam generator, 1, 097. 63 kW or 96. 95 % come from internal irreversibilities in the component, while the influence of other components on the loss of useful work in the steam generator is only 3. 05 %...|$|R

The Codex contained two statutes that decreed the <b>total</b> <b>destruction</b> of paganism, even in private life; these provisions were zealously enforced. Contemporary sources (John Malalas, Theophanes, John of Ephesus) tell of severe persecutions, even of men in high position.

Despite the fact that it altered the target system priorities outlined in AWPD-42, and changed the overall goal of the offensive from knocking Germany out of the war using airpower to one of preparing for the invasion of Europe, Hansell approved the designation of the German aircraft industry as its most important target and the destruction of the German Luftwaffe as its top priority. Hansell wrote the final draft of the CBO plan himself.

5|$|The Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania {{resulted}} in the near <b>total</b> <b>destruction</b> of Lithuanian Jews (Litvaks), living in Generalbezirk Litauen of Reichskommissariat Ostland within the Nazi-controlled Lithuanian SSR.

More than 95% of Lithuania's Jewish population was massacred over the three-year German occupation â€” a more complete destruction than befell any other country affected by the Holocaust. Historians attribute this to the massive collaboration in the genocide by the non-Jewish local paramilitaries, though the reasons for this collaboration are still debated.

Of the captured ships, three were no longer serviceable and were burnt in the bay, and three others were judged fit only for harbour duties owing to the damage they had received in the battle. The remainder enjoyed long and successful service careers in the Royal Navy; two subsequently served at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E

5|$|While {{tropical}} cyclones {{may well}} seriously damage settlement, <b>total</b> <b>destruction</b> encourages rebuilding.

However, disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages more people to live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms. Hurricane Katrina is the most obvious example, as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after Hurricane Camille. Many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well.|$|E
5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum.
