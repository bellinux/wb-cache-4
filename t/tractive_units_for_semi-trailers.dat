40|$|This study {{presents}} a Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) methodology <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> design. At present, many Chinese semi-trailer enterprises have low design level and their products {{often have a}} relatively short life-span. To solve this problem, {{it is necessary to}} integrate intelligent design process into semi-trailer design. Then a rapid design system <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> based on KBE is put forward. Combining with the UG development tools (KF, UDF, Part Family and Reuse Library), CBR (Case-Based Reasoning), parametric modeling and knowledge integration techniques, the rapid design system <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> is realized. The system provides appropriate suggestions and supports to promote working efficiency. Besides, it also achieves knowledge reuse and accumulation, improves the design quality and significantly reduces the design cycle...|$|R

50|$|By 1934, the {{original}} site had become inadequate and 3½ acres of adjoining land were purchased for expansion. Although car body production {{was coming to}} an end, major contracts for the GPO were obtained during the 1930s, for telephone repair vans in the main, on either Morris Minor or larger Morris Commercial Chassis, although two specials were BLB444 of 1934 the blue streamlined van designed to publicise the air mail service, which was modelled as a Dinky Toy. and GPO1 which was a Morris Commercial Leader <b>tractive</b> <b>unit</b> coupled to a Brockhouse semi-trailer upon which Duple built a travelling post office for use at agricultural shows, race meetings and other major public events.|$|R
5000|$|The cargo trailer is, {{by means}} of a king pin, hooked to a horseshoe-shaped {{quick-release}} coupling device called a fifth wheel or a turntable hitch {{at the rear of the}} towing engine that allows easy hook up and release. The truck trailer cannot move by itself because it only has wheels at the rear end: it requires a forward axle, provided by the towing engine, to carry half the load weight. When braking hard at high speeds, the vehicle has a tendency to fold at the pivot point between the towing vehicle and the trailer. Such a truck accident is called a [...] "trailer swing", although it is also commonly described as a [...] "jackknife". Jackknifing is a condition where the <b>tractive</b> <b>unit</b> swings round against the trailer, and not vice versa.|$|R

50|$|When {{vehicles}} {{enter the}} cross-over area, unless markings {{on the ground}} indicate two turning lanes in the cross-over, drivers form one lane. A cross-over with two lanes is designed at high-volume cross-overs, or when the right lane turns onto an intersecting street. In this case, the right lane is reserved for vehicles completing the design. Most cross overs must be made large enough <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks to complete the cross over. This large cross-over area often leads to two vehicles incorrectly lining up at a single cross-over.|$|R
5|$|Since June 2011, the E751 {{comprises}} the Croatian A8 and A9 tolled motorways of the Istrian Y. The tolls there {{are based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed-toll system. Tolls charged along the A9 motorway toll plazas vary depending on the length of route traveled and range from 3.00 kuna (€0.40) to 26.00 kuna (€3.51) for passenger cars and 15.00 kuna (€2.02) to 185.00 kuna (€25.00) <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks. Although A8 also employs a ticket system, usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the KanfanarRogovići section. A user of {{the entire length of the}} A8 is charged 36.00 kuna (€4.86) for passenger cars or up to 205.00 kuna (€27.70) <b>for</b> <b>semi-trailers,</b> depending on vehicle classification in Croatia. Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads.

40|$|The length {{legislation}} for trucks in Europe regulates the total {{length of a}} vehicle combination, {{from the front of}} the cab to the trailing edge of the trailer. The European Cab Over Engine (COE) <b>tractive</b> <b>units</b> are, compared to the conventional designs with a hood, not preferred aerodynamically due to its flat front and relatively sharp edges. If elongating the nose of the COE cab, creating a so-called Soft Nose (SN), potential for improved aerodynamic properties is seen. To improve the transport efficiency, some countries in Europe allow vehicle combinations of up to 25. 25 m; the aerodynamic properties of these longer vehicles have however not been in much focus historically. This thesis deals with perspectives of aerodynamic drag and cooling airflow for heavy trucks, under the circumstances of reconsidered total length legislation. The potential for design changes of different parts of a complete truck-trailer combination have been evaluated. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was the main tool for obtaining the results; measurements have been used to verify the results.|$|R

40|$|The results {{presented}} in this thesis showed {{that there are many}} areas on a complete truck-trailer combination where substantial drag reductions may be acquired. It has been seen that for longer vehicle combinations, the gap between the cargo-units and the chassis level of the trailer units were large sources of drag, especially in yawed-wind conditions. By design changes of these areas, drag was reduced by significant amounts. Working with the front-end of the COE cab, an elongation of the grille area could result in both improved aerodynamic properties, but also cooling airflow can be enhanced if also considering the layout of the components in the under hood. Without a ducting system, guiding the flow from the grille towards the cooling module, or a movement of the cooling module by the same magnitude as the SN elongation, {{a large portion of the}} airflow in the under hood leaked around the cooling module and reduced cooling capacity. The main conclusion to be made is that there still are much room for aerodynamic improvements on a truck-trailer combination if reconsidering the total-length legislation. Ideally, the <b>tractive</b> <b>units</b> and trailers should be developed as a whole, to maximize the possible aerodynamic reductions...|$|R
