5|$|As {{the first}} President, Washington was {{responsible}} for appointing the entire Supreme Court. Due to this, he filled more vacancies on the Court than any other president in American history. In September 1789, Washington nominated John Jay as the first Chief Justice and nominated John Rutledge, William Cushing, James Wilson, John Blair, and Robert Harrison as Associate Justices. All were quickly confirmed by the Senate, but after Harrison declined the appointment, Washington appointed James Iredell in 1790. The Court’s first term began on February 2, 1790, at the Royal Exchange in New York City. However, with no cases on <b>the</b> <b>docket</b> and little pressing business (a few procedural matters decided and 26 attorneys and counselors admitted to the federal bar), the term lasted for only eight days.|$|E
5|$|Brooks was {{assigned}} three prominent Minstrel attorneys, {{and after a}} year of sitting on <b>the</b> <b>docket,</b> at about 11 AM on April 15, 1874, Baxter's demurrer to Brook's complaint was suddenly called up. Neither of Baxter's lawyers were present in the court room, and the demurrer had been submitted without their knowledge. Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the new governor of Arkansas, despite having no authority to do so.|$|E

25|$|The third game on <b>the</b> <b>docket</b> for December 29 was the AutoZone Liberty Bowl at the self-named {{stadium in}} Memphis, Tennessee, pitting the Conference USA champions, the University of Houston Cougars against the SEC's University of South Carolina Gamecocks. Both teams had {{considerable}} success passing {{the ball in}} the second quarter; as a result, the halftime score had Houston leading 28–27. The shootout continued into the second half, however, South Carolina held off Houston to win by a score of 44–36. The offensive showcase set records for most points in the first half (55), most receiving yards (201 by Houston's Vincent Marshall), and most total yards gained (1,039 – 527 by Houston and 512 by South Carolina) and tied the record for touchdown passes by a single player (4 by South Carolina's Blake Mitchell). The conferences each received a check for $1.5 million for the teams' appearances.|$|E

25|$|Discretionary appeals make up {{the bulk}} of the court's docket. A {{discretionary}} appeal begins when a petition for appeal is filed with the clerk of the court. Petitions are assigned to a law clerk or staff attorney for initial research, culminating in a memorandum summarizing the pertinent facts and evaluating the legal issues raised by the petition and any brief in opposition filed in response to the petition. If the law clerk, staff attorney, or brief in opposition identify any procedural defects in the petition, it is referred to a panel of two justices who may dismiss it with or without prejudice depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. (When a petition is dismissed without prejudice, the petitioner has an opportunity to correct the procedural error and file a new petition. When a petition is dismissed with prejudice, the appeal ends and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.) Otherwise, the case is then placed on <b>the</b> <b>docket</b> for consideration by a panel of three justices.|$|E
25|$|The writ {{of error}} coram nobis {{was one of}} the oldest {{remedies}} of the common law. It lay to correct a judgment rendered by the court upon errors of fact not appearing on the record and so important that if the court had known of them at the trial it would not have rendered the judgment. The ordinary writ of error lay to an appellate court to review an error of law apparent on the record. The writ of error coram nobis lay to the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the contested judgment. Its purpose was to allow the correction of an error not appearing in the record and of a judgment which presumably would not have been entered had the error been known to the court at the trial. Further, a judgment for the plaintiff in error on an ordinary writ of error may reverse and render the judgment complained of, while a judgment for the petitioner on a writ of error coram nobis necessarily recalls and vacates the judgment complained of and restores the case to <b>the</b> <b>docket</b> for new trial.|$|E

50|$|The second {{connection}} also {{deals with}} tomb robberies and is made between <b>the</b> Abbott <b>Dockets</b> and a later series of tomb robbery trials {{which took place}} during {{the first two years of}} the era known as the Whm Mswt. From this era, which started in year 19 of the reign of Ramesses XI, several tomb-robbery papyri have survived, most notably: Papyrus Mayer A, Papyrus B.M. 10052, and Papyrus B.M. 10403. The list of thieves in <b>the</b> Abbott <b>dockets</b> foreshadows two trials described in Papyrus Mayer A. The first trial foreshadowed from <b>the</b> Abbot <b>Dockets</b> in Papyrus Mayer A is the trial concerning the thieves of the tombs of Ramesses II and Seti I. The other trial connection deals with thefts from tombs in the Necropolis of Thebes. The connection of <b>the</b> Abbott <b>dockets</b> with Papyrus B.M 10052 also deals with the trial of the thefts in the tombs of Thebes, but deals with information leading up to the trials. Lastly, the connection with <b>the</b> Abbott <b>dockets</b> and <b>the</b> Papyrus B.M 10403 deals again with trial of the thefts in the tombs of Thebes, but Papyrus B.M 10403 gives more detail on the evidence.|$|R
500|$|During the {{impeachment}} trial of President Andrew Johnson, Morton {{voted in favor}} of conviction, as did most moderate and all Radical Republicans, and openly voiced his disappointment at Johnson's acquittal. Although Morton delivered a speech in the fall of 1865 arguing that the recently freed slaves were unready for the vote, and once worked to end Indiana's so-called [...] "Black Laws" [...] that restricted blacks' basic civil rights, and the state constitutional provision forbidding their entry into the state, he reversed his position after the war. By 1866 Morton had come to share the general Republican belief that the only means of guaranteeing loyalty to governments protective of black civil rights must be through giving adult males of every race the franchise. As he explained, [...] "I confess, and I do it without shame, that I have been educated by the great events of War." [...] He championed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, and when the Democrats began to resign en masse from the Senate during its debate to prevent a quorum, Morton engineered a maneuver that kept the bill in <b>the</b> <b>docket</b> and allowed it to be passed.|$|E
500|$|After {{averaging}} 17points {{per game}} as a rookie and more than 22per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89million contract, but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth [...] $98 to $101million. However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P. J. Brown and failing {{to account for the}} impact of renegotiating Alonzo Mourning's contract before coming to terms with Howard. The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard's $9million for the 1996–97 season placed the Heat over the cap. Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5. He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100million; his seven-year contract was worth $105million. The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA draft first-round selection rights. The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player. The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract. [...] Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely, ESPN reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard. The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on <b>the</b> <b>docket</b> for New York University law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues: [...] "1.) Did the Heat circumvent the cap in first signing Mourning?; 2.) Did the Heat miscalculate bonus money for forward P. J. Brown and guard Tim Hardaway that was not counted correctly against the cap.?; 3.) Did the Heat add an illegal performance clause to Brown's contract?." [...] Meanwhile, the Heat's contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract. The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach Pat Riley, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid. If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season. By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties. [...] In addition to signing free agents Murray and Williams, the Bullets traded for Rod Strickland and Harvey Grant.|$|E
