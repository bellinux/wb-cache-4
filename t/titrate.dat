5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or <b>titrate</b> ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
25|$|When a weak base, such as pyridine, is {{dissolved}} in acetic acid, the acetic acid exerts its levelling effect and enhances the basic {{properties of the}} pyridine. It is possible, therefore, to <b>titrate</b> a solution of a weak base in acetic acid with perchloric acid in acetic acid, and obtain a sharp endpoint when attempts {{to carry out the}} titration in aqueous solution are unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Sensitivity {{may also}} be {{controlled}} by varying the dependency of the cells on their reporter genes. For example, this may be affected by altering the concentration of histidine in the growth medium for his3-dependent cells and altering the concentration of streptomycin for aadA dependent cells. Selection-gene-dependency {{may also be}} controlled by applying an inhibitor of the selection gene at a suitable concentration. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) for example, is a competitive inhibitor of the HIS3-gene product and {{may be used to}} <b>titrate</b> the minimum level of HIS3 expression required for growth on histidine-deficient media.|$|E

25|$|Ingesting a {{compound}} by smoking {{is one of}} the most rapid and efficient methods of introducing it into the bloodstream, second only to injection, which allows for the rapid feedback which supports the smokers' ability to <b>titrate</b> their dosage. On average it takes about ten seconds for the substance to reach the brain. As a result of the efficiency of this delivery system, many smokers feel as though they are unable to cease. Of those who attempt cessation and last three months without succumbing to nicotine, most are able to remain smoke-free for the rest of their lives. There exists a possibility of depression in some who attempt cessation, as with other psychoactive substances. Depression is also common in teenage smokers; teens who smoke are four times as likely to develop depressive symptoms as their nonsmoking peers.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to account for conformational fluctuations of a protein in predicting the pK(a) values of its <b>titrating</b> groups. Conformations of the protein are generated by conventional molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations, in which the protonations of the <b>titrating</b> groups are fixed. For each protein conformation, the electrostatic free energies required to add a proton charge to a <b>titrating</b> group while other groups are either unprotonated or protonated are calculated within a dielectric continuum model. These are {{used to determine the}} mean protonations of the <b>titrating</b> groups in the conformation at a series of pH values. The mean protonations are then used to determine the relative weight of the particular conformation with the <b>titrating</b> groups having all possible protonations. A conformationally averaged mean protonation for each <b>titrating</b> group is finally obtained by the weighted sum of the group's mean protonations in all the conformations. This method is applied to yeast iso- 1 -ferricytochrome c. The predicted pK(a) values are in general agreement with experimental results. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To compare {{standard}} {{high flow}} oxygen treatment with <b>titrated</b> oxygen treatment {{for patients with}} an acute exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} in the prehospital setting. Design: Cluster randomised controlled parallel group trial. Setting: Ambulance service in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Participants: 405 patients with a presumed acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were treated by paramedics, transported, and admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital during the trial period; 214 had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease confirmed by lung function tests in the previous five years. Interventions: High flow oxygen treatment compared with <b>titrated</b> oxygen treatment in the prehospital (ambulance/paramedic) setting. Main outcome measure: Prehospital or in-hospital mortality. Results: In an intention to treat analysis, the risk of death was significantly lower in the <b>titrated</b> oxygen arm compared with the high flow oxygen arm for all patients (high flow oxygen n= 226; <b>titrated</b> oxygen n= 179) and for the subgroup of patients with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (high flow n= 117; <b>titrated</b> n= 97). Overall mortality was 9 % (21 deaths) in the high flow oxygen arm compared with 4 % (7 deaths) in the <b>titrated</b> oxygen arm; mortality in the subgroup with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 9 % (11 deaths) in the high flow arm compared with 2 % (2 deaths) in the <b>titrated</b> oxygen arm. <b>Titrated</b> oxygen treatment reduced mortality compared with high flow oxygen by 58 % for all patients (relative risk 0. 42, 95 % confidence interval 0. 20 to 0. 89; P= 0. 02) and by 78 % for the patients with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0. 22, 0. 05 to 0. 91; P= 0. 04). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received <b>titrated</b> oxygen according to the protocol were significantly less likely to have respiratory acidosis (mean difference in pH 0. 12 (SE 0. 05); P= 0. 01; n= 28) or hypercapnia (mean difference in arterial carbon dioxide pressure − 33. 6 (16. 3) mm Hg; P= 0. 02; n= 29) than were patients who received high flow oxygen. Conclusions: <b>Titrated</b> oxygen treatment significantly reduced mortality, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis compared with high flow oxygen in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These results provide strong evidence to recommend the routine use of <b>titrated</b> oxygen treatment in patients with breathlessness and a history or clinical likelihood of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the prehospital setting...|$|R
40|$|Background—The {{supplemental}} {{oxygen flow rate}} is a common bedside measure of gas exchange impairment. We aimed {{to determine whether a}} <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement predicted mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods—We examined 104 adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis enrolled in a prospective cohort study and a validation cohort of 151 adults with a variety of interstitial lung diseases. The <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement was defined as the lowest oxygen flow rate required to maintain an oxyhemoglobin saturation of 96 % while standing. Cox proportional hazards models and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves were used to examine survival time. Results—A higher <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement was associated with a greater mortality rate independent of forced vital capacity and six-minute walk test results in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (adjusted hazard ratio per 1 L/min = 1. 10, 95 % confidence interval 1. 01 to 1. 20). The <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement was at least as accurate as pulmonary function and six-minute walk testing at predicting 1 -year mortality. Findings were similar in other interstitial lung diseases. Conclusion—The <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement is a simple, inexpensive bedside measuremen...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} {{effects of}} a pre-fixed flow of air-oxygen versus a flow <b>titrated</b> according to visible bubbling are not well understood. Objective: To compare the {{effects of a}} fixed flow (5 L/min) and <b>titrated</b> flow (flow just enough to ensure bubbling) at different set pressures on delivered intra-prong pressure, gas exchange and clinical parameters in preterm infants on bubble CPAP for respiratory distress. Methods: Preterm infants less than 35 weeks gestation on bubble CPAP and less than 96 h of age, were enrolled in this cross over study. They were subjected to 30 minute periods of <b>titrated</b> flow and fixed flow. At the end of both epochs, gas flow rate, set pressure, FiO 2, SpO 2, Silverman retraction score, respiratory rate, abdominal girth, and blood gases were recorded. The delivered intra-prong pressure was measured by an electronic manometer. Results: Sixty nine recordings were made in 54 infants. For each of the set CPAP pressures (4, 5 and 6 cm H 2 O), the mean delivered pressure with a fixed flow of 5 L/min was higher than that delivered by the <b>titrated</b> flow. During the fixed flow epoch, the delivered pressure was closer to and higher than the set pressure resulting in higher PaO 2 and lower PaCO 2 as compared to <b>titrated</b> flow epoch. In the <b>titrated</b> flow period, the delivered pressure was consistently lower than the set pressure. Conclusion: In preterm infants on bubble CPAP with set pressures of 4 to 6 cm H 2 O, a fixed flow of 5 L/min is more effective than a flow <b>titrated</b> to ensure adequate visible bubbling. It achieves higher delivered pressures, better oxygenation and ventilation...|$|R
