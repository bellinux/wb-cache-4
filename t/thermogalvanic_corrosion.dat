40|$|Corrosion {{resistance}} of Alloy 31, a highly alloyed stainless steel (UNS N 08031) were studied in heavy brine LiBr solutions (400, 700 and 992 g/l) at different temperatures using electrochemical techniques. The mixed potential theory {{was used to}} evaluate <b>thermogalvanic</b> <b>corrosion</b> of Alloy 31 in the studied LiBr solutions. Potentiodynamic curves indicate that high temperatures favoured both cathodic and anodic processes, increasing passive current densities and decreasing the pitting potential. Generally, the cold electrode of the pair was the anode of the thermogalvanic cell...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thermo{{galvanic}}</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{is a form}} of {{galvanic action}} in which metal dissolves from one surface and deposits on another {{as the result of a}} temperature difference between the two surfaces. An apparatus was constructed for measuring the thermogalvanic po-tential developed by carefully purified nickel powder in several concentrations of neutral nickel sulfate solution under temperature differentials up to 100 ~ Reproducible values of the thermodynamic potential were obtained, and were found to vary more or less linearly with temperature difference and exponentially with nickel concentration. The hotter nickel surface was always negative with respect to the colder surface, thus having a tendency to corrode anodically. Under average conditions the thermogalvanic potential developed was about 0. 89 millivolts per ~ The standard potential of the nickel electrode was computed from isothermal meas-urements against a calomel electrode, and found to be approximately- 0. 232 volt on the normal hydrogen scale...|$|E
40|$|Thermogalvanic (or thermoelectrochemical) {{systems can}} convert a {{temperature}} difference into an electrical current, by exploiting the entropy change {{associated with a}} redox process. The Seebeck coefficient is a key parameter in this process, as is the overall power density. Initially this project investigated establishing the apparatus to efficiently and effectively measure the Seebeck coefficient and power density of thermogalvanic cells using hermitically sealed CR 2032 battery casings. Subsequently the ferri/ferrocyanide system (known Seebeck coefficient of - 1. 4 mV K- 1) was investigated at platinum electrodes, {{and for the first}} time at stainless steel electrodes. Subsequently the iodide/triiodide redox couple was investigated under the same conditions at platinum and stainless steel electrodes. Dilute iodine was found to display a poor Seebeck coefficient of + 0. 26 mV K- 1 at platinum electrodes and a very significant Seebeck coefficient of + 2. 1 mV K- 1 at stainless steel electrodes. The stainless steel system was investigated in more detail and found change over time, and under optimal conditions an apparent Seebeck coefficient of + 13. 6 mV K- 1 could be achieved; the highest value ever reported. This is demonstrated to be due to a combination of the iodide/triiodide thermogalvanic redox couple and thermogalvanic iodine-induced corrosion of the stainless steel. Analysis of the corrosion, <b>thermogalvanic</b> <b>corrosion,</b> metal surfaces and electrolyte composition was performed. 	 9 	 Preliminary experiments confirmed that the extraordinary performance was not due to the composition of the electrolyte, but instead the interaction of the electrolyte with the stainless steel surface. The promising performance of ionic liquids as replacement electrolytes was also noted...|$|E
