5|$|Eggman sneaks {{away with}} the last Emerald and arms the Eclipse Cannon. When he tries to fire it, the colony begins falling and a {{prerecorded}} message from Gerald broadcasts: he programmed the ARK <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Earth if the Emeralds were used, destroying it in revenge for the government condemning his research and killing his colleagues, including his granddaughter Maria. Everyone works to access the cannon's core and neutralize the ARK using the Master Emerald.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that the comet was likely <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Jupiter caused great excitement within the astronomical community and beyond, as astronomers {{had never before}} seen two significant Solar System bodies collide. Intense studies of the comet were undertaken, and as its orbit became more accurately established, {{the possibility of a}} collision became a certainty. The collision would provide a unique opportunity for scientists to look inside Jupiter's atmosphere, as the collisions were expected to cause eruptions of material from the layers normally hidden beneath the clouds.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientist}} to extrapolate the current {{motions of the}} continents was Canadian geologist Paul F. Hoffman of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that the continents of North and South America would continue to advance across the Pacific Ocean, pivoting about Siberia until they begin to merge with Asia. He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, Amasia. Later, in the 1990s, Roy Livermore calculated a similar scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and Madagascar would move across the Indian Ocean <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Asia.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E

After making her way to Oban on 9 September, she began the first of seven roundtrips to Freetown over the next 18 months, including convoy SL 125. Twice, when setting out with convoys, Empire Simba {{had to return to}} port with unspecified problems. In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> another convoy ship, Empire Scott, and on 1 August Empire Simba straggled and dropped out of the convoy.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Gordon {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner. Reutimann made contact with Johnson, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the wall and damage his car's suspension on lap two. The first caution of the race was subsequently given. None of the leaders elected to make pit stops during the caution, and Johnson drove to his garage to change his front and rear suspension. Jeff Gordon maintained his lead on the lap eight restart. Kurt Busch passed Jeff Gordon on the low side of the track for the lead position four laps later. After starting twenty-ninth, Robby Gordon had moved up thirteen positions to sixteenth by lap 34. One lap later, Johnson's car was fitted with a new driveshaft.|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> enemies. The elevation {{of an enemy}} {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the bottom of the screen, which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the Solar System {{is stable}} in {{that none of}} the planets are likely <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years. Beyond this, within fivebillion years or so Mars's {{eccentricity}} may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether or send it {{on a collision course with}} Venus or Earth. This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the rain-affected practice and qualifying sessions, the track was dry {{for the duration of}} the race. All of the drivers except Jenson Button, Jarno Trulli and the two Red Bull drivers started on the softer option tyre. The first lap was eventful: Alonso started better than polesitter Massa and was able to take the inside line into turn one and gain the lead. Hamilton passed Räikkönen for third into the first corner, then drove round the outside of Massa into turn two to take second place. Meanwhile, the suspension on Adrian Sutil's Spyker failed at turn four, causing it <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Button's Honda and retire from the race. Button continued after making an early pitstop to repair the damage. Liuzzi and Sato also collided at turn four, causing Liuzzi to pit for a new front wing. After the race the drivers blamed each other for the incident.|$|E

5|$|The two vessels were {{pounding}} {{each other}} at such close range, they also managed <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> one another at five different times. By 11:00am Monitors supply of shot in the turret had been used up. With one of the hatches to the gun ports damaged and jammed shut she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and effect repairs to the damaged hatch, {{which could not be}} repaired. During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck {{to get a better view}} of the overall situation. Virginia, seeing Monitor turn away turned her attention to the Minnesota and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby tugboat Dragon. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition Worden returned to battle with only one gun in operation.|$|E
5|$|Rowland ran wide while de Jong {{reversed}} {{onto the}} run-off area. This {{was caused by}} both drivers not gaining optimum brake temperature. De Jong dropped to fifth while Rowland fell to third after the latter was passed by Sirotkin. Armand spun in the seventh corner, triggering the safety car's second appearance. It remained on the track {{for the next three}} laps. On the restart, Matsushita utilised a tactic of backing the field up before driving away. However some drivers accelerated away after passing the safety car line, while others remained at the pace dictated by Matsushita. This resulted in Malja colliding with the rear-end of Evans's car, removing his front wing, and sending debris from it airborne. Malja then hit Rowland in the first corner. He spun but managed to continue. Gelael was forced <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the barrier, causing him to retire. The incident resulted in the safety car's third deployment which remained on track for the next two laps. At the lap 13 restart, Marciello got away faster than Matsushita and drove around the inside of him but locked his tyres. The two made contact when they steered into turn one. The incident allowed Gasly to inherit the lead, with teammate Giovinazzi moving into second.|$|E
5|$|She later {{made her}} {{debut in the}} Winston Cup Series in the No. 84 Michael Kranefuss Racing Ford Taurus, and planned to run six races. The events were chosen because they were at tracks where Robinson felt comfortable, located in large markets where they would receive more attention. Her {{schedule}} was devised to allow Robinson time to test. She planned to race at Talladega Superspeedway but decided against {{it because of the}} rules regarding restrictor plate racing. Robinson failed to qualify for the first race she attempted (at California Speedway) when her car's rear-end gearing became detached causing her <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the wall. Four races later, she started from 32nd at Michigan International Speedway, and became the first woman to start a NASCAR Cup Series race since Patty Moise in 1989. Robinson finished 34th after spinning her car in the track's second turn but avoided damage. After she failed to qualify for her next two races, she was unable to complete her schedule due to sponsorship issues. Robinson stated that she used the season as motivation; she hoped to be driving consistently in five years, and wanted to be a spokesperson for women.|$|E
50|$|Such {{collisions}} {{are relatively}} common, considering galaxies long lifespan.

5|$|Sorenson {{ran into}} the {{rear-end}} of Dale Jarrett's car, who spun backwards into the turn four wall, prompting the third caution. Jarrett retired from the race when he drove into his garage. All drivers elected to make pit stops for fuel under caution. Riggs maintained his lead at the lap-39 restart, followed by Kahne and Bowyer. Johnson got ahead of Sadler to move into eighth on lap 44. On lap 46, a fourth caution was given; after leaving turn two, Todd Kluever was hit by teammate Greg Biffle and spun on the backstretch, causing Ken Schrader and Petty <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Kluever. Michael Waltrip hit the wall in avoidance. Most drivers (including Riggs) chose to make pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt led at the lap-53 restart with the non-stopping cars of Edwards, Newman, Biffle and Sorenson following him. Riggs moved back into third place on lap 59 after passing Biffle and Newman. By lap 66, Earnhardt held a 1.78-second advantage over Edwards. Two laps later, Riggs passed Edwards to take over second place. Riggs closed the gap to Earnhardt, and was 1.5 seconds behind by lap 75. Green-flag pit stops began three laps later, with Earnhardt stopping on lap 79, giving the lead back to Riggs. Kahne and Riggs made pit stops on the 85th lap for scuffed right-hand tires.|$|E
5|$|With the French rear defeated, the {{remaining}} British ships focused their attack on Impérial and Diomède, but the intense smoke blocked the British view and caused Atlas <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> Canopus, while fire from Impérial disabled Northumberland. At 11:30, surrounded by enemies and with escape impossible, Leissègues' decided to drive his remaining ships on shore rather than surrender. Steering {{for the beach}} and closely pursued by Canopus, both Impérial and Diomède were deliberately grounded. With the enemy line destroyed, Duckworth anchored offshore to observe French activity on the grounded ships and conduct hasty repairs. Out of range of British fire, small boats evacuated most of {{the remaining}} sailors from Impérial and Diomède, which had lost all their masts and were rapidly filling with water. When Duckworth sent in his frigates on 8 February it was clear that both ships were beyond repair, the British boarding parties removing the remaining 156 crew as prisoners and setting fire to the hulls. British casualties in the engagement had been 74 killed and 264 wounded, while the French total was estimated at 1,510, although accurate counts were not taken {{in the aftermath of the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|On lap 272, Martin {{reclaimed}} {{the lead}} {{as the previous}} leaders had made their pit stops. Four laps later, the eighth caution was given because of debris on the track in turns three and four. Most of the drivers made pit stops during the caution, although Martin stayed out and remained the leader on the restart. After the restart, the ninth caution was given after Reutimann and Earnhardt made contact, causing Earnhardt <b>to</b> <b>collide</b> <b>with</b> the turn two wall. At the lap 287 restart, Martin remained the leader ahead of Kurt Busch. One lap later, Montoya moved up into third after passing Hamlin and Johnson. On lap 289, Montoya passed Kurt Busch at the first turn for the second position. One lap later, Kurt Busch lost a further position when he was passed by Hamlin. On lap 292, Martin had a 1.1-second lead. Two laps later, the tenth caution came out after Allmendinger spun in turn two after he made contact with Marcos Ambrose. Martin led on the restart, followed by Montoya and Hamlin. On the final lap, Allmendinger spun sideways, bringing out the eleventh and final caution, and the field was frozen, with the finishing order determined by where the drivers were running {{at the moment of}} caution. The result gave Martin the victory, which was his fifth win of the 2009 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of Montoya in third, Johnson in fourth, and Kyle Busch in fifth. Kurt Busch, Newman, Sadler, Biffle and Bowyer rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E
