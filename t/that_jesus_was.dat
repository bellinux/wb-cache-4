5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a political national messiah, {{but the evidence}} for this portrait is negligible.

5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented {{to present the}} birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of Jesus are based not on {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|E

Later in the same gospel, Jesus asks his disciples who the people say that he is. The apostles' answer includes Elijah among others.|$|R
5|$|Judaism {{rejects the}} belief <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> the awaited Messiah, arguing {{that he did}} not fulfill Messianic prophecies and asserting that his resurrection is a Christian legend.|$|E
5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), especially <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born by {{a virgin}} Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events {{before the birth}} of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|The ox and the ass, as well {{as other}} animals, became a part of nativity scene tradition.

5|$|Non-Christian {{sources are}} {{valuable}} in two ways. First, {{they show that}} even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a teacher, {{had a reputation as}} a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E

5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E

5|$|The law {{was used}} {{in at least one}} attempt to prosecute a non-Christian.

Lumbrozo did not deny having said such things, but argued that he had only been responding to questions asked of him. He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War.|$|E

5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|If {{the story}} of the Star of Bethlehem {{described}} an actual event, it might identify the year Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew describes the birth of Jesus as taking place when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died after a lunar eclipse and before a Passover Feast. The eclipse is usually identified as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Other scholars suggested dates in 5 BC, because it allows seven months for the events Josephus documented between the lunar eclipse and the Passover than the 29 days allowed by lunar eclipse in 4 BC. Others suggest it was an eclipse in 1 BC. The narrative implies <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born sometime between the first appearance of the star and the appearance of the Magi at Herod's court. That the king is said to have ordered the execution of boys two years of age and younger implies that the Star of Bethlehem appeared within the preceding two years. Some scholars date the birth of Jesus as 6–4 BC, while others suggest Jesus' birth was in 3/2 BC.|$|E
25|$|Jews for Jesus {{takes the}} {{mainstream}} Christian positions <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> the Messiah, <b>that</b> his coming was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, and <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> {{the son of}} God, the second person of the Trinity. Jews for <b>Jesus</b> believes <b>that</b> their views of the Messiah are entirely compatible with the view of God presented in Jewish scriptures, and that {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity, fundamental to the Christian faith, is not entirely alien to Judaism.|$|R

5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{who see the}} gospel nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the Messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction. Aspects of Matthew's account which have raised questions of the historical event include: Matthew {{is the only one}} of the four gospels which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or the Magi. In Mark 6:1-4, the author of the Gospel of Mark, considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels, does not appear to be aware of the Bethlehem nativity story.. Scholars suggest <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by the Gospel writers to present his birth as the fulfillment of prophecy. The Matthew account conflicts with that given in the Gospel of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already live in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.|$|E
5|$|Most Christians believe <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>was</b> {{both human}} and the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E

50|$|In the Gospel of Luke, {{after the}} Sanhedrin trial of Jesus, the Jewish elders ask Pontius Pilate to judge and condemn Jesus in 23:2, accusing Jesus of making false claims {{of being a}} king. While {{questioning}} Jesus about the claim of being the King of the Jews, Pilate realizes <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> a Galilean, and <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>is</b> under Herod's jurisdiction.
