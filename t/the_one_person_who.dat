25|$|The Mask of Life's descent ends in Mahri Nui, an {{underwater}} city originally part of Voya Nui before it broke off and {{sunk into the}} sea. Upon sight, it becomes an object {{of interest to the}} Matoran villagers as well as the Barraki: six former warlords sent to the Pit (a prison that sits on the lip of the city) after their crimes as part of the League of Six Kingdoms. But after the Pit was damaged in the Great Cataclysm, they escaped into the surrounding ocean and were mutated by its mutagen waters. Believing the mask can change them back so they can rule the Kingdoms once again, the Barraki battle one another for possession of the Ignika. Meanwhile, the Toa Inika continue their descent through the stone cord, where they battle mutated incarnations of the Piraka, Vezon and an army of murderous Zyglak. Upon reaching the depths of the sea, the Mask of Life transforms the heroes into the water-breathing Toa Mahri, complete with new masks and weapons. The team engage with the Barraki and their aquatic Rahi armies upon arrival, but {{in the midst of the}} battle, Matoro is imprisoned in the Pit by a robotic Maxilos guard that reveals itself as Makuta Teridax, who possessed the robot after his essence followed the Toa through the stone cord. He informs Matoro that Mata Nui's life can only be saved if the Toa shatter the cord, and although not trustful in the villain's words, he relays the information to his team-mates. They agree and evacuate Matoran from both locations before proceeding to destroy the cord; sending Voya Nui plummeting into the ocean and demolishing Mahri Nui in the process. But by the time the Toa Mahri retrieve the Ignika, Mata Nui dies. Believing there's still hope, Matoro - <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> can touch the Ignika without becoming cursed - races towards a hole in the seabed with it before Voya Nui descends to close it, leaving his team to continue fighting the Barraki. Once in, he falls through a waterfall in what resembles a large cave and hears a voice from inside the mask telling him to put it on. In doing so, Matoro learns of the Ignika's history and how to use it to resurrect Mata Nui. Now knowing it was his destiny to sacrifice himself to save the universe, Matoro uses the sentient mask's powers to teleport the Toa Mahri back to Metru Nui and make them amphibious, before the mask turns his body into pure energy that saves the Great Spirit. Meanwhile, the Maxilos body that Teridax inhabited is found badly damaged after a ferocious battle with the Barraki's armies, and is so presumed dead. Mata Nui has been saved, but remains asleep.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} also {{somewhat}} autobiographical for Rossen, relating to {{his dealings with}} the House Un-American Activities Committee. [...] A screenwriter during the 1930s and '40s, he had {{been involved with the}} Communist Party in the 1930s and refused to name names at his first HUAC appearance. Ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members. Similarly, Felson sells his soul and betrays <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> really knows and loves him in a Faustian pact to gain character.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{deals with}} the concept of realizing one's {{mortality}} and discovering that life is more precious because of it. [...] Learning that he is in fact not immortal as he once thought, Bender initially feels that living a life that is anything less than immortal is worthless. [...] He {{deals with the}} devastating news of his newfound mortality by trying to find <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> he believes can answer his questions about the reason for his life and why he was allowed to [...] "be born" [...] only to die. [...] Though Bender cannot find the answers to his mortality, he ultimately ends up developing a new outlook on life, believing it to be more precious than it was before now that it is finite, and he resolves that life is worth living no matter how brief it is.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{announced}} in December 2006 that Sophie and Hunter McKay would be arriving {{as part of the}} McKay family unit, headed by Justine and Callum McKay. Sophie was described as a [...] "very pretty, popular fifteen year old. A typical teen consumer of any new product or trend, she's a total fashion victim." [...] She was described as close with her brother; [...] "Hunter's her best friend, her role model and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who's</b> always been there for her." [...] Crossman quit the role to move to Los Angeles, making her last appearance in March 2011. But expressed interest in returning in the future. Crossman returned for an unannounced cameo on 25 May 2012 to mark the shows 20th anniversary.|$|R
500|$|In all, ten ships heeded the {{distress}} calls, arriving {{throughout the day}} and into the next. Kroonland arrived at about 17:00, and by 20:00 had launched a lifeboat with a volunteer crew. The boat was unable {{to get close to}} the burning liner. Kroonlands lifeboat returned at 22:30 with an exhausted crew and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> had dared to brave the jump into the stormy water. Captain J. C. Barr of , the first ship to arrive, took command of the rescue effort. Barr had the vessels form a [...] "battle line" [...] of sorts and slowly circle the burning ship, while his ship kept a searchlight on Volturno and another sweeping the ring of rescue ships to help them avoid collisions. Despite Carmanias efforts, Kroonland and the French Line steamer [...] almost collided, coming—according to one passenger—within [...] of impact.|$|E
500|$|Oliver's career further {{deteriorated}} {{in early}} 2011, when it transpired {{he was not}} a qualified doctor. A series of setbacks – failing the exam to progress on to his CT1 training, blaming a surgical error on Penny, and the death of a patient in his care – prompted him to admit that he swapped his own exam paper with Penny's in his final year of medical school. Anderson explained that Oliver could no longer cope with the mounting pressure, hence his confession. Contrasting the siblings, he assessed [...] " [...] was seen as the golden boy when he arrived at Holby – but he was trading on his sister's success." [...] Issued with the ultimatum of confessing to Director of Surgery Henrik Hanssen, Oliver realised that [...] "he must take responsibility", lest he [...] "lose <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> loves him unconditionally." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor Gabriel Luna {{said that}} Robbie Reyes chose {{to work with}} Daisy Johnson after the last episode because [...] "I respect her power and I respect her. I {{understand}} that she’s going {{in the same direction}} I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." [...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in her stomach, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mercedes begins {{working as}} an escort which Lynsey discovers. Metcalfe {{explained}} that Lynsey comes to Mercedes' rescue when she is at her lowest point and she can see how broken Mercedes is so just hugs her friend. Lynsey begins a relationship with Mercedes' ex-fiance Riley. Metcalfe explained that if Mercedes discovered this she would feel [...] "utterly betrayed by Lynsey". Metcalfe revealed that Lynsey and Mercedes learn that Silas will not stand trial. Mercedes feels can confide in Lynsey about the situation and has a few heart-to-hearts with Lynsey as she is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> fully understands the situation. Metcalfe said Lynsey proves how much she cares about Mercedes when she convinces her to see a psychiatrist. Hassan praised the plot saying it was great because of the chemistry between herself and Metcalfe. Metcalfe similarly praised the friendship saying she has loved it and has enjoyed seeing Mercedes and Lynsey form a good bond.|$|E

2500|$|Torello and Abrams {{finally get}} enough proof of skimmed profits and rigged games to rescind Luca's gaming license and bar him from {{entering}} {{any and all}} casinos. [...] Infuriated, he impulsively goes after Goldman, whose wife he had been sleeping with (among other women); he then sends Holman to try and kill Goldman with a car bomb, but Goldman survives. [...] When Luca (still seething from being banned from his own casino) brutally rapes Pauli Taglia's girlfriend, a distraught Taglia turns against his boss and implicates Luca in the union leader's killing to Torello's Strike Force, just as Luca gets the ban on his license lifted. [...] Luca goes on trial for multiple murders, but cleverly orchestrates a mistrial by having Holman tamper with the jury and making sure the judge learns of it. [...] Luca is then released on bail pending a new trial. He apologizes to Pauli, who forgives him out of loyalty, though it is an agonizing decision since it means abandoning <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> was genuinely decent towards him.|$|E
2500|$|In these {{difficult}} times <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev. In 1869 he informed Pisemsky that his One Thousand Souls had {{been translated into}} German and enjoyed [...] "great success in Berlin". [...] "So now {{the time has come}} for you to step outside the borders of your motherland and for Aleksey Pisemsky to become a European name," [...] Turgenev wrote on October 9, 1869. [...] "The best Berlin critic, Frenzel, in National Zeitung devoted a whole article to you where he calls your novel 'a rare phenomenon', and I tell you, now you are well known in Germany," [...] wrote Turgenev in another letter, enclosing clips from other papers, too. [...] "The success of One Thousand Souls encourages [...] to start upon the novel Troubled Seas and I am so happy both for you and for Russian literature in general… Critical reviews of One Thousand Souls here in Germany are most favourable, your characters are being compared to those of Dickens, Thackeray, etc, etc", he continued. Julian Schmidt’s large article in Zeitgenossensche [...] Bilder, part of the series devoted to first class European authors, provided for Pisemsky another cause to celebrate, and following Turgenev's advice, in 1875 he visited Schmidt to thank him personally.|$|E
2500|$|A strong, {{noxious odour}} {{coming from the}} rear of the plane was first {{reported}} to the cabin crew around 19:00. Flight attendant Judi Davidson, 33, traced the odour to the lavatory. She attempted to look into the lavatory but was forced back by thick grey smoke rapidly filling the small room; she then ordered the third ranking crew member to find Sergio Benetti, 37, the chief cabin crew officer, and ask him to investigate. As Benetti sprayed the interior of the affected lavatory with a CO2 extinguisher, Davidson reported the fire to the captain while 28-year-old flight attendant Laura Kayama began urging the passengers on the sparsely-populated flight to come away from the front and rear of the plane and sit close together near the over-wing exits. At no time did any of the cabin crew mention to either Cameron or Ouimet that they had not yet seen flames. [...] Benetti, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> had managed to get a good look at the scene, had not reported seeing anything resembling the traditional causes of airline fires in pre-smoking-ban days: flames from a trash bin fire or the paper towel dispenser, both of which were commonly set ablaze by passengers smoking in the lavatories on long flights. First officer Ouimet went to investigate personally at 19:03, but was driven back by the thick smoke. At 19:04, Benetti reported that he thought the fire was probably out because he had completely doused the lavatory with fire retardant.|$|E

2500|$|As soon as {{he became}} a {{cardinal}}, François de Tournon was drawn into {{the affairs of the}} King of England. [...] Henry VIII wanted a divorce from the Emperor's aunt, Catherine of Aragon. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> {{might have been able to}} manage the intricacies of the Roman Curia on his behalf, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, [...] had been imprudently cast aside.

[...] The King was successful with none of them, facing opposition from the Emperor, the Curia, and even the families of the would-be cardinals. [...] Finally Henry realized that he would have to rely on someone else's resources, and he turned to King Francis I. [...] A meeting between the two monarchs took place at Boulogne on 20 October 1532, in which it was agreed that the two new French cardinals, Gramont and Tournon, should be sent to Rome to publicize the new rapprochement between England and France, to remove opposition to 'the King's great matter', and to bring about an alliance between France and the Papacy through the marriage of the Pope's niece and the King's son. [...] Pope Clement was to be invited to Nice to meet with King Francis, and perhaps with Henry VIII.|$|E

[...] Ownby obtained a lifetime lease when the national park was established, and for several decades afterward sold honey to hikers. Among those who paid Ownby a visit were Tennessee governor (and later U.S. senator) Lamar Alexander and U.S. Supreme Court justices Harry Blackmun and Potter Stewart. [...] The Justices were visiting a prominent Knoxville lawyer, Foster Arnett, who wanted to introduce them to a real mountain man. [...] Foster led the two Justices up the trail to meet Lem only to discover Lem would not meet the two men. [...] When Foster knocked on Lem's door and announced that he had two Supreme Court Justices outside who wanted to meet him, Lem simply replied that they were not welcome to come in the cabin. [...] Foster was very embarrassed while the two Justices folded over laughing. [...] The two Justices loved that Lem had refused to meet them because he was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would tell them no, something they seldom found.
