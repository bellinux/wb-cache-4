Archaeologists have expressed concerns that tourism encourages particular ways of seeing and knowing the past. When archaeological sites are run by <b>tourist</b> boards, <b>ticket</b> fees and souvenir revenues can become a priority, and the question remains whether a site is worth opening to the public or remaining closed and keeping the site out of harm's way. Damage to irreplaceable archaeological materials is not only direct, as when remains are disordered, altered, destroyed, or looted, but often the indirect result of poorly planned development of tourism amenities, such as hotels, restaurants, roads, and shops. These can drastically alter the environment in ways that produce flooding, landslides, or undermine ancient structures.|$|R

30|$|The {{first is}} that the pass rates of 77 % for the 2009 test and 41 % for the 2013 test are not {{based solely on the}} tests {{analysed}} in this study but include tests of three other areas of knowledge, all of which were administered in Chinese. These three other tests cover: (1) practical matters related to working as a tour guide, such as travel safety, <b>ticketing,</b> <b>tourist</b> psychology, etc.; (2) regulations pertaining to the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China; (3) Taiwanese history and geography. Like the language test, each of these tests consists of 80 multiple choice items. If the tests were not constructed from banks of trialled items, then there may have been differences in difficulty that exerted a greater influence on overall pass-rates than that of the language component, as revealed in this study. For example, a particularly difficult test of Taiwanese history and geography on the 2013 battery could have been a greater factor contributing to the low pass rate than a slightly more difficult English test.|$|R
