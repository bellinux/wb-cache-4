5|$|The Round Church {{contains}} many medieval inscriptions, both official and scratched on its walls as graffiti.

The Glagolitic inscriptions of the Round Church bear evidence that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic.|$|E

Even though all the persons with ownership rights were losing money with the empty stores, and stores were in great demand, their competing interests got in the way of the effective use of space.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1950s, {{there has}} been {{consensus}} among archaeologists as to the African origins of Great Zimbabwe. artefacts and radiocarbon dating indicate settlement in at least the fifth century, with continuous settlement of Great Zimbabwe between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries and {{the bulk of the}} finds from the fifteenth century. The radiocarbon evidence is a suite of 28 measurements, for which all but the first four, from the early days of <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> method and now viewed as inaccurate, support the twelfth to fifteenth centuries chronology, In the 1970s, a beam that produced some of the anomalous dates in 1952 was reanalysed and gave a fourteenth-century date.

500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy".

By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side.
