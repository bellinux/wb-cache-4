50|$|Though <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> {{had been}} {{developed}} in China centuries before, it was not commercially viable. However, in {{early years of the}} 19th century the process of <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> had been revived by George Savage, a Yorkshireman in London. It was to be Savage's methods upon which Baxter, already an accomplished artist and engraver, was to improve. In 1828, Baxter began experimenting with <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> by means of woodblocks.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study in {{entirety}} the group of large <b>colour</b> <b>prints</b> which William Blake made between 1795 and 1805. The series of prints represents {{the single most important}} and complete development of Blake’s skill as an innovative printmaker. Although they include some of Blake’s best-known images, they have not been studied before in their entirety or {{from the point of view}} of analysing the techniques and methods Blake had used. My study will show how Blake executed these truly impressive prints in terms of materials, method and motives. The first half of the thesis deals with the materialistic aspects of Blake’s <b>colour</b> <b>printing.</b> In chapter one tracing the controversial two-pull discussion to the root, I will make clear the focus points as well as revealing the early tradition of experimental criticism on Blake’s <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> method. Focusing on two important critics, W. Graham Robertson and Ruthven Todd, and the periods they lived, I attempt to reveal the role they played in a wider context. Also I show how the tradition of Blake’s art was inherited directly through the Ancients to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which leads to Robertson and Todd. In the second chapter I deal with the development of Blake’s <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> experiments. It is obvious that the Twelve Large <b>Colour</b> <b>Prints</b> were produced as a result of Blake’s series of <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> experiments, starting with monocolour simple prints, going through the illuminated books progressing with more colours and higher skills...|$|R

40|$|Plasmonic <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> {{has drawn}} wide {{attention}} as a promising {{candidate for the}} next-generation colour-printing technology. However, an efficient approach to realize full colour and scalable fabrication is still lacking, which prevents plasmonic <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> from practical applications. Here we present a scalable and full-colour plasmonic printing approach by combining conjugate twin-phase modulation with a plasmonic broadband absorber. More importantly, our approach also demonstrates controllable chromotropic capability, that is, the ability of reversible colour transformations. This chromotropic capability affords enormous potentials in building functionalized prints for anticounterfeiting, special label, and high-density data encryption storage. With such excellent performances in functional colour applications, this colour-printing approach could {{pave the way for}} plasmonic <b>colour</b> <b>printing</b> in real-world commercial utilization...|$|R
