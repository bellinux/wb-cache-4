5|$|In the sub-plot, Lisa {{discovers that}} the senior {{citizens}} at Grampa's nursing home {{do not have}} any entertainment, and decides to buy them a digital TV converter. However, while at the store to buy it, she discovers Mr. Burns feeling very happy playing Funtendo Zii Sports. She decides to buy this for the senior citizens, hoping they will feel younger and happier. When playing the Zii, the senior citizens feel very happy and feel younger. This forces <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> at the home to work extra hard after their workout, prompting them to wash the Zii in the dishwasher, causing it to break. Lisa becomes angry at <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> for doing it on purpose, thus showing their disregard for the senior citizens. However, <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> blow her off. The senior citizens then return to their boring selves, staring at TV static.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria's {{relationship}} with its neighbours since 1990 {{has generally been}} good. The country also {{plays an important role}} in promoting regional security. Bulgaria has an active tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, maintains strong relations with EU members, the United States, and Russia, and continues to improve its traditionally good ties with China and Vietnam. The HIV trial in Libya, which followed after the imprisonment of several Bulgarian nurses in Benghazi in 1998, had a significant impact on relations between Bulgaria, the European Union, and Libya. It resulted in the release of <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> by Muammar Gaddafi's government, which was granted a contract to receive a nuclear reactor and weapons supplies from France in exchange.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell and Galle were {{terminated}} from WCMH in June 2009. A {{few days}} later, both nurses were arrested. They {{were charged with}} misuse of official information, a felony that carries the possibility of ten years imprisonment and fines up to $5,000. Roberts said that <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> filed the complaint as a personal vendetta {{rather than as a}} good faith reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports did not include the names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E

Helena supported the proposed amalgamation of the RBNA {{with the new}} RCN, but that proved unsuccessful when the RBNA {{pulled out of the}} negotiations. However, she remained active in other nursing organisations, and was president of the Isle of Wight, Windsor and Great Western Railway branches of the Order of St. John. In this position, she personally signed and presented many thousands of certificates of proficiency in nursing.|$|E
5|$|The {{charges against}} Galle were dropped before her case went to trial. Mitchell's case was tried by county {{attorney}} Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts {{and the personal}} attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby Andrews County discouraged Tidwell from trying the case. At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to his patients. Roberts sold the supplements, {{but he said that}} his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> and {{that he did not have}} a business relationship with Arafiles.|$|E

5|$|When {{he learned}} of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of Winkler County, who was his friend {{and one of his}} patients. Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the medical board {{constituted}} harassment. The sheriff investigated and obtained the TMB complaint, which provided enough information about Mitchell and Galle to make them identifiable. Galle and Mitchell were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of official information. Galle's charges were dropped before trial and Mitchell was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a hospital administrator all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against <b>the</b> <b>nurses.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by <b>the</b> <b>nurses,</b> who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job.

Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E

He was the only British pilot to bail out in the battle. The Hurricane crashed near Addolorata Cemetery near Paola. MacLachlan remained in hospital with a severely wounded left arm. He was pumped with saline solution to prevent blood clotting but his arm was too badly damaged and it was amputated below the elbow. His determination and reputation was as such, <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> and squadron were already taking bets on whether or not he would return to action within a fortnight {{on the day of the}} operation.

5|$|Mitchell and Galle sent an {{anonymous}} complaint to the TMB detailing their concerns with Arafiles's care of nine patients in 2008 and 2009. The letter said that <b>the</b> <b>nurses</b> feared {{losing their jobs}} if their identities were revealed {{in connection with the}} complaint. Arafiles became aware of the complaint and spoke to Winkler County Sheriff Robert Roberts, alleging that the complaint amounted to harassment. The TMB issued a copy of the complaint to Roberts with the understanding that it would only be used to investigate criminal activity by Arafiles. Roberts sent the complaint to Arafiles and to WCMH administrator Stan Wiley. As WCMH was a small hospital, details from the letter identified Mitchell and Galle as the sources of the complaint.|$|E
