The ship was later converted into a barge and remained in use until she sank sometime during the 1950s. Her wreck was discovered in the Mississippi River in New Orleans in 2003, although there are no plans to raise her.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} at New Orleans on 6 July, Chickasaw was decommissioned. She {{temporarily}} bore the name Samson between 15 June and 10 August 1869 before resuming her original name. She was sold on 12 September 1874 to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company who modified the ship into a coal barge {{with the name}} of Samson. The railroad converted the ship into a <b>train</b> <b>ferry</b> in 1880 and changed her to side-wheel propulsion under the name Gouldsboro. She was sold in the 1940s to the New Orleans Coal & Bisso Towboat Co. and converted into a work barge. It sank off the Greenville Bend of the Mississippi River in New Orleans sometime during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The typhoon first {{affected}} the Northern Marianas Islands, where it left US$2.5million in damage, while damaging or destroying 114homes. The damage {{was enough to}} warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near Okinawa, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in Busan, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4million in damage. About 250,000people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to <b>train,</b> <b>ferry,</b> and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left ¥4.08billion (US$36.9million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322mm (52.0in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29people and caused ¥94.9billion (US$854million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon {{affected the}} Kuril Islands of Russia, where it dropped {{the equivalent of the}} monthly precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35people, and its effects were significant enough for the name to be retired.|$|E
