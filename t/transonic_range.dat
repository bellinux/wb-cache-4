50|$|Although a {{low-drag}} airfoil (in the <b>transonic</b> <b>range)</b> {{was thus}} produced, Whitcomb's superiors observed {{that not every}} aircraft manufacturer {{could be expected to}} use file and sandpaper to design the needed shapes. Therefore, NASA signed a contract with the Courant Institute at New York University, whose mathematician Paul Garabedian and aerodynamicist Anthony Jameson worked with Whitcomb to develop a practical computational method for designing supercritical airfoils - those that were most efficient in the <b>transonic</b> <b>range.</b> Using this method, supercritical wings were fabricated and proven on full-scale aircraft; in 1971 a Vought F-8 Crusader, and in 1973 a General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, were flown at the NASA Flight Research Center in California. For his contribution, NASA awarded Whitcomb a $25,000 prize, and he received the 1974 Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association.|$|E
50|$|In 1950, {{the tunnel}} {{was the first}} in the world to be {{modified}} to incorporate a slotted throat design. This revolutionary design gave researchers their first accurate data on airframe performance in the <b>transonic</b> <b>range.</b> The tunnel was deactivated in 1956, when a new 8 ft tunnel was built near it.|$|E
50|$|Interference drag {{results when}} airflow around {{one part of}} an object (such as a fuselage) must occupy the same space as the airflow around another part (such as a wing). The two {{competing}} airflows must speed up in order {{to pass through the}} restricted area; this speeding-up process requires extra energy and creates turbulence, resulting in a measurable increase in the form drag. This velocity increase is present at all airspeeds, but becomes even more important in the <b>transonic</b> <b>range</b> when the resulting velocity becomes sonic, producing shock waves.|$|E

40|$|A {{generalization}} {{is presented}} of Phillips' (1960) theory of noise generation by supersonic turbulent shear layers. Both Mach wave radiation and non-Mach wave noise radiation mechanisms are considered. The range of validity of Phillips' {{theory has been}} expanded to include the low supersonic and <b>transonic</b> <b>ranges.</b> These generalizations are important not only for their analytical rigor, but also for their prospective applications to practical problems in jet noise prediction and control. The noise generation mechanisms in a supersonic jet are found to differ from those in a subsonic jet. The theory is considered to offer some prospects of answering important questions in supersonic jet noise, such as noise source distribution, mean flow refraction effects, directivity, spectrum, and efficiency of noise radiation...|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, on 16 March 1945, the U.S. Army Air Forces Flight Test Division and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{contracted}} with the Bell Aircraft Company to build three XS-1 (for [...] "Experimental, Supersonic", later X-1) aircraft to obtain flight data on {{conditions in the}} <b>transonic</b> speed <b>range.</b>|$|R
50|$|As speeds {{approach}} {{the speed of}} sound, the additional phenomenon of wave drag appears. This is a powerful form of drag that begins at transonic speeds (around Mach 0.88). Around Mach 1, the peak coefficient of drag is four times that of subsonic drag. Above the <b>transonic</b> <b>range,</b> the coefficient drops dramatically again, although remains 20% higher by Mach 2.5 than at subsonic speeds. Supersonic aircraft must have considerably more power than subsonic aircraft require to overcome this wave drag, and although cruising performance above transonic speed is more efficient, it is still less efficient than flying subsonically.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Kramer {{continued}} to evolve the basic Ruhrstahl X-1 design during the war. One direction of {{research was to}} improve the ability of this weapon to penetrate the heavy armor of modern battleships of the British [...] and the American [...] classes. The X-2 and X-3 variants of the weapon did so by achieving even higher descent speeds into the <b>transonic</b> <b>range</b> without losing directional stability. The X-5 and substituted greater explosive power for descent speed, with a total weight approaching 2,250 kg. The X-6 attempted to overcome heavy deck armor with a very heavy steel tip and an enhanced explosive charge. None of the variants ever made it into large-scale production or operational use.|$|E
50|$|At {{the point}} where the density drops, the local speed of sound {{correspondingly}} drops and a shock wave can form. This is why in conventional wings, shock waves form first after the maximum Thickness/Chord and why all airliners designed for cruising in the <b>transonic</b> <b>range</b> (above M0.8) have supercritical wings that are flatter on top resulting in minimized angular change of flow to upper surface air. The angular change to the air that is normally part of lift generation is decreased and this lift reduction is compensated for by deeper curved lower surfaces accompanied by a reflex curve at the trailing edge. This results in a much weaker standing shock wave towards the rear of the upper wing surface and a corresponding increase in critical mach number.|$|E

40|$|The {{generation}} of reduced-order models for computing the unsteady and nonlinear aerodynamic loads on an aircraft from pitching motions in the <b>transonic</b> speed <b>range</b> is described. The models considered {{are based on}} Duhamelâ€™s superposition integral using indicial (step) response functions, Volterra theory using nonlinear kernels, radial basis functions, and a surrogate-based recurrence framework, both using time-history simulations of a training maneuver(s). Results are reported for the X- 31 configuration with a sharp leading-edge cranked delta wing geometry, including canard/wing vortex interactions. The validity of the various models studied was assessed by comparison of the model outputs with time-accurate computational-fluid-dynamics simulations of new maneuvers. Overall, the reduced-order models were found to produce accurate results, although a nonlinear model based on indicial functions yielded the best accuracy among all models. This model, along with a time-dependent surrogate approach, helped to produce accurate predictions {{for a wide range}} of motions in the <b>transonic</b> speed <b>range...</b>|$|R
5000|$|When the {{velocity}} of a projectile fired at supersonic muzzle velocity approaches {{the speed of sound}} it enters the transonic region (about Mach 1.2-0.8). In the transonic region, the centre of pressure (CP) of most non spherical projectiles shifts forward as the projectile decelerates. That CP shift affects the (dynamic) stability of the projectile. If the projectile is not well stabilized, it can not remain pointing forward through the transonic region (the projectile starts to exhibit an unwanted precession or coning motion called limit cycle yaw that, if not damped out, can eventually end in uncontrollable tumbling along the length axis). However, even if the projectile has sufficient stability (static and dynamic) to be able to fly through the transonic region and stays pointing forward, it is still affected. The erratic and sudden CP shift and (temporary) decrease of dynamic stability can cause significant dispersion (and hence significant accuracy decay), even if the projectile's flight becomes well behaved again when it enters the subsonic region. This makes accurately predicting the ballistic behavior of projectiles in the transonic region very difficult. Because of this, marksmen normally restrict themselves to engaging targets within the supersonic range of the projectile used.In 2015 the American ballistician Bryan Litz introduced the [...] "Extended Long Range" [...] concept to define rifle shooting at ranges where supersonic fired (rifle) bullets enter the transonic region. According to Litz, [...] "Extended Long Range starts whenever the bullet slows to its <b>transonic</b> <b>range.</b> As the bullet slows down to approach Mach 1, it starts to encounter transonic effects, which are more complex and difficult to account for, compared to the supersonic range where the bullet is relatively well-behaved." ...|$|E
40|$|Use of a {{supercritical}} airfoil can adversely affect wing flutter speeds in the <b>transonic</b> <b>range.</b> As adequate theories for three dimensional unsteady transonic flow {{are not yet}} available, the modified strip {{analysis was used to}} predict the transonic flutter boundary for the supercritical wing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the possibility of using a semi-empirical, wall pressure method to determine wind tunnel blocking corrections in the <b>transonic</b> <b>range.</b> Included are axial distributions of velocity increments at the wall {{in the presence of the}} wing models. The main results are presented in the form of comparisons of the blockage corrections determined by the semi-empirical method with the blocking corrections obtained by direct calculation. The models used in this investigation were reflection-plane-mounted wings of various sizes and sweep angles and one two-dimensional wing. Data for wings at moderate angles of attach are included, when available. The results indicate that the corrections obtained by the semi-empirical method agree with those obtained by direct calculation in the range of Mach numbers where agreement is expected. The semi-empirical corrections become rapidly larger than the calculated corrections as the critical Mach number of the wing is exceeded. The magnitudes of the differences in the <b>transonic</b> <b>range</b> are sufficiently large to warrant the application of the semi-empirical method to transonic wind tunnel tests...|$|E
