40|$|A <b>true-breeding</b> <b>line</b> {{characterized}} by free filaments of anthers and modified keel petal {{was derived from}} F 2 population of an intergeneric cross between Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. and Atylosia lineata W. & A. This variant, designated as partial cleistogamy, favours {{a high level of}} self-fertilization. The inheritance of this trait was studied in the F 1, F 2, F 3, and BC 1 F 1 generations of three crosses. The results suggest that the partial cleistogamy trait is governed by a single recessive gene, designated as pct. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>True-breeding</b> <b>lines</b> are {{required}} for the development and production of crop varieties. In a classical breeding approach these lines are obtained through inbreeding, and often 7 - 9 generations of inbreeding is performed to achieve the desired level of homozygosity, {{over a period of}} several years. In contrast, the chromosomes of haploids can be doubled to produce <b>true-breeding</b> <b>lines</b> in a single generation. Over the last century, scientists have developed a variety of techniques to induce haploids and doubled haploids, though these techniques apply only to particular crop varieties. Ravi and Chan, (2010) discovered that haploids could be obtained in Arabidopsis through the manipulation of the centromere-specific histone 3 variant, CenH 3. Their approach, which involved extensive modifications to a transgenic CenH 3, held promise of being translated to crop species, and has been successfully employed in maize (see REF, this issue). Refinements of this technology have since been developed which indicate that nontransgenic modifications to CENH 3 will also induce haploids. The complementation of a cenh 3 null by CENH 3 from closely related plant species can result in plants that are fertile but haploid-inducing on crossing by CENH 3 wt plants- suggesting that introgression of alien CENH 3 may produce nontransgenic haploid inducers. Similarly, a remarkably wide variety of point mutations in CENH 3, inducible by chemical agents, have recently been shown to result in haploid induction on crossing by wild-type CENH 3 plants. These CENH 3 -variant plants grow normally, are fully fertile on self-pollination, and may be present in existing mutagenized collections...|$|R
40|$|Haploid {{technology}} {{is used to}} develop uniform, <b>true-breeding</b> <b>lines,</b> {{as well as to}} accelerate crop improvement programs. Among 20 Apiaceae species screened for response to doubled haploidy, 11 generated microspore-derived embryos, and {{all but one of the}} latter yielded doubled haploid plants. Donor plant conditions, basal media, and culture conditions were evaluated for their efficacy on inducing microspore-derived embryos. Growing donor plants at temperature conditions of 10 / 5 or 15 / 100 C promoted microspore embryogenesis in fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), whereas, growing donor plants at a temperature regime of 10 / 50 C, along with the use of a cold extraction method, enhanced embryogenesis in dill (Anethum graveolens L.) and anise (Pimpinella anisum L.). The culture of fennel and dill microspores in an NLN basal medium and caraway (Carum carvi L.) in AT- 3 basal medium promoted the highest frequencies of embryo induction.

5000|$|Mendel's {{findings}} allowed scientists such as Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane {{to predict}} the expression of traits {{on the basis of}} mathematical probabilities. An important aspect of Mendel's success can be traced to his decision to start his crosses only with plants he demonstrated were true-breeding. He also only measured absolute (binary) characteristics, such as color, shape, and position of the seeds, rather than quantitatively variable characteristics. He expressed his results numerically and subjected them to statistical analysis. His method of data analysis and his large sample size gave credibility to his data. He also had the foresight to follow several successive generations (F2, F3) of pea plants and record their variations. Finally, he performed [...] "test crosses" [...] (backcrossing descendants of the initial hybridization to the initial <b>true-breeding</b> <b>lines)</b> to reveal the presence and proportions of recessive characters. Without his diligence and careful attention to procedure and detail, Mendel's work would have had a much smaller impact on the world of genetics.|$|R
40|$|A natural {{population}} of Drosophila melanogaster was {{tested for the}} presence of crossveinless (cve) alleles {{over the course of a}} summer. Approximately 8 % of the wild-caught females tested carried enough cve alleles to produce <b>true-breeding</b> crossveinless <b>lines.</b> In some cases, different isofemale lines produced identical cve strains. Also, differences were sometimes observed among independently selected cve sublines of a given isofemale line. —The cv- 2 allele was found to occur with a frequency of about 1 % to 2 %...|$|R
40|$|The Apiaceae family {{includes}} vegetables, {{as well as}} herb {{and spice}} crops. Compared to major crops, {{there have been few}} breeding or genetic improvement programs for any of the Apiaceae, especially the herb and spice species. Haploidy technology can be used to develop uniform, <b>true-breeding</b> <b>lines,</b> as well as to accelerate breeding programs. Field trials of dill (Anethum graveolens L.), caraway (Carum carvi L.), and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) doubled haploid (DH) lines were conducted over 2 5 cropping seasons. Several of the DH dill lines had desirable agronomic characteristics such as short uniform stature along with early maturity that would be useful for crop improvement. Seed yields and the essential oil content of the seed harvested from the best performing DH dill lines were either equal to or higher than the parental line. A DH annual caraway line was identified that produced higher seed yields than the industry standard. The main constituents of the essential oil for the DH lines of both dill and caraway were similar to the parental lines. Fennel DH lines exhibited differences in height but were too late in maturity for seed production under prairie conditions. The results indicate that not only were we able to generate DH lines {{that could be used in}} a crop improvement program, but we developed DH lines that could be used directly as cultivars as these lines performed better than the industry standard (parental line).

40|$|Arabica coffees (60 % {{of current}} world coffee production) are {{generally}} sold at considerably better prices than robustas {{on account of}} superior beverage quality. However, costs of production are much higher, mainly due to more stringent demands for soil and climatic conditions, crop management, primary processing and control of several pests and diseases including the potentially very destructive coffee leaf rust (CLR) and berry disease (CBD). Breeding for disease resistance in combination with vigour, productivity and quality started in the early 1920 s in India, but especially {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century comprehensive breeding programmes have been implemented in several other coffee producing countries. Many of the resulting CLR- and CBD + CLR-resistant cultivars (<b>true-breeding</b> <b>lines</b> and F 1 hybrids) meet the required standards of profitable and sustainable crop production. Challenges of more recent date include limited access to additional genetic resources of Coffea arabica, breakdown of host resistance to CLR, aggravating insect pest problems and the increasingly negative impact of climate change on arabica coffee production worldwide. This review discusses prospects of breeding and disseminating next generation (hybrid) cultivars of arabica coffee for sustainable coffee production under changing conditions of diseases, pests and climate. International networking on coffee breeding will facilitate sharing of resources (financial, genetic) and scientific information, application of genomics-assisted selection technologies, and pre-breeding for specific characters. Breeding and multiplication of new cultivars well adapted to the local environment will continue to be carried out at national or regional levels. A tree crop like arabica coffee does not lend itself to centralized variety development and dissemination on a global scale. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|A seed shriveling trait in peanut (Arachls hypogaea L.) {{has been}} {{identified}} that severely affects seed morphology and lipid deposition. This characteristic also showed partial penetrance and variable expressivity within the <b>true-breeding</b> shriv-eled <b>lines.</b> Also, both normal and shriveled seed were produced from the plants grown from either normal or shriveled seed from these lines. Knowledge of the genetic basis for this trait Is important for understanding the biosynthetic lesion Involved and for manipulation of the trait In breeding programs. Three shriveled-seeded lines— 529 B, 563 A, 647 A—were crossed to the normal-seeded cultlvar, Sun-runner, and Intercrossed to determine the inheritance of the shriveled seed trait and possible allelic relationships. Crosses with shriveled seed genotypes as male parents with Sunrunner showed that this trait is {{under the control of}} a single re-cessive gene. However, no segregation of shriveled types was observed in the F 2 generation of the reciprocal crosses when shriveled lines were used as female parents. Segregation was observed in the F, generation (F 4 seed) for these crosses. The paternal expression may be due to male transmission of extrachromosoma...|$|R
40|$|Wild emmer wheat, Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides, (2 n = 4 x = 28; genome BBAA), the {{progenitor}} of domesticated wheat, is genetically {{very close}} to durum and common wheat. This wild taxon has many characteristics that would be valuable if transferred to domesticated wheat. An appropriate exploitation of the "wild" genome requires its dissection into segments and evaluation of the contribution of each segment separately {{to the performance of}} domesticated wheat. This work describes the production of a series of chromosome-arm substitution lines (CASLs) of wild emmer in the background of the Israeli common wheat cultivar Bethlehem (2 n = 6 x = 42; genome BBAADD). The identity of the "wild" arm in each CASL was confirmed through the use of RFLP and SSR markers that were polymorphic between the two taxa. The product of this work is a series of <b>true-breeding</b> agronomic <b>lines</b> the breeding value of which can be evaluated under field conditions in different geographic regions. The usefulness of CASLs in studying the improvement of qualitative and quantitative traits in wheat is discussed...|$|R
