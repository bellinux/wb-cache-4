5000|$|Molina {{stated in}} an {{interview}} in 2013 that he owes his stage and film career to the Indiana Jones series. [...] "I'm very, very proud of that, I have to admit I didn't think at the time, 'Oh, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down in movie history.' I'd never been {{in front of a camera}} before," [...] Molina said about his short but memorable appearance in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Molina recalls getting the job as a [...] "gift from God" [...] and goes on to say [...] "I've publicly thanked Steven many, many times. That job saved my bacon, in more ways than one." [...] About his now famous line in the film Molina stated that [...] "I've never had a problem with people coming up to me about it. They'll shout that line to me, 'Throw me the idol, I'll throw you the whip!' I'm delighted that people still remember it." ...|$|E
5000|$|When in {{fact the}} last day of the Giro was run on the streets of Milan for the time trial, Hesjedal {{completed}} the course in 34:15 which was indeed enough time to take the maglia rosa for the final time. This completed his journey of becoming the first Canadian to win a Grand Tour and only the second time ever that the maglia rosa changed hands on {{the last day of}} the Giro. His title was also notable in that it was done on an entirely made and manufactured Canadian bicycle by Cervelo. The victory elicited an immediate response from his home country of Canada, with the nation's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper releasing a statement saying [...] "We thank Mr. Hesjedal for this defining moment in Canadian sport. This remarkable win in one of bicycle racing's most grueling competitions is a testimony to Mr. Hesjedal’s training, endurance, skill and competitive spirit." [...] British Columbia premier Christy Clark added that “For a British Columbian to have done this is amazing. I know <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down as one of the great Canadian accomplishments ever in sport.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Feathers were a {{trademark}} of early Scatterheart shows. Lead singer Enright strutted {{the stage in}} one of two sets of brightly colored feathered wings, and the audience often had the opportunity to share in the fun, as described on Lanarama's Bizarre Stage Antics: “Scatterheart had a feather cannon that would shoot feathers out over the crowd at their album release party” Scatterheart publicist Cristy Laubman, in conversation with Georgia Straight writer Adrian Mack speculated that the man might actually use his wings to fly. Ronatron {{had this to say about}} the group's performance at a legendary Vancouver venue: [...] "After the bricks have fallen and the lights turned off, I want to take a moment and step back in time and relive one of the best shows I have ever been to at Richard’s on Richards[...] [...] on that normal night, when no one actually believed that this venue was actually going to torn down, a local band by the name of Scatterheart utterly blew my mind with their amazing showmanship and tight instrumentals. I can honestly say that this was one of the best shows I have ever witnessed at Richard’s on Richards." [...] Regarding an earlier performance, Cordmag stated: [...] "This was the highlight of the festival so far. Scatterheart made it worth it if nothing else." [...] Spun concedes: [...] "If you weren't dripping in loverockrevolution by the end, there is something wrong with you. Scatterheart is a positive, high energy, rock n roll show that DEMANDS you be entertained." [...] With regards to international performance, the challenges of performing at a festival halfway around the globe are defined thus: [...] "Fury mentioned that learning to say “Scatterheart loves you!” in Korean was the first order of business, along with a couple of radio and TV interviews." [...] Rob Michaels of Mountain 102.1 FM Radio in Whistler/Squamish, B.C., became a Scatterheart fan after hearing the group at the 2009 Telus World Ski and Snowboard event http://wssf.com/. Intrigued by the sight of a man wandering around Whistler wearing multi-colored feathers, Rob later invited the group to his studio for both an extensive interview and an acoustic performance of the song Beautiful. Scatterheart guitarist Doug Fury regaled Michaels with stories of the group's festival experience in Busan, Korea: the initial ecstatic reaction of the crowd of 25,000 as the group came out on the stage led Doug to comment to Mike, Jesse, and Wes that “Dudes, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> off!” and, later, to note that a crowd of that size felt “just about right!” During the interview, Rob also reminded his listening audience about the upcoming First Night 2010 http://www.whistlerfirstnight.com/ show in the outdoor stadium at Whistler Olympic Park, at which Scatterheart was a featured group.|$|E
