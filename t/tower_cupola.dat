2500|$|One other {{important}} {{church of the}} San Andrés municipality is the church of Santa María Tonantzintla, which is valued for its decoration in what is called folk or indigenous Baroque. The church was initially built in the 16th century and developed over four phases until the 19th century. At {{the end of the}} 17th century, it had its basic layout, cupola, sacristy and main altar. At this time its intricate stucco work was begun. [...] The first phase of construction began in the 16th century, with a small sanctuary, whose vestiges are located just north of the current church. The first church on this spot was built {{in the middle of the}} 16th century with a simple nave and façade, now destroyed. The second phase began at the end of the 17th century and beginning of the 18th, when the bell <b>tower,</b> <b>cupola,</b> basic layout and a small sacristy were built. Decorative stucco work was also done on the apse. The third phase covers most of the 18th century when the structure was completed, expanding the nave, leaving the tower within it, and a new façade. The last phase covers the 19th and early 20th centuries, when the final details were finished. These details include pre-Hispanic elements such as dark skinned angels, niches with headdresses, tropical fruits and ears of corn. This area was sacred to Tonantzin, the mother goddess, and the Spanish replaced her with an image of the Virgin Mary.|$|E

There, indeed, was the fleet, but far away, like toy ships on the water, and the bit of a fort perched on the sandy edge of an island. I spent most of that day there, watching anxiously for some movement. But none came.|$|E

50|$|The Glasscock County Courthouse is an {{historic}} courthouse building located in Garden City, Glasscock County, Texas. Built in 1909 to 1910 {{at a cost}} of $28,000, it was designed by Georgia-born American architect Edward Columbus Hosford, who is noted for the courthouses and other buildings that he designed in Florida, Georgia and Texas. It was built of granite and rusticated stone with gable front porticoes on all sides, each of which is supported by four 2-story Doric columns. Unlike the Mason County Courthouse also designed by Hosford and built at the same time for $39,786, the Glasscock County Courthouse has no clock <b>tower</b> <b>cupola</b> in the center of its roof and its side porticoes are smaller than the other two.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} {{laid out in a}} Greek cross design, with a {{rectangular}} exterior, and semi-circular interior arms (to the north, south and east). From the exterior, the main volume of the chapel is surmounted by a tower-like cupola and cross, with the roof covered in rounded tiles. The limestone walls are surmounted by edged cornices, preceded by frieses, also in limestone, in the shape of rope, semi-circles, six-pointed rosettas and fleur-de-lis. The collateral façades are decorated with blind arcades, alternating between angular and double rounded-frieses, which are repeated in the <b>tower</b> <b>cupola,</b> and intersected by small round windows. The principal façade, which was the main entrance at one time, is highlighted by a grand arch portico, preceded by staircase. In northern part of the eastern arm of the chapel is an arcosolium, where the mortel remains of Saint Fructuosus was originally entombed, and exposed to the exterior.|$|E

50|$|The church here is {{the best}} known example of Indigenous or Folk Baroque in Puebla<.

50|$|The main {{building}} was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and Percy Worthington. In {{keeping with the}} style of Oxbridge, it features a quadrangle and a grandiose Memorial Hall. Entrance to the quad is by a tripartite arch under a clock <b>tower</b> <b>cupola.</b> There is also the Paton Library (named after J.L. Paton, a former High Master), MGS Archive Room (formerly the Alan Garner Junior Library, which has since {{become part of the}} Paton Library), Common Room, Refectory, Medical Centre, Book Shop, Gymnasium and Swimming Pool. This is in addition to classrooms (subjects taught in this building are Art and Design, Mathematics, Economics, Classical Civilisation, Computing, Greek, History, Latin, Religion and Philosophy) and administrative offices. The MGS Theatre has recently undergone extensive rebuilding, to provide a modern and comfortable auditorium, together with studios for rehearsals and drama teaching. The Drama Centre Campaign is chaired by Sir Nicholas Hytner (Director of the National Theatre and a former pupil) who brought Alan Bennett and the actors from The History Boys to launch the campaign in 2006.|$|E

50|$|The High Bridge Water Tower, {{located in}} the park between West 173rd and 174th Streets, was built in 1866-72 to help meet the {{increasing}} demands on the city's water system. The 200-foot-tall octagonal tower was designed by John B. Jervis {{in a mixture of}} Romanesque Revival and neo-Grec styles, and was accompanied by a 7-acre reservoir. The High Bridge system was inaugurated in 1872, and reached its full capacity by 1875. With the opening of the Croton Aqueduct, the High Bridge system became less relied upon; during World War I it was taken out of service when sabotage was feared. In 1949 the tower was disconnected from the system, and a carillon, donated by the Altman Foundation, was installed in 1958. The <b>tower's</b> <b>cupola</b> was damaged by an arson fire in 1984. The <b>tower</b> and <b>cupola</b> were rehabilitated and restored in 1989-90.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} by French {{engineers}} in 1856 {{in the form of}} a masonry octagonal prism with two stages. Since the ground at the location is not elevated enough from the sea level, the 16 m tower was constructed on a platform, enabling a focal height of 23 m. The structure is painted entirely white. A two-story outbuilding is annexed, that was used as the keeper's living quarters and for administrative purposes. A gallery encircles the tower's lantern room. Atop the <b>tower's</b> <b>cupola,</b> a flag post is erected.|$|R
50|$|The schoolhouse, {{although}} {{built at}} the height of Greek Revival’s popularity, reflects an amalgamation of architectural styling. Moderate classical elements include the arched door, sash windows, and projecting bell tower, while the split-gable and octagonal shape of the bell <b>tower’s</b> <b>cupola</b> reflect 19th-century Eclecticism that developed as local builders and craftsmen freely combined elements from different architectural styles. On the exterior, the bricklayer ornamented the one-room structure with a simple patterning of six rows of stretchers (horizontally-laid bricks) and one row of headers (end-laid bricks) that formed subtle bands circling the building.|$|R
