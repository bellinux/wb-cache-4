5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E

5|$|French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir {{provided}} a Marxist solution and an existentialist view {{on many of}} <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of feminism {{with the publication of}} Le Deuxième Sexe (The Second Sex) in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a feminist movement beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea that}} Moore begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> (i.e. assumes <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} in a premise) was first raised by W. Frankena. Since analytic equivalency, for two objects X and Y, logically results in <b>the</b> <b>question</b> [...] "Is {{it true that}} X is Y?" [...] being meaningless (by Moore's own argument), to say that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is meaningless is to concede analytic equivalency. Thus Moore begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> in <b>the</b> second premise. He assumes that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is a meaningful one (i.e. {{that it is an}} open <b>question).</b> This begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> and <b>the</b> open-question argument thus fails.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, its {{identification}} as a Roman road has been questioned by academics, and alternative interpretations suggested for its purpose and date of construction.

5000|$|Whilst {{relatively}} easy to state, <b>the</b> miracle <b>question</b> requires considerable skill to ask well. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> must be asked slowly with {{close attention to the}} person's non-verbal communication to ensure that the pace matches the person's ability to follow <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> Initial responses frequently include a sense of [...] "I don't know."

5|$|Mind of a Man is a {{game show}} {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network, with DeRay Davis as host. On each episode, two female contestants attempt {{to figure out what}} men believe about marriage, dating, work, and other subjects. Similar to Family Feud, <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> have previously been answered by a survey of one hundred men. Over the course of four rounds, a celebrity panel consisting of two men and a woman helps the contestants by offering their opinions about the correct answers to the surveys. The winner advances to the bonus round, which features a top prize of $10,000.|$|E
5|$|Montville {{suggested}} that Ruth is probably even more popular today {{than he was}} when his career home run record was broken by Aaron. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, {{to the delight of}} the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on SportsCenter and Baseball Tonight each evening during the season. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> of performance-enhancing drug use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{questioning}} of Oppenheimer concerned {{his role in}} the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party. <b>The</b> <b>questions</b> probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married.

Another Republican resolution was put forth to force {{him out of his}} chairmanship.
