Allan MacMillan was also called: though he <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Brownlee had encouraged his daughter to move to Edmonton and promised to forward information about Alberta College, he acknowledged that the premier had not followed through and not contacted her again until she was in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|Still another, Walter Kwiatkowski, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he paid Horton $600 (in {{addition}} to the $200 bond) to have the case against him dropped where Glasser was acting as prosecutor. And another, Victor Raubunas, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he twice paid bribes to Kretske in cases that Glasser was handling (Raubunas was convicted a third time, after refusing to pay Kretske, in a case prosecuted by Ward himself). Mae and Anthony Jurkas, two small-time bootleggers, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Glasser declined to prosecute them {{in exchange for the}} name of their bootlegging boss.|$|E
5|$|The defense case {{commenced}} on March 25. The third {{count of}} the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> his duties would include acting as a criminal defense attorney for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington. Burton <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he received notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, {{and that he had}} only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E

5|$|The government's first witness, U.S. Attorneys' Office clerk Gordon Morgan <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Glasser had {{suggested}} that Sidney S. Eckstone be appointed foreperson of a grand jury that returned only eight out of twenty indictments and that Glasser and Eckstone had conferred frequently. Another prosecution witness, illegal distillery landlord William F. Workman, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Capone-affiliated Louis Schiavone had posted approximately $1,000,000 in bail bonds.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body {{and he was not}} wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E

50|$|For example: {{a witness}} who <b>testifies</b> <b>that</b> he saw the {{defendant}} shoot the victim gives direct evidence. A witness who <b>testifies</b> <b>that</b> he saw the defendant fleeing {{the scene of the}} crime, or a forensics expert who says that ballistics proves that the defendant’s gun shot the bullet that killed the victim both give circumstantial evidence from which the defendant’s guilt may be inferred.|$|R

5|$|Blythe further <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he was {{not under}} the {{influence}} of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs. Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
5|$|Defense {{testimony}} {{focused on}} the theory that Tim Farrar, angry at his father, had set fire to the home. Friends of Tim's <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Tim had had a fascination with fire and that he had told friends that he knew how to make bombs. A neighbor <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he had once caught Tim burning some grass in the neighbor's yard. A former nanny <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> she had heard Tim speak about wanting his father dead and planning to burn down the family's house, and had caught him multiple times setting or with the implements to set fires. On cross-examination, she admitted that she had not seen Tim Farrar for years and agreed that she had not reported Tim's fascination with fire to his parents or the police when he had expressed it to her.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hearing}} into the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury {{in return for}} {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court that he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E

5|$|On December 27, 1880, Wyatt <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> White's {{shooting}} was accidental. Brocius expressed regret, {{saying he had}} not intended to shoot White. Gunsmith Jacob Gruber <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Curly Bill's single-action revolver was defective, allowing it to be discharged at half-cock. A statement from White before he died was introduced stating that the {{shooting was}} accidental. The judge ruled that the shooting was accidental and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained intensely angry about how Wyatt had pistol-whipped him and became an enemy to the Earps. Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, five {{government}} witnesses testified, including Dr. Quidor and the Leetes' {{mother and}} sister. Quidor <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> {{he had discovered}} blood on a ball of twine, although it had been painted over with vermilion.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented four {{witnesses to}} the court. Robert Chobert, a cab driver who testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White, a prostitute, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> from two car lengths away, he saw a man, matching Abu-Jamal's description, run {{across the street from}} a parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the shooting, testified to seeing Faulkner pull over Cook's car. As Abu-Jamal started to cross the street toward them, Magilton turned away and lost sight of what happened next.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case {{continued}} on March 24. Inspector Cochran <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> Burton {{had attempted to}} discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public. Cochran refused to discuss it. Reporter J.H. Aubere <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he had interviewed Burton that day, and that Burton had denied practicing before the Post Office. Hector McRea, the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and Burton, where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded. Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with Burton took place before Aubere's interview. Further, Cochran <b>testified</b> <b>that,</b> on February 5, 1902, Burton {{had told him that}} he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been assured by other Senators that such conduct was common and legal. Burton also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000. Finally, Mahaney <b>testified</b> <b>that,</b> on the day he personally paid Burton $500, Burton advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed. Thereafter, the prosecution rested.|$|E
5|$|A former {{employee}} of Chandler's <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> he bragged about dating three {{women on the}} bay that night, and that {{the next morning he}} arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts {{on the night of the}} murders, investigators found records of several ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home between 1:00am and 5:00am, which may have been attempts to explain his absence to his wife, and to provide himself with an alibi for the time of the murders. Chandler's daughter, Kristal May Sue, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> her father had talked about killing three women, and that he was afraid of returning to Tampa. A maid, who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed, <b>testified</b> <b>that</b> she walked past Chandler on June 1 as she was heading for the Rogers' room for room service. She said that she did not realize the significance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992; the sighting has never been confirmed. Michelle's boyfriend and Hal Rogers also took the stand during trial.|$|E
