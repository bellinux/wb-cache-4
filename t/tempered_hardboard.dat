50|$|<b>Tempered</b> <b>{{hardboard}}</b> is hardboard {{that has}} been coated with a thin film of linseed oil and then baked; this gives it more water resistance, impact resistance, hardness, rigidity and tensile strength. An earlier tempering process involved immersing the board in linseed oil or tung oil until it was 5 to 6 percent saturated, and heating to 170 °C (340 °F). <b>Tempered</b> <b>hardboard</b> is used in construction siding.|$|E
5000|$|Perforated hardboard, {{also called}} pegboard, is <b>tempered</b> <b>hardboard</b> {{that has a}} uniform array of 1/8" [...] or 1/4" [...] holes in it, into which tool-hanging hooks or store {{fixtures}} can be placed.|$|E
50|$|Thus in 1947, {{structural}} insulated panel development {{began when}} corrugated paperboard cores were tested with various skin materials of plywood, <b>tempered</b> <b>hardboard</b> and treated paperboard. The building was dismantled in 1978 {{and most of}} the panels retained their original strength with the exception of paperboard which is unsuited to outdoor exposure. Panels consisting of polystyrene core and paper overlaid with plywood skins were used in a building in 1967 and the panels have performed well to the present day.|$|E
50|$|Perforated {{hardboard}} is <b>tempered</b> <b>hardboard</b> {{which is}} pre-drilled with evenly spaced holes. The holes {{are used to}} accept pegs or hooks to support various items, such as tools in a workshop. Pegboard is a brand name of this product that is often used as a generic term for perforated storage boards made of hardboard, wood, metal, or other material. It is commonly used in retail settings along with steel rods sticking out to hold peggable products such as bagged potato chips, printer ink, and action figures.|$|E
50|$|Those first caravans were, in Alper's opinion, too {{expensive}} {{and he decided to}} try to produce a cheaper, lighter version that could be towed by an ordinary family saloon car. Within a year the Sprite was launched. Built from <b>tempered</b> <b>hardboard,</b> it sold for less than £200. One of Alper's relatives suggested the name and it soon caught on as he sold 500 caravans {{in the first year of}} production. In 1951 he towed one of his caravans to an international caravan rally in Florence, Italy as a publicity stunt. Driving via Frankfurt, Biarritz and Naples the 4500 mile (7,200 km) trip won him an award from a French magazine, but more importantly won a reputation for his caravans that soon made the name Sprite almost synonymous with caravans.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Mårtensson 1988 a), results of tests performed on hardboard in tension under cyclic humidity were presented and comparison with a suggested constitutive model was made. This paper presents {{the result of}} further work that {{has been carried out}} concerning modelling of the behaviour of <b>tempered</b> <b>hardboard</b> subjected to moisture loading combined with mechanical loading. Tests were made both in compression and bending. The tests in compression were of two types, conventional creep tests during moisture cycling and quasi-relaxation tests during moisture cycling. The model was quantified {{on the basis of the}} previous tension tests and the compression tests, in both cases creep tests, and was then checked independently against the other types of test. Interaction between moisture change and mechanical loading was found to be significant during the first moisture cycle but much smaller during subsequent cycles. Experimental and numerical analysis of composite structural elements was also performed, showing that internal stresses of significant magnitude are developed as a result of variations in moisture. Such stresses can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using the proposed model. This can be of great value in design and development of wood products and wooden structural elements...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} macroinvertebrate communities colonising multiplate samplers {{constructed from}} perspex or <b>tempered</b> <b>hardboard</b> (wood) {{with an alternative}} artificial substrate constructed from folded coconut fibre matting (coir) enclosed in nylon netting. Substrates were incubated for 62 days over January to March 2007 at six sites over 240 km along the Waikato River. The three substrates supported similar numbers of invertebrate taxa (27 - 29 taxa), but coir samples contained 71 % of total invertebrate numbers from all substrates combined, compared with < 17 % {{for each type of}} multiplate sampler. Coir faunas were heavily dominated by the hydrobiid snail Potamopyrgus (84 % of numbers), and this taxon along with the amphipod Paracalliope comprised 58 - 66 % of invertebrates on both types of multiplate samplers. Analysis of a Bray-Curtis matrix suggested statistically significant differences in percent community composition between coir samplers and each type of multiplate sampler over the late summer study period. Densities per cm 3 of Oligochaeta, Mollusca, and "other worms" (Platyhelminthes, Rhabdocoela, Nemertea and Hirudinea combined) were significantly higher in coir samples than {{one or both of the}} multiplate samplers. Results suggest coir samplers may provide a useful supplement to multiplate samplers for deep river invertebrate studies by collecting a different range of taxa, including those favouring cover and characteristic of depositional environments...|$|E
