25|$|For Phase II {{compliance}} {{the options}} were numerous, but for Phase I they were {{constrained by the}} time available to implement a decision. Because it takes 3–5 years to design and build a scrubber at an existing coal-fired unit, and longer to repower or build a new facility (e.g., 6–11 years for coal, 10–14 years for nuclear units), electric utility decision options for Phase I plants were limited to scrubbing, switching fuels, purchasing or transferring emissions allowances to allow continued use of high-sulfur coal, retiring units, or <b>trimming</b> <b>unit</b> utilization and substituting capacity from another source.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} Japan's {{mounting}} fiscal deficits, {{the newly elected}} government of Yukio Hatoyama formed the Government Revitalization Unit in 2009 to look for areas where the budget could be <b>trimmed.</b> The <b>Unit</b> recommended that the government cease purchasing and distributing foreign language periodicals like Japan Echo.|$|R
50|$|Since being introduced, {{the units}} have {{undergone}} works attention, {{which included the}} fitting of CCTV surveillance equipment. They have all undergone a further internal refurbishment which has seen them receive new flooring, new harder seating (though keeping the London Midland <b>trim).</b> All <b>units</b> are also now receiving new external door controls.|$|R
50|$|Follicular {{units are}} {{relatively}} compact structures, but {{are surrounded by}} substantial amounts of non-hair bearing skin. This extra tissue can be removed without injuring the follicles, using stereo-microscopic dissection. These small, <b>trimmed,</b> follicular <b>unit</b> grafts can then be placed into tiny incisions in the patient's scalp; thereby minimizing damage to the scalp's connective tissue and blood supply. In contrast; the larger wounds produced by mini-micrografting and plug transplants caused cosmetic problems that included dimpling and pigment changes in the skin; depression or elevation of the grafts; and a thinned, shiny look to the scalp. These problems can be avoided using very small grafts and very small recipient wounds.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of making small recipient wounds {{is the ability}} to create a [...] "snug fit" [...] for the follicular unit grafts. Unlike the punch grafts and some mini-grafting techniques; each of which removes a small bit of tissue in the recipient area; the <b>trimmed</b> follicular <b>unit</b> grafts used in FUT fit into small, needle-made incisions without any need for removing tissue. This preserves the elasticity of the scalp and holds the tiny grafts snugly in place. After surgery, the snug fit facilitates wound healing and helps to ensure that the grafts will get enough oxygen from the surrounding tissue in order to maximize their survival.|$|R
40|$|The guide {{contains}} 11 sections, each {{consisting of}} one or more units of instruction in commercial carpentry. The sections cover the following: introduction (orientation, safety, and applying for a job), leadership, related information (lumber, measuring, and fasteners), power and hand tools, blueprint reading, site preparation and layout, forming, framing, exterior finish, interior'wall finish, and interior <b>trim.</b> Each <b>unit</b> is based on behavioral objectives stated in two forms: terminal objectives stating the subject matter to be covered, and specific objectives stating the necessary student performance. Suggested teacher and student activities, information sheets providing the essential content, reference lists, and tests with answers are included for each unit. Many of the units also contain transparency masters, student handout sheets, job sheets designed to teach skills, and assignment sheets (with answers) providing paper and penci...|$|R
40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM) {{enables the}} {{production}} of geometrically complex parts {{that are difficult to}} manufacture by other means. However, conventional CAD systems are limited in the representation of such parts. This issue is exacerbated when lattice structures are combined or embedded within a complex geometry. This paper presents a computationally efficient, voxel-based method of generating lattices comprised of practically any cell type that can conform to an arbitrary external geometry. The method of conforming involves the tessellation and <b>trimming</b> of <b>unit</b> cells that can leave ‘hanging’ struts at the surface, which is a possible point of weakness in the structure. A method of joining these struts to form an external two dimensional lattice, termed a ‘net-skin’ is also described. Traditional methods of manufacturing lattice structures generally do not allow variation of cell properties within a structure; however, additive manufacturing enables graded lattices to be generated that are potentially more optimal. A method of functionally grading lattices is, therefore, also described {{to take advantage of this}} manufacturing capability...|$|R
25|$|With the {{information}} obtained from Learmonth’s radio commentary the problem plaguing the Australian-built Beauforts was {{traced to a}} component in the elevator <b>trim</b> tab actuating <b>unit.</b> All the RAAF Beauforts were grounded until they were modified to eliminate the problem. Learmonth is credited with supplying the vital information that was necessary to identify the problem and eventually solve it. A secret World War II landing field at Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, known only by the code-name Potshot, was eventually developed into a permanent military base and named RAAF Learmonth in honour of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth.|$|R
40|$|Since machine {{introduction}} in {{the early}} 1970 s, much work has been expended to adapt pruners to vine trellis and physiological requirements, especially regarding the higher bud load their non-selective cuts leave compared to manual <b>trimming.</b> While <b>units</b> have successfully met the former requirement, efforts to meet the latter have been hampered by {{a broad range of}} variables depending on cultivar, machine type, environmental conditions and any manual follow-up. Several examples are instructive here. Winter hedge pruning usually delivers best results with low-to-medium basal node fruitfulness coupled with some hand finishing, two crucial factors for achieving the desired balance of crop yield and quality similar to hand pruning but at lower cost. Minimal pruning has by and large proved unsuccessful in European environments, although some of its good features like looser, less rot-susceptible clusters, earlier canopy filling, lower individual shoot vigor and higher vine capacity can be reproduced using a semi-minimal pruned hedge (SMPH) system to better control over-cropping while maintaining desired grape composition. For instance, the best option for winter mechanical pruning in Italian districts today is the single high-wire cordon managed to maintain upright canopy growth for fast and physiologically sound cutter-bar pruning with little or no manual follow-up. A more comprehensive outlook seems to presage robotics for "precision" pruning to deliver a bud load that is adjusted to vine vigor and desired crop level...|$|R
50|$|The direct {{reason for}} an {{abnormally}} nose-up position {{was found to}} be an excessively high stabilizer <b>trim</b> setting (7.5 <b>units</b> ANU); likely, in the confusion due to switching seats, the pilots failed to reset the trim setting while performing takeoff checklists. (It was reported the first officer made this mistake occasionally.) Taking off at night, with no visual references, the inexperienced flight engineer did not manage to correct the attitude in time, leading to engine surges, aircraft banking and eventually an upset and an unrecoverable stall. It was not known why the captain did not manage to correct the situation; one possibility was that the flight engineer froze on the controls as he put the DC-8 into a gradual bank, and the opposite inputs from the captain had no effect on the movement of the stabilizer. The captain's decision to allow the flight engineer perform the takeoff was considered a contributing factor in the accident.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} master's {{thesis is}} to develop a method that fully automates a {{trimming}} step in the production of a fiber-optical power spectrometer, based on a unique Acusto-Optical Scanning Filter. The filter is created by letting an ultrasonic mechanical pulse pass through a chirped Fiber Bragg Grating. The pulse introduces a disturbance in the grating, creating a thin optical transmission window in the otherwise reflective bandwidth. The high demands on the window requires a precise, unit dependent pulse form with unknown properties. Thus each unit needs to be trimmed to reach required performance. The manual trimming is largely a trial and error process, that contains two performance tests. We redefine one, eliminating the need to reroute the optical path and reducing the number of fiber weldings. The tests are then quantified, allowing a figure of merit to be based on weighted performance values. A brute force method, testing a large set of pulses, is implemented. The set is defined by the parameter space spanned by previously produced units. Due to the large space, the method is too time consuming. Instead it is used to measure the performance spaces of three units. An attempt to largely reduce the parameter space using PCA failed. An alternating variables method that finds local performance optima in the parameter space is developed. By using a set of several starting points, the method tends to find several qualified pulses. The method is implemented and successfully verified by <b>trimming</b> new <b>units.</b> Finally we propose where to focus improvements of the method in a production ramp up...|$|R
