50|$|Stem rot, {{also known}} as white mold or {{southern}} blight, {{can be found in}} just about any peanut producing area in the U.S. The most notable symptom of this disease is the white cottony fungal growth that envelops the entire plant. This mold will appear midseason when the foliage has covered the row middles. This damages the pods and creates a rotted texture. In the 1950s PCNB was found to be somewhat effective at preventing white mold; however it was only able to reduce incidence by 15%. It was not until the 1990s when <b>tebuconazole</b> was introduced that a fungicide was able to provide effective disease control. <b>Tebuconazole</b> is able to reduce incidence of white mold by 80-90%.|$|E
5000|$|Fungicides are {{primarily}} marketed for cereal crops, fresh produce, fungal with bacteria-based pesticides, {{and control of}} mildew and rust diseases. Nativo products are a mixture of trifloxystrobin <b>tebuconazole.</b> [...] XPro products are a mix of bixafen and prothioconazole, while Luna contains fluopyram and pyrimethanil.|$|E
50|$|Under normal {{conditions}} in Hawaii {{it is estimated}} that without control of black sigatoka yield losses would be 30%. Sigatoka is controlled with a combination of protectant and systemic fungicides in order to prevent resistance from developing. Mancozeb is applied as the primary protectant and fenbuconazole, <b>tebuconazole,</b> and azoxystrobin are applied as systemic fungicides. These fungicides are applied during summer.|$|E
50|$|This {{class of}} timber {{treatments}} use white spirit, or light oils such as kerosene, as the solvent carrier to deliver preservative compounds into timber. Synthetic pyrethroids are typically {{used as an}} insecticide, such as permethrin, bifenthrin or deltamethrin. In Australia and New Zealand, the most common formulations use Permethrin as an insecticide, and Propaconazole and <b>Tebuconazole</b> as fungicides. While still using a chemical preservative, this formulation contains no heavy-metal compounds.|$|E
50|$|Web blotch is {{currently}} {{found in all}} major peanut growing states in the south. It can be a highly damaging disease. In ideal conditions web blotch can cause yield loss as high as 50%. The first sign that a plant is infected with web blotch is small tan blotches on plant leaves. The leaf will become brittle and the plant will defoliate. Chlorothalonil and <b>tebuconazole</b> are effective treatments for reducing web blotch incidence.|$|E
50|$|Copper azole {{is similar}} to ACQ with the {{difference}} being that the dissolved copper preservative is augmented by an azole co-biocide like organic triazoles such as <b>tebuconazole</b> or propiconazole, which are also used to protect food crops, instead of the quat biocide used in ACQ. The azole co-biocide yields a copper azole product that is effective at lower retentions than required for equivalent ACQ performance. The general appearance of wood treated with copper azole preservative {{is similar to}} CCA with a green colouration.|$|E
50|$|Peanut rust {{is unique}} {{because it is}} not a native disease to the U.S. and {{has not been able to}} survive beyond a single season when introduced. Airborne spores are {{annually}} introduced from other peanut-producing nations. Rust causes reduced peanut pod fill and can potentially defoliate the entire crop if the conditions are right. Originally copper and sulfur were used to control rust, but they were only partially effective. It was not until the development of chlorothalonil and <b>tebuconazole</b> that an effective treatment for peanut rust was found.|$|E
50|$|This disease infects {{any part}} of the plant below ground, so it often targets the roots; pegs or pods that are below ground are also vulnerable. Infected parts turn black and die. Often the {{infection}} spreads and kills the entire root system, effectively killing the plant. Originally the disease was localized to North Carolina and Virginia, but recently Florida and Georgia have begun experiencing higher incidences of the rot. Recent research has shown <b>tebuconazole</b> to significantly suppress the disease and increase yields by up to 1,500 pounds per acre.|$|E
5000|$|The fungal {{inoculum}} infects {{the growing}} cones of W. mirabilis early during their development, {{and a sharp}} increase in infection occurs when the pollination drops appear; through those drops the fungal spores may gain access to the interior of the developing seed. [...] Seeds in the wild may therefore be obliterated through fungal action even before they are fully developed. Seeds from botanical gardens or other cultivated sources are much cleaner and less likely to rot. The fungicide <b>tebuconazole</b> may be useful in controlling limited A. niger seed infection.|$|E
50|$|Early {{leaf spot}} of peanut {{can be treated}} {{through the use of}} {{fungicides}} applied at the very early pod stage, and applied every two weeks thereafter. After analyzing the incidence and severity of the disease, strip-tillage techniques have also proven to be effective in delaying an epidemic by reducing the amount of initial infection. Furthermore, the delay in disease caused by the strip-tillage technique proposes that initial application of fungicides for use in disease management may be delayed without having negative effects on the treatment of early leaf spot of peanut. Nevertheless, fungicides, such as the protectant fungicide, chlorothalonil, have been the standard for control leaf spots since the mid-1970s and is still widely used today. <b>Tebuconazole,</b> a systemic ergosterol biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide, and Pyraclostrobin, a strobilurin-type fungicide have also both proven effective in controlling early leaf spot, even more so than chlorothalonil. Usually, fungicides need to be applied multiple times every few weeks; a typical treatment using chlorothalonil or <b>tebuconazole</b> requires fungicides application around seven times starting just 30-45 days after planting. The use of resistant cultivars is the most successful way to be overcome the pathogen and maintain yields. Sources of resistance have been reported and prolong incubation and latent period by reducing the number of lesions per unit area of leaf surface, defoliation, and sporulation.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{resistant}} cultivars {{may lack}} desirable traits, {{such as a}} tendency toward early bolting when allium flowers are desirable for markets. When satisfactory resistant cultivars are unavailable, fungicides (<b>tebuconazole,</b> procymidone) can be applied as a seed treatment to provide systemic early season management or as a foliar spray 2-3 times throughout the season. [...] Triazole {{has been shown in}} laboratory studies to effectively control mycelial growth and provides local systemic protection. [...] Risk of infection can also be reduced by delaying fall planting of garlic until temperatures fall below the 18 °C optimal for S. solani growth, and good field sanitation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary control}} of purple spot was EBDC {{fungicides}} until processors began {{to reject the}} use of EBDCs. As a result, since 1990 exemptions for chlorothalonil and <b>tebuconazole</b> in Michigan have been granted by the EPA for use on asparagus. The fungicides are applied {{at the end of}} the harvest and chlorothalonil has been shown in experiments to reduce purple spot by 99% and increase yields by 36%. [...] This increase in yield as a result of purple spot control has been shown to translate into a net return of $200-400 per acre for asparagus growers [...]|$|E
5000|$|As {{sclerotia}} are {{a survival}} {{structure in the}} life cycle for the pathogen, {{it is important to}} reduce and eliminate sclerotia in the soil. One effective way to reduce sclerotia is sclerotia germination stimulants. These germination stimulants can reduce sclerotia by 90%. One {{way to do this is}} using diallyl disulfide (DADS). This chemical is what triggers sclerotia to germinate. Upon using DADS in the soil, no Allium crops can be grown in that soil for a year to keep the treatment effective. If there are allium crops growing they will be able to complete their lifecycle and keep sclerotia in the soil. Therefore, DADS is applied artificially in the field with no Allium species, which in turn has sclerotia germinate and unable to find a host and die rather than lay dormant in the soil. This can also be done by applying a garlic extract or the use of certain petroleum-based products. Dipping seed garlic in water at [...] is effective, but higher temperatures may kill the cloves. It is also important to use fungicides with the chemical DADS. There are three fungicides that are registered for white rot. They are: <b>Tebuconazole,</b> Fludioxonil and Boscalid with <b>Tebuconazole</b> being the most effective. [...] All of these fungicides need to be applied right at planting, as later fungicide applications are not effective to control disease. It is also important to note that once an infection is found there are no chemical controls to stop or reduce disease during that season.|$|E
50|$|Eastern filbert blight {{is caused}} by the fungus Anisogramma anomala and is {{indigenous}} to the Northeast United States. The fungus causes a small canker on the Native American Hazelnut, Corylus americana. However, on the introduced and commercially important European Hazelnut, Corylus avellana, it causes a lethal disease. The cankers caused by EFB slowly expand and kill the tree {{over the course of several}} years if diseased tree limbs are not removed in time. Research with chlorothalonil and <b>tebuconazole</b> in the 1990s showed that 4-5 applications of the fungicides on a two-week schedule when vegetative buds are breaking dormancy is ideal for control of EFB. The state of Oregon has estimated that if left uncontrolled EFB could eliminate half of the state's hazelnuts within ten years.|$|E
50|$|Although {{pesticide}} use should be minimized, fungicides have proven useful and economical {{in the control}} of tan spot (Loughman et al., 1998) and spot blotch (Viedma and Kohli, 1998). The triazole group (e.g. <b>tebuconazole</b> and propiconazole) especially {{has proven to be}} very effective for both HLBs, and their judicious use should not be overlooked. However, it may provide acceptable control but not always economic return in commercial grain production. This is dependent on the price received for the wheat, the price of the fungicide and the percent yield increase from using the fungicide. Situations will differ significantly according to geographical areas and cropping conditions. Spot blotch in particular is a very aggressive disease, and under a favourable environment, spraying at one- to two-week intervals for as long as necessary may be needed to maintain the disease under control.|$|E
5000|$|Asparagus rust {{was first}} {{reported}} in the U.S. in 1896. It began on the asparagus crops of mostly northeastern states and began to move westward across the country- For each successive year the disease was discovered in new western areas until in 1902 it was reported in California for the first time. Research to control the disease began with Bordeaux mixture experiments around {{the start of the}} 20th century. Copper and sulfur dust were tried as well but their success was very limited. Sulfur was the only one to have much success at all. Rust resistant strains of asparagus were cultivated but by the 1940s and 1950s these strains of asparagus were no longer providing adequate levels of resistance. In the 1950s zineb and mancozeb were developed as the primary means to control rust. Zineb reduced infection by 85% and mancozeb by 97% [...] By 1989 EBDC fungicides had become the most common fungicidal means to control rust on asparagus. However, after the EPA almost cancelled the use of EBDCs on asparagus many processors decided they would not accept EBDC-treated asparagus despite the EPA allowing its use after review. This meant that many growers were left with no registered fungicide to use on asparagus. Since 1990 the EPA has granted exemptions for <b>tebuconazole,</b> myclobutanil, and triadimefon for use on asparagus.|$|E
50|$|Necrotic ring spot can {{be managed}} through {{chemical}} and cultural controls. Cultural control includes the use of ammonium sulfate or other acidifying fertilizers to suppress the pathogen by lowering the pH of the soil to between 6.0 and 6.2. The more acidic soil discourages the activity of O. korrae (9) When reducing pH to these levels, additional manganese applications should be undertaken to compensate for lower pH. As of now, {{there are only two}} resistant cultivars of bluegrass, which are ‘Riviera’, and ‘Patriot’ (9). One component of their resistance could be that they are tolerant to low temperature, because the grass is more susceptible to the pathogen under colder temperatures(8). In addition, reducing watering inputs and growing turf on well drained soils can lessen disease symptoms. Many different fungicides are used to control the pathogen, Fenarimol, Propiconazole, Myclobutanil, and Azoxystrobin (8). Historically, Fenarimol and Myclobutanil were predominantly used (14). In a study where diluted pesticides were sprayed throughout infested test plots, Fenarimol was found to be the most effective with a 94.6% reduction of the disease. Myclobutanil also decreased the amount of disease, but only by 37.7% (8). Myclobutanil is generally recognized as a very weakly acting demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide and fenarimol is no longer registered for turf so a number of other DMI fungicides have been employed successfully, including Propiconazole, <b>Tebuconazole,</b> Metconazole and others. Pyraclostrobin and Fluoxastrobin have also been used to control the pathogen.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how the presence of Cu influences <b>tebuconazole</b> (Teb) sorption onto contrasting soil types and two important constituents of the soil sorption complex: hydrated Fe oxide and humic substances. <b>Tebuconazole</b> was used in commercial form and as an analytical-grade chemical at different Teb/Cu molar ratios (1 : 4, 1 : 1, 4 : 1, and Teb alone). Increased Cu concentrations had a positive effect on <b>tebuconazole</b> sorption onto most soils and humic substances, probably as a result of Cu−Teb tertiary complexes on the soil surfaces. <b>Tebuconazole</b> sorption increased in the following order of different Teb/Cu ratios 1 : 4 [*]>[*] 1 : 1 [*]>[*] 4 : 1 [*]>[*]without Cu addition, with the only exception for the Leptosol and ferrihydrite.

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} that biocidal organochlorines such as <b>tebuconazole</b> and permethrin, employed in formulations of wood preservatives, produce significant quantities of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDD/F) when subjected to thermal decomposition under oxidative conditions. Both <b>tebuconazole</b> and permethrin form PCDD/F during gas-phase oxidation, but much greater yields {{occurred in the}} presence of surrogate ash corresponding to wood treated with copper-based fungicides. The significant yields have implications for the increased toxicity of PCDD/F emissions during fires of wood impregnated by combination of organic and copper-based preservatives. The oxidative pyrolysis of <b>tebuconazole</b> and permethrin over simulated wood ash generated amounts of PCDD/F exceeding those of untreated wood by 3 orders of magnitude. We obtained yields of 1000 ng WHO 97 -TEQ/g <b>tebuconazole</b> and 5500 ng WHD 97 -TEQ/g permethrin when reacting the organochlorines in an oxidizing atmosphere over surrogate wood ash. Gasphase oxidation also produce measurable quantities of PCDD/F, corresponding to 1 ng WHD 97 -TEQ/g <b>tebuconazole</b> and 36 ng WHD 97 -TEQ/g permethrin. In the case of <b>tebuconazole,</b> the present measurements correlate well with those obtained from oxidative pyrolysis of CBA-treated wood in the cone calorimeter.

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of pollutant effects on host-parasite relationships and disease spread, the main goal {{of this study was}} to assess the influence of different exposure scenarios for the fungicide <b>tebuconazole</b> (concentration × timing of application) on a Daphnia-microparasitic yeast experimental system. Previous results had demonstrated that <b>tebuconazole</b> is able to suppress Metschnikowia bicuspidata infection at ecologically-relevant concentrations; here, we aimed to obtain an understanding of the mechanism underlying the anti-parasitic (fungicidal or fungistatic) action of <b>tebuconazole.</b> We exposed the Daphnia-yeast system to four nominal <b>tebuconazole</b> concentrations at four timings of application (according to the predicted stage of parasite development), replicated on two Daphnia genotypes, in a fully crossed experiment. An “all-or-nothing” effect was observed, with <b>tebuconazole</b> completely suppressing infection from 13. 5 µg l - 1 upwards, independent of the timing of <b>tebuconazole</b> application. A follow-up experiment confirmed that the suppression of infection occurred within a narrow range of <b>tebuconazole</b> concentrations (3. 65 – 13. 5 µg l - 1), although a later application of the fungicide had to be compensated for by a slight increase in concentration to elicit the same anti-parasitic effect. The mechanism behind this anti-parasitic effect seems to be the inhibition of M. bicuspidata sporulation, since <b>tebuconazole</b> was effective in preventing ascospore production even when applied at a later time. However, this fungicide also seemed to affect the vegetative growth of the yeast, as demonstrated by the enhanced negative effect of the parasite (increasing mortality in one of the host genotypes) at a later time of application of <b>tebuconazole,</b> when no signs of infection were observed. Fungicide contamination can thus affect the severity and spread of disease in natural populations, as well as the inherent co-evolutionary dynamics in host-parasite systems.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore beneficial plant-associated rhizobacteria exhibiting substantial tolerance against fungicide <b>tebuconazole</b> vis-à-vis synthesizing plant growth regulators under fungicide stressed soils and to evaluate further these multifaceted rhizobacteria for protection and growth promotion of greengram [Vigna radiata (L.)

The P. aeruginosa strain PS 1 solubilized phosphate significantly and produced indole acetic acid, siderophores, exo-polysaccharides, hydrogen cyanide and ammonia even under <b>tebuconazole</b> stress. Generally, <b>tebuconazole</b> at the recommended, two and three times the recommended field rate adversely affected the growth, symbiosis, grain yield and nutrient uptake in greengram in a concentration dependent manner. In contrast, the P. aeruginosa strain PS 1 along with <b>tebuconazole</b> significantly, increased the growth parameters of the greengram plants. The inoculant strain PS 1 increased appreciably root nitrogen, shoot nitrogen, root phosphorus, shoot phosphorus, and seed yield of greengram plants at all tested concentrations of <b>tebuconazole</b> when compared to the uninoculated plants treated with <b>tebuconazole.</b> The results suggested that the P. aeruginosa strain PS 1, exhibiting novel plant growth regulating physiological features, can be applied as an eco-friendly and plant growth catalyzing bio-inoculant to ameliorate the performance of greengram in fungicide stressed soils...|$|E
40|$|Triazole fungicides, such as <b>tebuconazole,</b> {{have been}} pivotal {{in the control}} of both foliar and seed/soil-borne {{diseases}} of many crops, including cereals, since their introduction in the 1970 s. Although routinely applied as a foliar spray, <b>tebuconazole</b> is also used as a seed treatment. The systemic nature of the fungicide may confer protection of plants from disease {{during the early stages}} of development. However, application rates are limited to between 1 and 7 g active ingredient (AI) per 100 kg of seed due to seed application causing reduced germination and stunting during early plant development. A novel technique whereby fungicides, including <b>tebuconazole,</b> are encapsulated using yeast cells as pre-formed microcapsules may provide {{a solution to the problem}} of phytotoxicity and allow seed treatments to be applied at higher rates, resulting in a reduction in total fungicide application required during the growing season. Several batches of microencapsulated <b>tebuconazole</b> were produced using yeast from different sources. These where tested for their potential for uptake, retention and subsequent delivery of the fungicide. The release of <b>tebuconazole</b> from the different yeast batches into water was assessed over a time course using liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and GCMS. Results showed no differences in the release characteristics of <b>tebuconazole</b> observed between batches. Further to this the age of the batches tested was found to have no effect on release of <b>tebuconazole</b> into water, suggesting shelf-life would not be a problem with this technology. Repeated washing of a sample of microencapsulated <b>tebuconazole</b> with water suggested that the novel formulation could provide the gradual delivery of <b>tebuconazole.</b> An investigation of the phytotoxic effect of <b>tebuconazole,</b> applied as seed treatments at higher than recommended rates (40 g AI per 100 kg seed), showed the microencapsulated formulation had a significantly reduced impact on germination and early plant development, when compared to two commercial formulations of the fungicide, Mystique and Raxil. Further analysis, of the amount of <b>tebuconazole</b> accumulated by plants grown from treated seed, using solid phase extraction (SPE and GC-MS), showed there to be initially less fungicide in plants treated with the microencapsulated formulation. As plant development continued, the amount of <b>tebuconazole</b> recovered from plants treated with both the microencapsulated and conventional formulations became similar. Variation in the results, between replicate samples and also between growth stages led to a series of experiments investigating the possible effect of the growth environment and seed sowing density on <b>tebuconazole</b> uptake. However, no significant effects of these factors were observed. A comparison of the uptake of seed-applied microencapsulated and conventional formulations of <b>tebuconazole</b> between 2 and 19 weeks after sowing, showed there to be no significant differences between formulations used in the concentration of the fungicide accumulated in plants. However, a pronounced increase in plant accumulation of the fungicide was consistently observed between 17 and 19 weeks. It was suggested that this might be associated with roots becoming densely packed within the compost, encouraging fungicide uptake from the compost in the localised dressing zone around the seed. It was shown that <b>tebuconazole</b> became readily bound to the loam-based compost used during the research. Experiments conducted in 1 m columns, containing <b>tebuconazole</b> applied to specific compost layers within the columns, confirmed the ability of wheat roots to recover the fungicide from the compost when they made contact with the specific layers...|$|E

The removal rate constants were consistently higher in unsaturated CWs (range of 2. 6 – 10. 9 cm d− 1) than in saturated CWs (range of 1. 7 – 7. 9 cm d− 1) and higher in planted CWs (range of 3. 1 – 10. 9 cm d− 1) than in unplanted CWs (range of 1. 7 – 2. 6 cm d− 1) for both designs. The low levels of sorption of <b>tebuconazole</b> to the substrate (0. 7 – 2. 1 %) and plant phytoaccumulation (2. 5 – 12. 1 %) indicate that the major removal pathways were biodegradation and metabolization inside the plants after plant uptake.

All together the information on the candidate by-products may help to select relevant sub-set of metabolites for further quantification by LC or GC coupled with MS. It is thereby possible to select putative toxic compounds for further quantification using chemical analysis. Previous work allowed the identification of potential metabolites of <b>tebuconazole.</b> Triazole, triazolyl acetic acid and p-chlorophenol were suspected to result from the decomposition of <b>tebuconazole.</b> <b>Tebuconazole</b> degradation kinetics was followed for 125 days by quanti- fying the dissipation of the parent molecule and the emergence of the three candidate metabolites by LC/MS for <b>tebuconazole,</b> triazol and triazolyl acetate and by GC/MS for p-chlorophenol. The data allowed the proposition of several metabolic pathways...|$|E
40|$|O controle químico da "ergot" (Claviceps africana) foi realizado em campo de produção de sementes do híbrido de sorgo granífero BR 304 (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.), utilizando-se os fungicidas (g i. a. /ha) : captan (1250, 0), {{fenarimol}} (80, 0), trifenil hidróxido de estanho (166, 7), prochloraz (450, 0), chlorothalonil (1500, 0), iprodione (750, 0), azoxystrobin (150, 0), thiabendazole (360, 0), procimidone (750, 0), ziram (1500, 0) e <b>tebuconazole</b> (200, 0). Parcelas sem aplicação de fungicida constituíram a testemunha. As pulverizações foram realizadas com pulverizador costal manual, com o jato dirigido para as panículas. O intervalo das aplicações dos fungicidas foi de 4 dias, a partir da antese. Aos 7 dias após o término das pulverizações, a porcentagem de panículas doentes variou 5, 4 para o fungicida <b>tebuconazole</b> e 100, 0 % para a maioria dos demais tratamentos. Para a porcentagem {{de flores}} doentes por panícula, os valores variaram de 0, 3 % a 65, 0 % para o fungicida <b>tebuconazole</b> e testemunha, respectivamente. Não ocorreu diferença significativa entre as porcentagens de flores doentes por panículas nos tratamentos <b>tebuconazole</b> (0, 3 %), chlorothalonil (2, 5 %) e prochloraz (3, 0 %), sendo esses os mais eficientes no controle da ergot. Adicionalmente, o fungicida mais eficiente no controle da antracnose foliar (Colletotrichum graminicola) foi o prochloraz, ao passo que para a ferrugem (Puccinia purpurea) e a cercosporiose (Cercospora fusimaculans), o maior controle foi obtido com o fungicida <b>tebuconazole.</b> Não houve aumento da germinação das sementes em nenhum dos tratamentos; entretanto, o aumento do peso de mil sementes foi significativo para os tratamentos com os fungicidas prochloraz, chlorotalonil e <b>tebuconazole.</b> The efficiency of fungicides {{in the control}} of sugar disease of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) was evaluated in a seed production field of the sorghum hybrid BR 304. The following fungicides and doses (g a. i. /ha) were evaluated : captan (1250. 0), fenarimol (80. 0), fentin hydroxide (166. 7), prochloraz (450. 0), chlorothalonil (1500. 0), iprodione (750. 0), azoxystrobin (150. 0), thiabendazole (360. 0), procimidone (750. 0), ziram (1500. 0) and <b>tebuconazole</b> (200. 0). A control plot without fungicide application was included in this assay. Applications were performed with a back sprayer, covering the whole panicle, and using 4 days intervals between applications at the anthesis. Seven days {{after the end of}} the applications, the percentage of diseased panicles varied of 5. 4 for the fungicide <b>tebuconazole</b> and 100 for the most of the other treatments. For the percentage of diseased flowers for panicle, the values varied from 0. 3 to 65. 0 for the fungicide <b>tebuconazole</b> and check, respectively. No significant difference among the percentages of diseased flowers for panicles in the treatments <b>tebuconazole</b> (0. 3), chlorothalonil (2. 5) and prochloraz (3. 0), being those the most efficient fungicides in the control of the "ergot". However, the fungicide prochloraz was the most efficient in the control of foliar disease casel by Colletotrichum graminicola, while for the fungi Puccinia purpurea, and Cercospora fusimaculans the best control were obtained with the <b>tebuconazole.</b> There was not an increase of the germination in none of the treatments, however the increase in the weight of a thousand seeds was significant for the treatments with prochloraz, chlorothalonil and <b>tebuconazole...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Tebuconazole</b> {{belongs to}} widely {{utilized}} plant fungicides, mostly in vineyards. Its traces {{are present in}} plant tissues, wine {{as well as in}} soil. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine stoichiometries and stabilities of metal (Cu, Zn, Cd, Ca and Ag) complexes with <b>tebuconazole</b> (1) by means of electrospray ionization mass spectrommetry (ESI-MS). It was found that the complexes of <b>tebuconazole</b> with copper ions are particularly stable ([Cu(1) ]+ has appearance energy 224 kJ·mol- 1, corresponding with the dissociation of the water molecule from the <b>tebuconazole</b> molecule), while the stability of another <b>tebuconazole</b> complexes is lower, about 150 kJ·mol- 1. In real environmental samples, the detection of 1 itself is hampered by its spreading into various species. The method involved here is based upon a hyphenation of electrochemistry (amperometry) and electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). It uses the fact that Cu creates very stable complexes with 1. We demonstrate that at appropriate potentials (at higher than 500 mV) Cu cations can be generated in an electrochemical cell and subsequently form complexes with 1 present in the sample. The resulting complex [Cu(1) ]+ is detected with ESI-MS. The intensity of detected complexes depends on the concentration of 1 and the oxidation level of the [...] ...|$|E
