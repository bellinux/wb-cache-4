25|$|Despite poor showings in the Iowa caucus (1.6%) and the New Hampshire primary (8%), Brown soon {{managed to}} win narrow {{victories}} in Maine, Colorado, Nevada, and Vermont, {{but he continued}} {{to be considered a}} small threat for much of the campaign. It was not until shortly after Super Tuesday, when the field had been narrowed to Brown, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, and front-runner then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, that Brown began to emerge as a major contender {{in the eyes of the}} press. On March 17, Brown forced Tsongas from the race when he received a strong third-place showing in the Illinois primary and then defeated the senator for second place in the Michigan primary by a wide margin. Exactly one week later, he cemented his position as a major threat to Clinton when he eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought Connecticut primary. As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a gaffe: He announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider <b>the</b> <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Jackson as a vice-presidential candidate. Jackson, who had made a pair of anti-semitic comments about Jews in general, and New York City's Jews in particular, while running for president in 1984, was still mistrusted within the Jewish community. Jackson also had ties to Louis Farrakhan, infamous for his own anti-semitic statements, and with Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37%–34%), and dramatically in New York (41%–26%).|$|E

40|$|Let’s Speak Chickasaw: Chikashshanompa’ Kilanompoli’ is a {{landmark}} achievement in Chickasaw language revitalization and fills a wide {{gap in the}} available literature. A Chickasaw Dictionary (1973), compiled by <b>the</b> late <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> J. Humes and his wife, the late Vinnie May James Humes, is an English-Chickasaw word list, an effort on the Humes’ part to preserve the language in written form. Chikashshanompa 2 ̆ 7 Holisso Toba 2 ̆ 7 chi: Chickasaw: An Analytical Dictionary (1994) is a remarkable effort of over 12, 000 entries and includes a chapter on “The Structure of Chickasaw Words,” a brief though thickly constructed examination of Chickasaw syntax, morphology, and phonology. Let’s Speak Chickasaw greatly expands this earlier material and provides interested language learners and scholars with a rigorously detailed grammar of the Chickasaw language and, perhaps most importantly, its first truly comprehensive Chickasaw language textbook. Let’s Speak Chickasaw is composed of twenty chapters covering in considerable detail the basic sounds of Chickasaw, sentence construction, active and stative verb forms, the function of various switch-reference suffixes, and the pattern and function of Chickasaw’s complex system of verb grades. Chapters are broken down into lessons with detailed discussion of subject matter and examples of the structures followed by exercises. Each chapter includes a vocabulary list, a section on reading and speaking, often with practice dialogues, as well as notes on aspects of Chickasaw culture and stories in Chickasaw, accompanied by audio recordings of Catherine Willmond and other fluent speakers retelling the stories, including the story of Rabbit and Buzzard as told by Lizzie Frazier, a masterful example of traditional oral narrative and a rich example {{of the complexity of}} Chickasaw switch-reference suffixes...|$|R
