5|$|Chambyal (people of Chamba) {{enjoy the}} {{traditional}} folk music of their area. This consists of folk songs, dances and folklores {{and these are}} accompanied by various musical instruments.

In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then twice <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> lines– that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation {{to the number of}} excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E

An article in Macworld praised the update and especially the new editing features, but said it had some quirks, such as a difficult-to-find Edit button.

In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method for {{measuring}} the closeness of multiple sets <b>of</b> rules <b>that</b> are combined using Dempster’s rule of combination to improve classification performance. The closeness provides an insight into combining multiple sets of rules in classification − in what circumambience the performance of combinations of some sets of rules using Dempster’s rule is better than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>others.</b> Experiments {{have been carried out}} over the 20 -newsgroups benchmark data collection, and the empirical results show that when the closeness between two sets of rules is higher than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>others,</b> the performance <b>of</b> its combination using Dempster’s rule is better than the others. ...|$|R

5|$|In a {{situation}} analogous with <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for {{the dissemination of}} the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a chasm between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power and wealth, and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already {{been exposed to the}} Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges with envy and hostility.|$|E
