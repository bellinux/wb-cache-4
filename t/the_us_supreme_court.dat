5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. <b>The</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E

5|$|The next {{landmark}} {{decision of}} <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> involving the Oregon Supreme Court was Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994).

However, <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> disagreed and overturned the Oregon court. Then the Oregon court ruled in February 2006 that Oregon’s land use law, Measure 37, was constitutional. Macpherson v.
