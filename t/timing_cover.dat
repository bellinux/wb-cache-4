2500|$|For the 1992 model year, the [...] LT1 {{engine was}} introduced, an {{increase}} of [...] over 1991's L98 engine. This engine featured reverse-flow cooling (the heads were cooled before the block), which allowed for a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1. A new distributor was also debuted. Called [...] "Optispark", the distributor was driven directly off {{the front of the}} camshaft and mounted in front of the <b>timing</b> <b>cover,</b> just above the crankshaft and harmonic balancer. Also new for 1992 was Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR), a form of traction control which utilized the Corvette's brakes, spark retard, and throttle close-down to prevent excessive rear wheel spin and possible loss of control. The traction control device could be switched off if desired.|$|E

50|$|The 300Tdi on a Wolf uses a {{slightly}} different design of <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> compared to the civilian version.|$|E
2500|$|W/NG [...] {{motorcycles}} were supplied from 1940 to 1945 and featured dual triangular tool boxes, pannier frames for bags, rear carrying {{racks and}} headlamp masks. [...] Rubber items were impossible to source from 1942 {{because of a}} shortage of rubber, therefore handgrips were made from canvas and footrests from steel. [...] As the war progressed, aluminium also became scarce and pressed steel {{was used for the}} primary chaincase and <b>timing</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A silver {{finish with}} red and blue lining was used and was matched by a blue saddle with red beading. Primary drive, {{taillight}} housing and <b>timing</b> <b>covers</b> were chrome-plated and the wheel rim centres were painted and lined. US-version side panels had [...] "One of a Thousand" [...] written under Union Jack flag stickers, UK-version side panels had [...] "Limited Edition", while the remaining 400 Commonwealth export bikes were badged [...] "International Edition". Quickly established as a collectors item, each machine was supplied with a unique certificate of ownership.|$|R
5000|$|The VG30i is a 3 L (2,960 cc) engine {{produced}} from 1986 through 1989. It features a throttle body fuel injection system. It {{has a long}} crank snout, a cylinder head temperature sensor positioned behind the <b>timing</b> belt <b>cover,</b> and a knock sensor in the cylinder valley (on California models only). It produces [...] at 4,800 rpm and 226 Nm at 2,800 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2007+ GMT900 Silverado/Sierra trucks, the LU3 engine {{received}} a {{distributorless ignition system}} - the traditional distributor was eliminated where a stub shaft was used. Also the crankshaft sensor was upgraded to a 58x reluctor wheel (same as the GEN IV LSx) {{which resulted in the}} <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> redesigned (this time the cover is aluminum alloy in lieu of the composite cover; the <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> bolt pattern {{is not the same as}} the 1996-06 LU3 and L35.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} block was redesigned {{for use with}} a balance shaft. Cylinder heads (10238181 casting) used with the L35 will have intake ports with eyebrows that clear the fuel injectors. <b>Timing</b> <b>cover</b> flange area was thickened in 1995 {{when some of the}} balance shaft motors had a 6 bolt <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> - some engines had a crankshaft position sensor (in conjunction with a redesigned distributor containing a pickup assembly which functions as a camshaft position sensor) when OBDII was phased in.|$|E
5000|$|... 1996 - This was {{the last}} change for the Generation I engine, which {{continued}} {{through the end of}} the production run in 2003; all 1997-2003 Generation I engines were [...] "Vortec" [...] truck engines. The cylinder heads were redesigned, using improved ports and combustion chambers similar to those in the Generation II LT1, resulting in significant power increases. The intake manifold bolt pattern was also changed to four bolts per cylinder head instead of the [...] "traditional" [...] five bolts. The cylinder block <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> lip was thickened for use with the plastic <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> (redesigned for use with a crankshaft position sensor with integrated dowel pins - cylinder blocks for 1996+ do not have dowel pins in the <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> flange) held with 8 bolts and the water pump bypass hole on the RH deck and below the water pump passage undrilled. Also the fuel pump boss is still present but undrilled (which dates back to the 1992 model year).|$|E
50|$|Marathon runners often {{set their}} own goals for the race in terms of <b>timing</b> and {{distances}} <b>covered.</b> Being able to achieve these goals highly motivates the runners mentally and enables them to gain a higher self-confidence.|$|R
50|$|Timings {{printed on}} the label are quite {{different}} from what the <b>cover</b> says. <b>Timings</b> from the <b>cover</b> are shown first, followed by the label's timing in brackets (not shown in one instance where they are the same).|$|R
30|$|In [6], state {{feedback}} and output controllers {{for a certain}} class of nonlinear <b>timing</b> systems <b>cover</b> the class of systems satisfying a linear growth condition [17], using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions. Authors derived delay-independent conditions to ensure global exponential stability of the closed-loop systems. In this paper, {{in order to reduce}} the conservatism, a new delay-dependent stability criterion is obtained in Theorem  6 and Theorem 7 by constructing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional given by (8) and (18).|$|R
50|$|Applications of the High Output 2.2L {{included}} the 1983-1984 Dodge Shelby Charger the 1984-1985 Dodge Omni GLH and the 1985-1987 Dodge Charger. This High Output {{version of the}} 2.2L could be easily recoginized by its chrome valve cover and tighter <b>timing</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
50|$|The K2 has {{a larger}} <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> which distinguishes {{it from the}} model K and the BSA A7. Also the K2 chassis has a {{different}} rear subframe, fuel tank and side panels. These changes gave the K2 a typically conservative Meguro image, dissimilar to the original BSA A7.|$|E
50|$|Engine {{timing was}} {{controlled}} by the all-steel, silent Morse timing chain (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> {{at the front of}} the engine block. The timing chain sprockets, one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> was a new-design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the accessory drive belt was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic belt tensioner this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} a comprehensive analysis of research investigating {{the impacts of}} nitrogen application <b>timing</b> and <b>cover</b> crops on the biomass production, nitrogen uptake, and cash crop grain yield in subsequent cash crops. Also contained within this thesis is a cost benefit analysis {{for the implementation of}} cover crops within varying nitrogen management systems, which assigns value to the environmental benefits of cover crops and determines their potential to recover the implementation costs associated with cover crops...|$|R
50|$|The 1.3 L 2A was {{produced}} from 1979 through 1989. 2A motors in 1982 onwards AL20 Tercels {{have a slightly}} different valve <b>cover</b> and <b>timing</b> belt <b>cover</b> than early AL11 Tercels, {{as well as an}} automatic choke, and automatically controlled hot air intake (HAI) system. It also has higher compression ratio, and reformulated combustion chambers to improve the fuel economy and emissions. All variants used belt-driven SOHC eight-valve counter-flow cylinder heads with a single downdraft carburetor.|$|R
50|$|Descriptions {{are taken}} from the track list on the album <b>cover.</b> <b>Timings</b> {{are taken from}} the first edition's label, which uses take four of each side. Later editions have {{alternate}} takes of side two, and timings are not shown on the labels.|$|R
50|$|A {{long block}} engine {{replacement}} typically requires swapping out parts {{from the original}} engine to the long block. These parts include the oil pan, <b>timing</b> <b>cover,</b> valve covers, intake manifold, emission-control parts, carburetor or fuel injection system, the exhaust manifold(s), alternator, starter, power steering pump (if any), and air conditioner compressor (if any).|$|E
50|$|First, {{the loose}} chain will reduce {{ignition}} timing accuracy, which usually results in noticeably rough running. Second, it may jump a tooth {{on the drive}} sprocket or break entirely, which almost always results in major damage to an interference engine. Third, the stretched chain can slap {{against the side of}} the <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> and wear through the metal into the coolant passage behind the water pump, resulting in major damage to both the oil and cooling systems (sometimes mis-diagnosed as a head gasket failure). The damaged aluminum <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> is difficult to repair effectively and is typically replaced after such an event. Aftermarket timing-chain kits for the 22R and 22RE typically include steel-backed guides that do not readily break even after the initial chain stretching has occurred, permitting the chain to run beyond the 100,000 mile point without further incident.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} years of production, the Lotus blocks were simply {{selected}} for the thickest cylinder walls from the standard production line, and identified with an [...] "A" [...] stamped into the <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> mating face. Later, the blocks were specially cast with twin-cam production in mind and identified with an [...] "L" [...] cast into the block under the engine mount.|$|E
50|$|Aprilia bought engines from Suzuki (which were {{fitted with}} Aprilia branded {{castings}} on the <b>timing</b> and clutch <b>covers),</b> then fit their own expansion chambers, barrels and ECU. They also redesigned the heads to have larger cooling passages {{and a slightly}} different combustion chamber shape.|$|R
50|$|However, {{while the}} Volvo engine designs would {{externally}} {{appear to be}} a domestic Volvo, there are minor differences. The engine mounts are one example along with the oil filter mounting, power steering pump, ECU, <b>timing</b> belt <b>cover</b> and probably the gearbox setup. The camshaft pulleys were inverted by Renault making the Volvo timing marks redundant. The engine must now utilise a specialist alignment tool to set up the timing however this tool can also be used on the same genuine volvo engines. The 2.5 engine is really a 2.4 being 2435cc but was rounded up by Renault.|$|R
50|$|For the 1992 model year, the 4.3L had its {{block design}} {{modified}} {{to allow a}} balance shaft to be installed. Even though the 4.3L is an even fire V6, the 90-degree block layout is not ideal for smoothness. The balance shaft on the 4.3L is installed above the top timing gear, and runs through {{the top of the}} lifter valley. It is gear driven off the timing chain, and therefore a new <b>timing</b> chain <b>cover</b> was designed for these balanced 4.3L V6s. Balance shaft engines do not have provisions for a mechanical fuel pump unlike the non-balance shaft motors which retained the cast in boss.|$|R
50|$|The Series 2 Interceptor {{engine was}} a major {{redesign}} of the Series 1A engine. It included a wet sump engine to improve oil flow to the crankshaft. The CB points were moved {{to the end of}} exhaust camshaft and the <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> was redesigned accordingly. This engine was used on the Interceptor until the end of production in 1970. This engine was later used on Rickman Interceptor and Clymer Enfields.|$|E
50|$|As of the 2013 model year, the 4.3L {{was still}} in {{production}} although the distributor was eliminated in the late 2000s where a coil-on-plug ignition system (using a 58x crankshaft position sensor based on the GEN IV LSx) was phased in. This resulted in a new design <b>timing</b> <b>cover</b> with a wider bottom flange, making it incompatible with the 1996-06 LU3/L35. The only vehicles using the 4.3L by that time were the GMT900 light duty trucks and vans.|$|E
50|$|Some {{parts from}} the Generation II are {{interchangeable}} with the Generation I one-piece rear main seal engine. The interchangeable parts include the rotating assembly (crank shaft, pistons, connecting rods, and flywheel/flexplate) and valvetrain assembly (not including timing set, {{which includes a}} gear to drive the water pump). The LT1 uses a new engine block, cylinder head, <b>timing</b> <b>cover,</b> water pump, intake manifold and accessory brackets. The harmonic damper also does not interchange; it is a unique damper/pulley assembly. Engine mounts and bell housing bolt pattern remain the same, permitting a newer engine to be readily swapped into an older vehicle.|$|E
40|$|The Numerical Aerodynamics Simulation (NAS) Facility's CRAY C 916 / 1024 has 240 + GB of SuperHome storage with 2 TB of {{migrated}} storage. NAS is a {{beta test}} {{site for the}} Storage Technology Corporation (STK) Redwood (SD- 3) device and Cray's DMF 2. 3. This discussion will include a list of resolved problems and various metrics relative to transfer, search, rewind, unload, and mount <b>timings.</b> Also <b>covered</b> will be how DMF 2. 3 with the advance tape MSP will integrate the Redwood tape drives along with the existing STK 4490 tape drives to potentially {{reduce the number of}} tapes used by 85 %...|$|R
5000|$|The first 2007 Hypermotard was {{available}} in two configurations: the base '1100' model and the higher specification '1100S' model. The more expensive 1100S featured a durable low friction diamond-like carbon (DLC) black coating to the front fork sliders, an Öhlins remote reservoir rear shock, the same Brembo Monobloc brake calipers used on the 1098, lighter forged aluminium Marchesini wheels with a red pin-stripe, Pirelli tires, plus carbon fibre fork protectors, <b>timing</b> belt <b>covers,</b> front mudguard/ fender and tail/ exhaust side panels. These upgrades made for a 2 kg (4.5 lb) weight saving; 177 kg (390 lbs) versus 179 kg (395 lbs) for the base model.|$|R
5000|$|Later {{versions}} of the 2AZ-FE engine were upgraded with 9.8:1 compression ratio, a slightly more aggressive intake cam profile, 6500 rpm red line, and piston oil squirters. These later versions are rated at [...] in the Scion tC, [...] in the Rav4, and [...] in the Camry, Corolla XRS, and Scion xB. However, these latter 2AZ-FE models {{were the first to}} be rated under the new SAE J1349 standard. The new standard usually produces more conservative numbers, though no definitive comparison is available since the two versions were never tested by the same standard.The Rav 4 uses a different <b>timing</b> chain <b>cover</b> than the Camry, they can however be interchanged.|$|R
5000|$|The small-block {{engine that}} was {{identified}} as the Windsor engine {{was introduced in the}} 1962 Ford Fairlane. Displacing 221 cuin L, it was designed to save weight, using thin-wall casting with a block that does not extend below the centerline of the crankshaft. The engine uses a separate aluminum timing chain cover, which differentiates it from the later 335-series Cleveland engines that use an integrated <b>timing</b> <b>cover.</b> All Windsor engines use two-valve-per-cylinder heads, with [...] "2V" [...] and [...] "4V" [...] designations indicating the number of barrels (or venturi) in the carburetor. The valves are in-line and use straight six-bolt valve covers. Coolant is routed into the block by the intake manifold.|$|E
5000|$|For the 1992 model year, the [...] LT1 {{engine was}} introduced, an {{increase}} of [...] over 1991's L98 engine. This engine featured reverse-flow cooling (the heads were cooled before the block), which allowed for a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1. A new distributor was also debuted. Called [...] "Optispark", the distributor was driven directly off {{the front of the}} camshaft and mounted in front of the <b>timing</b> <b>cover,</b> just above the crankshaft and harmonic balancer.

50|$|The major {{differences}} of the Buick 350 {{in comparison to}} other GM V8s are Buick's deep-skirt engine block construction, the use of cast iron with increased nickel content, {{the use of an}} external oil pump, a forward-mounted distributor, under-square cylinder bore sizing, 3 in crankshaft main journals, and 6.385 in connecting rods. The Buick 350 also shares an integrated aluminum <b>timing</b> <b>cover,</b> which incorporates the oil pump mechanisms as well, leaving the oil filter exposed to oncoming air for added cooling. The engine garnered a reputation as a rugged and durable engine , and some of the design characteristics of the Buick 350 are found in other Buick-designed GM engines such as the 231 CID L V6 and its 3800 descendants.|$|E
30|$|Semmens and Ramage (2012) {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} snowmelt and wildfire outbreaks using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), which can detect melt and refreeze cycles at the snow surface. Their method did not consider the <b>timing</b> of snow <b>cover</b> loss, as is calculated here. Additionally, their focus on a single watershed in Alaska may not be relevant to the US Mountain West.|$|R
50|$|Other {{changes to}} the engine were related to ease of {{manufacture}} and improved reliability. This led to elimination of coolant flowing through the intake manifold to prevent unnecessary heat transfer. To perform this change, {{the front of the}} engine block was extended to include provisions for the coolant to flow through a cross over in the block. This extension also acted as an integrated timing chain housing. The timing chain housing was covered with flat steel that was easier to seal than the typical large <b>timing</b> chain <b>cover</b> used on other Ford V8s. These changes resulted in a bigger and heavier engine block than the Windsor V8s. The 351 Cleveland was not an all-new design, but a development of the 351W into a higher-performance variation.|$|R
5000|$|Timing belts are {{typically}} covered by metal or polymer <b>timing</b> belt <b>covers</b> which require removal for inspection or replacement. Engine manufacturers recommend replacement at specific intervals. [...] The manufacturer may also recommend {{the replacement of}} other parts, such as the water pump, when the timing belt is replaced because the additional cost to replace the water pump is negligible compared {{to the cost of}} accessing the timing belt. In an interference engine, or one whose valves extend into the path of the piston, failure of the timing belt (or timing chain) invariably results in costly and, in some cases, irreparable engine damage, as some valves will be held open when they should not be and thus will be struck by the pistons.|$|R
