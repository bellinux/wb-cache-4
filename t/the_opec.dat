5|$|<b>The</b> <b>OPEC</b> Reference Basket of Crudes {{has been}} an {{important}} benchmark for oil prices since 2000. It is calculated as a weighted average of prices for petroleum blends from <b>the</b> <b>OPEC</b> member countries: Saharan Blend (Algeria), Girassol (Angola), Oriente (Ecuador), Rabi Light (Gabon), Iran Heavy (Islamic Republic of Iran), Basra Light (Iraq), Kuwait Export (Kuwait), Es Sider (Libya), Bonny Light (Nigeria), Qatar Marine (Qatar), Arab Light (Saudi Arabia), Murban (UAE), and Merey (Venezuela).|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, {{who had joined}} in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under <b>the</b> <b>OPEC</b> quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly <b>the</b> <b>OPEC</b> members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of {{hundreds of billions of}} US dollars per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E

5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 {{million barrels per day}} despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, <b>the</b> <b>OPEC</b> Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E
25|$|During the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Saudi Arabia {{participated in}} the Arab oil boycott of the United States and Netherlands. A member of <b>the</b> <b>OPEC,</b> Saudi Arabia had joined other member {{countries}} in moderate oil price increases beginning in 1971. After the 1973 war, {{the price of oil}} rose substantially, dramatically increasing Saudi Arabia's wealth and political influence.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>OPEC</b> {{oil embargo}} marked a {{long-term}} economic transition since, {{for the first}} time, energy prices skyrocketed, and American factories faced serious competition from foreign automobiles, clothing, electronics, and consumer goods. By the late 1970s the economy suffered an energy crisis, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and very high inflation coupled with high interest rates (the term stagflation was coined). Since economists agreed on the wisdom of deregulation, many of the New Deal era regulations were ended, such as in transportation, banking, and telecommunications.|$|E

50|$|Real GDP {{per capita}} (measured in 1990 $) {{increased}} significantly during the 1950s, 60s and 70s, {{which can be}} explained by both higher oil production levels as well as oil prices, which famously peaked in the 1970s due to <b>the</b> <b>OPEC’s</b> oil embargo. In following two decades however, GDP per capita in Iraq dropped substantially because of multiple wars, namely the 1980-88 war with Iran, the 1990-1991 Gulf War.|$|R

25|$|A joint aid {{strategy}} for Burkina Faso {{is expected in}} 2009 {{following in the footsteps}} of a “Plan d’Action National de l’Efficacité de l’Aide” (PANEA). Among the main external partners in the water and sanitation sector in Burkina Faso are the African Development Bank, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, Denmark, the Kuwait Fund for Arab and Economic Development, the European Investment Bank, the European Union, France, Germany, the Islamic Development Bank, <b>the</b> <b>OPEC</b> Fund for International Development, the West African Development Bank and the World Bank. The donors increasingly finance projects together in the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, thus reducing the fragmentation of external cooperation. In addition to public donor agencies, many NGOs are active in water and sanitation in Burkina Faso.|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2008, Pickens {{announced}} a major energy policy proposal, called the Pickens Plan. The plan promotes a radical {{reduction in the}} United States' dependency upon foreign energy, particularly oil provided by nations in <b>the</b> <b>OPEC</b> cartel. Although {{the plan calls for}} introduction of various alternatives to oil, including wind and solar, its major component is the conversion of the nation's commercial transport sector away from OPEC diesel to natural gas. The Pickens Plan also calls for the United States to utilize its wind corridor {{in the middle of the}} country stretching from Texas northerly through the Great Plains to the Canada–US border. He noted in Congressional testimony in July 2008 that his plan would generate new jobs and provide economic stimulus to this area, while noting that it would also require new transmission lines which traditionally antagonize some environmentalists and/or nearby populations.|$|E
25|$|Consumption in {{the twentieth}} and twenty-first centuries has been abundantly pushed by {{automobile}} growth; the 1985–2003 oil glut even fueled the sales of low economy vehicles in OECD countries. The 2008 economic crisis {{seems to have had}} some impact on the sales of such vehicles; still, the 2008 oil consumption shows a small increase. In 2016 however Goldman Sachs predicts lower demand due to emerging economies concerns, especially China. The BRICS (Brasil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries might also kick in, as China briefly was the first automobile market in December 2009. The immediate outlook still hints upwards. In the long term, uncertainties linger; <b>the</b> <b>OPEC</b> believes that the OECD countries will push low consumption policies {{at some point in the}} future; when that happens, it will definitely curb oil sales, and both OPEC and EIA kept lowering their 2020 consumption estimates during the past 5 years. Oil products are more and more in competition with alternative sources, mainly coal and natural gas, both cheaper sources.|$|E

The Conference ordinarily meets at the Vienna headquarters, at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary. It generally operates on the principles of unanimity and [...] "one member, one vote", with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget.

500|$|In {{the years}} after 1973, {{as an example of}} {{so-called}} [...] "checkbook diplomacy", certain Arab nations have been among the world's largest providers of foreign aid, and OPEC added to its goals the selling of oil for the socio-economic growth of poorer nations. <b>The</b> <b>OPEC</b> Special Fund was conceived in Algiers, Algeria, in March 1975, and was formally established the following January.

500|$|Thanks to the {{historic}} oil price increases of 2003–2008, OPEC revenues approximated an unprecedented US$1trillion per year in 2008 and 2011–2014. Beyond <b>the</b> <b>OPEC</b> countries, substantial surpluses also accrued to Russia and Norway, and sovereign wealth funds worldwide amassed US$7trillion by 2014–2015. Some oil exporters were unable to reap the full benefits, as the national economies of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Venezuela all suffered from multi-year political obstacles associated with what economists call the [...] "resource curse". Most of the other large exporters accumulated enough financial reserves to cushion the shock when oil prices and petrodollar surpluses fell sharply again from an oil supply glut in 2014–2017.|$|E
500|$|Oil-exporting {{countries}} have used {{part of their}} petrodollar surpluses to fund foreign aid programs, as a prominent example of so-called [...] "checkbook diplomacy" [...] or [...] "petro-Islam".

Oil exporters have also aided poorer nations indirectly through the personal remittances sent home by tens of millions of foreign workers in the Middle East, although their working conditions are generally harsh. Even more controversially, several oil exporters have been major financial supporters of armed groups challenging the governments of other countries.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies a {{game between}} {{a group of}} {{countries}} that have {{agreed to participate in}} an international climate agreement (<b>the</b> signatories) and <b>OPEC.</b> <b>The</b> purpose of the signatories is to design carbon taxes that maximize their total net income, given a goal on global carbon emissions. As a response to <b>the</b> climate agreement, <b>OPEC</b> imposes an oil tax on its member states that maximizes OPEC's profits. Within a numerical model we find the subgame-perfect equilibrium of a game in which each player chooses when to fix his decision variables.

It is demonstrated, however, that for both agents the order of move is of minor (numerical) importance. Hence, the players have limited incentives for strategic behaviour.
