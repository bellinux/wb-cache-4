5|$|Folklorists see the jackalope {{as one of}} a {{group of}} fabled creatures common to American culture since Colonial days. These appear in tall <b>tales</b> <b>about</b> hodags, giant turtles, Bigfoot, and many other mysterious beasts and in novels like Moby-Dick. The tales lend {{themselves}} to comic hoaxing by entrepreneurs who seek attention for their products, their persons, or their towns.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized <b>tales</b> <b>about</b> unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Burney, who was {{studying}} recent extinctions in Madagascar, collected <b>tales</b> <b>about</b> a creature called the kilopilopitsofy {{that had been}} described by villagers {{in the town of}} Belo-sur-mer, a small fishing village on the west coast. Several villagers independently described an animal that, as recently as 1976, had entered their village, {{was the size of a}} cow, was dark pigmented, grunted a lot, and when threatened, fled underwater. No known animal on Madagascar fits the description but the animal seemed remarkably like a hippopotamus.|$|E

5|$|The jackalope {{is subject}} to many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims {{embedded}} in tall <b>tales</b> <b>about</b> its habits. Jackalopes {{are said to be}} so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored. Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk, but The New York Times questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk. One of the ways to catch a jackalope is to entice it with whiskey, the jackalope's beverage of choice.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary <b>tales</b> <b>about</b> individual failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Parents and family members were expected to act as role models, and parents who worked for a living passed their skills on to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships for more advanced training in crafts or trades. Formal {{education was}} available only to children from families who could pay for it, {{and the lack of}} state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} folk <b>tales</b> <b>about</b> the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E

5|$|The Konjaku Monogatarishū from ca. 1120 is {{the most}} {{important}} setsuwa compilation. It is an anonymous collection of more than 1,000 anecdotes or <b>tales.</b> <b>About</b> two-thirds of the tales are Buddhist, telling about the spread of Buddhism from India via China to Japan. As such it is the first world history of Buddhism written in Japanese. This National Treasure is also known as the Suzuka Manuscript and consists of nine volumes covering setsuwa from India (vols. 2 and 5), China (vols. 7, 9, 10) and Japan (vols. 12, 17, 27, 29). It is considered to be the oldest extant manuscript of the Konjaku Monogatarishū and has served as a source for various later manuscripts.|$|E
