5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. <b>The</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
25|$|Method of storing the material. Wrap the scabs {{carefully}} in paper {{and put them}} into a small container bottle. Cork it tightly so that the activity is not dissipated. <b>The</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> not be exposed to sunlight or warmed beside a fire. It is best to carry it for some time on the person so that the scabs dry naturally and slowly. The container should be marked clearly with the date on which the contents were taken from the patient.|$|E
50|$|Ideally, the {{container}} {{is made of}} durable material to give the product a long shelf life. It must last even longer through consumer use. The frequent opening and closing of {{the container}} can take a toll on its condition over time. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> protect the product {{to the degree that}} it remains a safe product for human consumption. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> shield the product from dirt, dust and germs.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>containers</b> {{may also}} contain {{a limited amount}} of liquids. The energy {{released}} from radioactive materials will dissociate water into hydrogen and oxygen (radiolysis). This could then create a potentially explosive environment inside <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> <b>The</b> <b>containers</b> <b>must</b> be vented, as well, to prevent this from happening.|$|R
50|$|For on-site {{burning of}} used oil, the oil must {{be stored in}} tanks or containers, above or underground. <b>The</b> <b>containers</b> <b>must</b> be in good {{condition}} with no leaks, the tanks/containers must be labeled with the words “used oil”, and {{there must be a}} spill prevention plan (or a control and countermeasures plan).|$|R
5000|$|After {{resurfacing}} {{the entire}} sheet, {{also known as}} an [...] "ice cut" [...] or [...] "flood", <b>the</b> snow <b>container</b> <b>must</b> be emptied. Hydraulics raise one end of <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> causing <b>the</b> snow to spill out.|$|R
5000|$|The {{professionals}} who work {{to maintain the}} structure of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> be flexible {{to allow for the}} expected and the unexpected expression of self which comes in such an environment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} increases beverage delivery {{since the}} extra hole allows the liquid to leave while air enters simultaneously {{through the main}} hole. The bottleneck, created where air entering <b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> travel through the same orifice as liquid leaving, is removed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> {{also contain}} labels that legibly display basic {{information}} about the product and the manufacturer. These labels include contact information, ingredients, expiration dates, warnings and instructions. Labels not only identify products and their origins, they help provide consumers with the facts that cannot be confusing or misleading.|$|E
40|$|Given {{a pool of}} <b>containers,</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> {{assignment}} problem {{consists of}} determining on which waterway barges <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> <b>must</b> be loaded to minimize {{the total number of}} barges used while satisfying a number of side conditions. In this talk, we present three models and the associated solution methods, which mainly differ by the number of side constraints taken into account. Models and methods are compared on data provided by the Port of Lille...|$|R
50|$|Pyrophoric solids {{require the}} use of a sealed glove box flushed with inert gas. Glove boxes are {{expensive}} and require maintenance. Thus, many pyrophoric solids are sold as solutions, or dispersions in mineral oil or lighter hydrocarbon solvents. Mildly pyrophoric solids (such as lithium tetrahydridoaluminate (lithium aluminium hydride) and sodium hydride) can be handled in the air for brief periods of time, but <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> <b>must</b> be flushed with inert gas before storage.|$|R
50|$|An Inland port {{is located}} south of Minto station. It {{consists}} of a crossover and a siding. Because there are no facilities for locomotives to change ends of <b>the</b> train, <b>the</b> <b>container</b> trains <b>must</b> have engines at both ends.|$|R
50|$|During the {{operation}} of a typical magnetic agitator, the agitator bar is moved inside a container such as to dissolve a substance in a liquid. <b>The</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> {{be placed on the}} sheet, so that the magnetic field influences the agitation bar and makes it rotate. This allows it to mix different substances at high speeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of a {{cosmetic}} container {{is to protect the}} product while it is in storage or being transported. <b>The</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> be a well thought out solution that protects the product from deterioration and helps preserve its quality. It must be an attractive looking container as part of the marketing of a beauty product.|$|E
50|$|The {{aesthetics}} {{of the container}} are considered extremely important since cosmetic products are mainly sold on brand image. Since cosmetic products are not considered medicine or survival products, the marketing of cosmetics depends heavily on associating brand awareness with emotion. <b>The</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> convey emotions about how the product will improve one's appearance and attitude. Many times cosmetics are repackaged and rebranded to help give them more market visibility.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{setup is}} shown in Fig. 1. A {{reservoir}} of water or other conducting liquid (top, green) is connected to two hoses that release two falling streams of drops, which land in two buckets or containers (bottom, red and blue). Each stream passes (without touching) through a metal ring or open cylinder which is electrically connected to the opposite receiving container; the left ring (red) {{is connected to the}} right bucket, while the right ring (blue) is connected to the left bucket. <b>The</b> <b>containers</b> <b>must</b> be electrically insulated from each other and from electrical ground. Similarly, the rings must be electrically isolated from each other and their environment. It is necessary for the streams to break into separate droplets before reaching <b>the</b> <b>containers.</b> Typically, <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> are made of metal and the rings are connected to them by wires.|$|R
50|$|When storing {{chemical}} wastes, <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> <b>must</b> be in {{good condition}} and should remain closed unless waste is being added. Hazardous waste must be stored safely prior to removal from the laboratory {{and should not be}} allowed to accumulate. Container should be sturdy and leakproof, also has to be labeled. All liquid waste must be stored in leakproof containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. Snap caps, mis-sized caps, parafilm and other loose fitting lids are not acceptable. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from <b>the</b> primary <b>container,</b> segregate incompatible hazardous wastes, such as acids and bases.|$|R
50|$|On October 17, 2013, {{the first}} {{standard}} definition ruleset for retail sources was released. A day later {{there was a}} revision that fixed some examples. <b>The</b> MKV <b>container</b> <b>must</b> be used. It is mandatory to support file streaming and playing from RARs. CRF must be used. A photograph as proof must be included. 81 groups signed the document.|$|R

50|$|When {{disposing}} hazardous {{laboratory chemical}} waste, chemical compatibility must be considered. For safe disposal, <b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> be chemically {{compatible with the}} material it will hold. Chemicals must not react with, weaken, or dissolve the container or lid. Acids or bases should not be stored in metal. Hydrofluoric acid should not store in glass. Gasoline (solvents) should not store or transport in lightweight polyethylene containers such as milk jugs. Moreover, the Chemical Compatibility Guidelines should be considered for more detailed information.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> {{be made of}} {{materials}} resistant to hot or cold temperatures. It must also protect the product from ultraviolet rays, which can potentially damage the product. The container also cannot absorb product substances. Traditionally, plastic material or glass {{have been used to}} house cosmetics. Aluminum has become a popular type of container due to its lightweight yet sturdy quality, flexibility, durability and recyclability. A key factor in what type of material can be used for containers is how compatible the material is with the product.|$|E
50|$|As the {{finished}} product is fermented in a glass <b>container,</b> <b>the</b> fermentation process causes pressure to build up inside <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> Hence, care <b>must</b> be taken when opening <b>the</b> pressurized <b>container</b> containing ready-made cincalok.|$|R
50|$|Both {{of these}} ASiC {{containers}} {{are capable of}} maintaining long term availability and integrity when storing XAdES or CAdES signatures {{through the use of}} time-stamp tokens or evidence record manifest files that are contained within <b>the</b> <b>containers.</b> ASiC <b>containers</b> <b>must</b> comply with <b>the</b> ZIP specification and limitations that are applied to ZIP.|$|R
50|$|For the {{measurement}} of the volumetric expansion of liquids one takes a large glass container filled with water. In an expansion tank (glass container with an accurate volume scale) with the sample liquid. If one heats the water up, the sample liquid expands and the volume changes is read. However the expansion of <b>the</b> sample <b>container</b> <b>must</b> also be taken into consideration.|$|R
50|$|The {{materials}} used for cosmetic containers are {{of concern for}} both protective and sustainable reasons. <b>The</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> protect the product from environmental elements and it must also move {{in the direction of}} eco-friendly solutions. In other words, the more the container can be recycled, the better for both the environment and cost efficiency. Some of the factors that affect container durability include how the product substance responds to usage, chemical composition and biology. It is essential that the container is able to withstand mold and mildew, as well as contaminants.|$|E
50|$|Bitters is {{also known}} for his thumb pots. He has raised what was once humble, {{decorative}} and functional into objects of art by applying {{all the elements of}} formal art. Bitters’ pots and planters are distinctively earthy and textural and it is easy to overlook at texture, while a hallmark of his work, “is only one of the elements,” according to Bitters. “The surface of <b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> be treated in attitude like a painting involving the variation of a theme, thick and thin line, color, relationships of form, scale, proportion, calligraphy, texture, and finally, the organization of all these elements into a single statement. All the elements of formal art may be found in pots” (Bitters 1976, p. 48).|$|E

40|$|Constructive {{algorithms}} {{and lower}} bounds for guillotine cuttable orthogonal bin packing problems The d-dimensional bin packing problem (OBPP-d) {{is the problem}} of finding the minimum number of containers needed to contain a set of orthogonally packed d-dimensional rectangular boxes. In OBPP-d solvers two subproblems are crucial: Calculating lower bounds and solving the decision problem (OPP-d) of determining if a set of boxes can be orthogonally packed into a single container. This thesis focuses on these two subproblems with an extra requirement attached: All packings must be guillotine cuttable. That is, <b>the</b> <b>containers</b> <b>must</b> be able to be split into n pieces, each holding a box, by recursively cutting them with face orthogonal cuts. We present an extension of a framework by Fekete and Scheper...|$|R
5000|$|Compared to {{shipping}} from China, {{there is}} a special advantage for parts of China far away from <b>the</b> coast, those <b>containers</b> <b>must</b> be freighted a long way on railway anyway. These areas are the main initial target for the NEW.|$|R
5000|$|When the charged object C is {{enclosed}} inside <b>the</b> conductive <b>container</b> A. all <b>the</b> field lines {{extending from}} the object must terminate on the inside surface of the container; there is nowhere else for them to go. [...] Since each unit of charge on the object originates a field line, which ends on an equal induced charge on <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> <b>the</b> total charge on the object and the induced charge on <b>the</b> <b>container's</b> interior <b>must</b> be equal.|$|R
50|$|The cosmological {{constant}} has negative pressure equal to its energy density and so causes {{the expansion of}} the universe to accelerate. The reason a {{cosmological constant}} has negative pressure can be seen from classical thermodynamics. In general, energy must be lost from inside a container (<b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> do work on its environment) in order for the volume to increase. Specifically, a change in volume dV requires work done equal to a change of energy −P dV, where P is the pressure. But the amount of energy in a container full of vacuum actually increases when the volume increases, because the energy is equal to ρV, where ρ is the energy density of the cosmological constant. Therefore, P is negative and, in fact, P = −ρ.|$|E
50|$|For energy {{production}} purposes, one might use a container located inside a solenoid. The container {{is filled with}} gaseous uranium hexafluoride, where the uranium is enriched, to a level just short of criticality. Afterward, the uranium hexafluoride is compressed by external means, thus initiating a nuclear chain reaction and {{a great amount of}} heat, which in turn causes an expansion of the uranium hexafluoride. Since the UF6 is contained within the vessel, it can't escape and thus compresses elsewhere. The result is a plasma wave moving in the container, and the solenoid converts some of its energy into electricity at an efficiency level of about 20%. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> be cooled, and one can extract energy from the coolant by passing it through a heat exchanger and turbine system as in an ordinary thermal power plant.|$|E
50|$|The species {{could be}} housed as pets, {{and they can}} live with each other communally once into their 2nd instar. Mothers tend to eat the young on case-by-case basis. Another thing to {{consider}} if owning such species is that they need something to climb on. A cork bark is a nice climbing tool for such species if the owner will lean it {{against the side of}} the enclosure or layer it to provide ample climbing space. Artificial limbs can be used too, since the same tool is used for reptiles and aquariums alike. The container in which they need to live, is supposed to be of 3.8 - 5 cm deep and moistured. Peat moss must be provided, even though that the species are not burrowers. The owner is responsible for keeping the moss clean every two weeks. The species don't require water, since the acquire moist from their prey. The temperature in <b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>must</b> be at 75-90 °F or 24-32 °C for the species to survive and reproduce.|$|E
40|$|A {{key element}} in the Department of Energy (DOE) {{strategy}} for the stabilization, packaging and storage of plutonium-bearing materials involves closure welding of DOE-STD- 3013 Outer <b>Containers</b> (3013 <b>container).</b> <b>The</b> 3013 <b>container</b> provides <b>the</b> primary barrier and pressure boundary preventing release of plutonium-bearing materials to the environment. The final closure (closure weld) of <b>the</b> 3013 <b>container</b> <b>must</b> be leaktight, structurally sound and meet DOE STD 3013 specified criteria.
