50|$|Danknick had a {{small part}} in an episode of the Comedy Central series I'm With Busey. Danknick was a robot builder visited by Gary Busey and Adam de la Pena who tried to show Busey that not all {{technology}} was destructive. This portion of the episode was shot at Danknick's machine shop in Anaheim, CA. Two robots {{were built in the}} days before: one semi-lame wedge sporting <b>turkey</b> <b>wings</b> and an air vent, and the other a high power flipper with a propane torch. Adam got the flame, Busey the turkey.|$|E
50|$|Joint Consultative Committee (JCC) {{was formed}} on 16 November 1995 in {{accordance}} with the Article 25 of the Ankara Agreement. The Comity aims to promote dialogue and cooperation between the economic and social interest groups in the European Community and Turkey and to facilitate the institutionalization of the partners of that dialogue in Turkey. Joint Consultative Comity has a mixed, cooperative and a two-winged structure: EU and <b>Turkey</b> <b>wings.</b> It has 36 members in total, composed of 18 Turkish and 18 EU representatives and it has two elected co-chairmen, one from the Turkish side and the other from the EU side.|$|E
40|$|Stable carbon (13 C/ 12 C; δ 13 C) and {{nitrogen}} (15 N/ 14 N; δ 15 N) isotope ratios are best {{used to assess}} wild animal diets when the isotopic differences between consumers and diets are known. These differences are called discrimination factors (expressed with Δ notation). We report the 1 st Δ 13 C and Δ 15 N values between diet and fur from captive individuals held on controlled diets for 7 months and representing 4 felid species: African lions (Panthera leo), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), and mountain lions (Puma concolor). All animals were fed a mix of diet items (beef, beef rib, a commercial carnivore diet, chicken, mice, rats, turkey, and <b>turkey</b> <b>wings)</b> that was consistent throughout their molting period. Weekly diet composition {{was determined by the}} percentage of mass of each diet item and overall δ 13 C and δ 15 N values were calculated for each animal's diet. The mean Δ 13 C and Δ 15 N values (± SD) between felid fur and their non-lipid-extracted diets were 1. 1 ‰ ± 0. 2 ‰ and 3. 5 ‰ ± 0. 0 ‰, respectively (African lion, n = 1 animal sampled at 2 intervals); 5. 5 ‰ ± 0. 5 ‰ and 4. 1 ‰ ± 0. 1 ‰, respectively (bobcats, n = 3); 2. 4 ‰ and 3. 3 ‰, respectively (Canada lynx, n = 1); and 4. 7 ‰ ± 0. 6 ‰ and 4. 5 ‰ ± 0. 2 ‰, respectively (mountain lions, n = 2). Variations in Δ 13 C and Δ 15 N values among species were likely due to dietary differences and we recommend the use of the Δ 13 C (5. 5 ± 0. 5) and Δ 15 N (4. 1 ± 0. 1) values obtained from the bobcats for future determinations of wild felid foraging ecology as they were held on diets composed of 100 % whole animals and animal parts, which best reflects diets of wild felids. © 2014 American Society of Mammalogists...|$|E

40|$|Beds of the Atlantic {{pearl oyster}} (Pinctada imbricata) and the <b>turkey</b> <b>wing</b> (Arca zebra) of {{contrasting}} population densities were evaluated {{to determine the}} occurrence of associated decapod crustaceans. In these beds at Cubagua Island, Venezuela, we recorded 40 decapod species belonging to 18 families. Mithraculus forceps (Majidae), Pilumnus caribaeus (Pilumnidae), Cuapetes americanus (Palaemonidae) and Petrolisthes galathinus (Porcellanidae) were the most common species found in these assemblages. The medium- and high-density bivalve beds exhibited more species and a greater abundance of associated decapods than the low-density bivalve beds, and more taxonomic distinctness. Multivariate analysis detected different groups of decapods in the low-density beds and the medium- to high-density beds. Additionally, similarities {{were found in the}} communities of crustaceans in the beds of Atlantic pearl oysters and <b>turkey</b> <b>wing,</b> demonstrating that bed density is important for the composition of associated fauna...|$|R
50|$|The dish is {{also common}} in French-speaking parts of Louisiana, {{particularly}} the Cajun areas of Southern Louisiana and New Orleans; they {{were introduced to}} New Orleans by Donat Pucheu. Only the upper joint of the hind leg is served, which has a single bone similar to the upper joint of a chicken or <b>turkey</b> <b>wing.</b> They are commonly prepared by frying or deep frying, sometimes being breaded prior.|$|R

5000|$|While {{overseeing}} the store, Warren {{learned that his}} female clientele were unsatisfied with their whalebone corsets, which became brittle and stiff over time. During a trip to Chicago, Illinois, Warren visited a feather duster manufacturer and observed that the company discarded certain <b>turkey</b> <b>wing</b> feathers. These feathers were unsuitable for use in feather dusters, but were strong and pliable. By removing the plumage from these feathers, Warren was able to identify a substitute for whalebone. Warren experimented with developing a corset for a year before perfecting a design. A patent for [...] "featherbone" [...] was approved on October 3, 1883.|$|R
60|$|To make a hard story soft, Merriam {{did meet}} her and propose to her. He found {{her to be}} a woman in black with hair the colour of a bronze <b>turkey's</b> <b>wings,</b> and mysterious, remembering eyes that--well, that looked as if she might have been a trained nurse looking on when Eve was created. Her words and manner, though, were translucent, as Bibb had said. She spoke, vaguely, of friends in California and some of the lower parishes in Louisiana. The {{tropical}} climate and indolent life suited her; she had thought of buying an orange grove later on; La Paz, all in all, charmed her.|$|R

Before I could come to his rescue, he had managed to stick the flypaper on his little dog’s back. In no time at all, the pup had dashed around the room, {{attaching}} himself to first one object, then another. The situation was funny to everybody but Blue Horse. 'Bad Medicine,' he said in disgust.” ...|$|R
50|$|Under the {{management}} of Parker and Steiner, the deli became known nationwide, attracting celebrities such as Woody Allen, Jackie Mason and Henny Youngman, and opened branch locations in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Secaucus, New Jersey; and Tysons Corner, Virginia.

5000|$|Edward K. Warren {{arrived in}} Three Oaks in 1858 {{and opened a}} dry goods store. As a dry goods proprietor, he was {{familiar}} with complaints about {{the fragility of the}} then-common whalebone stays used in women's dresses. He also frequented the Chicago Feather Duster Company to purchase goods. It was there that he found out that the company disposed of <b>turkey</b> <b>wing</b> feathers as being too stiff to use in a feather duster. Warren eventually realized that stiff feather quills might make a suitable replacement for whalebone stays, and after some experimentation perfected a product which he christened the [...] "featherbone." [...] He opened the Warren Featherbone Company in 1883 to manufacture his new stays, and the product was an immediate success.|$|R
60|$|Here he sat down, {{just beyond}} {{the edge of a}} canyon, and began to call with his <b>turkey</b> <b>wing.</b> It thrilled him to hear his calls {{answered}} on all sides. Here was a wonderful opportunity. He realized that the turkeys were mostly young and scattered, and frightened, and wanted to come together. He kept calling, and as they neared him on all sides he felt something more than the zest of hunting. Suddenly Copple began to shoot. Spang! Spang! Spang! R.C. saw the dust fly under one turkey. He heard the bullet glance. The next shot killed a turkey. Then R.C. yelled that he was no turkey! Then of that scattering flock he managed to knock over one for himself.|$|R
50|$|The male {{usually has}} much more {{extensive}} pigmentation on the wings than other Calopteryx species in its range: in the south east of its range (the Balkans and <b>Turkey)</b> the <b>wings</b> are entirely metallic blue while in other areas, there are clear areas at the base and tip of the wing. Immature insects often have much paler, browner wings. They have metallic blue-green bodies and blue-green eyes.|$|R

50|$|Most {{common in}} the Florida peninsula, they number from 80,000 to 100,000 birds. This bird is named for the famous Seminole leader Osceola, and was first {{described}} in 1890. It is smaller and darker than the eastern wild <b>turkey.</b> The <b>wing</b> feathers are very dark with smaller amounts of the white barring seen on other subspecies. Their overall body feathers are an iridescent green-purple color. They are often found in scrub patches of palmetto and occasionally near swamps, where amphibian prey is abundant. Osceola turkeys are the smallest subspecies weighing 16 to 18 pounds.|$|R
40|$|Deep fat frying {{began in}} the {{southern}} part of the United States and has gradually spread nationwide. Turkeys are the most common food prepared by this method. However, chicken, <b>turkey</b> parts (breasts, <b>wings</b> and thighs), and Cornish game hens may be deep fat fried. Deep fat frying results in a juicy product because the hot fat seals the outside and the skin becomes crisp. This NebFact talks about the equipment, ingredients, preparation, frying, and safety of deep fat frying turkeys and other poultry...|$|R
50|$|Dave's Hoppers {{are usually}} tied on 2X or 3X long dry fly hooks {{such as the}} TMC 200R and uses red deer hair for the tail. The body was {{originally}} tied with yellow wool yarn, but more modern examples use yellow synthetic yarn for better flotation. The body is ribbed with a brown rooster neck hackle. The wing is created from a section of mottled <b>turkey</b> tail or <b>wing</b> feather. The head and collar are created with spun and clipped natural deer hair. Legs are simulated with a yellow grizzly hackle stem that is knotted to resemble the large rear legs most hoppers have.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT For 18 mo, torn, hen, and broiler turkeys {{processed}} {{in a single}} abattoir were observed for carcass defects resulting in downgrading. Samples of 100 turkeys per truckload {{were used to determine}} the proportion of <b>turkeys</b> requiring <b>wing</b> trim, half wing trim, and trimming for bruised drums, breast blisters, or breast buttons, leg, breast, or back scratches, and leg edema. Bird type (hen, torn, or broiler), truck, time on truck, farm of origin, and trimrning of toenails and spurs were also noted. Multiple least squares linear regression was used to assess the associations among truck, time on truck, space per bird on truck, toenail trimming, spur clipping, and proportions of truckloads of turkeys with carcass defects. The effect of farm and bird type were adjusted for in regression models. Overall, downgrading was observed to be a significant problem in turkey production and processing. Among toms, hens, and broilers there were sub-stantial differences in the rates of bruised drums, breast buttons or blisters, back and leg scratches, and leg edema. Toenail trimrning was associated with reduced breast and leg scratches and spur clipping was associated with reduced back scratches. Increased time birds were held on trucks was associated with increased half wing trim and bruised drums. Few associations were observed among downgrading defects, the various trucks used during the study, and space available to birds on trucks...|$|R
