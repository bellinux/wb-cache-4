5|$|In 1991 Berlin's public {{prosecution}} department rendered {{this incident}} assistance in emergency and self-defence in {{consequence of the}} police officer stating that he felt his life being threatened. In many cases West Berliner rescuers {{were not able to}} reach wounded persons because they were either on GDR territory or in East Berlin. They had no authorization to set foot into this territory, so that a trespassing would have been life-endangering for the rescue workers. The four children Çetin Mert, Cengaver Katrancı, Siegfried Kroboth and Giuseppe Savoca, who fell into the Spree at the Gröben riverside between the years 1972 and 1975, could not be rescued even though West Berlin rescue forces arrived quickly on site. In April 1983 the transit passenger Rudolf Burkert {{died of a heart attack}} during an interrogation at the border checkpoint Derwitz. During a subsequent autopsy in West Germany several external injuries were detected, so that an external forceful impact could not be ruled out as the cause of death. This lethal incident resulted not only in negative press reports but also led to an intervention by Helmut Kohl and Franz Josef Strauss. For the imminent public-sector loans they imposed on the GDR the condition to conduct humane border controls. Two further deaths of West Germans in <b>transit</b> <b>traffic,</b> shortly after Burkert's death, set off demonstrations against the GDR regime and a broad media discussion. In the period that followed inspections decreased in <b>transit</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Further {{construction}} of the motorway was suspended by {{the onset of the}} Croatian War of Independence. In October 1991, a part of the motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška became inaccessible to the government of the Republic of Croatia due to military occupation of the area by the forces of the so-called SAO Western Slavonia. Consequently, the NovskaNova Gradiška section was closed to all traffic. On December 21, 1994, negotiations led to the reopening of that section for <b>transit</b> <b>traffic.</b> However, the section remained unsafe for use as intermittent violence continued until May 1995, when the area was overrun by the Croatian army. Inspection of the motorway section carried out at the time revealed damage to a viaduct carrying the motorway over the ZagrebSisakVinkovci railroad and a local road near Novska. Besides the overall lack of maintenance during the period, the pavement and a number of flyovers were damaged by artillery bombardments, and the flyover approach embankments were damaged where trenches were dug.|$|E
5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at the Ivanja Reka {{mainline}} toll plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In such conditions, motorway users {{are advised to}} use the Rugvica and Ivanić Grad exits ahead of the Ivanja Reka interchange to avoid the queues. As of October 2010, the westbound <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> approaching the Ivanja Reka interchange must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to {{be integrated into the}} tolled motorway network as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Ivanja Reka toll plaza. That will require reconstruction of the Ivanić Grad interchange east of the Ivanja Reka toll plaza.|$|E

25|$|The city centre, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the pentagon, is surrounded by an inner ring road, the Small Ring (French: Petite Ceinture, Dutch: Kleine Ring), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered R20 or N0. These were built upon {{the site of the}} second set of city walls following their demolition. The metro line 2 runs under much of these. Since June 2015, a number of central boulevards inside the pentagon have become car-free, limiting <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> through the old city.|$|E

500|$|The {{motorway}} spans [...] {{between the}} Bregana border crossing, located near Samobor, to Slovenia and the Bajakovo border crossing to Serbia, east of Županja.

The route serves Sisak via the D36; Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina via the D5 and Stara Gradiška border crossing; Osijek via the A5; and Vinkovci via the D55. The A3 motorway route is complete since no extensions or alterations to the route are planned by applicable legislation.|$|E
500|$|The route between Bobovica and Ivanja Reka {{interchanges}} (inclusive) {{serves as}} a part of Zagreb bypass, and it is therefore not tolled. The A3 section of the bypass also comprises junctions to a number of other motorways: the A1 at the Lučko interchange, the A2 at the Jankomir interchange, the A11 motorway at the Jakuševec interchange, and the A4 at the Ivanja Reka interchange. Two interchanges east of Zagreb, Rugvica and Križ, have recently been built to fill in [...] gaps between the Ivanja Reka, Ivanić-Grad and Popovača interchanges, respectively. Even though the sections east of Rugvica are not parts of Zagreb bypass proper (they are tolled), the area has recently shown a rise in the population as it comprises several Zagreb suburbs and commuter towns. The consequent increase of commuter traffic volume, overall increase of the motorway <b>transit</b> <b>traffic</b> and plans for construction of a Sava River port in Rugvica warranted construction of the additional interchanges.|$|E

2500|$|Up until 1890, {{the south}} east of Switzerland was {{extremely}} poorly served by railways.

[...] Only the success of the Landquart-Davos-Bahn (LD) led to a turning point. In 1895, the LD changed its name to Rhaetian Railway (RhB). [...] Two years later, the people of Graubünden decided, in a referendum, that the RhB would come under state ownership. [...] These two changes created suitable conditions for a rapid construction of further RhB lines, which were intended to open up large parts of the Canton.|$|E

[...] Ribbentrop suggested that the Soviet Union should relinquish the oil district of Drohobycz and Boryslaw to Germany because Russia possessed rich oil resources while Germany lacked them. Stalin rejected this, but promised Germany the district's entire annual production, amounting today to 300,000 tons, but which he hoped would increase to 500,000 tons. [...] In return for this, Germany would supply coal and steel tubing. [...] Molotov summarized the results of the negotiations in a letter stating [...] "I have the honor to confirm herewith that the Government of the USSR is willing, on the basis and {{in the sense of the}} general political understanding reached by us, to promote by all means the trade relations and the exchange of goods between Germany and the USSR.

25|$|Dumfries is a {{relatively}} prosperous community but the town centre has {{been exposed to the}} centrifugal forces that have seen retail, business, educational, residential and other uses gravitate towards the town's urban fringe. This was started in the 1980s with the building of the Dumfries bypass. The immediate effect of this was as intended the diversion of <b>transiting</b> <b>traffic</b> away from the town centre. This brought with it an accompanying reduction in economic input to the town centre. The second effect of this has been more pronounced. Sites close to the bypass have attracted development to utilise the bypass as a high speed urban highway without the bottlenecks of the town centre and without the constraining limited town centre parking.|$|R
