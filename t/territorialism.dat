5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s {{there were a}} number of {{resettlement}} plans for European Jews that were precursors to the Madagascar Plan. Paul de Lagarde, an Orientalist scholar, first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften ("German Writings"). Members of the Zionist movement in 1904–1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme, by which Russian Jews, who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms, would be settled in what today is Kenya. The plan was later rejected as unworkable by the Zionist Congress. Adherents of <b>territorialism</b> split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state, or at least an autonomous area. The idea of Jewish resettlement in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese, and others. With the cooperation of the French, the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of deporting Polish Jews to the island. The head of the commission, , felt the island could accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 families, but Jewish members of the group estimated that only 500 or even fewer families could safely be accommodated.|$|E

2500|$|The fickle {{nature of}} {{weather and the}} ocean, plus the great desire for the best {{possible}} types of waves for surfing, make surfers dependent on weather conditions that may change rapidly. The staff of Surfer Magazine, founded in the 1960s when surfing had gained popularity with teenagers, {{used to say that}} if they were hard at work and someone yelled [...] "Surf's up!" [...] the office would suddenly be empty. Also, since surfing has a restricted geographical necessity (i.e. the coast), the culture of beach life often influenced surfers and vice versa. Localism or <b>territorialism</b> {{is a part of the}} development of surf culture in which individuals or groups of surfers designate certain key surfing spots as their own.|$|E
2500|$|Even though waves break {{everywhere}} along a coast, good surf {{spots are}} rare. A surf break that forms great surfable waves may easily become a coveted commodity, {{especially if the}} wave only breaks there rarely. If this break is near a large population center with many surfers, <b>territorialism</b> often arises. Regular surfers who live around a desirable surf break may often guard it jealously, hence the expression [...] "locals only." [...] The expression [...] "locals only" [...] is common among beach towns, especially those that are seasonally encroached upon by vacationers who live outside the area. Localism is expressed when surfers are involved in verbal or physical threats or abuse to deter people from surfing at certain surf spots. It is {{based in part on}} the belief that fewer people mean more waves per surfer.|$|E
2500|$|The report {{recognized}} that the nation's ability to collect and disseminate scientific intelligence was unsatisfactory. At {{the time of the}} task force’s activities, the responsibility for scientific intelligence was scattered throughout the community. [...] Some in the intelligence community such as the State Department and Defense Department were known for their <b>territorialism</b> over the responsibility. Another common problem for the CIA {{and the rest of the}} community was finding quality scientists willing to forgo a higher salary and name recognition to serve the scientific needs of the intelligence community. Due to these problems, the report encouraged the Central Intelligence Agency and the Research and Development Board to assign a specific entity “to collect, collate, and evaluate scientific and medical intelligence, in order that our present glaring deficiencies in this field be promptly eliminated.” This central authority for collecting and disseminating scientific intelligence would have included developing fields such as biological and chemical weapons, electronics, aerodynamics, and missile technology. While medical intelligence was relatively underdeveloped and responsibility was shared among several agencies, cooperation in that area between agencies was expected to increase. These recommendations were deemed necessary due to bureaucratic restraints which prevented the Scientific Branch of the CIA from effectively executing its function.|$|E
2500|$|These surfers {{are often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "surf punks" [...] or [...] "surf nazis." [...] The local surfer gangs in Malibu and on Hawaii, known as da hui, have been known to threaten tourists with physical violence for invading their territory. In Southern California, at the Venice and Santa Monica beaches, local surfers are especially hostile to the surfers from the San Fernando Valley whom they dub [...] "vallies" [...] or [...] "valley kooks". The expression [...] "Surf Nazi" [...] arose in the 1960s to describe territorial, authoritarian, aggressive, and obsessive surfers, often involved in surf gangs or surf clubs. The term [...] "Nazi" [...] was originally used simply to denote the strict <b>territorialism,</b> violence and hostility to outsiders, and absolute obsession with surfing that was characteristic in the so-called [...] "surf nazis." [...] However, some surfers reclaimed and accepted the term, and a few actually embraced Nazism or Nazi symbolism. Some surf clubs in the 1960s, particularly at Windansea in La Jolla, embraced the term by using the swastika symbol on their boards and identified with Nazism as a counterculture (though this may have just been an effort to keep out or scare non-locals and may have been a tongue-in-cheek embrace of the [...] "surf nazi" [...] label as a form of rebellion). The [...] "locals only" [...] attitude and protectionism of the Santa Monica surf spots in the early 1970s was depicted in the movie Lords of Dogtown, which was based on the documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys.|$|E

50|$|Functionalism is {{a pioneer}} in {{globalisation}} theory and strategy. States had built authority structures upon a principle of <b>territorialism.</b> State-theories were built upon assumptions that identified the scope of authority with territory (Held 1996, Scholte: 1993, 2000, 2001), aided by methodological <b>territorialism</b> (Scholte 1993). Functionalism proposed to build a form of authority based in functions and needs, which linked authority with needs, scientific knowledge, expertise and technology, i.e. it provided a supraterritorial concept of authority. The functionalist approach excludes and refutes the idea of state power and political influence (realist approach) in interpreting the cause for such proliferation of international organizations during the inter-war (which was characterized by nation-state conflict) and the subsequent years.|$|E

50|$|<b>Territorialism</b> may {{favor the}} {{evolution}} of island gigantism. A study on Anaho Island in Nevada determined that reptile species that were territorial tended to be larger on the island compared to the mainland, particularly in the smaller species. In territorial species, larger size makes individuals better able to compete to defend their territory. This gives additional impetus to evolution toward larger size in an insular population.|$|E
50|$|As Zionism grew in {{strength}} {{as a political}} movement, socialist Zionist parties were formed, such as Ber Borochov's Poale Zion. There were non-Zionist left-wing forms of Jewish nationalism, such as <b>territorialism</b> (which called for a Jewish national homeland, but not necessarily in Palestine), autonomism (which called for non-territorial national rights for Jews in multinational empires) and the folkism, advocated by Simon Dubnow, (which celebrated the Jewish culture of the Yiddish-speaking masses).|$|E

50|$|One {{effect of}} the large feral {{population}} is a high and rising level of dog attacks on humans. In 2007 official statistics suggest that 20,000 attacks took place, of which 8,000 were sufficiently serious to require police or medical intervention {{and at least one}} being fatal. In part, the problem is traced to status dogs that are abandoned when they become troublesome, and in part due to those dogs living in forested areas that are poorly socialized and more prone to aggressive <b>territorialism.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Mating seasons {{are often}} {{associated}} with changes to herd or group structure, and behavioural changes, including <b>territorialism</b> amongst individuals. These may be annual (e.g. wolves), biannual (e.g. dogs) or more frequently (e.g. horses). During these periods, females of most mammalian species are more mentally and physically receptive to sexual advances, a period scientifically described as estrous but commonly described as being [...] "in season" [...] or [...] "in heat".

50|$|The Jewish Territorial Organisation, {{known as}} the ITO, was a Jewish {{political}} movement which first arose in 1903 {{in response to the}} British Uganda Offer, but which was institutionalized in 1905. Its main goal was to find an alternative territory to that of the Land of Israel, which was preferred by the Zionist movement, {{for the creation of a}} Jewish homeland. The organization embraced what became known as Jewish <b>Territorialism</b> also known as Jewish Statism (though not to be confused with the political philosophy of the same name). The ITO was dissolved in 1925.|$|E
5000|$|Neo{{functional}}ism reintroduced <b>territorialism</b> in {{the functional}} theory and downplayed its global dimension. Neofunctionalism is simultaneously a theory and {{a strategy of}} regional integration, building {{on the work of}} David Mitrany. Neofunctionalists focused their attention solely on the immediate process of integration among states, i.e. regional integration. Initially, states integrate in limited functional or economic areas. Thereafter, partially integrated states experience increasing momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas. This [...] "invisible hand" [...] of integration phenomenon was termed [...] "spill-over." [...] by the neofunctionalist school. This was most apparent in the study of euthanasia. Although integration can be resisted, it becomes harder to stop integration's reach as it progresses.|$|E

50|$|Wells {{had given}} some moderate, unenthusiastic support for <b>Territorialism</b> before the First World War, but {{later became a}} bitter {{opponent}} of the Zionist movement in general. He saw Zionism as an exclusive and separatist movement which challenged the collective solidarity he advocated in his vision of a world state. No supporter of Jewish identity in general, Wells had in his utopian writings predicted the ultimate assimilation of the Jewish people.

When the sentient Wraith were discovered by the Ancients, it appears their ferocity, belligerence and large population were underestimated. The Ancients sent a delegation protected by their most powerful warships to negotiate with the Wraith, but the ships were ambushed and destroyed. The Ancients and Wraith went to war, and despite the Ancients' technological superiority, the Wraith overwhelmed the Ancients with their sheer numbers. During their war which lasted for centuries, the Wraith eventually conquered every planet in the Pegasus Galaxy until only Atlantis, the capital of their empire, remained protected by its powerful city shield.|$|E
50|$|The {{crab-eating fox}} creates monogamic teams for hunting; groups of several monogamic pairs may form during the {{reproductive}} season. The population distribution is as follows: some explorers show one individual distribution for 4 km2. Berta (1982) shows one had changed from 0,6 to 0,9 km2 for one individual. <b>Territorialism</b> was noticed {{during the dry}} season; during rainy seasons, when there is more food, they pay less attention to territory (Nowak, 1999). Hideouts and dens often are found in bushes and in thick grass, and there are typically multiple entrance holes per den. Despite being capable of tunnelling, they prefer to take over other animals' burrows. Hunting methods are adapted to type of prey. Several characteristic sounds are made by the crab-eating fox such as barking, whirring and howling, which occur often when pairs lose contact with one another.|$|E
