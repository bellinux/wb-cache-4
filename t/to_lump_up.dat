40|$|The {{topographic}} {{characteristics of}} a basin have great influence on runoff processes. If a lumped runoff model {{that takes into account}} the topographic {{characteristics of a}} basin can simulate runoff processes as exactly as and faster than a distributed runoff model, the former will be very useful. This paper describes a method <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> and scale <b>up</b> a distributed runoff model taking into account the topographic characteristics and shows the results of its application. In our method, we investigate distributed nature of topographic characteristics in a basin using the Basin Geomorphic Information System (BGIS), and lump slope systems using the cluster analysis technique. We also make a lumped stream network model on the assumption that stream discharge varies linearly along each stream segment at individual moment...|$|R

An {{example of the}} former is the mixing granulated sugar into water; {{an example of the}} latter is the mixing of flour or powdered milk into water. In the first case, the particles can be lifted into suspension (and separated from one another) by bulk motion of the fluid; in the second, the mixer itself (or the high shear field near it) must destabilize the lumps and cause them to disintegrate.|$|R

Clay type soil prevails among the filled soils in North-western Bohemia. As {{a consequence of}} the character and state of the soil, together with the mining and dumping technology, a typical lumpy structure of the clay fill is formed. The filled lumps range in size and vary in mechanical properties, but stiff <b>to</b> solid <b>lumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 0. 5 m in size are prevalent. Large and open macrovoids between the single lumps are a characteristic feature of the clay fills. Clay fills exhibit a double porosity structure, consisting of intergranular porosity between the lumps and intragranular porosity inside them. The total porosity of the freshly filled soils can reach 70 %. This type of clay fill structure is metastable. This thesis focuses on the problematic behaviour of clay fill soils due to their metastable structure and their partly saturated state. Long-term monitoring of matric suction at depths up to 2 metres in two reclaimed clay fills revealed two different trends. Seasonally-dependent suction oscillations were recorded in the moderate slope of the clay fill in the Bílina mine, while no suction pointing to fully saturated conditions was [...] ...|$|R

The reduction of chemical kinetics is performed {{on the basis of}} a timescale analysis and of lumping. Lumping techniques are widely used in air pollution modeling and consist of replacing some pure chemical species by linear combinations of species. We focus here on the theoretical justification of such techniques. We propose an algorithm in order <b>to</b> build <b>up</b> <b>lumped</b> species in a systematic way. An application to three kinetic schemes coupled with diffusion is presented in a monodimensional case. This justifies the way we couple a reduced kinetic scheme with other processes...|$|R

Together with the fork it forms {{one of the}} chief {{implements}} wielded by the hand in agriculture and horticulture. It is sometimes considered a type of shovel. Its typical shape is a broad flat blade with a sharp lower edge, straight or curved. The upper edge {{on either side of the}} handle affords space for the user's foot, which drives it into the ground. The wooden handle ends in a cross-piece, sometimes T-shaped and sometimes forming a kind of loop for the hand.|$|R
40|$|Manual {{palpation}} {{is commonly}} used to localize tumors and other features buried deep inside organs during open surgery. This approach is not feasible in minimally invasive or robotic surgery, as the contact with the tissue is mediated by instruments. To address this problem, we propose a soft robotic skin (SRS) that can be deployed from a small incision and create a stiffness map in a single step. Such a skin is composed of a matrix of soft robotic tactile elements (SRTEs), each one able to expand and record the tissue response during expansion. In this paper, we firstly prove the feasibility of palpation using a single SRTE. Then, we present and test a soft-suction based anchoring mechanism {{able to keep the}} SRS in the desired position in contact with the tissue, allowing surgeons to palpate different sides of the organ. Finally, we detail a calibration method for the SRTE, and assess the feasibility of identifying lumps buried inside a soft tissue phantom, and then inside a chicken liver during an ex-vivo trial. Experimental results show that the SRTE was able <b>to</b> differentiate simulated <b>lumps</b> (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> 3. 25 mm deep) from healthy tissue in both the phantom and the ex-vivo trials. These results, added to the ability of the suction gripper to compensate for the expansion forces of each SRTE, are paving the way for soft robotic autonomous tools {{that can be used for}} intraoperative mapping of tissue cancers...|$|R

40|$|For practitioners, the Cost-Average {{phenomenon}} {{is part of}} the basic knowledge concerning investment theory. The core effect lies within the possibility to achieve in average a lower acquisition cost compared to the average price of the stock or investment fund. With the regu-lar investment of equal amounts, more shares can be bought, when prices are low and less share are bought, when prices are high. Above this, many practitioners attribute increased significance to the Cost-Average phenomenon, by deducing that savings plans, compared <b>to</b> a <b>lump</b> sum investments, in general reduce the timing risk. In this paper, we theoretically check this rather intuitive conclusion. The main focus is on a specific analysis of risk- and return consequences of investment plans compared <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> sum investments. We find that regarding both the terminal value and the shortfall-probability regarding a nominal capital maintenance investment plans are inferior <b>to</b> <b>lump</b> sum investments.

If Gyroscopic effect of disc is only considered, off diagonal skew symmetric terms appear at limited degrees of freedom. However, if gyroscopic effect of shaft is also considered, the off diagonal skew symmetric terms are present throughout. Use of complex co-ordinates diagonalizes the skew symmetric terms due to discs only. However, if distributed gyroscopic effect of shaft is considered, the Gyroscopic matrix becomes symmetric but non-diagonal.
