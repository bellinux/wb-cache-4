The Sixth Avenue Line would also be {{connected}} to the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges. The connection between the Nassau Street Line and the Manhattan Bridge south tracks would be eliminated. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> thirty additional trains to operate between Midtown Manhattan and Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC {{also has}} a system for giving codes to {{identify}} amino acids and nucleotide bases. IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> these sequences to be compared {{to try to find}} homologies. These codes can consist of either a one letter code or a three letter code.|$|E
5|$|The {{line would}} have a track {{connection}} to the IRT Pelham Line at Third Avenue–138th Street {{and there would be}} a branch terminating at Third Avenue–149th Street to permit a transfer to the Third Avenue Elevated in the Bronx. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> the elimination of the Third Avenue Elevated south of 149th Street.|$|E

5|$|As {{the project}} neared its conclusion, American {{planners}} began {{to consider the}} use of the bomb. Groves formed a committee that met in April and May 1945 to draw up a list of targets. One of the primary criteria was that the target cities must not have been damaged by conventional bombing. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> an accurate assessment of the damage done by the atomic bomb. The targeting committee's list included 18 Japanese cities. At {{the top of the list}} were Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. Ultimately, Kyoto was removed from the list at the insistence of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who had visited the city on his honeymoon and knew of its cultural and historical significance.|$|E

50|$|A {{deliberate}} {{decision to}} collocate research with operations led the National Severe Storms Forecast Center {{to move from}} Kansas City to Norman in 1997, changing {{its name to the}} Storm Prediction Center. <b>This</b> move <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> improved collaborations between NSSL and SPC.|$|R
50|$|Gaitán became {{leader of}} the Colombian Liberal Party in 1947, when his {{supporters}} gained {{the upper hand in}} the elections for seats in Congress. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> the Liberal Party to present a single candidate for the 1950 elections.|$|R

25|$|The {{constitutional}} language areas {{determine the}} official languages in their municipalities, {{as well as}} the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters. Although <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to merge both. Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} cut costs, Pihl {{recommended}} that the line be built using narrow gauge. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> smaller curve radii and cheaper construction. A major drawback was that the lines would not be compatible with Swedish lines and the Trunk Line. Aiding in his cause, {{it was at the}} time not believed that the lines would ever connect, as lakes and rivers were seen as complimentary to railways. Pihl opted for the 1067mm gauge, for which the Hamar–Grundset Line became the first locomotive-hauled system. It would soon become the most used narrow gauge in the world.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Hobart International Airport Pty Ltd {{announced}} detailed {{plans for}} the airport with a new 20-year master plan. Currently aircraft have to taxi along the runway and proceed to the parking apron via taxiways {{in the middle of}} the runway. This has both capacity and safety implications for the airport, as the runway cannot be used whilst an aircraft is taxiing. The plans provide for a parallel taxiway to the full length of runway. When complete, aircraft landing on the runway would proceed to the end of the runway and exit via the parallel taxiway. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> greater utilisation of the existing runway.|$|E
50|$|A {{major and}} unique {{advantage}} of the Inforex Key-to-Disk-to-Tape system allowed an operator to directly read, edit, and write back, any single tape record directly onto the original 9 track output tape, in that tape records' original position in the tape. <b>This</b> capacity <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> quick corrections to minor keying errors.|$|R

25|$|In the 2015–2034 MTA Twenty-Year Capital Needs Assessment, two {{possible}} Harlem Line projects {{that would provide}} capacity to deal with increasing ridership and to expand service are mentioned. The first is the extension of a third track from Crestwood north to North White Plains. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> increased reverse-peak service, increased local and express service-the same goals of the original third track project from Mount Vernon West to Crestwood. The second project would be {{the construction of a}} new flyover at Woodlawn at the junction with the New Haven Line. However, funding for these projects have not been identified as there are ongoing needs to maintain basic infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|The Diaspora {{population}} of Ireland {{also got a}} fresh start on the islands of New Zealand during the later half of the 19th century. The ideology of striking it rich in the gold mines caused many Irish people to flock to the docks; risking {{their lives on the}} long voyage to potential freedom and more importantly self-sufficiency. Most famous places including both Gabriel's Gully and Otago are examples of mining sites which, with the funding of large companies, allowed for the creation of wages and the appearance of mining towns. Women found jobs as housemaids cleaning the shacks of the single men at work thereby providing a second income to the Irish family household. The subsequent money accumulated with regards to <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> chain migration {{for the rest of the}} family left behind.|$|E
25|$|The {{system could}} either {{be built in}} isolation, and rely on {{transfer}} to train at Lysaker, or be built {{in connection with a}} metro. The latter would result in an underground section through Lysaker and a common transfer between the three modes at Lysaker. The metro line was proposed as a branch of the Kolsås Line from Åsjordet Station and with an intersection and transfer to the Lilleaker Line at Lilleaker. Almost the entire section of metro would be built in a tunnel. at Lysaker a metro alternative would give transfer at the same platform between the two modes, while a non-metro alternative would give a people mover station below the train station. By linking up to five cars into a train, each departure could have a capacity of 175 people. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> 5,600 passengers per hour. Initial reports regarded this as sufficient, but later reports found this to be insufficient. The system would require eleven trains.|$|E
5000|$|Elgin Motor Car Corporation {{was formed}} in 1916 by several {{executives}} from the Elgin Watch Company. The company {{was based on the}} former New Era Motor Car Company of Joliet. Upon being taken over, the erstwhile company was moved in its entirety to Elgin, where the new company had a 210,000 square foot factory waiting on 13 acres. [...] <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> room <b>for</b> future expansion.|$|R
5000|$|As France was researching image-searching, Germany was {{supposed}} to be advancing voice clip and sound media searches, with the intention of transcribing their content to text, and translating it to other languages, before they pulled out of the project. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> also <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> [...] "query sound clips" [...] following the paradigm of the [...] "query image" [...] mentioned above.|$|R
50|$|Following this, Section 11004 on “Inspections” {{provides}} provisions <b>allowing</b> <b>for</b> {{agents of}} the EPA to “enter… any establishment… where medical wastes are or have been generated” so as to conduct “monitoring”, “testing”, or to “obtain samples from any person.”. <b>This</b> process <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> the Agency to legally enter generating facilities {{for the purpose of}} determining if infectious agents and materials were being handled as prescribed by the EPA Administrator.|$|R
25|$|There are {{suggestions}} {{about a new}} larger border checkpoint to be built on the Norwegian side, as the current station has insufficient capacity to handle increased traffic, and the ground is not sufficiently stable to allow an expansion at the current site. Individual Norwegian police executives {{have called for a}} common border checkpoint located directly on the border line. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> a more cost-effective and less time-consuming operation. However, Norwegian and Russian legislation, as well as the Schengen Agreement, prohibit such an operation. The Parliament of Norway's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has taken initiative to introduce a 24-hour-a-day opening time at the crossing; this has been rejected by the local police district, who stated that nearly all trans-border traffic is persons and that there is hardly any demand for a night service. Estimates show that border traffic may increase to 400,000 crossings by the mid- to late 2010s. The demand for a larger station remains as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|Plans from 2011 {{have called}} for a new tunnel which runs from Majorstuen via Stortinget to Tøyen, but {{following}} a different route and with intermediate stations at Bislett, Hammersborg and Olaf Ryes plass, in the St. Hanshaugen and Grünerløkka boroughs north of the city center. Three of the lines would thus follow the existing tunnel to Stortinget and then switch to the new line, while the other three lines would follow the new tunnel to Stortinget and then run along the old tunnel onwards. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> a six-minute headway on all but two branches, and also allow the proposed Fornebu Line to Skøyen, Fornebu and Nesodden to be built as part of the metro. Ruter has stated that the current stations are located in the areas which the most people want to travel to, and that if a second tunnel should deviate from these areas, they would have to serve places which generate as much traffic as the current stations.|$|E
25|$|On November 21, 2016, the MTA {{requested}} that the Phase 2 project be entered into the Project Development phase under the Federal Transit Administration's New Starts program. On December 15, several elected officials for the area announced that they were seeking $6 billion of funding for Phase 2 of the line, including $2 billion from the federal government. These officials wished to secure funding from the presidential administration of Barack Obama before Obama's term ended on January 20, 2017. In their request for funding, they cited {{that they wanted to}} avoid an uncertain response from the administration of Donald Trump and start construction on Phase 2 as soon as possible. The FTA granted this request in late December 2016. Under the approved plan, the MTA would complete an environmental reevaluation by 2018, receive funding by 2020, and open Phase 2 between 2027 and 2029. On May 24, 2017, the MTA Board approved an amendment to the 2015–2019 Capital Program, and as part of it, the funding allocated to Phase 2 was increased by $700 million to a total of $1.735 billion. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>for</b> a near-term 30 percent match per Full Funding Grant Agreement process.|$|E
