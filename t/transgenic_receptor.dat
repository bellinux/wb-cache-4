40|$|AbstractIn mice, {{individual}} olfactory neurons express one of {{the thousand}} distinct olfactory receptor genes [1 – 3]. Neurons that express a given receptor converge on distinct loci in the olfactory bulb to form structures called glomeruli [4 – 6]. The olfactory receptor is involved in an instructive manner in this axonal convergence [6, 7] but {{little is known about}} the mechanisms involved in maintaining convergence. We have previously created a transgenic olfactory receptor locus that functions independently of the endogenous loci [8]. Here, we show that, although the projections of neurons expressing this ectopic transgenic olfactory receptor always converge in newborn mice, surprisingly, in adult mice, convergence is not always maintained. Moreover, in adult mice there is a positive correlation between the number of neurons expressing the <b>transgenic</b> <b>receptor</b> and the probability of maintaining convergence. These observations, taken together with the variability observed in wild-type [4, 6] and genetically manipulated mice ([6] and our unpublished observations), suggest that olfactory neurons require the presence of other similar axons to maintain a glomerulus.

In spite of functional cell-mediated immunity and high antiviral antibody titers, an immunological control of the CNS infection is not achieved in patients suffering from subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). The known cellular receptors for measle virus (MV) in humans, CD 46 and CD 150 (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule, SLAM), are important components of the viral tropism by mediating binding and entry to peripheral cells. Because neural cells do not express SLAM and only sporadically CD 46, virus entry to neural cells, and spread within the CNS, remain mechanistically unclear.

In mice that express a <b>transgenic</b> <b>receptor</b> specific for peptide 111 – 119 of influenza hemagglutinin presented by Ed class II MHC molecules as well as hemagglutinin under control of the immunoglobulin-κ promoter, {{we have found that}} anergic T cells [3] can also have immunoregulatory function and secrete IL- 10 [4]. In order to obtain information on molecular mechanisms involved in anergy and immunoregulation, we have compared expression levels of 1176 genes in anergic, naive, and recently activated CD 4 + T cells of the same specificity by gene array analysis. The results provide a plausible explanation for the anergic phenotype in terms of proliferation, provide new information on the surface phenotype of in vivo-generated anergic CD 4 + T cells, and yield clues with regard to new candidate genes that may be responsible for the restricted cytokine production of in vivo-anergized CD 4 + T cells. The molecular fingerprints of such T cells should enable the tracking of this small population in the normal organism and the study of their role in immunoregulation...|$|E

Murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells were subjected to electroporation with mRNA transcribed in vitro from a plasmid encoding lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein or enhanced green fluorescent protein {{under the control of}} a T 7 promotor. The transfection efficiency of dendritic cells was 22 to 40 %. Maturation was not inhibited by the electroporation.

This situation offers {{the opportunity to}} examine the outcome of γδ versus αβ T lineage commitment when only the TCRαβ is expressed.

40|$|T {{lymphocytes}} {{have been}} implicated in the onset of many autoimmune diseases; however, the mechanisms underlying T-cell activation toward self antigens are poorly understood. To study whether T-lymphocyte costimulation can overcome the immunologic unresponsiveness observed in an in vivo model, we have created transgenic mice expressing the costimulatory mouse molecule B 7 - 1, a ligand for the CD 28 receptor, on pancreatic beta cells. We now report that triple-transgenic mice expressing both B 7 - 1 and a viral glycoprotein on their beta cells, along with T cells expressing the viral-glycoprotein-specific <b>transgenic</b> T-cell <b>receptor,</b> all develop insulitis (lymphocytic infiltration of the pancreatic islets) and diabetes. In striking contrast, the T cells in double-transgenic mice expressing the same viral glycoprotein (but no B 7) on their pancreatic beta cells and the <b>transgenic</b> T-cell <b>receptor</b> on their T cells, reported earlier, remain indifferent to the glycoprotein-expressing beta cells. In fact, all three transgenes are required to initiate immune-mediated destruction of the beta cells. Mice expressing any of the transgenes alone, or any two in combination, maintain normal islet architecture and never spontaneously develop insulitis or diabetes. Our results show that aberrant B 7 expression on peripheral tissues may {{play an important role}} in the activation of self-reactive T cells and further suggest that abnormal expression of costimulatory receptors may be involved in various T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases...|$|R

40|$|Background: Bacterial DNA is {{well-known}} for its potent immunostimulatory properties {{which have been}} attributed to the abundance of CpG dinucleotides within the genomes of prokaryotes. Research has found that mammalian TLR 9 is a receptor which mediates the immune response to CpG DNA; however, its functional properties in non-mammalian vertebrates are still poorly characterized. Leukocytes isolated from lower vertebrates, including teleosts, respond to CpG DNA and TLR 9 has been identified in many fish species; however, the ligand-binding properties of fish TLR 9 have, so far, not been studied. The fact that some vertebrates, like chicken, lack TLR 9 and use an alternative molecule (TLR 21) as a receptor for CpGs has questioned the functional conservation of TLR 9 within vertebrates. Results: In the current study, TLR 9 from Atlantic salmon (SsTLR 9) has been found to interact with synthetic oligonucleotides via a CpG-independent but a pH-dependent mechanism. The endogenous receptor, expressed by primary mononuclear phagocytes colocalizes with CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) in vesicles that appear to be endosomes. When overexpressed in salmonid cell lines, SsTLR 9 spontaneously activates ISRE-containing promoters of genes involved in the IFN response; however, the <b>transgenic</b> <b>receptor</b> fails to translocate to CpG-containing endosomes. This indicates that only specific immune cell types have the ability to relocate the receptor to the appropriate cellular compartments where it may become activated by its ligand. In addition, through co-precipitation and mass spectrometry, two salmon proteins - hnRNPA 0 and NCOA 5, which both contain RNA-binding domains (RRM), were found to bind CpG ODNs, suggesting they may be involved in the CpG response in salmon leukocytes. Conclusion: The presented data are the first to demonstrate that the DNA-binding properties of TLR 9 are conserved between teleosts and mammals. The current study also identifies additional molecules which may function as mediators of the immunostimulatory properties of foreign DNA...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to analyze}} the pathopysiological role of the human ETBR in relation to blood pressure and blood vessel wall structure in a rat model. In order to achieve this, an already established transgenic rat model of the human ETBR receptor {{under the control of}} a VSMC specific promoter (derived from the murine SM 22 α gene) was used. Two transgenic rat lines (4230 and 6707) from this model were further analyzed. Previous experiments showed an expression of the transgenic ETBR in various organs and isolated blood vessels for both lines. Blood pressure was measured using radio telemetry over a period of one month to establish whether or not the co-expression of ETB could have a possible effect on the blood pressure. At the commencement of the measurements, the rats were 14 weeks of age. When comparing the baseline blood pressure parameters (systolic, mean, diastolic blood pressure) and heart rates of the transgenic rats and their non-transgenic littermates, no statistical significant differences were found. The treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME, prevented the vasodilation effect of NO. This resulted in an elevated blood pressure as well as a decreased heart rate. There were, however, no statistically significant differences between the transgenic and the non-transgenic animals. All parameters normalized to similar values once L-NAME was no longer administered. In order to identify the structural phenotypes, the thoracic aorta of each of the telemetry probed animals was analyzed using histomorphometry. This should have confirmed a possible variation of the media induced by the co-expression of the human ETBR. Upon removal of the vessels, all animals were 18 weeks old. The histological crosssections were digitally analyzed and the media-to-lumen ratio was measured by a specific computer program. The analysis resulted in a small but statistically significant reduction in the media-to-lumen ratio in the transgenic animals of L 4230 in comparison to the non-transgenic controls. In contrast, the media-to-lumen ratio of the transgenic rats of L 6707 was statistically significantly higher by trend in comparison to their non-transgenic controls. From the results, it can be concluded that the co-expression of the human ETBR in the transgenic rat model has no relevant blood-pressure related effects. The structural effect was very low und not consistent. The model’s validity is limited by the downregulation of the transgenic expression with increasing age of the animals as well as the low level of expression of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>receptor...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{analyzed}} genomic integration, transgenic-expression and adaptive transcriptional changes on RNA-basis in a transgenic (tg) rat model expressing the human Endothelin-A-receptor (ETAR). Therefore we used 5 different rat strands (L 6341, L 6351, L 6888, L 6353, L 6888) generated by pronuclear microinjection which expressed the human ETAR under control of murine sm- 22 alpha promoter for smooth muscle cell specific expression. Identification of transgenic animals {{was done by}} conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore we established a realtime PCR based assay for quantification of transgenic insertion. With this method we determined 8, 4 and 1 tg-copies in tg-heterozygote animals of L 6351, L 6888 and L 6878 respectively. Furthermore {{we were able to}} distinguish homozygote and heterozygote transgenic animals. On RNA level we analyzed the transgenic expression of human ETAR in selected organs and vessels with RT-PCR technique. Whereas in L 6341 no significant expression was determined, high expression was found in L 6878 and L 6351. In the other two lines moderate expression was found. Interestingly there was significant tg-expression in the organs of L 6878. For further discrimination we used Realtime-PCR to quantify RNA-expression of tg ETAR, endogenous ETAR und ETBR in mesenteric arteries and aorta of L 6878 and L 6351 in one month and one year old animals. Whereas in aortic RNA of one month old animals higher transgenic expression was found in L 6351, there was much higher transgenic expression in mesenteric RNA of L 6878 compared with L 6351. The <b>transgenic</b> <b>receptor</b> expression was nearly on the same level as the endogenous receptor expression. In one year old animals of both lines a downregulation of transgenic expression was recognized. Whereas by this time in L 6351 almost no RNA-expression was detectable, L 6878 still expressed significant levels of transgenic RNA. Interestingly in homozygote animals of L 6878 transgenic expression was doubled compared to heterozygote animals of the same line. Furthermore endogenous ETAR expression was significant diminished in aortic RNA of L 6878 in one year old animals. No expressional changes of endogenous ETBR-expression have been observed in any of the lines. Besides of described adoptions, one month old animals of both lines showed a higher alpha 1 B RNA expression in mesenteric arteries. In addition a higher expression of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK 2) was detected in transgenic animals. Furthermore a strong correlation between alpha 1 BR and GRK 2 RNA expression was recognized for transgenic and non-transgenic animals. These findings establish a basis for further phenotypic analysis of the transgenic rat model and provide possibilities for {{a deeper understanding of the}} ETAR function in vessels.

40|$|Estrogens greatly {{affect the}} {{activity}} and connectivity of serotonergic neural cell populations, which extend from clusters of nuclei in the brainstem, termed the raphe nuclei, where estrogen receptor β {{is the most}} abundantly expressed estrogen receptor subtype. Estrogenic effects on the raphe nuclei are primarily important for influencing various neuropsychological behaviors, including depression, mood swings and anxiety behaviors. Because of this connection, phases of intense hormone fluctuations for instance during menopause are often associated with several mood disturbances that often reduce {{the quality of life}} of menopausal women. Accordingly, long-term use of hormone replacement therapy appeared to be the method of choice for many menopausal women to help alleviate vasomotor symptoms, which may include neuropsychological changes such as depression. However, given the limitations and number of serious health risks attributed to hormone replacement therapy, natural compounds such as phytoestrogens are receiving widespread awareness due to their occurrence in medicinal plant extracts and a wide variety of food items including dietary supplements with respective health claims. Flavonoids, particularly the isoflavones and the naringenin-type flavanones, belong to a group of polyphenolic plant-derived secondary metabolites known to possess estrogen-like bioactivities. Nevertheless, little is known about their transactivational activity and their potential to regulate endogenous gene expression of estrogen responsive genes in the raphe nuclei due to the lack of suitable cellular models expressing sufficient amounts of functional estrogen receptor β. Hence, a raphe nuclei-derived cell line that expresses a functional estrogen receptor β was sought as a model to investigate effects of flavonoids in vitro. In this regard, RN 46 A-B 14 cells derived from embryonic day 13 rat medullary raphe nuclei were primarily used in this study as the main cellular model. Nonetheless, expression of endogenous estrogen receptor β in these cells was not sufficient to pursue downstream investigations of estrogen-dependent activities. To overcome this deficit, a rat raphe nuclei-derived in vitro model that overexpresses a functional estrogen receptor β was initially established (herein termed RNDA cells) by stably transducing its parent cell line, RN 46 A-B 14 cells, with a suitable lentiviral expression vector encoding a human estrogen receptor β gene. The stable expression and the functional characterization of the <b>transgenic</b> <b>receptor</b> was confirmed by Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter gene assays, respectively. The same reporter gene assay was used to scrutinize the transactivational activity of the flavonoids in RNDA cells. Key results revealed that Genistein, Daidzein, Equol, Naringenin and 8 -Prenylnaringenin demonstrated high transactivational activity in a concentration-dependent manner by stimulating luciferase expression from an estrogen responsive element-regulated reporter gene construct transiently transfected in RNDA cells. Low transactivational activity was observed in RNDA cells in response to increasing concentrations of 7 -(O-prenyl) naringenin- 4 '-acetate. However, no transactivational activity was noticed in response to 6 -(1, 1 -Dimethylallyl) naringenin in the studied cell model. All effects elicited by the flavonoids were antagonized by the pure estrogen receptor antagonist, Fulvestrant, indicating that all substances act by binding to and activating the transgenic ERβ. Additional effects were observed in RNDA cells in response to a co-treatment of 1 µM of either Genistein or Daidzein, but not Equol, with 10 nM 17 β-Estradiol. Slight antagonistic effects were observed in the same studied cell line when either 8 -Prenylnaringenin or 7 -(O-prenyl) naringenin- 4 '-acetate, but not Naringenin or 6 -(1, 1 -Dimethylallyl) naringenin, were co-added with 17 β-Estradiol. Results from the reporter gene assays were validated on the basis of regulation of mRNA expression of estrogen responsive genes following the global assessment of 17 β-Estradiol-induced gene expression in this cell line using a DNA microarray technique. Out of 212 estrogen-regulated genes with at least two-fold change of expression, six were selected according to specific features of estrogenic regulation of expression. The expression of the six selected 17 β-Estradiol-regulated genes was validated using quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The regulation of mRNA expression of the selected genes in response to the tested flavonoids was then investigated in RNDA cells. Additionally, because RNDA cells encode a temperature-sensitive mutant of the Simian Virus 40 large T-antigen, their neuronal differentiation is constitutive upon shifting them from conditions promoting proliferation (permissive temperature) to differentiation (non permissive temperature). Hence, the regulation of mRNA expression of the selected genes in response to the tested flavonoids was additionally investigated as RNDA cells differentiate. In RNDA cells grown under proliferative conditions, 17 β-Estradiol up-regulated mRNA expression of camello-like 5, sex determining region Y-box 18 and keratin type I cytoskeletal 19. Similar effects were observed in response to 8 -Prenylnaringenin, Genistein, Daidzein and Equol. In addition, 17 β-Estradiol down-regulated mRNA expression of neurofilament medium polypeptide and zinc finger DHHC-type containing 2. Similar effects were observed in response to 8 -Prenylnaringenin, Naringenin, Genistein, Daidzein and Equol. Yet, no effect was observed on the regulation of mRNA expression of solute carrier family 6 member 4 in response to 17 β-Estradiol or the flavonoids in RNDA cells grown under proliferative conditions. When RNDA cells were shifted to conditions promoting differentiation, changes in cell morphology, in mRNA expression levels and in responsiveness towards 17 β-Estradiol or the flavonoids were observed. These expression studies additionally highlighted some of the genes as indicator genes for RNDA cellular differentiation. The newly established RNDA cell line should prove useful to elucidate basic physiological properties of estrogen receptor β in the raphe nuclei. The present study should serve as the basis to help shed light on molecular and cellular mechanisms following the action of phytoestrogens, endocrine disruptors or other exogenous estrogen receptor ligands in neural cell populations, particularly the raphe nuclei, for further applications within the brain...|$|E
40|$|The type of cytokines {{produced}} during T cell responses determines susceptibility or resistance to many pathogens and influences {{the development of}} autoimmunity and allergy.

Significantly, expression of B 7. 1 or B 7. 2 without additional accessory molecules led to very high production of interleukin (IL) - 4, which contrasted with minimal IL- 4 production elicited by conventional antigen presenting cells (APC).

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{outcome of}} the traditional adoptive cancer immunotherapy approaches involving the administration of donor-derived immune effectors, expanded ex vivo, has not met expectations.

In addition, the host immune regulatory mechanisms and immune homeostasis mechanisms, such as activation-induced cell death (AICD), could further limit the clinical efficacy of the adoptively administered antitumor T cells. Since generation of a sufficiently large number of potent antitumor immune effectors for adoptive administration is critical for the clinical success of this approach, recent advances towards generating customized donor-specific antitumor-effector T cells by engrafting human peripheral blood-derived T cells with a tumor-associated antigen-specific <b>transgenic</b> T-cell <b>receptor</b> (TCR) are quite interesting.

40|$|One enigma in tumor {{immunology}} is why animals bearing malignant grafts can reject normal grafts that {{express the}} same nonself-antigen. An {{explanation for this}} phenomenon could be that different T cell clones react to the normal graft and the malignant cells, respectively, and only the tumor-reactive clonotypes may {{be affected by the}} growing tumor. To test this hypothesis, we used a T cell <b>receptor</b> <b>transgenic</b> mouse in which essentially all CD 8 � T cells are specific for a closely related set of self-peptides presented on the MHC class I molecule L d. We find that the tumor expressed L d in the T cell <b>receptor</b> <b>transgenic</b> mice but grew, while the L d-positive skin was rejected. Thus, despite an abundance of antigen-specific T cells, the malignant tissue grew while normal tissue expressing the same epitopes was rejected. Therefore, systemic T cell exhaustion or anergy was not responsible for the growth of the antigenic cancer cells. Expression of costimulatory molecules on the tumor cells after transfection and preimmunization by full-thickness skin grafts was required for rejection of a subsequent tumor challenge, but there was no detectable effect of active immunization once the tumor was established. Thus, the failure of established tumors to attract and activate tumor-specific T cells at the tumor site may be a major obstacle for preventive or therapeutic vaccination against antigenic cancer...|$|R
40|$|Designer T cells expressing <b>transgenic</b> T cell <b>receptors</b> (TCR) with anti-tumor {{specificity}} {{offer new}} treatment options for cancer patients. We developed a three phase procedure to identify T cells of high avidity {{based on the}} fact that T cells recognizing peptides presented by allogeneic MHC efficiently kill tumor cells. Autologous dendritic cells (DC) are co-transfected with ivt-RNA encoding an allogeneic MHC molecule and a selected antigen to allow them to express allogeneic MHC-peptide complexes that activate allo-restricted peptide-specific T cells. This approach provides great flexibility for obtaining high-avidity T cells as potential sources of TCR for adoptive T cell therapy...|$|R
40|$|Allelic {{exclusion}} at the T-cell receptor {{alpha chain}} locus is incomplete {{resulting in the}} generation of T cells that express two T-cell receptors. The potential involvement of such T cells in autoimmunity has been suggested [Padovan, E., Casorati, G., Dellabona, P., Meyer, S., Brockhaus, M. & Lanzavecchia, A. (1993) Science 262, 422 - 424; Heath, W. R. & Miller, J. F. A. P. (1993) J. Exp. Med. 178, 1807 - 1811]. Here we show that expression of a second T-cell receptor can rescue T cells with autospecific receptors from thymic deletion and allow their exit into the periphery. Dual receptor T cells, created by constitutive expression of two <b>transgenic</b> T-cell <b>receptors</b> on a Rag 1 -/- background, are tolerant to self by maintaining low levels of autospecific receptor, but selfreactive effector function (killing) can be induced through activation via the second receptor. This opens the possibility that T cells carrying two receptors in the periphery of normal individuals contain putatively autoreactive cells that could engage in autoimmune effector functions after recognition of an unrelated environmental antigen...|$|R
40|$|The <b>transgenic</b> T-cell <b>receptor</b> in mouse TEa CD 4 + {{lymphocytes}} recognizes an endogenous peptide, Eα 52 - 68, {{presented in}} the context of the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule I-Ab. In response to an optimal peptide concentration TEa cells enter the cell cycle and proliferate. However, a single exposure to high doses of the specific peptide diminished cell expansion upon subsequent restimulation. This hyporesponsive, or anergic, phenotype can still be detected after multiple restimulations indicating that the hyporesponsiveness persists despite cell division and it was inherited by daughter cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this hypoproliferative response is associated with high p 27 Kip 1 and cyclin E protein levels, and reduced intracellular interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) expression. Addition of exogenous IL- 2 was required to reset p 27 Kip 1 levels in the progeny derived from hyporesponsive TEa cells. Thus, we have established antigen dose-dependent induction of a reversible, inheritable (i. e. epigenetic) phenotype and we have identified at least three components of the network of interactions: p 27 Kip 1 cyclin E, and IL- 2 expression...|$|R
40|$|Using {{in vitro}} brain slices of {{hippocampus}} and cortex, neuronal oscillations {{in the frequency}} range of 30 – 80 [*]Hz (gamma frequency oscillations) can be induced {{by a number of}} pharmacological manipulations. The most routinely used is the bath application of the broad-spectrum glutamate receptor agonist, kainic acid. In the hippocampus, work using <b>transgenic</b> kainate <b>receptor</b> knockout mice have revealed information about the specific subunit composition of the kainate receptor implicated in the generation and maintenance of the gamma frequency oscillation. However, there is a paucity of such detail regarding gamma frequency oscillation in the cortex. Using specific pharmacological agonists and antagonists for the kainate receptor, we have set out to examine the contribution of kainate receptor subtypes to gamma frequency oscillation in the entorhinal cortex. The findings presented demonstrate that in contrast to the hippocampus, kainate receptors containing the GLUK 5 subunit are critically important for the generation and maintenance of gamma frequency oscillation in the entorhinal cortex. Future work will concentrate on determining the exact nature of the cellular expression of kainate receptors in the entorhinal cortex...|$|R
40|$|The adoptive {{transfer}} of lymphocytes expressing <b>transgenic</b> T-cell <b>receptors</b> (tgTCR) specific for a tumor-associated antigen is providing a new treatment option {{for patients with}} advanced cancer. This therapy {{can be used to}} treat not only leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors, but also life-threatening viral infections. 1 In these settings, successful immuno-therapy requires that antigen-specific TCR-engineered T cells with appropriate functional characteristics are transferred to patients to eliminate infected or trans-formed cells. In previous clinical studies, the {{adoptive transfer}} of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes specific for multiple tumor-associated antigens was shown to suc-cessfully control melanoma in numerous patients. 2 While overexpressed self-anti-gens, like p 53 and telomerase, are poten-tial targets for adoptive T-cell gene therapy against multiple types of tumors, negative selection in the thymus yields only low-avidity T cells in the peripheral reper-toire. 3 Thus, to obtain high-avidity T cells one must seek within a non-negatively selected T-cell repertoire, for example using foreign MHC-molecules to present High-quality and high-avidity T cell clones specific for tumor-associated antigens and how to find them susanne wilde 1 and Dolores J. schendel 1, 2,...|$|R
40|$|TCDD is {{a potent}} immunotoxicant that {{suppresses}} adaptive immunity by mechanisms that are not well defined. To gain insight {{at the level of}} the T cell, we used the DO 11. 10 <b>transgenic</b> T-cell <b>receptor</b> (TCR) mouse model in an adoptive transfer approach to characterize the influence of TCDD on the responsiveness of anti-gen-specific CD 41 T cells in vivo. Flow cytometry was used to track the response of the OVA-specific transgenic CD 41 T cells in syn-geneic recipients using an antibody specific for the transgenic TCR (KJ 1 - 26 [KJ]). Consistent with a previous report, exposure of the recipientmice toTCDD(15 mg/kg po) did not alter the initial expan-sion of the CD 41 KJ 1 T cells in the spleen following immunization with OVA but resulted in a significant decline in the number of cells present on and after day 4. The degree of decline was dependent on the dose of TCDD. On day 3 after OVA injection, a higher percent-age of the CD 41 KJ 1 T cells in the spleens of TCDD-treated mic...|$|R

The in vivo consequences and significance of this cleavage on Drosophila Notch signaling remain unclear and contradictory. We determined the cleavage site in Drosophila and examined its in vivo function by a <b>transgenic</b> analysis of <b>receptors</b> that cannot be cleaved. Our results demonstrate a correlation between loss of cleavage and loss of in vivo function of the Notch receptor, supporting the notion that S 1 cleavage is an in vivo mechanism of Notch signal control...|$|R

In this system, positive selection of CD 4 SP cells occurred only after the addition of exogenous peptide. Analysis of antigen analogs indicated an inverse relationship between the antigenicity for peripheral T cells and the concentration of peptide required for positive selection. These data are most consistent with an avidity (rather than an affinity) model of positive selection, in which ligand density and the affinity of T cell receptor act in concert to determine the fate of developing thymocytes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Streptozotocin (STZ) is {{the most}} widely used di-abetogenic agent in animal models of islet transplantation. However, the immunomodifying effects of STZ and the ensuing {{hyperglycemia}} on lymphocyte subsets, particularly on T regulatory cells (Tregs), remain poorly understood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—This study evaluated how STZ-induced diabetes affects adaptive immunity and the consequences thereof on allograft rejection in murine models of islet and skin transplantation. The respective toxicity of STZ and hyperglycemia on lymphocyte subsets was tested in vitro. The effect of hyperglycemia was assessed independently of STZ in vivo by the removal of transplanted syngeneic islets, using an insulin pump, and with rat insulin promoter diphtheria toxin <b>receptor</b> <b>transgenic</b> mice.
