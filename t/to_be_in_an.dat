5|$|Historians {{believe that}} as many as 256 {{soldiers}} of the First Maryland Regiment under Colonel William Smallwood fell in the battle, about two-thirds of the regiment. It is known that they were buried in a mass-grave, but the grave's exact location has been a mystery for 240 years. In 2012 Brooklyn historian and president of the Brooklyn Preservation Council, Robert Furman, stated that he had a strong suspicion of the location of the gravesite, believing it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> empty lot in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E

25|$|Australian ABC radio {{reported}} on September 24, 2008, that Armstrong would {{compete in the}} UCI Tour Down Under through Adelaide and surrounding areas in January 2009. UCI rules say a cyclist has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> anti-doping program for six months before an event, but UCI allowed Armstrong to compete. He had to retire from the 2009 Vuelta a Castilla y León during the first stage after crashing in a rider pileup in Baltanás, Spain, and breaking his collarbone. Armstrong flew back to Austin, Texas, for corrective surgery, which was successful, and was back training on a bicycle within four days of his operation.|$|E
25|$|Minesweeping {{equipment}} and U.S. Navy personnel trained in minesweeping both were in short supply, so, {{in order to}} minimize the danger of mine explosions to American personnel and equipment, Task Force 78 planners devised an operational scheme in which minesweeping was limited to areas in which the mines already had rendered themselves inert. If all mines known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> area also were known to have passed their self-sterilization dates, Task Force 78 planned to conduct a check sweep of a few passes; if it was not clear that all mines in a given area had become inert, a more thorough clearance sweep was to be used.|$|E

25|$|According to the 2009 National Healthcare Disparities Report, uninsured Americans {{are less}} likely to receive {{preventive}} services in health care. For example, minorities are not regularly screened for colon cancer and the death rate for colon cancer has increased among African Americans and Hispanic populations. Furthermore, limited English proficient patients are also less likely to receive preventive health services such as mammograms. Studies have shown that use of professional interpreters have significantly reduced disparities in the rates of fecal occult testing, flu immunizations and pap smears. In the UK, Public Health England, a universal service free at the point of use, which forms part of the NHS, offers regular screening to any member of the population considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> at-risk group (such as individuals over 45) for major disease (such as colon cancer, or diabetic-retinopathy).|$|E

500|$|A {{controversial}} {{ending to}} the Masters occurred in 1968.

By the rules of golf, if a player signs a scorecard (thereby attesting to its veracity) that records a score on a hole higher than what he actually made on the hole, the player receives the higher score for that hole. This extra stroke cost De Vicenzo a chance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> 18-hole Monday playoff with Bob Goalby, who won the green jacket.

500|$|For Tracy Draco, the {{producers}} wanted an established actress opposite [...] Lazenby. Brigitte Bardot was invited, but after she signed {{to appear in}} Shalako opposite Sean Connery the deal fell through, and Diana Rigg—who had already been the popular heroine Emma Peel in The Avengers—was cast instead. Rigg {{said one of the}} reasons for accepting the role was that she always wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> epic film. Telly Savalas was cast following a suggestion from Broccoli, and Hunt's neighbour George Baker was offered the part of Sir Hilary Bray. Baker's voice was also used when Lazenby was impersonating Bray, as Hunt considered Lazenby's imitation not convincing enough. Gabriele Ferzetti was cast as Draco after {{the producers}} saw him in an Italian Mafia film, but Ferzetti's heavy Italian accent also led to his voice being redubbed by English actor David de Keyser for the final cut.|$|E
