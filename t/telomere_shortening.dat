40|$|Background: Cryptogenic liver {{cirrhosis}} (CC) and Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are chronic, progressive diseases with poor prognosis that share inflammation and fibrosis of target organs as common pathogenetic mechanisms. Both {{are included in}} the spectrum of syndrome of <b>telomeres</b> <b>shortening.</b> We describe a case of synchronous diagnosis of IPF and CC associated with a novel mutation in telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Subjects and Design: The proband was a 48 -year-old active smoker, formerly obese, woman with type- 2 diabetes mellitus. IPF and CC had a rapid and negative course. Her large family had an excess of type- 2 diabetes and chronic liver disease and a high prevalence of different cancers, premature menopause and osteoporosis. In this family, we suggested an implication of <b>telomeres</b> <b>shortening.</b> Results: Sequencing and mutation analysis of hTERT and hTR demonstrated the presence of a novel hTERT mutation (L 153 M) and of a hTERT polymorphism (A 305 A). The patient was a carrier of both mutation and polymorphism, which were observed also in other family members. The relevance of L 153 M variant was confirmed by protein sequence alignment and by the prediction program PolyPhen. Furthermore, leukocyte telomeres length was significantly shorter in family members compared to age-matched healthy controls (0. 94 ± 0. 45 vs 1. 37 ± 0. 63; p= 0. 007). Conclusions: this is the first description of the coexistence of CC and IPF associated with a novel telomerase mutation not in the setting of dyskeratosis congenita. This case report gives further evidence of telomeres involvement in liver disease progression and suggests a possible link between NASH and CC through <b>telomeres</b> <b>shortening...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Telomeres {{act like}} {{protective}} caps for the chromosome. During cell division, a cell will {{make copies of}} its DNA. The enzymes in the cell {{that are responsible for}} copying the DNA cannot copy the very ends of the chromosomes. This is sometimes called the [...] "end replication problem".

However, because chromosomes have telomeres or mega telomeres on their ends, repetitive non-essential sequences of DNA are lost instead (See: <b>Telomere</b> <b>shortening).</b> While the chromosomes in most eukaryotic organisms are capped with telomeres, mega-telomeres are only found in a few species, such as mice and some birds. The specific function of mega-telomeres in vertebrate cells is still unclear.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Lifespans among taxa vary widely, however, most {{all species}} undergo a {{reduction}} in physiological function with increasing age, often termed aging. One theory suggest that aging {{occurs as a result}} of the accumulation of damage during life, and though maintenance and repair mechanisms have evolved, they are not sufficient to completely mitigate the accrual of damage, resulting in aging pathologies. This theory also suggests that the variation of lifespan among species could be a result of the variable ability of maintenance systems to mitigate damage. Particularly long-lived species should evolve processes that maintain physiological systems linked to survival. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are an outlier among bird species and live 26 % longer than their mass-predicted maximum lifespan. Telomeres, tandem repeating, non-coding sequences that protect the coding regions of DNA during cell replication, are linked to survival. <b>Telomeres</b> <b>shorten</b> with age in most species. We show that Magellanic penguins maintain their telomeres over their lifespan, resisting the stressors of growth, reproduction and environment. This may be a key factor in their enhanced longevity. We found telomere lengths for adults from 4 years to more than 27 years of age were similar. We found telomeres of adult Magellanic penguins remained similar in length over a 3 -year period. Telomere length did not predict re-sighting, nor did <b>telomeres</b> <b>shorten</b> with more reproductive effort or reproductive success. Our results suggest that Magellanic penguins maintain their telomeres. If telomere length is important to survival, adults should have strong mechanisms maintaining telomere length. Chick growth is energetically costly, and is characterized by high levels of cell proliferation, which is linked to shorter telomeres in other species. Mitochondria are the source of both energy production, and damaging reactive oxygen species that can <b>shorten</b> <b>telomeres.</b> We characterized the dynamics of telomere length and mitochondria number during the fastest growth and throughout the lifespan of Magallenic penguins. We tested how growth impacted telomeres by taking blood from wild known-age Magellanic penguin chicks as they grew and measured telomere length and mitochondria number. <b>Telomeres</b> <b>shortened</b> during early rapid growth but by fledging telomeres were similar to their length at hatching and stay at this length throughout life. Mitochondrial copy number increased significantly after hatch as the chick grew, probably to meet energetic demands, than returned to their number at hatching by 45 days of age. When the penguins reach 7 to 8 years of age the number of mitochondria decreased to the level at hatching, remaining at this abundance throughout adulthood. Our results indicate that while <b>telomeres</b> <b>shorten</b> during growth, characterized by increased mitochondria number, Magellanic penguins elongate telomeres and enter breeding age with telomeres similar to their hatch day. Magellanic penguins also live in captivity, where the stressors they experience undoubtedly differ from those of wild penguins, but could have equally potent effects on maintenance systems. In captivity, confinement and living in non-native habitats may be stressors, <b>shortening</b> <b>telomeres.</b> If so, telomeres in Magellanic penguins should shorten more in captivity than in the wild. We found that <b>telomeres</b> do not <b>shorten</b> with age in males or females, in captivity. Telomeres were similar in length in captive and wild Magellanic penguins. Magellanic penguins appear to maintain their telomeres in captivity, the same as in the wild, which is consistent with their longer than predicted lifespan. Magellanic penguins’ enhanced longevity may be explained, at least in part, by the maintenance of telomeres. By understanding the aging physiology of seabird species like Magellanic penguins we are likely to find insights into the evolutionary processes that drive the aging phenotypes we observe in nature...|$|R
