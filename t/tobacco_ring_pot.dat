40|$|SUMMARY: Serological and plant-protection {{experiments}} {{provided evidence}} that potato bouquet and beet ringspot viruses are strains of tomato black ring virus. Tomato black ring and potato bouquet viruses are {{more closely related}} to each other than either is to beet ringspot virus. The three produce similar symptoms and have a similar host range. There was no evidence that they are related to <b>tobacco</b> <b>ring</b> spot or peach yellow bud mosaic viruses. In the plant-protection tests, protection be-tween serologically related virus strains often was not reciprocal; when protection was incomplete, the symptoms produced by the second virus were milder than those in plants infected by it alone. Strains of tomato black ring virus could be arranged in order of their ability to cause symptoms in plants already infected with other strains. Although results of the plant-protection and serological tests agreed broadly, the correlation was not complete, suggesting that the tests measure different pro-perties of the virus particles. The degree of difference between strains of tomato black ring virus seems to reflect their geographical separation, something that is perhaps to be more expected with soil-borne than with other viruses...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Honey {{bees are}} eusocial insects that are commercially managed to provide {{pollination}} services for agricultural crops. Recent increased losses of honey bee colonies (averaging 32 % annually since 2006) {{are associated with}} the incidence and abun-dance of pathogens. In their study inmBio, J. L. Li et al. [mBio 5 (1) :e 00898 - 13, 2014, doi: 10. 1128 /mBio. 00898 - 13] share their dis-covery that a plant virus, <b>tobacco</b> <b>ring</b> spot virus (TRSV), replicates in honey bees and that the prevalence of this virus was high in weak colonies. Their findings increase our understanding of the role of viruses in honey bee colony losses and underscore the importance of surveying for new and/or emerging viruses in honey bees. Furthermore, their findings will pique the interest of virologists and biologists across all disciplines. The discovery that a plant virus (TRSV) replicates, spreads, and negatively affects the health of an insect host will lead to additional studies on the mechanisms of host-specific adaptation and the role of cross-kingdom infections in the transmission of this virus. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) pollinate numerous agriculturalcrops, including almonds, apples, blueberries, and oil seed crops, valued at a total of $ 14. 6 billion annually (1).

40|$|An {{ability to}} {{efficiently}} compute the electrostatic potential produced by molecular charge distributions under realistic solvation conditions {{is essential for}} a variety of applications. Here, the simple closed-form analytical approximation to the Poisson equation rigorously derived in Part I for idealized spherical geometry is tested on realistic shapes. The effects of mobile ions are included at the Debye–Hückel level. The accuracy of the resulting closed-form expressions for electrostatic potential is assessed through comparisons with numerical Poisson–Boltzmann (NPB) reference solutions on a test set of 580 representative biomolecular structures under typical conditions of aqueous solvation. For each structure, the deviation from the reference is computed for a large number of test points placed near the dielectric boundary (molecular surface). The accuracy of the approximation, averaged over all test points in each structure, is within 0. 6 kcal∕mol∕∣e∣∼kT per unit charge for all structures in the test set. For 91. 5 % of the individual test points, the deviation from the NPB potential is within 0. 6 kcal∕mol∕∣e∣. The deviations from the reference decrease with increasing distance from the dielectric boundary: The approximation is asymptotically exact far away from the source charges. Deviation of the overall shape of a structure from ideal spherical does not, by itself, appear to necessitate decreased accuracy of the approximation. The largest deviations from the NPB reference are found inside very deep and narrow indentations that occur on the dielectric boundaries of some structures. The dimensions of these pockets of locally highly negative curvature are comparable {{to the size of a}} water molecule; the applicability of a continuum dielectric models in these regions is discussed. The maximum deviations from the NPB are reduced substantially when the boundary is smoothed by using a larger probe radius (3 Å) to generate the molecular surface. A detailed accuracy analysis is presented for several proteins of various shapes, including lysozyme whose surface features a functionally relevant region of negative curvature. The proposed analytical model is computationally inexpensive; this strength of the approach is demonstrated by computing and analyzing the electrostatic potential generated by a full capsid of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>ring</b> spot virus at atomic resolution (500 000 atoms).

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{infectivity}} {{of plant}} viruses was suppressed by inhibitory substances (IS) in the sap of Chenopodium. Various methods were attempted {{to find an}} efficient method which would allow direct transmission of viruses from Chenopodium to other plants. Viruses used in these experiments were alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and <b>tobacco</b> <b>ring</b> spot virus (TRSV) The infectivity of AMV-containing Chenopodium extract increased with dilution. There {{seemed to be an}} apparent dissociation of the virus and the IS at 1 : 1000 dilution. The AMV extract mixed with equal parts of IS was completely noninfectious at all dilutions. Dilution of TMV and IS mixture resulted in a gradual increase in infectivity. The infectivity of TMV was comparable to the water control at 1 : 1000 dilution, but both were in low titre as was AMV at this dilution. AMV and IS could be separated when heated together at 60 °C, but very few lesions developed. There was no virus activity with temperatures below and above 60 °C. IS started inactivating at 60 °C when only IS of Chenopodium extract was heated, cooled and then added to AMV. The inactivation of IS increased as the temperature increased. TMV and IS were not separated to the same degree as were AMV and IS when heated together in a mixture. The only infectivity was present after the 60 °C treatment. There was no virus activity with temperatures below and above 60 °C. IS started inactivating at 60 °C when only IS Chenopodium extract was heated, cooled and then added to TMV. The inactivation of IS increased as temperature increased. Liquid-nitrogen increased the infectivity of AMV three to seven fold, but AMV was still in low titre. There was no TRSV infectivity after adsorption with hydrated calcium phosphate. Partial separation of AMV and IS could be accomplished by high speed centrifugation. When Chenopodium extracts were layered on 30 - 50 g of sucrose/ 100 ml of 0. 033 M phosphate buffer, pH 7 density-gradient columns and centrifuged, most of the IS remained in the aqueous layer, not sedimenting into the sucrose. Consequently, all samples removed from the sucrose gradient and mixed with TMV allowed lesion formation on Pinto bean leaves, in contrast to the samples withdrawn frorn the aqueous layer. In other tests, TRSV and AMV from Chenopodium each sedimented into sucrose during centrifugation, concentrating in the 35 g sucrose region. When 2 ml of clarified extract of TRSV- or AMV-infected Chenopodium was layered over 3 ml of the 35 g sucrose solution and centrifuged, both viruses were recovered in high concentration from the sucrose. Controls not centrifuged or just ground in sucrose were not infective. An attempt to recover TRSV with this method from an old infection in Chenopodium was not successful. However, some infection was obtained from old Peach yellow bud mosaic (PYBV) infected strawberry leaves with this method. It was concluded that the most efficient method of separating viruses from IS in Chenopodium was layering extracts over 35 g sucrose followed by centrifugation...|$|R

Ladies and gentlemen, who came to market, looked on at a larger amount of amateur fighting than could easily be seen in these later times, and beheld more revolting rags, beggary, and rascaldom, than modern householders could well picture to themselves. As the day wore on, the hideous drama of the gaming-house might be seen here by any chance open-air spectator--the quivering eagerness, the blank despair, the sobs, the blasphemy, and the blows:-- ...|$|R

Ye must know, comrades, that I've seed them do it myself--anyways I've seed a man that knew a feller who said he had a comrade that wintered once with the Huskies, which is pretty much the same thing. An' he said that {{sometimes}} when they kill a big seal, they boil it whole an' have a rig'lar feast. Ye must understand, mes garcons, that the Huskies make thumpin' big kettles out o' a kind o' soft stone they find in them parts, an' some o' them's big enough to boil a whole seal in. Well, when the beast is cooked, they take it out o' the pot, an' while they're tuckin' into it, the dogs come and sit in a <b>ring</b> round the <b>pot</b> to wait till the soup's cool enough to eat. They knows well that it's too hot at first, an' that they must have a deal o' patience; but afore long some o' the young uns can't hold on, so they steps up somewhat desperate like, and pokes their snouts in. Of course they pulls them out pretty sharp with a yell, and sit down to rub their noses for a bit longer. Then the old uns take courage an' make a snap at it now and again, but very tenderly, till it gits cooler at last, an' then at it they go, worryin', an' scufflin', an' barkin', an' gallopin', just like Moses there, till the pot's as clean as the day it wos made." ...|$|R
40|$|Both {{structural}} and functional properties of belowground organs {{are critical for}} development and yield of plants, but compared to the shoot, these are {{much more difficult to}} observe due to soil opacity. With the yield relevant organ situated belowground sugar beet is even more affected by this difficulty than other crops. The beet shows a complex tissue structure with several cambia active in parallel that are tightly linked with its function in storing photoassimilates in the form of sucrose. Additionally the development of traits during the growth period such as morphology, anatomy, sugar content and photoassimilate allocation within the beet cannot be addressed with destructive sampling techniques. Nevertheless, these are key factors for sugar yield. Here, we show application of Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate on a routine basis the development of structural traits such as beet diameter, biomass and width of cambia <b>rings</b> in plants <b>potted</b> in an agricultural soil mixed with sand. Functional traits such as sugar content and petiole xylem flow velocity were investigated regularly during the same time periods of up to four months. Individual tissues could be identified using MRI T 2 -maps with the aid of light microscopy at final harvest allowing the study of the development of tissues such as cambia, phloem or storage parenchyma in the cambial rings. Different Genotypes, commercial varieties as well as such of contrasting sugar content from KWS material were compared. For studying photoassimilate allocation we applied Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using carbon isotope 11 C as a tracer. We show 3 D PET maps of Radioactivity in the beet tracing the routes of photoassimilate translocation from the leaves into the beet. This revealed translocation pattern and their dynamics during three month of growth. These data are further used for fitting simple transport models, to estimate assimilate transport velocity and assimilate storage along the transport pathway in specific sections of the beet. Together these approaches have the potential to yield unique insights into sugar beet belowground development. Thereby they will shed new light on processes like sugar storage or stress responses in the beet...|$|R
