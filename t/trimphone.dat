5000|$|The GPO {{introduced}} the <b>Trimphone</b> {{in the late}} 60s {{as an alternative to}} its standard telephone. Subscribers had to pay extra for the <b>Trimphone.</b> The original design by Martyn Rowlands dates from 1964. It won a COID Design Award in 1966. Anthony Wedgwood Benn (the then Postmaster-General) presented the first one to a subscriber in 1965, but it was not available to everyone until 1968.|$|E
50|$|The first keypad {{version of}} the <b>Trimphone</b> {{appeared}} in 1977 - somewhat delayed by the problem of packaging the signalling electronics into the small volume of the <b>Trimphone.</b> The problem was alleviated by marginally increasing {{the height of the}} case compared to the dial version. The first design of keypad <b>Trimphone</b> to achieve large-scale production was the SC version (Tele 766); this design incorporates relays, but does not require batteries. Subsequent designs eased the packaging problems further by eliminating the relays and introducing transistor pulsing. An MF4 (Touch-tone) design had to await the development of an integrated circuit to replace the bulky coils and capacitors otherwise needed. This was introduced in 1979 (Tele 786).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Trimphone,</b> a British {{model of}} {{telephone}} {{designed in the}} 1960s, was featured prominently in the series.|$|E
50|$|A loop {{dialling}} keypad {{version of}} the <b>Trimphone</b> was introduced in 1976 as the 766. The Trimphones were all fitted with a tone ringer which initially warbled quietly and then louder. With the advent of new style wiring the model numbers were prefixed with an '8' and were fitted with a 4000Ω high impedance ringer and a new style line cord fitted with a 431A plug. In 1982 the final incarnation of the <b>Trimphone</b> was relaunched with {{a new set of}} colours known as The Snowdon Collection.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Trimphone</b> started life in 1964 as the Telephone No. 712. The Telephone No.712 {{was usually}} {{supplied}} as a 712L with an alphabetical {{as well as}} numerical dial. The <b>Trimphone</b> {{was the first in}} the GPO range to use a tone caller which warbled at around 2350 Hz modulated by ringing current. The volume of the ringer gradually built up over the first few cycles. There is a volume control in the base of the telephone with 'loud', 'medium' and 'soft' settings (a silent setting was achieved by slackening off a screw on the tone ringer board inside the phone).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A <b>Trimphone,</b> {{viewed from}} the side. The handset cradle functioned as a {{carrying}} handle when the receiver was off the hook, and the coiled cord in theory allowed the phone to be carried around.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The <b>Trimphone,</b> from above, in the {{original}} dial design and the later keypad. To fit the electronics used to generate the dial pulses (and in later models, tones), {{the depth of the}} case was increased.|$|E
50|$|After {{a number}} of {{different}} modifications, the definitive version of the <b>Trimphone,</b> the 2/722 was introduced in 1971. These were supplied with an all figure dial, although earlier variants of the 722 with lettered dials do exist.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Trimphone</b> is a {{model of}} {{telephone}} designed in the 1960s in the UK. It was positioned as a more fashionable alternative to the standard telephones available from the GPO, the predecessor to British Telecom. The name is an acronym standing for Tone Ring Illuminator Model, referring to the then innovative electronic ringer ("warbling", as opposed to the traditional bell) and the illuminated dial. The luminous dial or betalight contained the mildly radioactive element tritium, which later caused some concern about safety. At one point during the 1990s the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority at Harwell was fined £5,000 by Wantage Magistrates Court for accumulating radioactive waste, having collected several thousand <b>Trimphone</b> luminous dials in a skip.|$|E
50|$|Although a later model {{featured}} buttons {{that did}} not light up instead of the original dial, it continued {{to be known as}} the <b>Trimphone.</b> Consumers were divided as to its aesthetic merits, and some models required rewiring in order to connect to the public phone network in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The final {{incarnation}} (or rather reincarnation) of the <b>Trimphone</b> was {{a collection}} of alternative colour range Trimphones called the Phoenix phone or 'Snowdon Collection'. BT, as the GPO had become, fitted these with the new plug-socket connection and they were available, not to rent, but for outright purchase.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>Trimphone</b> was the 712 {{however it}} took a number of revisions to get right and a much improved model, the 722 came along in 1966 and was released as the 1/722 with a revised version, the 1/722 MOD, following swiftly on its heels. A further improved version, the 2/722, then became the standard issue in late 1971. With the advent of new style wiring the model numbers were prefixed with an '8' and were fitted with a 4000Ω high impedance ringer and a new style line cord fitted with a 431A plug. Push-button models were introduced in the 70s and {{the final version of}} the <b>Trimphone</b> was the Phoenix phone, available in a range of new colours known as The Snowdon Collection which came in out 1982.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem with}} the dial version of the <b>Trimphone</b> was its light weight, 0.8 kg {{compared}} with 1.4 kg for the 700-type and 2.6 kg for the 300-type telephone. This led to the complaint that on slippery surfaces the telephone turned and slid whilst dialling. The fix for this was to wet the feet and the phone stuck to the table.|$|E
50|$|Production {{of the new}} {{telephone}} commenced in 1965 by STC, and {{an initial}} quantity of 1000 was offered to customers on a selective trial basis in the London North West Telephone Area in the same year. It became available throughout the country in 1968, at extra rental cost, {{with a choice of}} three two-tone colour schemes: grey-white, grey-green and two-tone blue. The first example of the <b>Trimphone</b> was presented in May 1965 by the Postmaster General, Tony Benn, to a newly wed couple in Hampstead in a ceremony marking the ten millionth telephone to be installed in Britain. By 1980 there were 1.6 million Trimphones in use out of a total telephone population at that time of 27 million.|$|E
5000|$|The Bad Girls Club house, {{similar to}} {{previous}} seasons, features free accessories such as shoes, purses, and jewelries which were displayed as add-ons {{on the walls}} of the house. Inside the house, in the middle, has a [...] "light fixture" [...] which features, colors such as pink and purple décor. The fixture was also made up of patterns of high heels which was displayed above the centered circular small black couch. In the living room, the girls was given spotted light color couches which was in front of paintings of various cities. Close to the paintings, were, the Bad Girls Club oath which sits above the fireplace. The girls was also give a 1960s replica of a wall <b>Trimphone,</b> instead of today's modern house phones. Inside the girls rooms features adult toys and statues of half naked men which were displayed {{on the walls of}} some of the girls rooms. There was also a [...] "Screaming O" [...] vending machine which the girls had to pay a fee in order to receive adult toys, similar to a full-line vending. The vanity room, also features, 1960s furniture, which the girls go to apply beauty supplies and/or get ready for clubbing. The jacuzzi was placed, in front of the computer which had speakers connecting to the computer. The jacuzzi was also placed inside the house. In the back of the house, the girls was given a modern pool, and an outside modern swing, which the girls could get some shade. Inside the pool, however, features a queen size floating bed which floats around the pool. The kitchen features a more 1970s look, with light patterns. The girls were also given gas stoves. The kitchen table featured light green, black, white, and orange colors.|$|E
40|$|Nine audio {{descriptions}} were written, performanced, and recorded, but eight descriptors {{used for}} the multi-sensory desks in the ' 3 D Printing: The Good, the Bad and the Beautiful' exhibition at the National Centre for Craft & Design. Each descriptor aimed to describe verbally the appearance and physicality of each exhibit and / or the design, social, economic, and cultural context of a specific displayed exhibit. In addition, the key concept and themes of the exhibition was explained and illustrated. Each audio descriptor is approximately 150 seconds long and could be listened to on a <b>trimphone</b> placed on a multi-sensory desk...|$|E
