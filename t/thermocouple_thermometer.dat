Ambient air temperature {{is used to}} evaluate temperature stress effect on yield under field conditions; however, {{there is evidence that}} actual temperatures in the canopy where bolls develop are different. In terms of cotton responses, there is limited research about the effects of elevated day and night temperatures upon boll carbohydrate content, size, and boll respiration. Field and growth chamber experiments were performed during 2014 - 2015 using the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivar DP 0912 B 2 RF. Field studies for determining temperature gradients through the canopy consisted of two planting dates with weekly measurements performed at noon, beginning one week after first flower. Temperature was recorded using <b>thermocouple</b> <b>thermometers</b> at both lower canopy (main-stem node 7 ± 1) and upper canopy (main-stem node 11 ± 1) positions, and included internal boll, air next to the boll, ambient air above the canopy, subtending leaf, and soil temperature. Results showed that there is a dynamic vertical temperature gradient through the canopy with the ambient air temperature being significantly cooler that the air inside the canopy. Consequently, ambient air temperature is not always an appropriate indicator of what is happening within the canopy. For analyzing the effect of high day and night temperature on boll carbohydrate and respiration, three growth chamber experiments were performed. The temperature regimes consisted of optimal temperature throughout the study (32 / 24 oC, day/night) and high day and night temperature (38 / 30 oC, day/night).

MethodsSkin temperatures induced by monkshood cake moxibustion were evaluated by measuring the Neiguan acupoint (PC 6) from 31 participants with a digital <b>thermocouple</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Temperatures of 43 °C and 52 °C were applied to cultured human leukemia mast cell line HMC- 1 in vitro. Calcium fluorescence was applied to detect intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i). Extracellular ATP contents were measured by luciferin-luciferase assay. ResultsMaximum skin temperatures mostly ranged from 40 – 45 °C, but some reached up to 50 °C. Both 43 °C and 52 °C induced MC degranulation, which was accompanied {{by an increase in}} [Ca 2 +]i and ATP release. Complexing extracellular Ca 2 + with 5 mM ethylene glycol-bis (β-aminoethyl ether) -N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) inhibited the noxious heat-induced elevation of [Ca 2 +]i and prevented the enhanced ATP secretion by those cells at 52 °C, but not 43 °C.

These gauges are accurate from 10&minus;3 Torr to 10 Torr, but their calibration is sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.|$|R

An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind chill factor, where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same.

Resection of the infarcted segment of gut was followed by an improvement in the patient's condition. Most of the hazards and complications of induced hypothermia are well known and fully docu-mented. However, the English and American literature on the subject contains no reference to the occurrence of mesenteric infarction during hypothermia. A case {{is reported}} in which such an incident did occur, due to either mesenteric thrombosis or embolus. CASE REPORT A man aged 46 years, with malignant hypertension (blood pressure 240 / 180 mm Hg), was found to have a stenosed left renal artery. In order to improve the blood flow to the left kidney a lieno-renal arterial anastomosis was planned. It was decided to perform the operation under hypothermia to protect the kidney while its blood supply was cut off. The patient was dyspnoeic on moderate exertion and had been in left ventricular failure on several occasions, treated with hypotensive agents, digitalis and diuretics. The e. c. g. showed left ventricular hypertrophy and a possible previous infarct. Haemoglobin and white cell count were normal. Cold haemaglutinins precipi-tated heavily at 4 °C and faintly at 11 "C, but as this temperature range was far outside that to which it was intended to cool the patient, no significance was attached to this observation. A naesthelic management. On the night before operation, the patient was given chlorpromazine 50 mg orally with no effect on his pulse rate or blood pressure.

30|$|This {{study has}} the {{following}} limitations. First, direct brain temperature measurements {{were made by}} a <b>thermocouple</b> <b>thermometer</b> implanted into the brain. Furthermore, invasive temperature probe can only provide a point measurement whereas {{it is important to}} know if temperature gradients exist in the brain with hypothermia induced by blowing cold air into the nasal cavities. With regard to this first limitation, MRI can measure brain temperature to within 1  °C [45]; but it is not a bedside method and cannot be used to monitor brain temperature at frequent intervals throughout the period of hypothermia that can last for a period of 12 to 72  h [32, 45]. Also, we had examined the temperature gradient within the brain of four pigs by measuring temperatures at the frontal and parietal lobe, and the gradient calculated as the difference was found to be no more than 0.1  °C. This could be due to the CSF circulation in the brain which minimizes temperature gradients if they exist. Furthermore, there are other several anatomical differences between pigs and human (e.g., cerebral blood flow, distance from the nasopharynx to the brain, ratio between the size of the nasal cavity to the brain) that are important in this context and may alter the results. With regard to the distance from the nasopharynx to the brain, we had examined the efficiency of intranasal cooling with a shortened nasal catheter (4 – 5  cm) for which the results were found to be similar to this study [46]. One important aspect which was not tested in our experiments is controlling the rewarming rate. Rewarming is a critical phase of therapeutic hypothermia in that too fast a rewarming rate may re-trigger destructive processes at the cellular level [47]. However, our method can also be used to control the rewarming rate and maintain normothermia in the post-rewarming period. In a recent study [46], we showed the potential use of our method to tightly control the rewarming rate within 0.3 [*]±[*] 0.1  °C per hour by manually increasing the air temperature gradually and adjusting the flow rate on four juvenile pigs. In future studies, we will upgrade our controller to automatically adjust the flow rate and temperature of cold air according to the tympanic (ear drum) temperature measured by a near-infrared sensor in the ear canal as surrogate of the brain temperature. Moreover, in future studies, we will be blowing humidified air into the nasal cavities and humidity will be measured and controlled inside of the nasal catheter right before the nasal cavities. Histopathological studies on the lining of the nasal cavity will also be performed to demonstrate that there is no damage induced by blowing air for an extended period into the nostrils. As an initial step, we will obtain large animal data to prove that brain cooling with our fully automated device does provide brain protection in resuscitated cardiac arrest models in pigs.|$|E

A temperature sensor such as a <b>thermometer,</b> <b>thermocouple</b> or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the tube, which is usually in the open air outside the process piping or vessel and any thermal insulation. Thermodynamically, the process fluid transfers heat to the thermowell wall, which in turn transfers heat to the sensor. Since more mass is present with a sensor-well assembly than with a probe directly immersed into the process, the sensor's response to process temperature changes is slowed by the addition of the well. If the sensor fails, it can be easily replaced without draining the vessel or piping. Since the mass of the thermowell must be heated to the process temperature, and since the walls of the thermowell conduct heat out of the process, sensor accuracy and responsiveness is negatively impacted by the addition of a thermowell.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried for measuring tube-side heat transfer coefficient, friction factor, heat transfer enhancement efficiency {{of water for}} turbulent flow in a circular tube fitted with rectangular-cut twisted tape insert. A copper tube of 26. 6 mm internal diameter and 30 mm outer diameter and 900 mm test length was used. A stainless steel rectangular-cut twisted tape insert of 5. 25 twist ratio was inserted into the smooth tube. The rectangular cut had 8 mm depth and 14 mm width. A uniform heat flux condition was created by wrapping nichrome wire around the test section and fiber glass over the wire. Outer surface temperatures of the tube were measured at 5 different points of the test section by T-type <b>thermocouples.</b> Two <b>thermometers</b> were used for measuring the bulk temperatures. At the outlet section the thermometer {{was placed in a}} mixing box. The Reynolds numbers were varied in the range 10000 - 19000 with heat flux variation 14 to 22 kW/m 2 for smooth tube, and 23 to 40 kW/m 2 for tube with insert. Nusselt numbers obtained from smooth tube were compared with Gnielinski [1] correlation and errors were found to be in the range of - 6 % to - 25 % with r. m. s. value of 20 %. At comparable Reynolds number, Nusselt numbers in tube with rectangular-cut twisted tape insert were enhanced by 2. 3 to 2. 9 times at the cost of increase of friction factors by 1. 4 to 1. 8 times compared to that of smooth tube. Heat transfer enhancement efficiencies were found to be in the range of 1. 9 to 2. 3 and increased with the increase of Reynolds number...|$|R
5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the thermowell must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the thermowell projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a thermowell with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A thermowell is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A thermowell is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or flanged process connection. The temperature sensor such as a <b>thermometer,</b> <b>thermocouple</b> or resistance temperature detector is inserted in the open end of the thermowell and typically spring-loaded to ensure that the outside tip of the temperature sensor is in metal to metal contact with the inside tip of the thermowell.|$|R
