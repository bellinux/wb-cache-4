5|$|Textual {{critics and}} palaeographers like Johann Jakob Wettstein, Constantin von Tischendorf, Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener and Caspar René Gregory dated the {{manuscript}} to the 10th century. Henri Omont and Kirsopp Lake dated {{it to the}} 12th century, and Dean Burgon to the 12th or 13th century. It is dated by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research to the 12th century because the frequent occurrence of <b>enlarged</b> <b>letters,</b> rounded breathing marks, flourishes and ligatures seem to eliminate earlier dates.|$|R

50|$|A historiated initial is an initial, an <b>enlarged</b> <b>letter</b> at the {{beginning}} of a paragraph or other section of text, that contains a picture. Strictly speaking, a historiated initial depicts an identifiable figure or a specific scene, while an inhabited initial contains figures (human or animal) that are decorative only, without forming a subject. Both sorts became very common and elaborate in luxury illuminated manuscripts. These illustrated initials were first seen in the Insular art of the early 8th century. The earliest known example is in the Saint Petersburg Bede, an Insular manuscript of 731-46, and the Vespasian Psalter has another.|$|R
5000|$|These {{nonsense}} sentences {{were created in}} order to eliminate any non-prosodic interference (e.g phonological differences, different number of syllables, etc.) thus babies would {{only be able to}} differentiate between the two languages based on the prominence of prosodic cues in the sentences. The table above depicts the sentences heard by the French babies (translated as [...] "The large orangoutang was nervous"), where the bolded and <b>enlarged</b> <b>letter</b> indicates word stress and prominence (Christophe et al. 2003). As predicted, French babies tended to prefer the modified nonsense French phrases, based solely on prosodic prominence, given by the location of the head direction parameter.|$|R
