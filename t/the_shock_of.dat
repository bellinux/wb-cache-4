5|$|The AEC would {{eventually}} concede, as well, that even {{low levels of}} radiation were harmful.

5|$|All {{five men}} injured {{that night at}} the Seward home survived. Powell was {{captured}} the next day at the boarding house of Mary Surratt, and was executed on July 7, 1865, along with Herold, Atzerodt, and Mrs. Surratt, convicted as conspirators in the Lincoln assassination. Their deaths occurred only weeks after that of Seward's wife Frances, who never recovered from <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the assassination attempt.|$|E

5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction. The deck and turret roof armour proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side armour was {{not strong enough to}} withstand <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> impact from heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|Later, Osborn stumbles upon an old Green Goblin hideout which, again, restores his memory. However, <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> seeing Harry Osborn hospitalized, overdosed on drugs, causes Osborn's amnesia {{to return}} once more. After the final {{restoration}} of his memories, the Green Goblin kidnaps and takes Gwen Stacy to a bridge. During Spider-Man's rescue attempt, Osborn knocks Gwen off the bridge, {{resulting in the}} girl's death. Spider-Man, traumatised and obsessed with revenge, tracks Green Goblin to his hideout, and in the ensuing battle, Osborn is impaled by his own goblin glider.|$|E
5|$|NuScale's design {{does not}} rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment. The company claims it can shut down and {{continue}} cooling itself indefinitely {{in the event of}} a catastrophe. The devices are intended to be kept in a below-ground pool, to absorb <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> earthquakes, with a concrete lid over the pool. In the event that AC power is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil.|$|E

5|$|On 6 January 1966, Nell {{was driving}} the family car with Harry as a passenger; {{they were going to}} the south coast of Queensland for a holiday. A tyre blew out and the car rolled on the Leichhardt Highway near Condamine. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs. He had {{suffered}} heart trouble for some time, and <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the accident is believed to have caused his death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|On June 6, the {{two major}} party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock, Ontario. Speaking in the afternoon, St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200. To <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} an hour late, with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who wanted only to see him or shake his hand.|$|E
5|$|One of the year's best {{music videos}} was {{directed}} by Jay-Z and cost about zero dollars to make. The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's Take-Away Shows, its appeal compounded by <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. It's all quite endearing and personal â€“ two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple.|$|E

5|$|Setting {{up her own}} {{publishing}} house Marsden House, Karen is relying on useless Ramona as personal assistant. Adam is determined to take things one step further with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed on his feet as a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> Karen and Adam.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The final {{disaster}} for Villiers occurred in November, when Princess Amelia died. After her death, Villiers {{and his wife}} attempted to blackmail the Royal Family by threatening (in a letter to her doctor, Sir Henry Halford) to release some of her correspondence, much to <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> her sister, Princess Mary. The family finally moved out of Cranborne Lodge in 1812.|$|E

5|$|The {{response}} towards {{more effective}} cannons {{was to build}} thicker walls and to prefer round towers, as the curving sides {{were more likely to}} deflect a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures {{had to find a way}} to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle's curtain wall to absorb some of <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> impact.|$|E
5|$|Unique to this {{adaptation}} of the story, Marceau finds additional clues such as a crate full of living accommodations in the security vault of the baggage compartment {{and a picture of}} Michel's family, despite the fact that Poirot's nephew radios that the man has none. After explaining the second solution, Poirot reveals that Michel is not who he appears, but is in fact Robert Perkinson, Cassetti's criminal partner. Perkinson confirms this to <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the other passengers and reveals that Cassetti kept Daisy Armstrong at his house, but Cassetti gunned down Perkinson's daughter, Teresa, whom he mistook for Daisy.|$|E
5|$|Another bombshell is {{dropped in}} Dimitri's {{life when he}} finds out that Anton Lang, who he {{believed}} to be the son of two Marick family employees, is really his son with his maid, Corvina Lang (Margaret Sophie Stein). Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father, but Corvina convinces him not to tell Anton the truth right away. Dimitri attempts to forge relationship with Anton so it will ease <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the news. Nevertheless, Anton, who had believed Corvina was his sister, doesn't take the news of his parentage well and marries Kendall to throw it in Dimitri's face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the manipulator that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri manage to work things out before Anton leaves town.|$|E

5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E
5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear turret for thicker armour and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. She was given a deep draught to improve her seaworthiness, but her low {{freeboard}} meant that she had very little ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in layout to Glatton, but she was given more freeboard by the addition of an unarmoured structure above her waterline armour belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed turret with four gun ports as a rotating turret was not thought capable of withstanding <b>the</b> <b>shock</b> <b>of</b> impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type turret instead of the fixed turret and thicker armour than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, thicker armour and a steel hull.|$|E
