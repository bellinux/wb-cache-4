The sympathy of friends was good to him, but he could have done without it. The good opinion which he had of himself was never shaken by adverse criticism; and the criticism on the other side, by which it was exalted, came from the enumeration of the number of copies sold. He was a firm reliant man, very little prone to change, who, when he had discovered the nature of his own talent, knew how to do the very best with it.|$|E

50|$|After the {{extraction}} and tea creaming processes, the tea solution {{is still too}} dilute to pass through a drier. Drying at this point would take too much capital for little gain, and any type of spray or freeze-drying would cause the resulting powder to have too low a density. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> first concentrate the solution to what is usually 40% solids before drying, which involves the removal of water through evaporation. Concentration of tea is normally done through reduction of pressure. At high temperatures, the theaflavins in the solution are converted to thearubigins and carbohydrates caramelize. Forced evaporation systems had hot spots which led to undesirable sensory characteristics such as stewed and burnt flavors. Plate heat exchangers can cause the desired evaporation at around 45 °C, with short residence times that {{reduce the risk of}} thermal damage. This method can produce an extract with 45% solids. Aroma stripping is done prior to concentration, because those compounds run the risk of being lost during evaporation.|$|E
