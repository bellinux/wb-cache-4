Soon an electrostatic particle accelerator for 700 keV protons was installed (later also a <b>tandem</b> <b>accelerator),</b> und {{in collaboration with}} O. Benka, D. Semrad, A. Kropf and others, atomic physics experiments were started. To make the Linz group internationally known, Paul started to organize international workshops: at first three on theories of ionisation of inner atomic shells.

25|$|The {{school has}} been home to many {{different}} particle accelerators over the years. The first accelerator installed was a 1.25 MV Cockcroft-Walton known as HT1, this was in use from 1952 until 1967 when it was sold to the University of New South Wales. A second smaller 600 kV Cockcroft-Walton machine (HT2) was assembled in house using many spare parts acquired for HT1. In 1955 the UK government supplied a 33 MeV electron synchrotron as a gift. It {{was moved to the}} University of Western Australia in 1961. During 1960–1980 a HVEC EN <b>tandem</b> <b>accelerator</b> was used by nuclear physics for light ion research. 1975 saw the school's 14UD accelerator come online, which has since been augmented with a superconducting linear accelerator.|$|E

This resulted in expanding applications of these DLC foils which necessitated further development efforts directed toward the following applications of DLC targetry: (i) thin stripper foils for lower energy <b>tandem</b> <b>accelerators,</b> (ii) enlarged (up to 66 mm. in diameter) stop foils for improved time-of-flight elastic recoil detection ion beam analysis, and (iii) ultra-thin (about 0. 6 mug/cm(2)) DLC foils for some fundamental and applied physics experiments.

40|$|Accelerator mass {{spectrometry}} (AMS) is an ultra-sensitive method for counting atoms, both radionuclides and stable nuclides. When using small <b>tandem</b> <b>accelerators</b> to measure heavy isotopes, interfering isobars are often troublesome. One {{way to reduce}} this interference is to combine AMS with the detection of characteristic X-rays of the projectile. After analysis in the AMS system {{it is possible to}} identify ions of different atomic number by their characteristic X-rays, by slowing down the ions in a suitable target. In this paper, the detection limit of Ni- 59 at the Land AMS facility is reported. A method for the chemical extraction of nickel from stainless steel, combined with a purification step to reduce the cobalt content in the sample by several orders of magnitude, is also described.

LI-ERDA is also often performed using a relatively low energy (2 MeV) 4He beam specifically to depth profile hydrogen. In this technique, multiple detectors are used: at backscattering angles to detect heavier elements by RBS and forward (recoil) detector to simultaneously detect the recoiled hydrogen. The recoil detector for LI-ERDA typically has a “range foil” which is typically a Mylar foil {{placed in front of}} the detector for blocking scattered incident ions but allow lighter recoiling target atoms to pass through to the detector. Usually a 10 µm thick Mylar foil is able to completely stop 2.6 MeV He+ ions but allows the recoiled protons to go through with a low energy loss.|$|R

5000|$|Litherland and Allan Bromley were, in {{the words}} of J. C. D. [...] "Doug" [...] Milton, [...] "two of the key people working on the van de Graaff accelerators, the 3 MV home-made {{single-ended}} machine, and beginning in 1958, the world's first <b>tandem</b> <b>accelerator,</b> the EN tandem. The unprecedented precision and flexibility of the EN tandem made Chalk River the envy of physicists around the world and opened up the field of heavy-ion physics. Allan Bromley is sometimes called the father of heavy-ion physics. Litherland was honoured first of all for his work on the 3 MV machine through which, and with his insight and courage, the first proof that the collective model could be applied to a light nucleus, in this case 25Al. It led to a great simplification of our understanding of the spectra of such nuclei and directly to the Unified Model. Litherland went on to make critical contributions to nuclear structure research, primarily through the introduction, with John Ferguson, of new gamma-ray angular correlation techniques. In 1966, Litherland was recruited by the University of Toronto, and in 1967, he, along with Harry Gove and Ken Purser, realized the unique value of a <b>tandem</b> <b>accelerator</b> in measuring exquisitely minute quantities of 14C. Thus was born accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS); for his contribution the University of Toronto made him a university professor. Litherland subsequently became the director of Isotrace, a facility that leads the world in the introduction of new AMS techniques." ...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} sulphur hexafluoride as a stripper gas in <b>tandem</b> <b>accelerators</b> {{by using the}} ANTARES accelerator system at ANSTO to measure charge state distributions for this gas.

Charge state distributions using sulphur hexafluoride are found to have mean charge states up to I charge unit higher than, and to be broader than, corresponding distributions for argon gas, except in the case of carbon beams. As a result, SF 6 is shown to provide significantly higher yields for charge states of heavy ions above the mean charge state.
