Nowadays gas turbines have been put to use in various fields like, power plants, marine industries {{as well as for}} industrial propulsion. For high thermal efficiency advanced gas turbines use high temperature at the entry of the turbine. Therefore, for the purpose of increasing thermal efficiency of the turbines, it is imperative to design effective cooling schemes. The current Turbine Inlet Temperature in advanced gas turbines is much higher than the melting point of the blade material. As a result a varied range of cooling techniques are used to cool the blade to maintain normal operation of the turbine.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the outcome of}} a study carried out in the frame of a wider assessment performed with the LUISA (Land Use-based Integrated Sustainability Assessment) modelling platform, configured in compliance with the “EU Energy, Transport and GHG emissions trends until 2050 ” (EU Energy Reference Scenario 2013). A new methodology has been implemented to estimate and map water requirements for energy production in Europe. In this study, the category of dedicated energy crops (ENCR) played an important role. These crops are expected to emerge as additional fuel sources within the EU 28 by 2020. Water requirements in the remaining energy sectors have also been estimated in order to assess whether the introduction of these ENCR may, in any way, compete with the existing water requirements for energy production. More specifically, the study tackles the following questions: •	Where and to what extent will there be potential competition with cooling water required for electricity generation related to the introduction of these crops? •	How will these trends evolve over time? •	How will the introduction of energy crops affect the overall water consumption trends in Europe? The analysis indicates that high irrigation requirements for ENCR are foreseen in France, Poland, Spain, eastern Germany, and regions of Italy and the UK. Substantial increases in requirements are seen for several regions from 2020 to 2030. ENCR are absent in Finland, Denmark, Greece, Malta, Cyprus and Croatia for the whole simulation period. Water consumption for cooling in electricity production has been quantified for the years 2020 and 2030 for 2 scenarios with a minimum and a maximum value. There is notable variation in overall water consumption, both over time and between the scenarios. There is an increase in cooling water consumption for most regions in both scenarios over the period 2020 to 2030, which is especially high in France for the minimum scenario. The values given by the two scenarios vary greatly due to the wide range in water consumption between the different cooling technologies assumed in the two cases. In some regions there is even up to a factor 10 difference in total consumption for cooling. As for any modelling exercise, the study presents a level of uncertainty due to the number of external models giving input and to the assumptions made. In the case of the cooling water mapping, a possible range of minimum/maximum values has been used to reflect the large variation due to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> used by each power plant. For the energy crop water requirements we relied on estimates found in the literature. Nevertheless, the study presents an overall continental scale analysis of the potential impacts of the 2013 Energy Reference scenario, covering many of the involved sectors and provides the framework for further refinements and improvements.

40|$|Abstract. As {{an effort}} in {{reducing}} the dependency on fossil fuel, efforts have been gathered to develop electric vehicle (EV) for the past decades. Technology of electric vehicles (EV) has been initialized in developed countries. However, the latter have different geographical and environmental conditions. Therefore, the system of EV cannot be utilized directly in this country. The controller of an EV functions by utilizing a potentiometer; supplying {{a certain amount of}} voltage from the batteries to the motor by driver’s force applied to the acceleration pedal. This action generates a huge amount of heat due to the internal resistance of the controller (e. g. potentiometer). In order for an EV to operate at optimum condition, temperature of the controller has to be maintained at a certain limit. Hence an effective <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is required to be designed to fulfill the above condition.

Two lines of action were explored: innovative Personal <b>Cooling</b> <b>Systems</b> (PCS) and Personal Monitoring Equipment (PME). PME refers to sensors affixed to the worker that warn of an approaching heat stress condition, thereby preventing it. Three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> were investigated: Pre-Chilled or Forced-Air System (PCFA), Umbilical Fluid-Chilled System (UFCS), and Passive Vest System (PVS).

Base case economic parameters were used to evaluate the optimum system for each of the four general <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> followed by a sensitivity study for each parameter. Comparison of energy and water consumption follows from the results of the performance model, while comparison of environmental impacts is mostly qualitative. Some quantitative modelling was performed for the environmental effects of thermal discharges from once-through systems, fogging from wet cooling towers and water consumption from the ponds, wet towers and once-through. The results of the optimization models of each of the systems are compared on the basis of: performance - discrete distributions of environmental conditions and transient simulation; economics - using base case scenarios and sensitivity values to arrive at costs expressed in terms of production costs, annualized costs and present value costs; energy and water consumption; and environmental effects. The once-through systems were found to be the least expensive of the four systems, the most energy efficient, but potentially the most environmentally damaging. On the other extreme, dry cooling towers are the most environmentally sound while being the most expensive and least energy efficient. Finally, the results of the economic optimization are compared with results from previous comparative studies. Originally presented as a thesis (M. S.), M. I.

40|$|Closed-cycle <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are an {{increasingly}} common technology {{used to provide}} the necessary heat rejection for steam electric power plants. Environmental and regulatory trends have made these systems—both wet and dry cooling—the nearly universal cooling option for newly-constructed power plants. California reflects this trend as well, with new and repowered facilities adopting this approach and reducing impingement and entrainment impacts to California’s coastal waters. Unlike screening technologies, closed-cycle systems, as a retrofit technology, will more broadly affect a facility’s operation and may trigger other environmental effects that may require mitigation of their own. These effects may be more pronounced at an aging facility that is less efficient and more susceptible to process changes. This chapter provides general background information on the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> closed-cycle <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> their function and some secondary effects of their use as a retrofit technology. 2. 0 HEAT TRANSFER The function <b>of</b> any <b>cooling</b> technology is to transfer waste heat from the turbine to the environment as efficiently as possible.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the thermal {{behavior}} and fluid-dynamic systems, vapor compression refrigeration and its components (heat exchangers, expansion devices, compressors, connecting pipes, pumps and pressure vessels). Topics discussed throughout this thesis arise from the growing interest in refrigerants friendly environment as well as different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> for vapor compression has motivated the research group of the CTTC (Centre for Heat Transfer Technology) to carry out major research efforts as well as participate in several projects with national and European institutions. The information contained in this thesis represents a summary of work performed by the author in recent years but also includes many of the contributions made by other members of CTTC. This thesis {{has led to the}} publication of several articles in international conferences. The main achievement of this thesis was the development of a numerical tool based on several subroutines flexibility to study different cooling Systemas vapor compression. The entire digital infrastructure has been the result of attaching specific numerical resolutions of each element of the cycle with the overall resolution algorithm. The simulations have been oriented to the study of thermodynamic cycle as well as to study some relevant aspects of the elements. In addition to the numerical results has been carried out important experimental work in the CTTC facilities in order to validate numerical models. The author has been fully involved in the process of data acquisition and has collaborated {{in the development of the}} units. The thesis is structured into five chapters plus a final conclusions and future actions. The first chapter, the introduction puts the reader in regard to the problematic situation, the history <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> and objectives. The second presents the mathematical formulation and numerical methodology used in the simulation of the different elements and all <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> The third study presents the numerical code verification. The fourth focuses on the validation of models with experimental results. And finally the fifth presents a suite of parametric studies and analysis. The numerical simulation code implemented has proven to be a flexible tool as various aspects of the steam compression systems have been successfully simulated and studied. It has also proven a reliable and good level of accuracy as the numerical results have been simulated properly the various experimental data compared. Postprint (published version...|$|R
