40|$|The {{number of}} micro and nano {{satellite}} projects is expanding. Main {{focus is on}} providing these small satellites with the same capabilities as today's larger satellites. In the field of propulsion, efforts are on miniaturization of the on-board propulsion system. This though presents major challenges to the designers. TNO Defence, Security and Safety, Delft University of Technology and University of Twente have faced those challenges, developing a commercial off-the-shelf cold gas micro-propulsion system, the T 3 ?PS capable of providing a pre-set thrust level in the range 1 to 10 mN. It {{is based on a}} highly integrated feeding and thruster system and cool gas generators, which contain nitrogen stored in solid form. The Delfi-n 3 Xt <b>triple</b> <b>unit</b> cubesat, scheduled for launch in 2011 / 12, has been chosen as platform to test the capabilities of the T 3 ?PS. To satisfy the Delfi-n 3 Xt requirements the T 3 ?PS is designed to provide a thrust of maximum 6 mN, minimum impulse bit less than 0. 1 mNs and a total impulse of 0. 7 Ns. To qualify the T 3 ?PS and verify that it meets the requirements, an extensive test campaign has been devised by TNO.

40|$|One of {{the main}} Cubesat bus {{limitations}} is the available on-board power. The maximum power obtained using body mounted solar panels and advanced triple junction solar cells on a <b>triple</b> <b>unit</b> Cubesat is typically less than 10 W. The Cubesat performance and the mission scenario opened to these small satellite systems could be greatly enhanced by an increase of the available power. This paper describes the design and realization of a modular deployable solar panel system for Cubesats, consisting of a modular hinge and spring system that can be potentially used on-board single (I U), double(2 U), triple (3 U) and six units (6 U) Cubesats. The size of each solar panels {{is the size of}} a lateral Cubesat surface. The system developed is the basis for a SADA (Solar Array Drive Assembly), in which a maneuvering capability is added to the deployed solar array in order to follow the apparent motion of the sun. The system design trade-off is discussed, comparing different deployment concepts and architectures, leading to the final selection for the modular design. A prototype of the system has been realized for a 3 U Cubesat, consisting of two deployable solar panel systems, made of three solar panels each, for,a total of six deployed solar panels. The deployment system is based on a plastic fiber wire and thermal cutters, guaranteeing a suitable level of reliability. A test-bed for the solar panel deployment testing has been developed, supporting the solar array during deployment reproducing the dynamical situation in orbit. The results of the deployment system testing are discussed, including the design and realization of the test-bed, the mechanical stress given to the solar cells by the deployment accelerations and the overall system performance. The maximum power delivered by the system is about 50. 4 W BOL, greatly enhancing the present Cubesat solar array performance. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Spacecraft, {{returning}} back to Earth, {{experience a}} very harsh environment during {{the encounter with}} the particles of the atmosphere. One of the major issues of the atmospheric entry is the extreme aerodynamic heating and the exothermic chemical reactions due to the gas-surface interaction at hypersonic free stream velocities. There is a constant effort by the space agencies to increase {{the understanding of the}} re-entry flight dynamics to optimize the spacecraft and especially its thermal protection system design. During the design process, ground tests and numerical tools are extensively used for their low cost and controlled environment abilities. However, real flight tests are indispensable for ground test and numerical tools validation. Due to high costs, such missions are rarely launched and thus there is an increasing interest in small affordable entry probes. Such platforms, once matured enough, may serve as an easily accessible tool to produce experimental data. It is the aim of this dissertation to propose tools to improve ground test capabilities {{and on the other hand}} to present the design, and using the developed tools, the testing of aerothermodynamic experimental payloads to collect flight data with a small entry probe. QARMAN (QubeSat for Aerothermodynamic Research and Measurements on AblatioN) is a <b>triple</b> <b>unit</b> CubeSat with ablative and ceramic thermal protection systems. It will perform an atmospheric entry with 7. 7 km/s and a peak heat flux of 1. 7 MW/m 2. The aim of the in-flight experiments is to retrieve real flight data on ablator efficiency (temperature, pressure, recession) and temperature-pressure measurements for transition on the side panels. The peculiar squared geometry of QARMAN led to the development of a Flight-to-Ground Duplication methodology accounting for spacecraft geometries. It allows duplicating fully the stagnation region of a spacecraft with an arbitrary geometry in subsonic plasma wind tunnels. As a requirement of this methodology, free stream characterization techniques, specifically enthalpy measurement techniques are introduced. Experimental and numerical databases are built. A thorough ablation characterization campaign in VKI Plasmatron is conducted to provide input for building material response models. The cork P 50 ablator is studied in terms of surface and sub-surface temperatures, emissivity, mass loss, char-pyrolysis layers, outgassing species and recession and swelling profiles. Similar in-flight experiments are proposed for QARMAN flight for in-depth temperature and pressure. Methods to build models for advanced data treatment are proposed. A full picture of post-flight analysis strategy is described for each study to relate the ground tools and flight data...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been several {{experimental}} and numerical researches on transparent envelope components that integrate phase change materials (PCMs). To address some of the drawbacks of these systems, new prototypes were created and their summer performance was monitored under Cfa climatic conditions (Turin, Italy). The proposed glazing system comprises a <b>triple</b> glazing <b>unit</b> with a thermotropic layer placed on the outer side, acting as a switchable shading system capable of regulating the phase transition of the PCM. The PCM is tested in both the inner and the outer cavity of the glazing, alternately. In this paper, the summer performance of these responsive glazing systems is reported, complementing the assessment of their performance under winter conditions, which was previously presented in another paper (Bianco et al., 2017). Two additional systems were also tested in parallel for reference purposes: a <b>triple</b> glazing <b>unit</b> with a thermotropic layer only, and a reference <b>triple</b> glazing <b>unit.</b> Direct solar transmission was assessed, and the correlation between glazing temperature and solar transmission coefficient of the thermotropic layer, when coupled with the <b>triple</b> glazing <b>unit,</b> was derived. The solar transmission {{as a function of the}} external surface temperature of the PCM glazing units was also evaluated. The energy performance was assessed by means of a long-term evaluation in addition to daily analyses during cloudy and sunny days. The capability of the aforementioned technologies to improve indoor thermal comfort was investigated, with the effect of the transmitted solar radiation impinging on the occupants also taken into account. The results highlight that the integration of a thermotropic layer in a <b>triple</b> glazing <b>unit</b> allows the cooling load through the transparent component to be reduced by one third when compared to a traditional <b>triple</b> glazing <b>unit.</b> The overall energy performance was found to be primarily affected by the position of the PCM; not only during winter season, but especially in summer, the PCM completed the phase transition only when placed in the outermost cavity. The thermal comfort conditions were improved, when evaluated in terms of traditional PMV, regardless of the position of the PCM layer. However, when the influence of the direct solar radiation impinging on the occupants was taken into account, the solution with the PCM layer located in the inner cavity presented a better performance...|$|R

Reasons for limiting the legal trailer configurations include both safety concerns and the impracticality of designing and constructing roads that can accommodate the larger wheelbase of these vehicles and the larger minimum turning radii associated with them.
