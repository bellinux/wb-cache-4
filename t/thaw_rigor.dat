40|$|The {{effect of}} {{low-voltage}} electrical stimulation (56 V effective voltage, with polarity reversed every 10 s) on lamb carcasses stored forzen {{for one year}} was studied. Non-electrically stimulated carcasses frozen pre-rigor showed evidence of <b>thaw</b> <b>rigor</b> {{during the first six}} months of storage in weight loss, water holding capacity, and shear strength values. Electrical stimulation and pre-rigor conditioning prevented <b>thaw</b> <b>rigor</b> in the carcasses. No significant differences in protein solubility (in a 5 % NaCl solution) were observed between the carcasses in the different treatment groups during the frozen storage period. Oxidative rancidity levels remained low throughout storage, regardless of the treatment applied. Â© 1989. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|From {{technological}} {{point of}} view in the food industry has been obtained meat maturation using different methods: storage under controlled conditions, the use of enzymes or mechanical equipment tenderization musculature. Was also reported that electrical stimulation of carcasses immediately after slaughter procedure can increase the degree of maturation of the meat. Meat and meat products are subjected to reduce during chilling and freezing temperatures principal for reasons of conservation or meat packing. Particular attention must be paid to temperature control, especially before rigor mortis, knowing that too rapid cooling could lead to a cold shortening or <b>thaw</b> <b>rigor</b> during the thaw. During application of the electrostimulation process, occur physical and biochemical changes, meaning that this one has some effect on the technological properties of meat. It has obtained a reduction of maturation of beef with the electrostimulation of half-carcasses of cattle, verified by the increase of non-protein nitrogen in meat. The same time it has been considerably improved the texture and firmness of the muscles, which allows the use of beef in fast food products (ready to cook). Researches have revealed the conclusion that the use of the portable device for electrostimulation, in the described conditions, has induced positive transformations improving meat quality of adult beef...|$|E
40|$|Sharks {{caught in}} {{tropical}} Australian waters occasionally exhibit tough texture. Two species of Carcharinid shark, originally {{known as the}} sorrah shark (Carcharinus sorrah) and the black spot shark (Carcharinus tilstoni), compose {{the majority of the}} catch. Experiments were conducted to identify the cause of tough texture and to improve the overall quality of the catch. The possibility that a cold shock reaction may occur was investigated by observing the contraction of fillets under a range of temperature conditions before freezing. The effect of on-board handling practices were evaluated using frozen shark fillets, which had been stored prior to freezing in refrigerated seawater at different rigor stages, temperatures and times as trunks. Fillets were analyzed for nucleotides, lactate, thaw pH, sarcomere length and raw and cooked shear force values. The existence of <b>thaw</b> <b>rigor</b> was also investigated. There was little difference in the texture between the individual strips of a fillet exposed to different temperatures but there were significant differences between individual sharks. A cold shock reaction could not be demonstrated in these species. The main influences on texture were of biological origin. The species, sex and size were found to have significant links with texture of fillets. The quality of the fillets deteriorated quicker during the warmer season and were at their worst if the trunks were kept on deck till post-rigor or held in 15 degree C refrigerated seawater before freezin...|$|E
