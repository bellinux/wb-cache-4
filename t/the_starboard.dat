5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her side. Most of <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side is present, but {{severely}} compacted.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{flew into}} the mountain at an angle of 15 to 20 degrees, with <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side towards the mountain. The aircraft was ascending at a seven-degree angle, plus/minus one degree. The tip of <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> wing {{was the first to}} hit the mountain, followed by engine number four (the right-most). The engine was immediately torn off and the aircraft started to rotate. The aircraft started being torn in the back rib of <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> wing. Then the nose and port wing from engine number two (the inner) hit a depression in the mountain-face, causing engine number one to loosen from its nacelle and the port wing to break between the engines. At the same time the aircraft's body was broken in two. The aircraft's forward movement stopped, the wreck pieces rotated with the vertical stabilizer away from the mountain-side, the port wing caught on fire and exploded {{and the rest of the}} aircraft fell down the slope. On the way down, <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> wing caught on fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} the He 111Z had the pilot and his {{controls}} in the port fuselage only. The controls themselves and essential equipment were all that remained in <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> section. The aircraft had a crew of seven; a pilot, first mechanic, radio operator and gunner in the port fuselage, and the observer, second mechanic and gunner in <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> fuselage.|$|E

5|$|On 20 September 1958, Vulcan VX770 {{was flown}} by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine {{performance}} sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. It flew {{along the main}} runway then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, during which <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> wing disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three occupants of a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.|$|E
5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung barely out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, barely clearing the rudder. <b>The</b> <b>starboard</b> battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E

5|$|Four Type 94 high-angle fire-control {{directors}} were fitted {{to control the}} Type 89 guns. The two controlling the port-side guns were adjacent to their guns while <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> {{directors were}} mounted fore and aft on the island. They could control all of the forward and rear guns respectively as necessary. Type 22 and Type 13 air search radars may have been fitted.|$|E
5|$|In late February 1944, Scherf {{took part}} in a sortie over Axis {{occupied}} territory with Squadron Leader Howie Clevelend; Scherf flew the leading aircraft of the two. The pair attacked an Axis airfield at St Yan, France, and successfully destroyed three aircraft on the ground. Soon after, the two pilots spotted a Heinkel He 111Z twin-fuselage glider tug towing two Gotha Go 242 gliders. Scherf and Clevelend attacked the party, with Clevelend firing first and destroying one of the gliders. Scherf then destroyed the second glider, before the pair assaulted the Heinkel. In the first pass, Scherf set <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> engine ablaze while Clevelend hit <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side. Scherf made a second firing pass, before the Heinkel spiralled to the ground with three of its five engines on fire. This action was Scherf's final sortie of his tour. The pair were credited with shooting down three aircraft in this operation, with an additional three others damaged or destroyed on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Prince of Wales fired unopposed {{until she}} began a port turn at 05:57, when Prinz Eugen took her under fire. After Hood {{exploded}} at 06:01, the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on Prince of Wales, with 15-inch, 8-inch and 5.9-inch guns. A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as Prince of Wales manoeuvred through {{the wreckage of}} Hood. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side of the compass platform and killed {{the majority of the}} personnel there. The navigating officer was wounded, but Captain Leach was unhurt. Casualties were caused by the fragments from the shell's ballistic cap and the material it dislodged in its diagonal path through the compass platform. A 15-inch diving shell penetrated the ship's side below the armour belt amidships, failed to explode and came to rest in the wing compartments on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side of the after boiler rooms. The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} armament for Montana and {{her sisters}} was to be 20 /54 cal guns housed in 10 turrets along the island of the battleship; five on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side and five on the port. These guns, designed specifically for the Montanas, were to be the replacement for the /38 cal secondary gun batteries then in widespread use with the US Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} most {{damaging}} attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded {{on the port}} side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fireroom and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.|$|E

5|$|Following the operation, Seydlitz and {{the other}} heavy units of the High Seas Fleet {{returned}} to the North Sea. On 11–12 September, Seydlitz {{and the rest of}} the I Scouting Group covered a minefield laying operation off Terschelling. On 24 November, the ship ran aground in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, but was quickly refloated. On 4 December, while exiting the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, Seydlitz became entangled in one of the net barriers. Divers had to remove the tangled nets from <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> screws.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side of the cabin just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of the}} cabin as had been previously thought.

5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E
