5|$|Temperatures Rising {{was one of}} two sitcoms {{that the}} ABC network premiered in its 1972–73 prime time schedule, the other being The Paul Lynde Show. Both series were {{produced}} and developed by William Asher and his partner Harry Ackerman for Ashmont Productions and Screen Gems, which had scored a major success for the network with Bewitched, a fantasy sitcom that first aired in 1964 starring Asher's wife, Elizabeth Montgomery. Asher and Screen Gems made a deal with ABC to cancel Bewitched a year earlier than contracts stipulated, thereby allowing them <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the two new sitcoms. Ackerman served as executive producer and Asher as producer.|$|E
5|$|The Nile {{has been}} the {{lifeline}} of its region for much of human history. The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone {{in the history of}} human civilization. Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile valley {{through the end of the}} Middle Pleistocene some 120,000 years ago. By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region.|$|E
5|$|When the CCP {{entered the}} First United Front to fight warlords and unite China from 1924–27 with the Guomindang (GMD), the each party {{established}} their own women’s department during this time. However, the United Front {{ended with the}} White Terror (1927), where the GMD launched an attack to purge the communists and laborers. The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule. These territories were called soviets, and were the places the CCP fled to following the White Terror {{because they were not}} {{under the control of the}} GMD. The GMD championed traditional Confucian ideals about women, and they established the New Life Movement, which sought to counter the gender role espoused by the CCP with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the GMD. The CCP's time in the soviets from 1927–1945 also gave them <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the skills for organizing federations and governing, which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later.|$|E

5|$|Its royal {{occupant}} {{may very}} well have made York House the pinnacle of Brettingham's career. Built during the 1760s, it was one of his last grand houses. His last country-house commission was at Packington Hall, Warwickshire. In 1761, he published his plans of Holkham Hall, calling himself the architect, which led critics, including Horace Walpole, to decry him as a purloiner of Kent's designs. Brettingham died in 1769 at his house outside St. Augustine's Gate, Norwich, and was buried in the aisle of the parish church. Throughout his long career, Brettingham did much to popularise the Palladian movement. His clients included a Royal Duke and at least twenty-one assorted peers and peeresses. He is not a household name today largely because his provincial work was heavily influenced by Kent and Burlington, and unlike his contemporary Giacomo Leoni he did not develop, or was not given <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop,</b> a strong personal stamp to his work on country houses. Ultimately, he and many of his contemporary architects were eclipsed by the designs of Robert Adam. Adam remodelled Brettingham's York House in 1780 and, in addition to Kedleston Hall, went on to replace James Paine as architect at Nostell Priory, Alnwick Castle, and Syon House. In spite of this, Adam and Paine remained great friends; Brettingham's relationships with his fellow architects are unrecorded.|$|E

5|$|With {{both sides}} {{exhausted}} from the fighting {{the night of}} 5/6 October was less eventful than expected, and the Australians used <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> their position. To add further depth to their defences and to probe the Chinese positions, Taylor ordered the Australians to capture the central remaining Chinese position, the Sierra feature—a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of Maryang San and the Hinge—the next day. Meanwhile, the Fusiliers would renew their attack on Hill 217. The southern approach to Hill 217 had proved to be too strongly defended by the Chinese and {{it became obvious that}} if it was to be overcome Taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders. To do this the high ground to the north-west of Maryang San, known as the Hinge, would be vital. Indeed, adjacent to Hill 217, the Hinge dominated it from the north. As such for the next assault, planned for the morning, the Fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack the Hinge from the east, using the Australian positions on Maryang San as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on Hill 217.|$|E
