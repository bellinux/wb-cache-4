5|$|When World War II in Europe ended, Potthast was in Achensee, Austria and, after {{learning}} {{of the death of}} Himmler on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>on</b> 23 May 1945, went into hiding, living temporarily with Eleonore Pohl in Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria. In June/July 1945, she was arrested there by members of the U.S. Army and interrogated for several days in Munich. Margarete and Himmler's daughter, Gudrun Burwitz, did not learn of her half-siblings until after the war. When she tried to make contact with them, Potthast refused. She lived in Theissendorf and kept in contact with the family of Himmler's older brother, Gebhard, as well as Himmler's former close confidant, Karl Wolff, until the 1950s.|$|E

Newstalk ZB has maintained a long-running first place in the ratings under successive breakfast hosts Paul Holmes and Mike Hosking, with a 13.4 percent station share and a weekly cumulative audience of 178 thousand listeners in the latest Q2-14 survey for August to September 2014.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, Gordon Lightfoot was {{the victim}} of a death hoax {{originating}} from Twitter, when then-CTV journalist David Akin posted on Twitter and Facebook that Lightfoot had died. Lightfoot was at a dental appointment at the time the rumors spread and found out when listening to <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>on</b> his drive home. Lightfoot dispelled those rumors by phoning Charles Adler of CJOB, the DJ and radio station he heard reporting his demise, and did an interview expressing that he was alive and well. In 2012, Lightfoot continued to tour, telling a sold-out crowd June 15 at Ottawa's National Arts Centre that he still performs sixty times a year. Lightfoot played two shows at the NAC after his induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.|$|E

The 2005 match was organised as a kind of security test in the run-up to the likely possibility that both teams, with socially polar fan-bases, would qualify for and be drawn against one another in a near-future Setanta Cup competition.|$|E

However, after delivering lectures at Oxford University and Cambridge University on similar topics she re-considered her choice.

500|$|Nash's {{rendition}} of [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] was released exclusively in Jamaica by Federal Records on 23 February 1973.

The following year, CBS Records International released it in South Africa, but instead with [...] "Ooh Baby You've Been Good to Me" [...] replacing the previously mentioned B-side.

500|$|Sinatra {{signed with}} Columbia Records {{as a solo}} artist on June 1, 1943 during the 1942–44 musicians' strike. Columbia Records re-released Harry James and Sinatra's August 1939 version of [...] "All or Nothing at All", which reached number 2 on June 2, {{and was on the}} best-selling list for 18 weeks. He {{initially}} had great success, [...] and performed on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>on</b> Your Hit Parade from February 1943 until December 1944, and on stage. Columbia wanted new recordings of their growing star as quickly as possible, so Alec Wilder was hired as an arranger and conductor for several sessions with a vocal group called the Bobby Tucker Singers. These first sessions were on June 7, June 22, August 5, and November 10, 1943. Of the nine songs recorded during these sessions, seven charted on the best-selling list. That year he also made his first solo nightclub appearance at New York's Riobamba, and a successful concert in the Wedgewood Room of the prestigious Waldorf-Astoria New York that year secured his popularity in New York high society. Sinatra released [...] "You'll Never Know", [...] "Close to You", [...] "Sunday, Monday, or Always" [...] and [...] "People Will Say We're in Love" [...] as singles. By the end of 1943 he was more popular in a Down Beat poll than Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Bob Eberly and Dick Haymes.|$|E

500|$|My Love: Essential Collection was {{released}} while Dion {{was on her}} Taking Chances World Tour. During her concert in Stockholm, Sweden on 7 June 2008, Dion recorded a live version of [...] "My Love", which was confirmed {{to be the first}} single from the compilation. The song premiered on <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>on</b> 22 September 2008 and a digital single {{was released}} the next day, accompanied by a live music video. Chuck Taylor, senior editor of Billboard, said that [...] "My Love" [...] was an inspired choice from the album and complimented Linda Perry's composition and Dion's delivery of the song, calling it highly emotive ballad about ache and uncertainty. After [...] "My Love" [...] debuted on the US Adult Contemporary chart, Dion became the artist with the most adult contemporary hits in the 2000s, with [...] "My Love" [...] being her sixteenth entry of the decade. The song peaked at number fifteen. The next single, [...] "I'm Alive" [...] was remixed by Laurent Wolf and released in October 2008 to radio to promote the album in France, instead of [...] "My Love." [...] In January 2009, new remixes of [...] "I'm Alive" [...] by Maurice Joshua were sent to the US clubs. They reached number thirty-five on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. [...] "I'm Alive" [...] was originally released as a single from A New Day Has Come in 2002 and peaked at number seven in France and number six on the US Adult Contemporary chart.|$|E
500|$|Peter Lavezzoli, {{author of}} The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, has written of Harrison's first solo single: [...] "'My Sweet Lord' was {{everything}} that {{people wanted to}} hear in November 1970: shimmering harmonies, lustrous acoustic guitars, a solid Ringo Starr backbeat, and an exquisite [...] guitar solo." [...] Reviewing the single for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau called the track [...] "sensational". In an era when songs by Radha Krishna Temple and adaptations of the Christian hymns [...] "Oh Happy Day" [...] and [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] were all worldwide hits, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone observed that the substituting of Harrison's [...] "Hare Krishna" [...] refrain for the trivial [...] "Doo-lang, doo-lang, doo-lang"s of [...] "He's So Fine" [...] was [...] "a sign of the times". John Lennon told a reporter, [...] "Every time I put <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>on,</b> it's 'Oh my Lord' – I'm beginning to think {{there must be a}} God." [...] In his December 1970 album review for NME, Alan Smith bemoaned the apparent lack of a UK single release for [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and noted that the song [...] "seems to owe something" [...] to [...] "He's So Fine". To Gerson, it was an [...] "obvious re-write" [...] of the Chiffons hit, and within two months US music publisher Bright Tunes had served a writ on Harrison citing unauthorised copyright infringement. In a January 1971 review for NME, Derek Johnson expressed surprise at Apple's delay in releasing the single in the UK, before declaring: [...] "In my opinion, this record – finally and irrevocably – establishes George as a talent equivalent to either Lennon or McCartney." ...|$|E
