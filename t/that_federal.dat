5|$|Actual {{planning}} for I-359 commenced in 1961, and by 1971, the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) announced <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> funding would be sought for its construction. Planning for the corridor continued throughout the 1970s, only to stall briefly due to complications with the required {{environmental impact assessment}} associated with the project. By 1976, it was announced I-359 would have an exit both at 35th Street and 15th Street to improve access to both the University of Alabama and Stillman College.|$|E
5|$|Hoover was {{defeated}} for re-election by Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Roosevelt was convinced <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> activism {{was needed to}} reverse the country's economic decline. In his first hundred days in office, the Congress enacted at Roosevelt's request a series of bills designed to strengthen the banking system, including the Emergency Banking Act, the Glass–Steagall Act (which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), and the 1933 Banking Act. The Congress also passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act to stabilize the nation's agricultural industry.|$|E

5|$|The ruling {{has been}} criticized for its {{intrusion}} into state affairs and its basis in previous rulings. Prior to Santosky, the realm of family life had been left to the states. Because of this, Santoskys direct intervention into the affairs of state interests was seen as contrary to United States v. Yazell, which held <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> courts should only overturn state statutes when those statutes cannot adequately serve a clear and substantial federal interest.|$|E
5|$|Urban renewal {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} federal grants. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which created the NRHP, requires <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> agencies give consideration to the opinions of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in assessing the impact their actions will have on listed properties and consider alternatives to any action that would destroy or significantly affect them. The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for urban renewal.|$|E
5|$|Bell alleged in his 2003 {{lawsuit that}} the {{government}} employees had actually planted an illegal GPS tracking device in his car months before the one ostensibly allowed by the October 2000 warrant, at least as early as Bell's April 2000 release from prison. The information from that prior device could not be used, however, {{because there was no}} warrant allowing it to be planted. Bell also alleged <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> government employees had also illegally planted a GPS tracking transmitter in a vehicle he drove in June 1998, one which the government never disclosed. Bell further stated that his defense lawyers colluded to keep Bell from being able to demand disclosure of all such secretly planted devices.|$|E
50|$|Other delegates argued <b>that</b> if <b>federal</b> {{judges were}} {{involved}} in the law-making process through participation on the council of revision, their objectivity as judges in later deciding on the constitutionality of those laws could be impaired.

5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|During the Reagan years, Kemp and his {{followers}} ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth. These tax cuts have been credited by conservatives for the economic growth from 1983 to 1990, which by 1996 {{had become one of}} the longest expansions in American history. Kemp notes <b>that</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming, prisons, medical treatment, and credit card use.|$|E
5|$|In October 1849 the {{southern}} interests held a convention to discuss railroads in Memphis, {{in response to}} a convention in St. Louis earlier that fall which discussed a northern route. The Memphis convention overwhelmingly advocated the construction of a route beginning there, to connect with an El Paso, Texas to San Diego, California line. Disagreement arose only over the issue of financing. The convention president, Matthew Fontaine Maury of Virginia, preferred strict private financing, whereas John Bell and others thought <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> land grants to railroad developers would be necessary.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to his work in Soviet studies, Löwenthal was noted for his defense of the Federal Republic. Löwenthal felt <b>that</b> the <b>Federal</b> Republic was the most democratic government in German history, and criticized the left-wing philosopher Jürgen Habermas for utopianism when the latter asserted in the 1970s <b>that</b> the <b>Federal</b> Republic was not democratic enough.|$|R
5|$|In late May 1938, Chandler's {{campaign}} manager publicly claimed <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> relief agencies—especially the Works Progress Administration—were openly working for Barkley's re-election. Although the WPA administrator in Kentucky denied the charges, veteran reporter Thomas Lunsford Stokes launched {{an investigation of}} the agency's activities in the state and eventually raised twenty-two charges of political corruption in a series of eight articles covering the Barkley-Chandler campaign. Federal WPA administrator Harry Hopkins claimed an internal investigation of the agency refuted all but two of Stokes' charges, but Stokes was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1939 for his investigation. In the wake of the investigation Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939 to limit the WPA's involvement in future elections.|$|E
5|$|It was {{becoming}} clear <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> intervention {{was required to}} settle the dispute, despite the general policy of the Grant administration {{to stay out of}} the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of election year violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred the dispute back to the State Legislature.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1980s crimes {{involving}} {{computers were}} dealt with using existing laws. The first computer crimes were {{recognized in the}} 1978 Florida Computer Crimes Act, which included legislation against the unauthorized modification or deletion of data on a computer system. Over {{the next few years}} the range of computer crimes being committed increased, and laws were passed to deal with issues of copyright, privacy/harassment (e.g., cyber bullying, cyber stalking, and online predators) and child pornography. It was not until the 1980s <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> laws began to incorporate computer offences. Canada was the first country to pass legislation in 1983. This was followed by the US Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986, Australian amendments to their crimes acts in 1989 and the British Computer Misuse Act in 1990.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{have also}} argued that {{inconsistent}} application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair. Trevor W. Morrison, for example, claims that circuit splits create potential due process conflicts if criminal defendants are unaware that their behavior constitutes criminal activity in that circuit. An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also suggested that there {{is the potential for}} the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|E
5|$|The {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. This {{was the first time}} the new government had been directly opposed, and through a clear show of federal authority, Washington established the principle <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> law is the supreme law of the land, and demonstrated that the federal government had both the ability and willingness to suppress violent resistance to the nation's laws. The government's response to the rebellion was, therefore, viewed by the Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. This also was one of only two times in U.S. history that an incumbent president has personally commanded the military in the field; James Madison would command an army in 1814.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Pribilof Islands dispute, an {{outbreak}} of mob violence in New Orleans became an international incident. After New Orleans police chief David Hennessy led a crackdown against local mafiosi, he was assassinated on October 14, 1890. After the alleged murderers were found not guilty on March 14, 1891, a mob stormed the jail and lynched eleven of them. Since many of those killed were Italian citizens the Italian minister, Saverio Fava, protested to Blaine. Blaine explained <b>that</b> <b>federal</b> officials could not control how state officials deal with criminal matters, and Fava announced that he would withdraw the legation back to Italy. Blaine and Harrison believed the Italians' response to be an overreaction, and did nothing. Tensions slowly cooled, and after nearly a year, the Italian minister returned to the United States to negotiate an indemnity. After some internal dispute—Blaine wanted conciliation with Italy, Harrison was reluctant to admit fault—the United States agreed to pay an indemnity of $25,000, and normal diplomatic relations resumed.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the possibility that}} the Taylor rule should be formulated as a threshold process such <b>that</b> the <b>Federal</b> Reserve acts more aggressively in some circumstances than in others. It seems reasonable <b>that</b> the <b>Federal</b> Reserve would act more aggressively when inflation is high than when it is low. Similarly, it might be expected <b>that</b> the <b>Federal</b> Reserve responds more to a negative than a positive output gap. Although these specifications receive some empirical support, we find that a modified threshold model that is consistent with "opportunistic" monetary policy makes significant progress toward explaining Federal Reserve behavior.
