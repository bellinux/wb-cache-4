Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>that</b> Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to converse directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an [...] "aggressive act" [...] that shows no {{consideration}} for loved ones left behind. The assertion prompted criticism, but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life. A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call. After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get {{through the rest of the}} month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund. The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days. Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. <b>The</b> <b>advice</b> <b>that</b> the Detroit caller had given – [...] "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" [...] encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.|$|E
500|$|On 18 October 1869, {{a warrant}} for a {{commission}} of inquiry into {{the state of the}} College was established. The warrant issued on the behalf of the Duke of Norfolk, stated: [...] "that it is desirable that the College of Arms should be visited, and an inquiry instituted with the view of ascertaining whether the Rules and Orders for the good government of the said College... are duly obeyed and fulfilled... and whether by change of circumstances or any other cause, any new Laws, Ordinances or Regulations are necessary to be made... for the said College." [...] The commission had three members: Lord Edward Fitzalan-Howard (the Deputy Earl Marshal), Sir William Alexander (Queen's Counsel) and Edward Bellasis (a Sergeant at Law). Sir Bernard Burke (of the famous Burke's Peerage), at the time Ulster King of Arms, gave the commission <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>that</b> the College should: [...] "be made a Government Department, let its Officers receive fixed salaries from Government, and let all its fees be paid into the public exchequer. This arrangement would, I am sure, be self-supporting and would raise at once the character of the Office and the status of the Heralds." [...] Burke's suggestion for reform was the same arrangement that had already been applied to the Lord Lyon Court in Scotland in 1867, and was to be applied to his own office in 1871. However unlike the Lyon Court, which was a court of law and part of the Scottish Judiciary, the College of Arms has always been an independent corporate body overseen by the Earl Marshal. While the Lord Lyon depended on the Government for its reforms and statutes, the College has always been able to carry out changes from within itself. The commission also drew attention to the fees, annulments and library of the College, as well as the general modernisation of the chapter as a whole. When the commission made its report in 1870, it recommended many changes, and these were duly made in another warrant dated 27 April 1871. Burke's recommendation, however, was not implemented.|$|E

Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies wrote back to Bligh, his instructions being received on 31 December 1807.

2500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Andrea {{had decided}} that his uncle {{would be better off}} in the Italian climate, and three outside {{physicians}} were called in for their opinions. Their report concluded with <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>that</b> he leave for Italy without delay. [...] But, as Andrea began to make plans for his uncle's journey to and upkeep in Bergamo, he was forced by the Paris Prefect of Police to have his uncle undergo another examination by other physicians appointed by the Prefect. Their conclusion was the opposite of that of the previous doctors: [...] "we are of the opinion that the trip should be forbidden formally as offering very real dangers and being far from allowing hope of any useful result." [...] With that, the Prefect informed Andrea that Donizetti could not be moved from Ivry. Andrea saw little use in remaining in Paris. [...] He sought a final opinion from the three doctors practicing at the clinic, and on 30 August, they provided a lengthy report outlining step-by-step the complete physical condition of their declining patient, concluding that the rigours of travel—the jolting of the carriage, for example—could bring on new symptoms or complications impossible to treat on such a journey. Andrea left for Bergamo on 7 (or 8) September 1846 taking with him a partial score of Le duc d'Albe, the completed score of Rita, and a variety of personal effects, including jewelry.|$|E
2500|$|She {{performed}} 26 {{times at}} the Royal Albert Hall in London between 1898 and 1926. Although she called Covent Garden [...] "my artistic home", her appearances there became less frequent in the 20th century. One reason for this was {{that she did not}} get on well with Sir Thomas Beecham, who was in control of the opera house for much of the period from 1910 until her retirement. She said, [...] "I dislike Beecham and his methods", and he thought that while she had [...] "nearly all the attributes inseparable from great artistry ... she was wanting in a genuine spiritual refinement." [...] Another factor in her reduced appearances at Covent Garden was the appearance on the scene of Luisa Tetrazzini, a soprano ten years her junior, who became a great success in London and later in New York in roles previously associated with Melba. A third reason was her decision to spend more time in Australia. In 1909 she undertook what she called a [...] "sentimental tour" [...] of Australia, covering 10,000 miles (16,093km) and including many remote towns. In 1911 in partnership with the J. C. Williamson company, she appeared in an operatic season. Her attitude to her tour concerts and the audiences attending was summed up in <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>that</b> Clara Butt said Melba gave her apropos of a planned Australian tour: [...] "Sing 'em muck; it's all they can understand." [...] To another colleague and compatriot, Peter Dawson, she described his home city of Adelaide as [...] "that city of the three P's– Parsons, Pubs and Prostitutes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1816, Lays had the {{satisfaction}} of enjoying one final triumph in the comic opera Le rossignol by Louis-Sébastien Lebrun (1764–1829), set {{in the foothills of}} his native Pyrenees. Lays took one of his favourite stock parts, [...] "a bailiff in his fifties, a lover of good food and beautiful young women, naive and credulous, convinced of his own powers of seduction. The audience, at first amused and then enthralled, gave him a standing ovation which cheered his heart." [...] However, things subsequently took a turn for the worse. In 1817, the restored Intendant of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi, Papillon de la Ferté abolished all additional emoluments granted by Napoleon, leaving the singer to survive on his meagre salary from the school of music and the minimum pay from the Opéra, at the very time when his son, stricken with tuberculosis, required expensive medical treatment and his four daughters needed money for their dowries. Lays turned to Luigi Cherubini. Lays had repeatedly supported Cherubini when Napoleon had shown signs of dislike for the composer. Cherubini had now become one of the leading figures in the musical establishment under the Restoration. He immediately intervened on Lays's behalf, but all he could obtain from Ferté was <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>that</b> the singer should go {{on a tour of the}} provinces as a way of supplementing his income.Having obtained leave of absence, Lays appeared in Nancy (where performances were interrupted by the death of the leading soprano) and Strasbourg, where Lays himself was obliged to interrupt them with disastrous effects on his finances: he had been unexpectedly summoned back to Paris on the pretext he was urgently needed for rehearsals of a new opera, Les jeux floraux; in reality, the rehearsals only took place two months later. Lays then applied to the royal administration, insisting he should be granted some of the potential economic benefits provided by law, but, after the new opera's premiere, his demands received a blanket rejection. According to Quéruel, when he protested stridently about this decision, he was forced into unpaid leave from his theatrical activities in late 1818. He subsequently spent about two years of hardship, during which his need to provide a dowry for his eldest daughter Marie-Cécile forced him further into debt.|$|E
