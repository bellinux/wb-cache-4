5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in the Revolution, with at least twenty-nine having served in the Continental forces, most in {{positions}} of command. All but two or three had served in colonial or state government during their careers. The vast majority (about 75%) of the delegates were or had been members of the Confederation Congress, and many had been members of the Continental Congress during the Revolution. Several had been state governors. Just two delegates, Roger Sherman and Robert Morris, would be signatories <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the nation's founding documents: the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The coinage of Coenwulf {{follows the}} broad silver penny format {{established}} under Offa and his contemporaries. His very first coins {{are very similar}} to the heavy coinage of Offa's last three years, and since the mints at Canterbury and in East Anglia were under the control of Eadbert Praen and Eadwald respectively, these earliest pennies must be the product of the London mint. Before 798 the new tribrach type appeared, with a design consisting of three radial lines meeting at the centre. The tribrach design was introduced initially at London alone but soon spread to Canterbury after it was reconquered from the rebels. It was not struck in East Anglia, but there are tribrach pennies in the name of Cuthred, sub-king of Kent. Around 805 a new portrait coinage was introduced <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the southern mints. After around 810 a range of reverse designs was introduced, though several were common to many or all of the moneyers. From this date there is also evidence of a new mint, at Rochester in Kent.|$|E
25|$|The Southern Octavian {{is written}} in a Middle English dialect close {{to that of the}} {{southeast}} Midlands of England, as is Sir Launfal, although the problem of the direct borrowing of lines by Thomas Chestre in order to steal rhymes in other dialects, part of his “eclectic mode of composition”, is common <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> these poems. The verses of the Southern Octavian are of six lines, rhyming aaabab.|$|E

25|$|The {{incidence}} of cycles in Lie sphere geometry provides {{a simple solution}} to the problem of Apollonius. This problem concerns a configuration of three distinct circles (which may be points or lines): the aim is to find every other circle (including points or lines) which is tangent <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the original circles. For a generic configuration of circles, there are at most eight such tangent circles.|$|E
25|$|The first dismembered corpse {{was found}} in the Spring of 2010 which belonged to Sergei Berezovsky, an ex-partner of Alexander's mother, Irina Bychkova. In September of the same year two more dismembered corpses were found. Alexander Zhuplov, a local mentally ill man, was arrested for the murders on 19 September 2010. Zhuplov confessed <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the murders, of which he was found guilty of all three and sent to a mental institution.|$|E

25|$|An Apollonian gasket can be {{constructed}} as follows. Start with three circles C1, C2 and C3, each {{one of which is}} tangent to the other two (in the general construction, these three circles can be any size, {{as long as they have}} common tangents). Apollonius discovered that there are two other non-intersecting circles, C4 and C5, which have the property that they are tangent <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the original circles– these are called Apollonian circles (see Descartes' theorem). Adding the two Apollonian circles to the original three, we now have five circles.|$|E

25|$|Despite early {{campaign}} polls {{which showed}} an NDP lead, the party lost 59 seats {{on election night}} and fell back to third place in Parliament. By winning 44 seats Mulcair was able to secure the second best showing in the party's history, winning one more seat than Ed Broadbent managed in the 1988 election, but with a smaller share of the popular vote. During the election campaign, Mulcair's stance on the niqab issue contributed {{to a decline in}} the party's support in Quebec; NDP seat gains in Saskatchewan and British Columbia were offset by numerical losses in almost every other region, while in Alberta and Manitoba the party simply held on to its existing seats without gaining or losing. The party was locked out of the Atlantic Region and the Territories, and lost over half of its seats in Ontario including all of its seats in Toronto. In Quebec the NDP lost seats <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> the other major parties, namely the Liberals, Conservatives, and Bloc Québécois, though it managed to place second in both vote share (25.4%) and seats (16) behind the Liberals, who formed a majority government. Mulcair's leadership faced criticism following the election, particularly due to a moderate platform that the party was running on and Mulcair's promise to balance the federal budget while Liberal leader Justin Trudeau was promising to run a budget deficit in order to fund stimulus programs and higher social spending, a position which was perceived as allowing the Liberals to outflank the NDP on the left. Mulcair lost a leadership review vote held at the NDP's policy convention in Edmonton, Alberta on April 10, 2016. Consequently, his successor was to be chosen at a leadership election to be held no later than October 2017. On October 1, 2017 Jagmeet Singh won the leadership vote to head the party.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the consultation between Kerr, Charteris and Charles was maintained to ensure that the Queen and the British Parliament were not part of the discussion. Assistant Private Secretary to the Queen in 1975, Sir William Heseltine, who along with Charteris informed her of the dismissal, has maintained that it came as a surprise <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> them; that he considered Kerr's actions imprudent; and that he believed that this opinion was shared by Charteris. A memorandum by Sir Paul Hasluck of his conversation with Charteris supports this suggestion, and that disillusionment with Kerr's character led the Palace to apply pressure for his resignation. The Queen's opinion is unknown, but Heseltine has stated: [...] "I think she is an old and wily bird about her own views ... to the extent that I could divine what she felt, I think she felt the same ... I’m reasonably confident myself that she thought it could have been handled better.” ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the record}} neared {{completion}} by August 2003, the band performed {{for a short}} time for the armed forces in the Middle East and premiered more new songs at their Reading and Leeds sets. The trio shot small, home-made videos for several songs on Blink-182, as well as the official music video for [...] "Feeling This", the song they picked as the first single. The band spent time to finalize the CD booklet and album artwork in September. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so [...] "personal <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>three</b> <b>of</b> us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it." [...] The release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of Geffen Records, made calls asking, [...] "What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?" [...] DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as [...] "crazy stressful", with [...] "literally hours to turn [...] to have it come it out on time." [...] The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band's history, commenting, [...] "That was a good time in my life. I was smoking just enough weed and taking just enough pills." ...|$|E
