5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively <b>to</b> <b>conditions</b> in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Epsilon was {{the final}} of fifteen {{hurricane}}s within the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a cold front beneath an upper-level low, Epsilon formed on November29 about 915mi (1470km) east of Bermuda. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast the storm to transition into an extratropical cyclone within five days, due <b>to</b> <b>conditions</b> unfavorable for significant intensification. Epsilon continually defied forecasts, at first due to an unexpected loop to the southwest, and later due to retaining its strength despite cold waters and strong wind shear.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of the Vengeance force, by late 1942 the RAAF was aware that the type was obsolete and other Allied air forces' experiences had demonstrated that dive bombing was an inefficient tactic. Combat experience in Europe showed that dedicated dive bombers were highly vulnerable to attack from fighter aircraft, especially when preparing to dive on targets. Few USAAF officers regarded dive bombers as effective, though they were frequently used by the United States Navy. A USAAF squadron equipped with Douglas A-24 Banshee dive bombers was deployed to New Guinea in April 1942, but was withdrawn from combat at the end of May that year after flying only a few combat sorties. The USAAF regarded this type as unsuited <b>to</b> <b>conditions</b> in the theatre, though the US Navy operated it very successfully from its aircraft carriers as the Douglas SBD Dauntless. The USAAF preferred to use fighter-bombers and light bombers to support ground troops in New Guinea, fighter-bombers especially as they could strafe and skip bomb Japanese positions as well as employ dive-bombing tactics. Similarly, by late 1942 the RAAF preferred to use the light bombers that it was now beginning to receive to provide tactical support for the Army. An order for 150 Curtis Shrike dive bombers was cancelled after the first ten of these aircraft were delivered to Australia in November 1942, making the Vengeance the only dedicated dive bomber operated by the RAAF.|$|E

5|$|On 7 January 1983 amateur fossil hunter William J. Walker {{discovered}} a large claw, a phalanx bone, {{and part of}} a rib in Smokejacks Pit, a clay pit near Ockley in Surrey, England. The tip of the claw was missing, but Walker found it a week later. British palaeontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner examined the finds at the Natural History Museum of London and found more bones at the site on 7 February, but the entire skeleton could not be collected until May and June due <b>to</b> <b>conditions</b> at the pit. A team of eight museum staff members and several volunteers excavated two tonnes of matrix. Walker donated the claw to the museum, and the Ockley Brick Company (owners of the pit) donated the rest of the skeleton and provided equipment. The area had been explored for 200 years, but no similar remains had been found before.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{system from}} which Hurricane Alex {{developed}} was first discernible as a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June17, 2010. Over {{the next few}} days, most of its associated thunderstorm activity was embedded within the ITCZ. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned it {{as a candidate for}} tropical cyclone formation on June20, while it was crossing the Windward Islands into the southeastern Caribbean Sea; at the time, some upper-level wind shear was present, leading <b>to</b> <b>conditions</b> only marginally favorable for development. The system moved through the Caribbean, and on June21, it developed {{to the extent that the}} NHC assessed a 50%chance of development into a tropical depression within 48hours. The next day, however, the feature deteriorated as thunderstorm activity spread across the Greater Antilles, although the upper-level regime remained favorable for eventual redevelopment.|$|E
