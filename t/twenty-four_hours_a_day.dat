25|$|By 1994 some 6 {{million people}} were {{receiving}} television broadcasts via satellite, and the number was expected to increase rapidly {{throughout the rest of}} the decade. Cable television was even more prolific, with an estimated 12 to 15 million subscribers in 1994. Besides Doordarshan, Zee TV—an independent station broadcasting from Mumbai since 1992—uses satellite transmissions. In fact, because Doordarshan is the only network that is permitted to broadcast television signals domestically, Zee TV and other entrepreneurs broadcast their Indian-made videotapes via foreign transmitters. Other networks joining the fray are Cable News Network (1990); Asia Television Network (1991); Hong Kong-based Star TV (1991); Jain TV, near Bombay (1994); EL TV, a spin-off of Zee TV in Bombay (1994); HTV, an affiliate of the Hindustan Times in New Delhi (1994); and Sun TV, a Tamil language service in Chennai (1994).

This paper will describe the preliminary results of an Australian Research Council Linkage-Project conducted in conjunction with Helping Hand Aged Care Inc., Delfin Lend Lease and Spotless Services Limited. The research project used a multiple embedded case study research method to develop a comprehensive picture of the relationship between procurement processes, the post-occupancy provision of health services, and resident quality of life in three aged care facilities. The evidence presented will include a description of the research method and summary of the data collected through documentary analysis, observational studies and self-report surveys from two of the facilities used in the study. As with recent research into office environments (Leaman and Bordass, 2000), the findings indicate a strong link between the design of the physical environment and the capacity of service providers to provide efficient and effective health care. The findings further suggest that both the briefing and documentation phases are critical factors in the development of efficient and responsive physical environments. The research ultimately aims to provide economic benefits through improved worker productivity and a reduction in post occupancy alterations to the physical environment.
