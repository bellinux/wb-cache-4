5|$|Just as machinima can be {{the cause}} of legal dispute in {{copyright}} ownership and illegal use, it makes heavy use of intertextuality and raises the question of authorship. Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E
5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} {{that he is going}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of a wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E
50|$|Technobabble also {{occurs in}} soft science fiction, {{although}} {{here it is}} frequently just a throw-away {{part of the world}} and not dwelt on. Soft sci-fi generally prefers unobtainium or handwavium to technobabble, as it is less taxing on the reader and fits with the setting of <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> in <b>a</b> sci-fi setting as opposed <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about partially fictional science.|$|R

The following month, Groupon sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.|$|E
25|$|Giorgione also {{introduced}} a new range of subjects. Besides altarpieces and portraits he painted pictures that told no story, whether biblical or classical, or if they professed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> neglected the action and simply embodied in form and color moods of lyrical or romantic feeling, much as a musician might embody them in sounds. Innovating with the courage and felicity of genius, he had for a time an overwhelming influence on his contemporaries and immediate successors in the Venetian school, including Titian, Sebastiano del Piombo, Palma il Vecchio, il Cariani, Giulio Campagnola (and his brother), and even on his already eminent master, Giovanni Bellini. In the Venetian mainland, Giorgionismo strongly influenced Morto da Feltre, Domenico Capriolo, and Domenico Mancini.|$|E
25|$|NBC head Brandon Tartikoff (who {{had started}} his career in Chicago) gave an order for a two-hour movie, which had a {{theatrical}} release {{in a handful of}} U.S. theaters to invited guests only. Tartikoff also ordered 22 episodes which allowed Reininger and Adamson <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> with developing character arcs, and continuing stories (instead of episodic, self standing shows.). Two episodes were made every three weeks, with shooting taking up more than 12 hours in a day, seven days a week. By the second season, an average episode cost between $1.3 and 1.4 million (roughly the same as Miami Vice) because it was shot on location, set during the 1960s (requiring period-accurate props and costumes), and featured a large cast.|$|E

25|$|Other writers blamed either Pompey or Caesar. Plutarch did not {{indicate}} when the incident happened either. In his version it was a ploy by the supporters of Pompey, who claimed that Vettius was plotting to kill Pompey. When questioned in the senate he accused several people, but when he spoke {{in front of the}} people he said that Licinius Lucullus was the one who arranged the plot. No one believed him and {{it was clear that the}} supporters of Pompey got him to make false accusations. The deceit became even more obvious when he was battered to death a few days later. The opinion was that he was killed by those who had hired him. Suetonius wrote that Caesar had bribed Vettius <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about a conspiracy to murder Pompey according to a prearranged plot, but he was suspected of ‘double-dealing.’ He also wrote that Caesar was supposed to have poisoned him. Cicero gave an account in some letters to his fiend Atticus. Vettius, an informer, claimed that he had told Curio Junior that he had decided to use his slaves to assassinate Pompey. Curio told his father Gaius Scribonius Curio, who in turn told Pompey. When questioned in the senate he said that there was a group of conspiratorial young men led by Curio. The secretary of Calpurnius Bibulus gave him a dagger from Bibulus. He was to attack Pompey at the forum at some gladiatorial games and the ringleader for this was Aemilius Paullus. However, Aemilius Paullus was in Greece at the time. He also said that he had warned Pompey about the danger of plots. Vettius was arrested for confessing to possession of a dagger. The next day Caesar brought him to the rosta (a platform for public speeches). Vettius did not mention Curio. He implicated other men instead. Cicero thought that Vettius had been briefed on what to say during the night. The men he mentioned had not cast any suspicion. Cicero noted that it was thought that this was a set up and that the plan had been to catch Vettius in the forum with a dagger and his slaves with weapons, and that he was then to give information. He also thought that this had been masterminded by Caesar, who got Vettius to get close to Curio.|$|E
500|$|The {{thematic}} {{focus of}} the story also differs between the novel and the film. Reviewer Antonia Levi wrote {{that the experience of}} watching the film was similar to reading high quality fan fiction; although the characters and the setting were the same, the story was different. Although in both cases the story begins with Sophie being a prisoner of her circumstances and of social norms, the challenges she faces are slightly different. Levi said that [...] "Jones uses Sophie, Howl, and Calcifer in a fairytale format <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about challenging class and gender expectations, Miyazaki uses the same characters <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about personal loyalty, love, and war." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyric {{poetry is}} a genre that, unlike epic and {{dramatic}} poetry, does not attempt <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> but instead is {{of a more}} personal nature.
