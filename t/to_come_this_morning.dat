6000|$|... "I did {{not expect}} to see you so soon again, colonel. Your man brought me word that I was not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> as you would be engaged," [...] the {{sergeant}} said when he entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Call up Hennessy and Mendenhall," [...] he told Blake, when, at ten, {{the latter}} {{gathered}} up his notes {{and rose to}} go. [...] "You ought to catch them at the stallion barn. Tell them not <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> but to-morrow morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "October 18th.--Armadale <b>came</b> <b>to</b> breakfast <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{by way of}} {{catching}} Midwinter before he shuts himself up over his work.|$|R
6000|$|... "'And {{he surely}} will,' said her grandfather, 'for he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> like the honorable fellow he is, and {{obtained}} {{permission to do}} so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and {{no later}} than to-day. That is why I have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> I {{received}} <b>this</b> letter, which you will perhaps read for yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Elizabeth-Jane {{thought and}} thought of these words [...] "kept me alive," [...] as they slowly retraced {{their way to the}} town, and at length guessed their meaning. [...] "Father!--I will not leave you alone like this!" [...] she cried. [...] "May I live with you, and tend upon you as I used to do? I do not mind your being poor. I would have agreed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but you did not ask me." ...|$|E
60|$|ASHER. I {{was ready}} to {{recognize}} that. Before they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I had made a plan to reorganize the shops, to grant many privileges.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot," [...] Ronald Mervyn answered. [...] "I {{found as}} I was {{starting}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{that one of}} my gloves was missing, and I may say at once that I have no doubt that the other glove is the one I lost; though how it can have got near the place where it was found I cannot explain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{the judge}} answered, almost testily, shaking his sleeve with impatience. [...] "I'll have no putting off for trifles {{in the court}} where I sit. There's a capital case <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> When a man's neck's at stake--when {{a matter of life}} and death's at issue--I don't like to keep any one longer in {{suspense}} than I absolutely need. Delay would be cruel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma," [...] gravely replied Viola, [...] "I want to {{tell you}} {{something}} that <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I wonder if what grandfather says is not made up of what Pratt and Anthony want?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will do so, and I must be quick, for I {{have promised}} Mr. Rucastle {{to be back}} before three. I got his leave <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into town <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> though he little knew for what purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's quite too ridiculous!" [...] she declared, tossing her head. [...] "I {{really wanted}} you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with me <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{because you know}} the country," [...] she added, with a sidelong glance from her dark eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Word <b>come</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that you'd trapped a {{large number}} of horses," [...] went on Wiggate. [...] "I see that's a fact. It's a {{wonderful}} sight. Of course you expect to make a deal for them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you discovered, my good madam, {{whether my}} poor Hetty has stolen {{any of the}} spoons? When I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> breakfast <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> my {{daughter}} was alone, and {{there must have been}} a score of pieces of silver on the table." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can. I do. I do love both of you.--Oh, I am straight. I {{shall be}} straight. I must work this out. I {{thought you might}} help me. That is why I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> you <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> There must be some solution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word I hardly know. Two chaps <b>came</b> <b>to</b> him <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{before he}} was up; about business, they said. He nearly murdered one of them out of hand; and I believe that he's locked up somewhere with the other this minute." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. HIGGINS. Eliza <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> She {{passed the}} night partly walking {{about in a}} rage, partly trying to throw herself into the river and being afraid to, and partly in the Carlton Hotel. She told me of the brutal way you two treated her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Merely one," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Lavender, [...] "who {{wishes to}} do all {{in his power to}} forward a project so fraught with beneficence to all mankind. I count myself fortunate beyond measure <b>to</b> have <b>come</b> here <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and found the very Heart of the matter, the grain of mustard-seed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have just}} {{come at the}} right moment, Mabel," [...] Mr. Penfold said as she came in. [...] "This is Ralph Conway, of whom I was {{speaking}} to you. Ralph, this is Mabel Withers. I asked her <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in early <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> so as to act as your guide round the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do," [...] said Mr. Seymour. [...] "Here we are, {{fifteen of}} us, all good men and true, {{graduates}} of our Universities, and, {{as far as}} I can see, if we divide up the boys who have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> school <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> on fair share-and-share-alike lines, it will work out at about two-thirds of a boy each. Spence, will you take a third of Pickersgill II.?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last night," [...] I continued, {{speaking}} very deliberately, [...] "my {{brother who}} is in London rang me up in Norfolk. He {{told me that he}} had just received a cable from Dicky concerning Mr. Delora. It was at his earnest request that I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> London <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> By the bye, Louis," [...] I added, [...] "I think that I should like some Riz Diane." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{we thought}} you'd <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> but we turned out early and left Woolwich, {{the best of}} boys, to mind his sisters and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> you instead--as you see! For Lignum, he's tied so close now, and gets so little exercise, that a walk does him good. But what's the matter, George?" [...] asks Mrs. Bagnet, {{stopping}} in her cheerful talk. [...] "You don't look yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never was}} more in earnest in my life,' said Undy. 'I'll just {{explain how the}} matter is; and as you are sharp enough, you'll see at once that you had better oblige him. Val, you know, is always hard up; he can't touch a {{shilling}} of that woman's money, and just at present he has none of his own. So he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to raise the wind.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Sir Walter Scott {{mentioned}} her {{visiting his}} {{house with her}} father in December 1827. He wrote, [...] "A very sweet pretty looking young lady, the Prima Donna of the Italian Opera, now performing here, by name of Miss Ayton, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> breakfast <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with her father...Miss Ayton talks very prettily, and I dare say, sings beautifully, though {{too much in the}} Italian manner, I fear, to be a great favourite of mine. But I did not hear her, being called away" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cover up your magical picture, then," [...] replied her friend, [...] "else I {{never can}} {{look away from}} it. It is strange, dear Hilda, how an innocent, delicate, white soul like yours {{has been able to}} seize the subtle mystery of this portrait; as you surely must, in order to {{reproduce}} it so perfectly. Well; we will not talk of it any more. Do you know, I have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> on a small matter of business. Will you undertake it for me?" ...|$|R
40|$|Eternal God, Our Father, we <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with hearts {{that are}} {{grateful}} for your care and compassion which are made fresh to us this day. We thank You that You have made this day for us to enjoy and to use. May we use it wisely. Thank You also for the good {{men and women who}} are committed to public service. Thank You for their willingness to serve the people of this State, in this body.

6000|$|The great crisis {{which we}} have debated about so often is COME. Half of my secret is known, and I have thought and thought, until I am quite sure that {{now is the time}} to reveal THE WHOLE OF THE MYSTERY. Sir Pitt <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and made--what do you think?--A DECLARATION IN FORM. Think of that! Poor little me. I might have been Lady Crawley. How pleased Mrs. Bute would have been: and ma tante if I had taken {{precedence}} of her! I might have been somebody's mamma, instead of--O, I tremble, I tremble, when I think how soon we must tell all! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't stay shut up {{in there}} any longer," [...] he said. [...] "You've lost weight and you're pale. Go out {{in the air and}} sun. You might as well get used to the gang. Bate Wood <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and said he thought you were the ghost of Dandy Dale. That name will stick to you. I don't care how you treat my men. But if you're {{friendly}} you'll fare better. Don't go far from the cabin. And if any man says or does a thing you don't like--flash your gun. Don't yell for me. You can bluff this gang to a standstill." ...|$|R
60|$|December 21.--A {{very sweet}} pretty-looking young lady, the Prima Donna of the Italian Opera, now {{performing}} here, by name Miss Ayton,[100] <b>came</b> <b>to</b> breakfast <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> with her father, (a bore, after {{the manner of}} all fathers, mothers, aunts, and other chaperons of pretty actresses)! Miss Ayton talks very prettily, and, I dare say, sings beautifully, though {{too much in the}} Italian manner, I fear, to be a great favourite of mine. But I did not hear her, being called away by the Clerk's coach. I am like Jeremy in Love for Love[101]--have a reasonable good ear for a jig, but your solos and sonatas give me the spleen.|$|R
40|$|I <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{not as an}} {{intellectual}} property lawyer but as a former general counsel of biotechnology and pharmaceutical related companies, as an attorney with significant exposure to intellectual property issues and as one who has seen first-hand the importance of intellectual property in shaping commercial strategies in biotechnology. With that as a backdrop, I {{would like to thank}} you for allowing me the opportunity to share with you today thoughts that I have regarding patents and the impact of patent reform on biotechnology. It has been said {{that the best way to}} predict the future is to invent it. However, I believe that the best way to control the future is to patent it...|$|R
6000|$|December 12.--Hogg <b>came</b> <b>to</b> breakfast <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> {{having taken}} and brought for his {{companion}} the Galashiels bard, David Thomson,[69] as {{to a meeting}} of [...] "huzz Tividale poets." [...] The honest grunter opines with a delightful naïveté that Moore's verses are far owre sweet--answered by Thomson that Moore's ear or notes, I forget which, were finely strung. [...] "They are far owre finely strung," [...] replied he of the Forest, [...] "for mine are just reeght." [...] It reminded me of Queen Bess, when questioning Melville sharply and closely whether Queen [Mary] was taller than her, and, extracting an answer in the affirmative, she replied, [...] "Then your Queen is too tall, for I am just the proper height." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} out of work three months. He has a large family. We are sure they cannot live without wages. He was one of the {{deputation}} of cloth-dressers who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> me <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to complain and threaten. William did not threaten. He only asked me to give them rather more time--to make my changes more slowly. You know I cannot do that: straitened on all sides as I am, I have nothing for it but to push on. I thought it would be idle to palaver long with them. I sent them away, after arresting a rascal amongst them, whom I hope to transport--a fellow who preaches at the chapel yonder sometimes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Philip {{denied the}} {{applicability}} of that naive [...] "of course" [...] in his inmost soul: {{but it was no}} use being angry with Mr. Bertram Ingledew. So much he saw at once; the man was so simple-minded, so transparently natural, one could not be angry with him. One could only smile at him, a superior cynical London-bred smile, for an unsophisticated foreigner. So the Civil Servant asked with a condescending air, [...] "Well, what's your difficulty? I'll see if peradventure I can help you out of it." [...] For he reflected to himself in a flash that as Ingledew had apparently a good round sum in gold and notes in his pocket yesterday, he was not likely <b>to</b> <b>come</b> borrowing money <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R
6000|$|A {{copy of this}} {{farewell}} {{letter was}} seen by a lady {{who happened to be}} a neighbour of Miss Newcome's when the family misfortune occurred, and to whom, in her natural dismay and grief, the young lady fled for comfort and consolation. [...] "Dearest Mrs. Pendennis," [...] wrote Miss Ethel to my wife, [...] "I hear you are at Rosebury; do, do <b>come</b> <b>to</b> your affectionate E. N." [...] The next day, it was--"Dearest Laura--If you can, pray, pray <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Newcome <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I want very much to speak to you about the poor children, to consult you about something most important." [...] Madame de Moncontour's pony-carriage was constantly trotting between Rosebury and Newcome in these days of calamity.|$|R
40|$|We <b>come</b> <b>to</b> you <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> with hearts {{that are}} {{grateful}} for your care and compassion, which are made available to us new and fresh every day.
