5|$|Although US-89 {{follows the}} I-70 freeway from Sevier to Salina, the old {{alignment}} {{can still be}} driven, and is state-maintained north of Elsinore as SR-258, SR-118 (which overlaps I-70 Business through Richfield), SR-24, and US-50. Both highways stay mainly in the west half of the Sevier River's valley, with the faster I-70/US-89 bypassing <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> the surface road passes through. Just south of Salina, I-70 curves to the east, rising alongside Salina Creek, and US-89 exits into downtown Salina, where it rejoins its pre-freeway alignment. US-50 overlaps US-89 between I-70 and Salina, following I-70 east and a separate alignment northwest from the area; the short Interstate 70 Business also uses this roadway as a business spur from I-70 to the city. North of Salina, US-89 bypasses Redmond (SR-256 follows the former route through the town) and passes through Centerfield to Gunnison, where it meets SR-28 and finally {{turns away from the}} Sevier River.|$|E

25|$|The International Year of the Salmon (IYS) is an {{international}} initiative to raise the capacity of collaborative outreach and research to meet the issues facing wild salmon, and <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> benefit them, under the backdrop of increasing environmental variability. The IYS is a joint venture launched by the NPAFC, the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO), and other partners. The overall theme of the initiative is 'Salmon and People in a Changing World'. Through outreach efforts, the IYS will create awareness and advance understanding of challenges facing salmon populations and <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> are associated with them. An investment in research will also be stimulated by the initiative, which will and leave behind a legacy of knowledge, data/information systems, tools, and {{a new generation of}} scientists better informed to provide effective advice on the rational management of salmon.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change is}} raising ocean {{temperatures}} and raising levels {{of carbon dioxide}} in the atmosphere. These rising levels of carbon dioxide are acidifying the oceans. This, in turn, is altering aquatic ecosystems and modifying fish distributions, with impacts on the sustainability of fisheries and the livelihoods of <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> depend on them. Healthy ocean ecosystems are also important for the mitigation of climate change.|$|E

25|$|While {{the main}} line of US20 takes a direct path between Hamburg, Buffalo, and East Bloomfield via Avon, US20A veers to the south to serve several villages and hamlets, {{including}} the villages of Geneseo and Warsaw. The town of Attica, famous for the Attica Prison riots of 1971, lies between US20 and US20A. As the route heads east, US20A connects to several northâ€“south freeways, such as NY400 outside of East Aurora and Interstate390 (I-390) between Geneseo and Lakeville. Outside of <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> dot the highway, US20A is a two-lane, rural highway.|$|E

25|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{the number}} of kibbutzim making {{significant}} changes in their lifestyle continued to grow, while the resistance to these changes gradually decreased, {{with only a few}} dozen kibbutzim still functioning under more traditional models. It is important to note, however, that each kibbutz has undergone different processes of change. There are many people, outside and inside the kibbutzim, who claim these changes bring the end of the kibbutz concept. Among <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> had recently officially ceased being kibbutzim are Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley, HagGoshrim in the Upper Galilee, Beyt Nir in the Negev, etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} {{population of}} Sutton Coldfield parish was {{recognised in the}} mid-19th century and new ecclesiastical parishes were created from it to better serve the residents of <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> made up Sutton. The first ecclesiastical parish to be created was Walmley in 1846, with the recently completed St. John the Evangelist Church becoming the parish church. Hill became the next ecclesiastical parish in 1853, with its church being St. James' Church in Mere Green. Boldmere parish was created in 1857, with St. Michael's Church becoming its parish church. Holy Trinity Church was further extended with a north outer aisle and vestries in 1874-9.|$|E
25|$|While all of {{this was}} happening, the open source and {{developer}} communities set to work to revolutionize what could be done with JavaScript. This community effort was sparked in 2005 when Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax, and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, used to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads and leading to more dynamic applications. This resulted in a renaissance period of JavaScript usage spearheaded by open source libraries and <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> formed around them, with libraries such as Prototype, jQuery, Dojo Toolkit, MooTools, and others being released.|$|E

25|$|In May 2008, the Post-Gazette and the Trib {{reached a}} deal for one company to deliver both papers. The Post-Gazette would begin {{delivering}} the Trib {{to most of the}} area with some exceptions. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. On June 20, 2008, Trib Total Media publicly announced it was closing several weekly newspapers in the Gateway Newspapers chain. The papers affected include: Bridgeville Area News, North Journal, McKnight Journal, Woodland Progress, Penn Hills Progress, Coraopolis-Moon Record and the Advance Leader. Many of those papers were several decades old. The company also announced major changes to the remaining Gateway publications including a revamp of the Pennysaver in <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> have Gateway newspapers. Several published reports say the remaining community newspapers would expand coverage to include areas no longer serviced by Gateway publications. The communities served by those titles will now be served by other Gateway newspapers.|$|E
25|$|In addition, many non-Russians {{who lived}} outside their {{respective}} administrative units tended to become Russified linguistically; that is, {{they not only}} learned Russian {{as a second language}} but they also adopted it as their home language or mother tongue â€“ although some still retained their sense of ethnic identity or origins even after shifting their native language to Russian. This includes both the traditional communities (e.g., Lithuanians in the northwestern Belarus (see Eastern Vilnius region) or the Kaliningrad Oblast (see Lithuania Minor)) and <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> appeared during Soviet times such as Ukrainian or Belarusian workers in Kazakhstan or Latvia, whose children attended primarily the Russian-language schools and thus the further generations are primarily speaking Russian as their native language; for example, for 57% of Estonia's Ukrainians, 70% of Estonia's Belarusians and 37% of Estonia's Latvians claimed Russian is the native language in the last Soviet census of 1989. Russian language as well replaced Yiddish and other languages as the main language of many Jewish communities inside the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Like {{others in}} the world, the border is a culture unto itself, not {{belonging}} 100% to either country. Interaction between the peoples on both sides {{is a part of}} both the culture and the economy. In the 1980s, an international volleyball game was regularly held near Naco, with the chain link border fence serving as the net. Much of Arizona and Sonora share a cuisine based on the wheat, cheese and beef that was introduced to the region by the Spaniards, with wheat tortillas being especially large {{on both sides of the}} border. This diet is reinforced by the vaquero/cowboy tradition which continues in both states. The six border crossings are essential to the existence and extent of <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> surround them, as most of them function as ports for the passage of goods between the two countries. People regularly shop and work on the other side, taking advantage of opportunities there. The economic opportunities of the border are not equal on both sides. Most of the population along this border lives on the Sonoran side, many of which have moved here for the opportunities created by the maquiladoras and other businesses. These are lacking on the Arizona side.|$|E

25|$|Much of the stateâ€™s {{economic}} activity {{is related to}} its border with the United States state of Arizona. People from both countries regularly cross the border to shop. The border crossings are essential to many of <b>the</b> <b>communities</b> <b>that</b> straddle the border, {{not only in the}} main crossings in Nogales and Agua Prieta, but also in the smaller ones such as Naco. On each side of the border, there is a fifteen km strip, which is designated as a commercial trade zone, where both Mexicans and United States citizens can enter with limited visa requirements. Many Arizonans travel and cross one of the crossings to eat and shop, mostly to experience something different from doing the same at home. Most spend only the day. The most popular of these border crossings is Nogales, which is just over an hour south from Tucson by highway. The main shopping street in Nogales is Avenida ObregÃ³n, which is crowded with pharmacies with lower prices than in the United States, stores selling knock offs of designer names such as Louis Vuitton, Cuban cigars, tequila, cheaper cigarettes and Mexican handcrafts, including some of the best work from artisans from Puebla, Guadalajara, MichoacÃ¡n and Oaxaca. Although these stores cater mostly to Americans crossing the border, it is still possible to negotiate prices. Many of these communities on the Mexican side also have bars close to the port of entry, taking advantage of Mexicoâ€™s lower drinking age of 18.|$|E
