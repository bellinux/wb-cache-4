500|$|August Brown of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, commenting that [...] "Kendrick Lamar somehow packs more personality into a halfhearted hook on 'Forbidden Fruit' than Cole {{gets in the}} song". Phillip Mlynar of Spin felt that [...] " [...] quirky bass line and warm-keys motif are so recognizable that it's a brow-furrowing challenge to hear anything other than Q-Tip and Phife's original vocals {{in the space between}} the beat and the new raps." [...] Mlynar further stated that [...] "Cole himself (along with Kendrick Lamar's guest spot) ends up evaporating entirely — he's upstaged by loftier artists who aren't even there." [...] Contrarily, Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest expressed his appreciation for Cole's production: [...] " [...] didn't like <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> was already done. [...] brought other parts to the sample that you caught that I was like, 'Oh, nice!'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Could Fall in Love" [...] {{is similar}} to [...] "Dreaming of You" [...] in its lyrics. Many media outlets, {{including}} the Milwaukee Journal and Billboard magazine, called them [...] "confessional ballads", with an emotionally vulnerable narrator who wants true love but finds it unattainable. Tarradell believed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] was an indirect response to Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., who forced her and Perez to end their relationship just because Perez was a rocker. Tarradell asserted that the words [...] "I know it's not right but I guess I should <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I should do" [...] were directed at Abraham and reflected Selena's realization of her independence. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News believed that Selena's 1992 song [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] shared similarities with [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] in expressing uncontrollable [...] "adrenalin-fueled love". Burr later wrote that the difference in [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] is that the lyrics are recorded with [...] "powerful agony" [...] which forces the narrator to [...] "fall into a phase of deep loneliness" [...] because her lover {{may or may not}} reciprocate her feelings.|$|E
500|$|In {{separate}} interviews {{early in}} 2011 both Davies brothers spoke positively about a potential reunion. Dave Davies explained, [...] "There's {{nothing in the}} pipeline yet, but... we'll see. It's possible." [...] Each has said that any reunion would be dependent on the other. According to Ray Davies, the brothers were to meet in April to discuss future plans. [...] In October that year, Dave Davies quashed rumours of a reunion, stating {{in an interview that}} although he loves his brother, [...] "I just can't stand to be with him. About an hour with Ray's my limit, so {{it would be a very}} short reunion." [...] In November of that year Ray Davies reported that he had recently recorded with Avory [...] "just to sort of <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we call demos... we might do it in fits and starts and bring Dave in at a later date. I'll never say never with my brother, because he's totally unpredictable." [...] In a 2013 Skype interview Dave Davies expressed interest in doing reunions shows. On 18 December 2015, Ray Davies joined Dave Davies onstage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London to perform [...] "You Really Got Me". On 5 November 2016, Dave Davies posted on Twitter: [...] "Me and Ray have not spoken about Kinks shows at all– although were trying to work together on other stuff and have worked on music together".|$|E

He was the person on my mind. [...] "Especially since Janet only made records, not to disrespect Q-Tip or Heavy D, {{but as far as}} popular rappers in this day and time, Busta Rhymes was the only one. We was trying to go to the radio and not do the typical R {{featured}} record. I was trying to be more creative and find somebody who can do melody as well as rap on the record. Nelly doesn't really rap on this song, he's singing. He has that different style. That's kind of what the record is. We see that enough: R with a rapper feature. That's why I call this a duet as opposed to a feature".|$|E

2500|$|The {{organization}} Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) put Congressman Barton on its CREW's Most Corrupt Report 2011. The article {{states that}} on Barton's 2008 financial disclosure statement, he inaccurately {{reported on the}} source of a natural gas interest that he bought into. [...] The share was purchased through a longtime donor and supporter who later died. This was discovered by the Dallas Morning News in 2010. According to the Dallas Morning News article, Barton made over $100,000 on the investment. [...] The article and CREW Report both point out how Barton buying this undervalued asset from an [...] "advisor" [...] on energy issues could be a conflict of interest to the Congressman's position as the Chair of the House's Energy Subcommittee. [...] It quotes James Thurber, a professor of government at American University, as saying [...] "If you are elected as a public servant to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> is right for the public generally and then you use that position to help bring in material wealth, I think it's unethical." ...|$|E

But really, and upon my honour, I will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally," [...] Wingrave agreed. [...] "But {{then you}} are a sentimentalist. You like to see people happy, and you would even help to make them so if you could without any {{personal}} inconvenience. I am at the other pole. If I could collect humanity into one sentient force, I would set my heel upon it without hesitation. I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I can with the atoms, but I have not the best of fortune. There was Mrs. Travers, now!

60|$|There are those, and, {{thanks to}} Almighty God, {{they are to}} be {{numbered}} by tens of thousands, who will not perplex themselves with questionings; simple, genial hearts, who <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> good they can in the world, and meddle not with matters too high for them; people whose religion is not abstruse but deep, not noisy but intense, not aggressive but laboriously useful; people who have the same habit of mind as the early Christians seem to have worn, ere yet Catholic truth had been defined in formulae, when the Apostles' Creed was symbol enough for the Church, and men were orthodox in heart rather than exact in head.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{he went on}} to {{say that}} this would of course put an end to the {{emigration}} plan, so far as he was concerned.

[...] And then he said it did not seem a worthy thing to do nothing, but just exist on a confined income, and the only thing he did know anything about, and was not too old to learn, was farming, and managing an estate.|$|E
6000|$|These miserable outcasts {{called that}} [...] "fumigating" [...] us, and {{the term was}} a tame one indeed. They {{fumigated}} us to guard themselves against the cholera, though we hailed from no infected port. We had left the cholera far behind us all the time. However, they must keep epidemics away somehow or other, and fumigation is cheaper than soap. They must either wash themselves or fumigate other people. Some of the lower classes had rather die than wash, but the fumigation of strangers causes them no pangs. They need no fumigation themselves. Their habits make it unnecessary. They carry their preventive with them; they sweat and fumigate all the day long. I trust I am a humble and a consistent Christian. I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> is right. I know it is my duty to [...] "pray for them that despitefully use me;" [...] and therefore, hard as it is, I shall still try to pray for these fumigating, maccaroni-stuffing organ-grinders.|$|E

Of course," [...] she went on, [...] "it is far easier for me. The one thing I try to develop amongst them is a genuine, not a false spirit of independence. I want them to lean upon no one. I have no charities {{in connection with the}} estate, no soup kitchens or coal at Christmas, or anything of that sort. My theory is that every person is the better for being able to look after himself, and my idea of charity is placing him in a position {{to be able to do}} it. I don't want to be their Lady of the Manor and accept their rents and give them a dinner. I try to encourage them to save money and to buy their own farms. The man here who owns his own farm and makes it pay is in a position to lead a thoroughly self-respecting and honourable life. He ought to get what there is to be got out of life, and his children should be yeomen citizens of the best possible type. Of course, all this sort of thing is so much easier in the country. Very often, in the winter nights here, I waste my time trying to think out your greater problems." ...|$|E
