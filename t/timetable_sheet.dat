40|$|The energy {{consumption}} {{of a train}} depends on characteristics of train and line, environmental conditions, comfort parameters, planned operation and different driving styles, that could cause relevant variation among different drivers operating the same traction unit and timetable. The {{energy consumption}} calculation needs extended variable data bases and parameters to be kept under control. Driving style can play a rewarding role for the energy saving in itself {{and it is an}} important reference for the evaluation of technologies and operational measures aiming at energy saving. Today energy meters on board the trains cover a lack of information about the real energy consumption of trains, therefore the authors are working on realistic and suitable methodological approaches for data handling towards clearly defined objectives. In fact such data seem difficult to be useful if not well managed. The research activity is aiming to provide with a simplified approach for energy consumption evaluation useful to determine the more suitable driving style to save energy and respect the timetable in a specific line with a specific train. The proposed methodology is based on a simplified set of data: characteristics of the line usually provided by the infrastructure manager to operators and from them to their drivers, as well as the rolling stock characteristics usually provided by the supplier as design documentation. The methodology is based on simulations and is strictly related to the driver perspective with available documentation (<b>timetable</b> <b>sheets</b> and regulations). This paper describe the first results of the proposed simplified approach to determine the most suitable driving styles to save energy and respect the timetable constraints by line section and timetable structure. The assessment of strategies are based on analytical calculations and simulation of drivers behaviours on the Italian railway network...|$|R
