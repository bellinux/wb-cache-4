5|$|Although {{the novel}} uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a {{realistic}} portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned {{attention to detail}} is used to describe a gambling house, an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home {{similar to the one}} he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and decrepit at the story's end.|$|E
5|$|In October 1776, {{at the age}} of 17, Wilberforce went up to St John's College, Cambridge. The {{deaths of}} his {{grandfather}} and uncle in 1777 had left him independently wealthy and as a result he had little inclination or need to apply himself to serious study. Instead he immersed himself in the social round of student life and pursued a hedonistic lifestyle enjoying cards, gambling and late-night drinking sessions – although he found <b>the</b> <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> some of his fellow students distasteful. Witty, generous and an excellent conversationalist, Wilberforce was a popular figure. He made many friends including the more studious future Prime Minister William Pitt. Despite his lifestyle and lack of interest in studying he managed to pass his examinations and was awarded a B.A. in 1781 and an M.A. in 1788.|$|E

5|$|Sophiatown , {{also known}} as Sof'town or Kofifi, is a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. Sophiatown was a legendary black {{cultural}} hub that was destroyed under apartheid, rebuilt {{under the name of}} Triomf, and in 2006 officially returned to its original name. Sophiatown was one of the oldest black areas in Johannesburg and its destruction represents some of <b>the</b> <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> South Africa under apartheid. Despite the violence and poverty, it was the epicentre of politics, jazz and blues during the 1940s and 1950s. It produced some of South Africa's most famous writers, musicians, politicians and artists.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Buddhism during {{the sixth century}} was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese Tang and Sui Dynasties led to {{the foundation of the}} first permanent capital in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The {{introduction of}} the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to <b>the</b> <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, many architects {{studying}} in Italy learned of Palladio's work. Foreign architects then returned home and adapted Palladio's style to suit various climates, topographies and personal tastes of their clients. Isolated forms of Palladianism {{throughout the world}} were brought about in this way. However, the Palladian style did not reach the zenith of its popularity until the 18th century, primarily in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland and later North America. In Venice itself there was an early reaction to <b>the</b> <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> Baroque architecture that manifested itself as a return to Palladian principles. The earliest neo-Palladians there were the exact contemporaries, both trained up as masons, Domenico Rossi (1657–1737) and Andrea Tirali (1657–1737). Tommaso Temanza, their biographer, {{proved to be the}} movement's most able and learned proponent; in his hands the visual inheritance of Palladio's example became increasingly codified in correct rules and drifted towards neoclassicism.|$|E

5|$|McCarthyism {{has taken}} on a broader meaning, {{describing}} <b>the</b> <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> similar efforts. The term is also now used more generally to describe reckless, unsubstantiated accusations, as well as demagogic attacks on the character or patriotism of political adversaries. During the McCarthy era, hundreds of Americans were accused of being communists or communist sympathizers and became the subject of aggressive investigations and questioning before government or private-industry panels, committees and agencies. The primary targets of such suspicions were government employees, those in the entertainment industry, educators and labor union activists. Suspicions were often given credence despite inconclusive or questionable evidence, and the level of threat posed by a person's real or supposed leftist associations or beliefs was sometimes exaggerated. Many people suffered loss of employment or destruction of their careers; some even suffered imprisonment. Most of these punishments came about through trial verdicts later overturned, laws that were later declared unconstitutional, dismissals for reasons later declared illegal or actionable, or extra-legal procedures that would come into general disrepute.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of Indonesian {{intelligence}} influential with Suharto {{had initially}} envisaged that invasion, subdual of Fretilin resistance, and integration with Indonesia would be quick and relatively painless. The ensuing Indonesian campaigns up through 1976 were devastating for the East Timorese, an enormous drain on Indonesian resources, were severely damaging to Indonesia internationally, and ultimately a failure. The wanton, wholesale killings by the TNI near the coastal regions {{during the opening}} months of the invasion had driven {{a large portion of}} the population and most of the remaining Falintil into the central regions. This proved counterproductive as it left Indonesian troops fighting against an enemy which was well equipped and had access to agricultural resources and population. The civilian population came to see the Falintil as a buffer against <b>the</b> <b>excesses</b> <b>of</b> the Indonesian forces, which led to heightened support for the resistance. From 1975 to 1977, the Fretilin protected at least 40% of the population who had fled the coastal regions, in inhospitable conditions, with the active support of rallied communities. Schwarz suggests the fact that Indonesian military's power base remained barely dented by the mid-1970s intelligence miscalculations and ongoing failures, was a measure of the military's dominance of Indonesian affairs.|$|E
