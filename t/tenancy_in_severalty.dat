40|$|In recent years, {{the higher}} courts in Queensland {{have had the}} {{opportunity}} to revisit the effect of severance on a joint tenancy. The cases allow for the opportunity to examine in more depth the nature of joint tenancy itself, and the concept of alienation as a means of severance of joint tenancy. This article provides an analysis of these decisions to ascertain the contemporary 'state of play' in the law applying to severance of a joint tenancy. A joint tenancy is characterised by the four unities - of possession, interest, title and time! – together with the right of survivorship. Given this characterisation, severance of a joint tenancy represents a fundamental change in the nature of the co-ownership. In particular, the destruction of the right of survivorship through severance will by definition change the potential of each co-owner to hold the whole of the estate <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> upon the death of the other co-owners. The nature of the common ownership of a joint tenancy, and the potential that it carries, can be adjusted by converting, or severing, the joint tenancy to create a <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common. Unlike a joint <b>tenancy,</b> a <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common is characterised by each tenant holding a distinct interest in the property; the shares may be in different proportions. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{usufruct}} {{is either}} granted <b>in</b> <b>severalty</b> or held <b>in</b> common ownership, {{as long as}} the property is not damaged or destroyed. The third civilian property interest is abusus (literally abuse), the right to alienate the thing possessed, either by consuming or destroying it (e.g. for profit), or by transferring it to someone else (e.g. sale, exchange, gift).

40|$|Joint <b>tenancy</b> and <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common are for {{all intents}} and {{purposes}} the only means of co-ownership of real or personal property in Western Australia. Joint tenants hold the whole property jointly and nothing separately. Tenants in common, on the other hand, have a distinct share in the property. There are two essential features that distinguish a joint tenancy from a <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common. The first feature is the right of survivorship: upon the death of one joint tenant his interest in the property is extinguished and the interest of the surviving joint tenants is correspondingly enlarged. Upon the death of a tenant in common his interest in the property passes under his will or intestacy. The second feature is the presence of four unities: in order for there to be a joint tenancy there must be unity of title, interest, time and possession. Although the four unities may be present <b>in</b> a <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common, the only unity which is essential is unity of possession...|$|R
