Its streets, too, were organized on a grid pattern, but one slightly offset from Albany's, a pattern still visible today. By the 1860s, residents of the hamlet were being listed in Albany's city directory and considered themselves socially and culturally {{to be part of}} the city. In 1870 their petition <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> legal and political reality was accepted and the city's boundary was extended a mile (1.6km) to the south, to its present location along the Normans Kill, creating the area of Albany known as the First Ward.|$|E

The Aberdeen government chose <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> motion of confidence; Disraeli led the opposition to defeat the government, 305 to 148.

500|$|New {{developments}} in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced {{stage of the game}} but periodically one is perfected <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed [...] "Pan-focus", as I have been active for two years in its development and used {{it for the first time}} in Citizen Kane. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.|$|E

[...] Because of this, [...] "they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. [...] "From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did", said Norby, [...] "there was a lot of work figuring out how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> scary film as well as a funny film."

White noted in his inaugural address, [...] "We will labor <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>a</b> Christian institution, a sectarian institution may it never be." [...] However, the university has made provision for voluntary religious observance on campus. Currently, the University Charter provides, [...] "Persons of every religious denomination, or of no religious denomination, shall be equally eligible to all offices and appointments". Through the 20th century, the University Charter also required {{that a majority of}} trustees could not be of any single denomination. Sage Chapel, a non-denominational house of worship opened in 1875. [...] Since 1929, the Cornell United Religious Works (CURW) has been an umbrella organization for the campus chaplains sponsored by different denominations and faiths. [...] Perhaps the most newsworthy of the chaplains was Daniel Berrigan who, while Assistant Director of CURW, became a national leader in protesting the Vietnam War. In 1971, the social activism aspects of CURW were spun off into a separate Center for Religion, Ethics and Social Policy (CRESP).
