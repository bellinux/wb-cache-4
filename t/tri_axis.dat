40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Education, Dept. of Human Performance StudiesTechnological advancements in {{electronics}} {{have provided}} access to quantitative methods of measuring balance or postural stability. In {{the past decade}} mobile devices have added built-in motion sensors called tri-axial accelerometers. Developers are accessing the accelerometer outputs while the device is against the body, and translating the values to postural sway and/or stability. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess balance in high school athletes using a mobile device software application using accelerometric motion sensors in order to provide information for concussion management and return-to-play. METHODS: 121 healthy high school-aged athletes (62 male, 59 female; average age = 16. 1 plus/minus 1. 3 yr) performed a series of balance tasks (bilateral, tandem, single leg) over multiple visits. Age, sex, orthopedic injuries post concussions, height, and weight were also recorded. RESULTS: Balance scores for concussed athletes did not show any significant difference between baseline and post-concussion test; however, there were three large effect size and one moderate effect size calculated. No significant differences were observed in balance scores between ages. CONCLUSION: Balance or postural sway is one of many important factors in providing vital information to help medical professionals determine proper management and return-to-play. Mobile devices with <b>tri</b> <b>axis</b> accelerometers is a new innovative and cost-effective method to measure human balance, however, more research needs to be completed to assess its effectiveness in identifying potential impairments resulting from sports concussions or mild traumatic brain injury...|$|E
40|$|In March 2010, the Autosub 6000 AUV {{embarked}} on a cruise to discover, locate and map hydrothermal vent sites in an active spreading centre, the Cayman trough in the Caribbean sea. The environment provided the challenge of steep and rugged terrain together with deep water (in places greater than 5000 m). Autosub 6000 is a flight class, hydrodynamically shaped AUV, with good endurance capability, making it well suited for searching for plume signals and mapping terrain over the required moderately large areas. However, it must fly at a forward speed greater than 0. 8 ms- 1 to achieve control, and so it requires a capable forward look collision avoid capability. Another potential challenge is navigation. To make best use of ship time, Autosub 6000 missions are commonly conducted with neither the support ship in attendance, nor an acoustic transponder long baseline network. Hence positioning is dependent upon the AUV autonomous navigation (aided by a position fix after the AUVâ€™s descent to within ADCP bottom tracking range of the seabed). For the cruise on the UK research ship RRS James Cook, the AUV was equipped with sensors for EH (redox potential), turbidity, CTD, <b>tri</b> <b>axis</b> magnetometer, and an EM 2000 multibeam sonar. The paper describes the Autosub 6000 vehicle, its systems, capabilities, the missions it undertook in the deep Caribbean sea, and the discoveries it made. The missions, although ultimately very successful, were not without problems, with, for example, the steep seabed slopes, at times affecting the accuracy for the navigation system. The paper will also discuss these issues and how they might be addressed in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} of ever increasing demand of the intelligent robots in our society, the natural ways of Human Robot Interaction (HRI) {{have been investigated}} in terms of speech recognition, machine perception and physical interfaces. As the speech and vision methods that require power processing and intensive calibration are difficult to implement. Hence, the physical interfaces are still in use. These interfaces improve the cooperative behavior between man and machine. The aim of this thesis is to design and investigate the use of emerging motion capture techniques for the future robots. In this thesis the human arm motion has been utilized to control the human like manipulator of the WorkPartner robot in real-time dynamic task environment. This technique offers great benefits in advance teleoperation and robotic control through motion learning and conversion. Initially various motion capture techniques are reviewed and then based on reliability, accuracy, robustness and real-time performance the Internal & Magnetic MoCAP technique has been selected. The selected approach is validated by the assembly of low cost c 3 D orientation sensor (<b>tri</b> <b>axis</b> accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer). After evaluation of accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer for angle measurement a sensor fusion based the real-time extended Kalman filter technique is proposed to achieve an average angle accuracy of 0. 5 degree in each axis of 3 D orientation measurement. The performance of the filter is validated by the experiments and their results are discussed. An idea of wearable sensor sleeve comprising four 3 D orientation sensors is presented {{in connection with the}} motion translation control scheme that allows the user to control the human like robotic arm directly using his arm motion with no delay. Further, by analyzing kinematics aspects of the front part of WorkPartner robot, an integrated e 3 D kinematics simulator is described. In addition the interfaces of Human Robot Interaction GUI are covered. At the end, the real-time motion translation scheme is tested through the experiments and their results are briefly discussed.
