It’s a <b>tough</b> <b>call,</b> but I’ll take 'Comic' in a squeaker. The show melds the series’ deft satirical tone with exceptional character development. Bart seems to grow especially strongly, and his psychological meltdown in the third act is hilarious." [...] "Three Men and a Comic Book" [...] was named the best episode of the season by IGN.|$|E
