5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations {{to lose their}} jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed.

5|$|On December 21, 1865, {{two days}} after the {{announcement}} that the States had ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, Wilson introduced a bill to protect <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> African Americans.

5|$|As the 19th century wore on non-conformist ministers {{increasingly}} {{began to}} conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation {{had been introduced}} during the 17th century to limit <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> Catholics, beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 {{in the wake of}} the failed Gunpowder Plot that year. But although almost all restrictions on Catholics in England and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, the appointment of a Catholic chaplain was unthinkable. Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin and the {{legislature}} continued to clash throughout {{the remainder of}} 1861 and into 1862. They found agreement only on the most menial of legislation, such as a bill to allow the common schools to continue the sessions that had been interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. He found particularly onerous a bill forfeiting the citizenship of anyone who fought for or aided the Confederacy, but in March 1862, his veto of the bill was overridden. Magoffin also opposed the military rule of Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle, who he believed was violating <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> states' rights advocates, {{even if they did}} not advocate secession.|$|E
5|$|The Weiquan {{movement}} is a non-centralized group of lawyers, legal experts, and intellectuals in China {{who seek to}} protect and defend <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the citizenry through litigation and legal activism. The movement, {{which began in the}} early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of human rights abuses, and written appeal letters, despite opposition from Communist Party authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights, protection for AIDS victims, environmental damage, religious freedom, freedom of speech and the press, and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866 {{had been}} enacted into law over President Andrew Johnson's veto, {{some members of}} Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to {{eliminate}} doubts about <b>the</b> constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866, or {{to ensure that no}} subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. Thus, the Citizenship Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment parallels citizenship language in <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866, and likewise the Equal Protection Clause parallels nondiscrimination language in the 1866 Act; the extent to which other clauses in the Fourteenth Amendment may have incorporated elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866 is a matter of continuing debate.|$|R

While <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866 prohibited discrimination in housing, there were no federal enforcement provisions. The 1968 act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, and since 1974, gender; since 1988, the act protects people with disabilities and families with children.|$|R
5|$|Though widely {{respected}} in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady {{at the time}} for her outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon reopening his business, Johnson started {{publishing}} theological and political works by Priestley and other Dissenters. Starting in the 1770s, Johnson published more specifically Unitarian works, {{as well as}} texts advocating religious toleration; he also became personally involved in the Unitarian cause. He served as a conduit for information between Dissenters {{across the country and}} supplied provincial publishers with religious publications, thereby enabling Dissenters to spread their beliefs easily. Johnson participated in efforts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> Dissenters. In one six-year period of the 1770s, Johnson was responsible for publishing nearly one-third of the Unitarian works on the issue. He continued his support in 1787, 1789, and 1790, when Dissenters introduced repeal bills in Parliament, and he published much of the pro-repeal literature written by Priestley and others.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{opposition}} to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which {{before and during the}} Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, {{with the passage of the}} Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.|$|E
