25|$|UFC 1 – Although the {{advertising}} said <b>There</b> <b>Are</b> <b>No</b> <b>Rules,</b> {{there were in}} fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks.

Despite this, the first match in UFC 1 was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> for {{how many}} species should make a genus, a family, or any other higher taxon (that is, a taxon in a {{category}} above the species level). It should be a natural group (that is, non-artificial, non-polyphyletic), as judged by a biologist, using all the information available to them. Equally ranked higher taxa in different phyla are not necessarily equivalent (e.g., it is incorrect to assume that families of insects are in some way evolutionarily comparable to families of mollusks). For animals, at least the phylum rank is usually associated with a certain body plan, which is also, however, an arbitrary criterion.|$|E

500|$|Project 86's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by heavy rock and Schwab's [...] "loud, eerie, and atmospheric" [...] vocal style. Their sound has been likened to rock groups Helmet, Rage Against the Machine, and Tool. The moniker [...] "intense" [...] has frequently {{been used as a}} description. Rick Anderson of Allmusic called the music [...] "dense and crunchy", while Albuquerque Journal writer Ron Gonzales declared it a [...] "blisteringly heavy sound." [...] Commenting on their musical style, Schwab said, [...] "Our goal as a band has been to never make the same record twice. The only rule is that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules.</b> If there is a rule, it's that we try not to over-think things, that the music that comes out is honest and real, spontaneous and from our heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{those of}} most sports, {{baseball}} playing fields can vary significantly {{in size and}} shape. While {{the dimensions of the}} infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of Major League and Minor League Baseball is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of [...] from home plate to the fences in left and right field and [...] to center. Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only [...] from home plate. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> at all that address the height of fences or other structures {{at the edge of the}} outfield.

2500|$|The game {{consists}} of each panellist in turn announcing a landmark or street, most often a tube {{station on the}} London Underground system. The apparent aim {{is to be the}} first to announce [...] "Mornington Crescent", a station on the Northern line. Interspersed with the turns is humorous discussion amongst the panellists and host regarding the rules and legality of each move, as well as the strategy the panellists are using. Despite appearances, however, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> to the game, and both the naming of stations and the specification of [...] "rules" [...] are based on stream-of-consciousness association and improvisation.

2500|$|Rather than {{intending}} to communicate a single or concrete meaning with his work, Pinsky anticipated that his poetry would change {{depending on the}} particular subjectivity of each reader. Embracing the idea that people's individuality would fill out the poem, he has said, [...] "The poetry I love is written with someone’s voice and I believe its proper culmination is to be read with someone’s voice. And the human voice in that sense is not electronically reproduced or amplified; it’s the actual living breath inside a body—not necessarily the second life of reception—not necessarily the expert’s body or the artist’s body. Whoever reads the poem aloud becomes the proper medium for the poem." [...] Pinsky observes 'the kind of poetry I write emphasizes the physical qualities of the words' for poetry to Pinsky, is a vocal art, not necessarily performative,but reading to one self or recalling some lines by memory. Pinsky comments 'all language is necessarily abstract ' [...] No aspect of a poem, he observes, is more singular, more unique, than its rhythm, for <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E
2500|$|AAA has {{traditionally}} included a Relevos Atómicos de Locura, or [...] "Atomic Madness" [...] match {{as part of}} their major shows for years as a homage to AAA founder Antonio Peña who created the concept years prior. In a Relevos Atómicos de Locura match each team represents the four distinct type of wrestlers that work for AAA, Male, Female, Mini-Estrella and Exótico. While the match is a mixed-gender match <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>rules</b> to limit the interaction between the teams so males wrestle females, Mini-Estrellas wrestle Exótico and so on. For the 2015 show AAA paired up Drago (male), Goya Kong (female), Dinastía (Mini-Estrella and AAA World Mini-Estrella Champion) and Pimpinela Escarlata (Exótico) on the tecnico side to take on Daga (male), Sexy Star (female), Mini Psycho Clown (Mini-Estrella) and Mamba (Exótico). The two Exótico had fought on opposite sides of various Relevos Atómicos de Locura matches for years, {{as far back as the}} 2014 Rey de Reyes ("King of Kings"). Goya Kong had only recently joined AAA making the Triplemanía XXIII her first major AAA appearance. Dinastía and Mini Psycho Clown had been working a long-running storyline prior to the show, including Dinastía successfully defending the AAA World Mini-Estrellas Championship against Mini Psycho Clown on June 28, 2015.|$|E
