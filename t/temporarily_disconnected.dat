50|$|Isolation valves {{are used}} to <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnect</b> part of a piping system, to allow {{maintenance}} or repair, for example. Isolation valves are typically left in either a fully open or fully closed position. A given isolation valve may be in place for many years without being operated, but must be designed to be readily operable whenever needed, including emergency use.|$|R
50|$|Throttling valves {{are used}} to control the amount or {{pressure}} of a fluid allowed to pass through, and are designed to withstand the stress and wear caused by this type of operation. Because they may wear out in this usage, they are often installed alongside isolation valves which can <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnect</b> a failing throttling valve {{from the rest of}} the system, so it can be refurbished or replaced.|$|R
50|$|Frequently, {{one or more}} fileservers {{will become}} {{inaccessible}} (down for maintenance, on a remote and <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnected</b> network, or accessed via a congested link). Administrators also often {{find it necessary to}} relocate data from one file server to another - to resolve capacity issues and balance the load. Having data mount-points automated makes it easier to reconfigure client systems in such cases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Temporarily</b> <b>Disconnected</b> is {{the fourth}} album from rap/metal/funk pioneers 24-7 Spyz. It {{features}} the reunion of the band's classic lineup, including mainstays Jimi Hazel and Rick Skatore along {{with the return of}} vocalist P. Fluid (now using his proper last name, Forrest) and drummer Anthony Johnson. The reunion and subsequent album were based on the lingering popularity of this particular lineup in Europe (where it was released exclusively) following the breakup of Strength in Numbers lineup.|$|E
50|$|The 1600 imp gal {{on-board}} {{water tank}} {{on the front}} engine unit was only used when the water tender was <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the engine at running sheds, where the locomotives had to detach and run around their water tenders to change direction. While the locomotives were still shedded at Braamfontein before the new depot at Millsite in Krugersdorp was opened, their water tenders were usually only re-attached when the engines left the depot to save space.|$|E

50|$|A single device can add {{intercom}} functionality {{to multiple}} standard telephones {{on a common}} phone line, even of different makes and models. Installation effort is minimal, and is not vulnerable to the radio interference and security issues of wireless systems. The Add-A-Com Whole House Intercom for Standard Telephone Systems is such a device. Intercom paging is accomplished by sounding a distinctive ring from all telephones after any phone is taken briefly off hook. After paging, any number of phones may converse. The device <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnects</b> the external phone line during intercom use, and reconnects when all phones are again on hook. During intercom use, an external call’s ringing signal {{can be heard in}} the earpiece.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{days after}} the event the users of LambdaMOO {{arranged}} an online meeting, which Dibbell attended under his screenname (Dr. Bombay), to discuss {{what should be done}} about Mr. Bungle. The meeting lasted approximately two hours and forty-five minutes, but no conclusive decisions were made. After attending the meeting, one of the master-programmers of LambdaMOO (with screenname TomTraceback), decided on his own to terminate the Mr. Bungle user's account. Additionally, upon his return from his business trip, LambdaMOO's main creator, Pavel Curtis (screenname Archwizard Haakon), set up a system of petitions and ballots where anyone could put to popular vote anything requiring administrative powers for its implementation. Through this system, LambdaMOO users put into place a [...] command, which <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnects</b> disruptive guest users from the server, {{as well as a number}} of other new features.|$|R
50|$|Some {{electric}} locomotives can also operate on battery power to enable short journeys or shunting on non-electrified lines or yards. Battery-powered locomotives {{are used in}} mines and other underground locations where diesel fumes or smoke would endanger crews, and where external electricity supplies cannot {{be used due to}} the danger of sparks igniting flammable gas. Battery locomotives are also used on many underground railways for maintenance operations, as they are required when operating in areas where the electricity supply has been <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnected.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Daimler Company began {{production}} of motor boats in 1897 from its manufacturing base in Coventry. The engines had two cylinders and the explosive charge of petroleum and air was ignited by compression into a heated platinum tube. The engine gave about six horse-power. The petrol was fed by air pressure {{to a large}} surface carburettor and also an auxiliary tank which supplied the burners for heating the ignition tubes. Reversal of the propeller was effected by means of two bevel friction wheels which engaged with two larger bevel friction wheels, the intermediate shaft being <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnected</b> for this purpose. It was not until 1901 that a safer apparatus for igniting the fuel with an electric spark was used in motor boats.|$|E
50|$|The Type X-17 {{water tender}} first entered service as tenders to these {{locomotives}}. In effect, since Garratt locomotives had hitherto been considered as tank engines because they carry all their water on board, this arrangement introduced the tank-and-tender Garratt. In spite of initial criticisms and doubts, the unusual arrangement of auxiliary water tenders which had earlier only been {{seen on the}} Kitson-Meyer locomotives of the Cape Government Railways and Central South African Railways of 1903 and 1904 respectively, proved to be very effective and was later repeated upon {{the introduction of the}} Classes GMA and GO Garratts in 1954. On the Class GM, the 1600 imp gal on-board water tank on the front engine unit was only used when the water tender was <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the engine at running sheds.|$|E
40|$|We are {{becoming}} more and more dependent upon a broad range of more or less ubiquitous communication technologies, and these are increasingly integrated with our PCs. The more connected we become, the more important it is that we pro-actively manage our communication patterns. If not, we risk being forced to either <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnecting</b> ourselves from communicating, or spend all our time trying to catch up with the demand for communication. None of these two scenarios are desirable. The aim of this paper is to investigate how people manage communication patterns as an integral part of their daily work. Empirical investigation of complex work in a Swedish pharmaceutical company showed a variety of means for managing communication patterns. Based on the fieldwork we present SwitchIT, an application for pro-actively managing communication modes, and discuss the theoretical implications of applying the concepts of communication overflow and communication deficiency to describe communication patterns. It is concluded that there is a need for collaborative technology supporting the negotiation of communication. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{decentralized}} intermittent communication and task planning framework for mobile robot teams. The {{goal of the}} robots is to accomplish complex tasks, captured by local Linear Temporal Logic formulas, and share the collected information with all other robots and possibly also with a user. Specifically, we consider situations where the robot communication capabilities are not sufficient to form reliable and connected networks while the robots move to accomplish their tasks. In this case, intermittent communication protocols are necessary that allow the robots to <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnect</b> from the network {{in order to accomplish}} their tasks free of communication constraints. We assume that the robots can only communicate with each other when they meet at common locations in space. Our decentralized control framework jointly determines local plans that allow all robots fulfill their assigned temporal tasks, sequences of communication events that guarantee information exchange infinitely often, and optimal communication locations that minimize a user-specified metric. Simulation and experimental results verify the efficacy of the proposed controllers...|$|R
40|$|This article explores ways {{in which}} the {{connectivity}} that enables the knowledge economy also constrains it. Knowledge economies prosper through inventing processes that save energy, time, and money. But the conception of the ideas that translate into these processes is time intensive. The paradox of invention is that you need {{to spend a lot of}} time in order to save even more time. Creative thinking is a solitary activity that requires focus over time and insulation from distraction. However, the continual distractions and demands of a highly connected world can mean that we are both victims and perpetrators of the theft of time. Research shows that the typical information worker today is interrupted on average every eleven minutes. In contemporary organizations requests for information and demands for reporting escalate remorselessly, leaving little time for inventiveness. In the rich world time has become by far the scarcest factor of production, due in part to improved connectivity. To engage in inventive thinking we need to be able to <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnect</b> ourselves from the world. In fact, the key to success in the knowledge economy may be the art of simultaneous connection and disconnection...|$|R
50|$|Occasionally {{connected}} computing is {{a software}} architecture {{based on the}} idea that an end user should be able to continue working with an internet application even when <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnected</b> or when a wireless connection fails or is otherwise unavailable. OCC has been seen as one aspect of 'pervasive computing'. In the past, audio and visual telephony no longer functioned when a connection was lost. In an OCC architecture, tasks continue and update a central data store when a connection is restored. Client-side persistent data (CSPD), while not permanent data as in a central data store, are a common implementation of an OCC framework on non-handheld devices such as personal and laptop computers. As the local data store on PDAs commonly exceeds several Gigabytes, OCC becomes more viable for handheld devices.|$|E
5000|$|After {{being dropped}} from Arista, they signed to Lucky Dog Records, a {{subsidiary}} of Epic Records. Their first release for the label, 2001's This Is BR549, also eliminated the hyphen from the band's name. Its only single, [...] "Too Lazy to Work, Too Nervous to Steal", peaked at No. 11 on Country Singles Sales but did not enter the country singles charts proper. After this album, both Bennett and McDowell left the band, with Geoff Firebaugh succeeding McDowell as upright bassist, and Chris Scruggs taking over on guitar and vocals. The new lineup made its first appearance in 2003 on their self released album <b>Temporarily</b> <b>Disconnected.</b> In 2004, they signed with Dualtone Records and released Tangled in the Pines. Scruggs left the band to tour solo in 2005. Firebaugh also left {{to start his own}} band, Hillbilly Casino. Mark Miller replaced Firebaugh. A second album for Dualtone, Dog Days, was released in early 2006.|$|E
50|$|P. Fluid and the P. Fluid Foundation played {{clubs in}} and around New York City but never {{released}} an album. Shortly after leaving 24-7 Spyz for the second time, P. Fluid, now using the name Forrest Thinner, formed Blkvampires. The band released a five-song EP titled The Collector's Item through the Catch A Fire website. These five songs had previously been recorded by 24-7 Spyz and released on <b>Temporarily</b> <b>Disconnected.</b> In 2005, the New York City based band released their debut, self titled album compiling seven previously unreleased tracks {{as well as the}} five songs previously included on the The Collector's Item EP. In 2010, the band released a follow-up ten-song EP/DVD titled Blkcula. A five-song release, titled The Devil's Music, followed in 2012. Also in 2012, Thinner was the creative director and publisher of a book titled The HarlequinX. The book, based on a short film and characters created by Thinner, was written by CJ Cassidy and edited by Hector Valle. Thinner can also be seen in the film Riot on the Dance Floor, an upcoming documentary about City Gardens, a legendary nightclub formerly located in Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of design for sustainability is considered within a design-centred research approach. This form of investigative activity {{is of particular}} interest to the design disciplines and here it is distinguished from other types of design research and discussed in terms of its potential relevance and contribution in advancing material culture in more sustainable directions. As its name suggests, this emerging form of design research within academia focuses especially on the activity of designing, and is complemented by more traditional primary and secondary source research methods. However, in order to advance this type of research activity, particularly in the challenging area of design for sustainability, it is necessary, at least <b>temporarily,</b> to <b>disconnect</b> design from the bottom line in order to more freely explore new ideas and new possibilities. A basis for design-centred research is outlined and supplemented by examples from the author's own research experiences...|$|R
5000|$|When Hazel and Skatore {{discovered}} how popular {{the first two}} albums remained in Europe, they reunited with Anthony Johnson and P. Fluid, now performing as Forrest (his real last name) to release <b>Temporarily</b> <b>Disconnected,</b> produced by Jimi Hazel. The album was released exclusively in Europe by Enemy Records, and {{was followed by a}} quick tour of the continent before Johnson and Fluid left the band once again.-Alternate versions of the next studio album were released in 1996. In March, 6, produced by Jimi Hazel, was released exclusively in Europe through the Enemy label. The album contained covers of The Association's [...] "Along Comes Mary" [...] and Love's [...] "7 and 7 Is." [...] The album was titled 6 due to it being the sixth release by the band. In September 1996, What Are Records released Heavy Metal Soul by the Pound, the American version of 6. The track listing would remain almost identical to 6 {{with the exception of the}} removal of [...] "Along Comes Mary" [...] and [...] "7 and 7 Is" [...] and the additions of [...] "Earth And Sky" [...] and [...] "Save The World" [...] as replacements.|$|E

He, Aeryn, and a <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnected</b> Pilot take a shuttle to Earth's moon, where John makes an emotional farewell phone call to his father. Then, they successfully collapse the wormhole, and kill the Scarrans. While Moya waits on the other side, she is attacked by the Scarrans, and is damaged.

The subject of the analysis was: the cohesion of a family {{from the perspective of the}} evaluated adolescent and three factors of psychological loneliness: social loneliness (sense of social marginalization and isolation), emotional loneliness (solitude) and existential loneliness (sense of self-alienation). The Loneliness Scale (SBS) was used based on an original concept of multidimensional sense of loneliness. The questionnaire for the survey of family cohesion (KSR) were used too. The age (12 - 14 and 15 - 17), gender, family structure and the family lifestyle were controlled. Obtained results revealed significantly lower cohesion and significantly higher existential loneliness in group of teenagers from <b>temporarily</b> <b>disconnected</b> families (TDF).

40|$|Air {{embolism}} due to {{a patent}} foramen ovale visualised by harmonic contrast echocardiography A 73 year old woman presented with impaired conscious-ness after 3 days of uneventful recovery from surgery for rectal cancer. The patient became comatose, and her blood pressure dropped to 70 mm Hg. The total parenteral nutrition infusion line into the right subclavian vein had been <b>disconnected</b> <b>temporarily</b> and by accident just before the episode. Cerebral CT showed branch-like structures with air density in the right frontal lobe (fig 1 A), which strongly suggested cerebral air embolism. The patient gradually regained consciousness, and moderate hemipare-sis {{on the left side}} was noticed. Cerebral angiograms were unremarkable, and on the repeat CT obtained 3 hours after onset, the air was gone. Contrast echocardiography performed after 3 days showed nothing remarkable, partly because the patient was not able to cooperate adequately. Two months after the episode onset, however, harmonic echocardiography with micro air bubbles as a contrast medium demonstrated pas-sage of the bubbles from the right to the left atrium under the Valsalva manoeuvre (fig 1 B). Thus, an occult patent foramen ovale was documented. Air embolism is a rare complication of total parenteral nutrition. When a patent foramen ovale is small, the right to left shunt is diYcult to detect on conventional echocar-diograms. Harmonic contrast echocardiography with the Valsalva manoeuvre is superior in such cases and is as use-ful as transesophageal contrast echocardiography in detecting the small patent foramen ovale. ...|$|R
