5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. <b>The</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including the firing pin and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. <b>The</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E
5|$|In May 1946, SMERSH agents {{recovered}} from the crater where Hitler was buried two burned skull fragments with gunshot damage. These remains were apparently forgotten in the Russian State Archives until 1993, when they were re-found. In 2009 DNA and forensic tests were performed on the skull fragment, which Soviet officials had long believed to be Hitler's. According to the American researchers, the tests revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman and <b>the</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sutures where the skull plates come together placed her age at less than 40 years old. The jaw fragments which had been recovered in May 1945 were not tested.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage).

In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E

At Wisner's request, Tracy Barnes created a booklet from these documents to show to US President Dwight Eisenhower. The 23 documents in the booklet included Communist literature owned by Árbenz, such as a Chinese study on agrarian reform and some Marxist volumes, as well as diplomatic records implying Communist sympathies, and Árbenz's wife Maria Cristina Villanova's copy of a biography of Joseph Stalin.

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails <b>the</b> <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and discontinuities between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E
