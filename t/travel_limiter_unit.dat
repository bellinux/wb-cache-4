50|$|The {{aircraft}} had stalled {{during an}} abnormally steep climb {{and had been}} unable to recover. On 1 December 2015, the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee released its report concluding that the sequence of events leading to the crash started with a malfunction in the rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiter</b> <b>unit.</b> The pilots' response led to a 104-degree roll of the aircraft, and apparent miscommunication between them was a significant link in the chain of events that led to the loss of the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The report {{stated that}} the crash {{resulted}} from the flight crew’s inability to control the aircraft in alternate law. The cracking of a solder joint resulted in {{the failure of the}} Rudder <b>Travel</b> <b>Limiter</b> <b>Unit</b> four times during the flight. The flight crew action to the first three faults was in accordance with the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor messages. Following the fourth fault, the Flight Augmentation Computer's circuit breakers were reset by the flight crew, resulting in electrical interruption to the computers causing the autopilot to disengage and the flight control logic to change to Alternate Law. The rudder deflected 2 degrees to the left, causing the aircraft to roll up to 54 degrees. Subsequent flight crew actions resulted in the aircraft entering a prolonged stall from which they were unable to recover.|$|E
5000|$|After {{studying}} {{the wreckage of}} the Airbus A320-216 as well as the two black boxes and the cockpit recorder, Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee issued a report with their conclusions from the investigation on 1 December 2015. The report stated that the sequence of events that led to the crash started with a malfunction in two of the plane’s rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiter</b> <b>units</b> (RTLU). A tiny soldered electrical connection in the plane's RTLU was found to be cracked, likely for over a year, causing it to intermittently send amber master caution warnings to the electronic centralised aircraft monitor (ECAM) - with the plane's maintenance records showing that the RTLU warning had been sent 23 times over the previous year, but was always solved (and never further investigated, which could have addressed the underlying electrical problem) by resetting the RTLU system. On this flight, the RTLU issue sent an amber caution warning four different times, and the first three times that the ECAM system gave the warning [...] "Auto Flight Rudder <b>Travel</b> <b>Limiter</b> System", the pilot in command followed the ECAM instructions, toggling the flight augmentation computer (FAC) 1 and 2 buttons on the cockpit's overhead panel to off and then on. This procedure did clear the amber master caution warnings for each of those first three warnings.|$|R
5000|$|Faults with rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiters</b> were {{involved}} in the crashes of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 and American Airlines Flight 587. After the latter crash Airbus changed the rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiter</b> on the Airbus A300-600 from a variable ratio design to a variable stop design, as the latter is less complex, with less severe failure modes.|$|R

5000|$|A rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiter,</b> or rudder limiter, is a {{controlling}} device in an aircraft used to mechanically limit the maximum rudder deflection.|$|R
50|$|The rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiter</b> in the Airbus A300-600 is {{controlled}} by the Feel and Limitation Computers (FLC) maintaining sufficient yaw control within the entire flight envelope and limiting excessive lateral loads on the rudder and vertical stabilizer.|$|R
25|$|Any {{aircraft}} rudder {{is subject}} to considerable forces that determine its position via a force or torque balance equation. In extreme cases these forces can lead to loss of rudder control or even destruction of the rudder, as on American Airlines Flight 587 (the same principles also apply to water vessels, of course, {{but it is more}} important for aircraft because they have lower engineering margins). Maximum rudder deflection is controlled by rudder <b>travel</b> <b>limiter.</b> The largest achievable angle of a rudder in flight is called its blowdown limit; it is achieved when the force from the air or blowdown equals the maximum available hydraulic pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The full game {{is played}} with a fleet of PocketModels of up to 30 [...] "build stars" [...] (a fleet size point <b>limiter</b> with <b>units</b> ranging in point values from 1 to 5), and a deck of 30 cards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present the}} design and {{experimental}} implementation of an RF limiter metamaterial using a sheet of nonlinear metamaterials. We demonstrate that complementary electric inductive-capacitive resonators loaded with nonlinear p-i-n diodes can act as RF <b>limiter</b> <b>unit</b> cells. We design and fabricate limiter metamaterials and compare them to traditional circuit limiters. Our limiter metamaterial exhibits a minimum insertion loss under 3 dB, a maximum decrease in transmission of 6. 95 dB and broadband performance, with a minimum decrease in transmission of 3 dB over 18 % bandwidth. The limiter metamaterial is suitable {{for a wide variety}} of practical applications requiring protection of sensitive devices from high power.

40|$|Indonesia {{has one of}} {{the highest}} number of {{fatalities}} caused by traffic accident. It is become main concern since last decades. Approximately of 10 % fatalities is caused by tank truck accident, it recorded by PT. Pertamina Persero, Indonesia in 2015 that 17 % and 20 % tank truck accident is caused by over speed and fatigue, respectively. Therefore, over speed has become main factor the occurrence of tank truck accident. Main objective of this research is to install speed limiter on the tank truck in order to improve safety engineering system, decrease accident and to maintain engine performance. This research is conducted in Indonesia especially in Java-Bali route <b>travel.</b> Speed <b>limiter</b> is installed to the tank truck engine which completed by fuel cut-off solenoid to reduce the speed automatically when it exceeding the maximum speed that has been determined. From the result shows that top speed which performed by driver up to 133 km/h when tank truck uninstalled by speed limiter. Meanwhile, when speed limiter is installed to the tank truck, top speed locked at 70 km/h even though the driver want to speed up. It means that fuel cut-off system is very effective to lock the speed at 70 km/h and it shown the improvement up to 65 %. The monitoring activities observed that the decreasing number of fatalities caused by tank truck accident become 7 % as compared to last year of 17 %. It can be found that the speed limiter coupled by speed recorder was very efficient to improve safety engineering system of the tank truck...|$|R
40|$|Ship {{acceleration}} manoeuvre {{is important}} in terms of safety and engine performance. Head seaways {{are one of the most}} challenging conditions for the ship propulsion. A detailed simulation of the propulsion system’s transient response during dynamic acceleration in harsh conditions can result in a thorough investigation of the engine performance, a better management of control system and the monitoring of engine limiters application in real conditions. For the overall propulsion system performance assessment during ship acceleration, a computational tool has been developed that comprises sub-systems for the simulation of engine, turbocharger, propeller components and their interaction. The developed tool has been validated against available shop and sea trials data and then it has been tested for the simulation of propulsion system performance during acceleration in dynamic conditions. Based on the simulations results, a sensitivity analysis has been performed for the investigation of the governor control <b>unit</b> <b>limiters</b> that apply on the engine during acceleration. As a result, the effect of engine governor limiters on the overall engine and hydrodynamic performance of the ship during acceleration is quantified and discussed...|$|R
