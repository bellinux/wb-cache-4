2500|$|Declarative {{sentences}} show a 2–3–1 pitch pattern. If {{the last}} syllable is prominent the final decline in pitch is a glide. For example, in <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>fun,</b> this is is at pitch 2, and fun starts at level 3 and glides down to level 1. But if the last prominent syllable {{is not the}} last syllable of the utterance, the pitch fall-off is a step. For example, in That can be frustrating, That can be has pitch 2, frus- has level 3, and both syllables of -trating have pitch 1. Wh-questions work the same way, as in Who (2) will (2) help (3↘1)? and Who (2) did (3) it (1)?. But if something is left unsaid, the final pitch level 1 is replaced by pitch 2. Thus in John's (2) sick (3↘2) ..., with the speaker indicating more to come, John's has pitch 2 while sick starts at pitch 3 and drops only to pitch 2.|$|E

5000|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} on the developers' website on 23 September 2009 and given its first public showcase in November 2009 at the Eurogamer Expo in Earls Court. The team used this event {{as an opportunity}} for extensive playtesting, receiving feedback from those playing the game and creating new software builds for each day of the expo. Murray cited numerous [...] "happy accidents" [...] during development, which led to incorporation of various features into the end product.

And it doesn't have the freshness and originality of a more traditional movie like Lilo & Stitch. Its real future, I suspect, lies in home video. It's only 76 minutes long, but although kids will like it, their parents will be sneaking looks at their watches." ...|$|E

[...] which he encourages people to experiment with in their own kitchens. His most famous creation is the Cherpumple, in which cherry, apple and pumpkin pies are baked into several different flavors of cake and then stacked together, a concoction which the Wall Street Journal dubbed [...] "the turducken of desserts" [...] and The Huffington Post described as [...] "awesome and absolutely offensive all in one".|$|E

30|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the lack of {{knowledge}} is a significant limitation to the correct interpretation of hemodynamic variables [17]. Serious games are video games designed to learn and train on serious topics, such as safety and processes. Serious games are increasingly used in industry and hospitals [18]. They increase the use of learning tools (<b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>fun)</b> and training efficiency (this is simulation) [19]. Advantages of simulation training over traditional education methods include unlimited exposure to rare but complicated clinical events and the absence of risk for patients [20]. Simulation-based training was demonstrated to improve medical knowledge, clinical performance and comfort in procedures. It is also useful to teach teamwork and communication, a key element of quality of care [21]. Therefore, the current development of serious games in health care [18] may greatly benefit hemodynamic monitoring, given the large number of hemodynamic variables and tools, as well as the complexity of cardiovascular physiology.|$|E
40|$|Our beginner’s {{course in}} signal {{processing}} is taught {{to students who}} are computer literate, but who lack the traditional electrical engineering background in circuit theory. We started to notice that when they were taught using a high-level, batch-oriented language such as Matlab TM for computer exercises, they did not grasp well the basic details of sinusoids, convolution, the DFT etc. This led us to a search for better ways. The multimedia and real-time capabilities of Java TM combined with the large processing capability of today’s PC, and in addition the real time input/output of the PC’s soundcard, now provide the key elements in our beginner’s course. The students {{have to work out}} all the details of loops and indices for the convolution, the sinusoids of the DFT, and time and frequency axes. Results have been improved, and also the enthusiasm of the students.
