5|$|One word {{more about}} the bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> acted, some indecencies had like to have happened, {{but it was not}} my fault.

When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know.

You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1924, Darrow took {{on the case of}} Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb, the teenage sons of two wealthy Chicago {{families}} who were accused of kidnapping and killing Bobby Franks, a 14-year-old boy, from their stylish southside Kenwood neighborhood. Leopold was a law student at the University of Chicago about to transfer to Harvard Law School, and Loeb was the youngest graduate ever from the University of Michigan; they were 18 and 17, respectively, when they were arrested. When asked why they committed the crime, Leopold told his captors: [...] "The thing that prompted Dick to want to do this thing and prompted me to want to do <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a sort of pure love of excitement... the imaginary love of thrills, doing something different... the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{he walked}} slowly down-town he was {{thinking}} hard. The subject occupying his mind was {{the problem of how}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to be stopped.|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} further discomforted him. It {{was growing}} upon him that <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{not going to}} be the success he had anticipated. It would be necessary to proceed warily.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{sank back}} upon her chair, {{perfectly}} helpless. <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{too much for}} her to grasp. She looked up at the woman who had spoken these marvelous words, half frightened, altogether bewildered.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't. Isn't that plain? <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> getting horrible--but I {{have to see}} it through. It was Clavering fixed it, any way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then; come in," [...] she replied, tartly. [...] "Thank the Lord <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> nearly over, and we'll have a {{few weeks}} of peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kindly prompt me," [...] said Hackett, {{wiping his}} forehead, though {{the night was}} cool, [...] "how far <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to be carried. And might I expect any further {{portions}} of my raiment to be mistaken for wild animals and killed?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{a general}} start. The first gleam of light {{struggled}} into {{the minds of the}} little group of listeners. They began to see whither <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> tending, and everyone looked very grave.|$|E
60|$|Milly was a wise girl, {{and pressed}} him no further. After all, {{there are some}} things it is better for none of us to know about one another, and <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> just one of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thy watchmen call but slowly, King, {{the water}} in the pool speaks swifter," [...] said Rachel, then still {{in the midst of a}} heavy silence, for <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> fearful to them, she turned and departed.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll wish I hadn't before <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> ended," [...] was the surly reply, {{and then}} the {{prisoner}} {{turned his back on}} the ex-chief of the regulators.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll see {{enough of}} me before <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> ended," [...] {{the man said}} with a growl, and Harvey looked around suspiciously, so {{confident}} was the fellow's tone.|$|R

6000|$|... "Not {{a bit of}} it. I {{only thought}} that there'd be more chance of success if {{somebody}} else took the job. You see I've made a big fool of myself {{half a dozen times}} since <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> started." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{knew what}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> I have on my back; then I could make {{some sort of}} {{conjecture}} as to what I design doing with it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'You rode well,' said Sidonia to Coningsby; 'but {{your horse}} was more strong than swift. After all, <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a race; and, {{notwithstanding}} Solomon, {{in a race}} speed must win.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As Lyon was {{cruising}} about," [...] he said, [...] "and his sloop was pitching her catheads under, <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> washed upon a spare anchor, {{where it}} stuck. It's a queer flag. Can it {{have had any}} connection with the lugger?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who were they?" [...] {{he asked}} himself, again and again. [...] "What {{kind of man}} did <b>this</b> <b>thing?</b> <b>Was</b> the leader a man like Ballard? Even so, he was hired. By whom? By ranchers covetous of the range; that was {{absolutely}} certain." ...|$|E
60|$|A sudden {{gust of wind}} {{drove them}} back a step, {{rendering}} talk impossible. It covered a gap when Jimmy could not have spoken. The shock {{of the information that}} Ann had met him before made him dumb. <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> beyond him. It baffled him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jest {{as likely}} as not I'll {{surprise}} people before <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> over. If I can get on the track of them men Something is goin' to happen for a fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--Macpherson's in Judd Street. I {{suppose he}} likes to keep among the Scotch. I don't think he ever goes out of the house, and he's waiting in London till <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> published." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{serve you}} out before <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> ended," [...] he cried, shaking his fist in {{impotent}} rage {{as he went}} toward the flap, and Dan, who could control himself no longer, replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|When on {{the third}} night he dreamed it yet again, even more vividly, then {{he was sure that}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> from God, and summoned his holy Imauns and his Diviners, and took counsel with them. These, after they had listened, prayed and consulted, spoke thus: ...|$|E

60|$|Lord Belpber was {{thoroughly}} upset.
