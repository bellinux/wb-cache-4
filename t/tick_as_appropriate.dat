40|$|Audit {{data were}} {{collected}} continuously between February 1988 and July 1991. For the initial period (February 1988 -June 1990) {{data were collected}} by monitoring of ward admission and discharge records and by collecting data from operating theatre records whilst complications were noted in a 'complications book' which was kept on the notes trolley. In July 1991, when a computerized system for storing and processing audit data was introduced into the department, the methods of data collection changed. For each patient a proforma {{was attached to the}} clinical notes which was filled in at each stage of the hospital stay. On this proforma was a list of possible complications which were <b>ticked,</b> <b>as</b> <b>appropriate,</b> at the time of discharge from hospital. We have reviewed the results of clinical audit during these two periods. The number of operations performed per month fell slightly in the latter period (p = 0. 005). However, there was a significant increase in both the number of complications (p < 0. 0001) and in the complication rate (p < 0. 0001). Further analysis showed that there was a similar {{increase in the number of}} recorded major and minor complications, and that this increase was also seen even when changes in medical personnel were accounted for. We suggest that the increased complication rate recorded in the latter period reflects the change in the method of data collection. This has important implications when comparing outcome measures for clinical departments...|$|R

2500|$|Korean has {{a simple}} tone system often {{characterized}} by the poorly defined term [...] "pitch accent". Hangul originally had two diacritics to represent this system, a single <b>tick,</b> <b>as</b> in 성〮, for high tone, and a double <b>tick,</b> <b>as</b> in 성〯, for a long vowel. When transcribing Chinese, these had been used for the 'departing' (去聲) and 'rising' (上聲) tones, respectively. [...] (The 'even' tone (平聲) was not marked. [...] The 'entering' (入聲) [...] "tone", which was not a tone at all, was indicated by its final stop consonant.) [...] Although the pitch and length distinctions are still made in speech by many Koreans, the diacritics are obsolete.|$|R

40|$|Bartonella are hemoparasites {{exploiting}} a {{range of}} mammals as reservoir hosts. Several species are zoonotic pathogens. Fleas, lice, and other arthropods, such <b>as</b> <b>ticks,</b> have been implicated as vectors. While the competence of <b>ticks</b> <b>as</b> vectors of Bartonella species has recently been demonstrated, the epidemiological significance of <b>ticks</b> <b>as</b> vectors of Bartonella species in wildlife populations remains unknown. We used the presence of deer at study sites to control the presence of Ixodes ricinus ticks, and used this system to determine whether I. ricinus contributes to the epidemiology of Bartonella species infections in small mammals. Ticks were present at all sites with deer, but were absent from all sites without deer; however, the abundance of ticks on small mammals {{did not affect the}} probability of wood mice being infected with Bartonella species. Data presented here indicate that I. ricinus is not involved in the transmission of Bartonella in woodland rodents. A. Harrison was supported by a Ph. D. studentship from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD). [URL]...|$|R
