25|$|Viper was {{launched}} at Poole on 11 June, and having got her ready for sea, Roddam sailed {{to join the}} Channel Fleet at Spithead, arriving on 26 July. Shortly after his arrival, the commander-in-chief, George Anson {{expressed a desire to}} stop a fleet, then at Plymouth, from sailing. The commanders of the various ships in the fleet argued against sending a ship, owing to the strong south-westerly wind, but Roddam, despite having a brand-new ship, not fully fitted and trialled at sea, offered to make the attempt. Impressed, Anson wrote to the Admiralty, and requested that Roddam be placed under his command. Anson was later superseded by Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Warren, who in mid-1747 received word from a Bristol-based privateer that a fleet of some 30 ships were assembled at Cedeiro Bay, near Cape Ortegal, loaded with naval stores. The entrance to the anchorage was very narrow, and was defended by two shore batteries. With the odds against any attack, Sir Peter decided that there was little point in risking an assault. At this time Captain Henry Harrison, Roddam's old commander on Monmouth, suggested to Warren that Roddam make an attempt in Viper, adding that 'He would answer for <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> effecting all that human nature could perform'.|$|E

[...] "I'm not {{pitching}} for the Cy Young", Zito said. [...] "I'm pitching to get the Oakland A's into the playoffs and to the World Series." [...] In his next start, against the Seattle Mariners, Zito took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before John Olerud singled to leadoff the inning. Seattle manager Lou Piniella said if he could vote for the Cy Young Award winner, [...] "It would go to <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who pitched for the Oakland team.

40|$|Social {{psychologists have}} argued that popular U. K. and U. S. men’s {{magazines}} known as “lads’ mags” have normalized hostile sexism among <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> Three studies develop this argument. First, a survey of 423 <b>young</b> U. K. <b>men</b> found that ambivalent sexism predicted attitudes toward the consumption of lads’ mags, but not other forms of direct sexual consumption (paying for sex or patronizing strip clubs). Second, Study 2 (N 81) found <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> low in sexism rated sexist jokes as less hostile toward women, but not as either funnier nor more ironic, when those jokes were presented within a lads’ mags context. These findings refute the idea <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> readily read lads’ mags’ sexism as ironic or “harmless fun. ” They show instead that placing sexist jokes in lads’ mags contexts makes them appear less hostile. The third study (N 275) demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> perceived lads’ mags as less legitimate after attempting to distinguish the contents of lads’ mags from rapists’ legitimations of their crimes. Implications for contemporary studies of masculinities and consumption are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|One {{example of}} Telyakovsky's efforts {{in his attempt}} to [...] "de-throne" [...] Petipa came in 1902 when he invited Alexander Gorsky, former premier danseur to the Imperial Ballet, to stage his own version of Petipa's 1869 ballet Don Quixote. Gorsky had been engaged as Ballet Master to the Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre, and in 1900 he mounted a {{complete}} revision of Don Quixote in a version radically different from Petipa's original. Petipa became furious when he learned this new version would be staged for the St. Peterburg troupe, as he had not even been consulted on the production of a ballet that was originally his creation. While watching a rehearsal of Gorsky's production at the Mariinsky Theatre, Petipa was heard yelling out [...] "Will someone tell <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> that I am not yet dead?!". Petipa was further frustrated {{by the fact that the}} Imperial Theatre's newly appointed régisseur Nicholas Sergeyev was being paid large sums to travel throughout the Russian Empire and stage many of the ageing Ballet Master's works.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} into a range of needs and risks <b>that</b> affect <b>young</b> people found <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are often as vulnerable as <b>young</b> women, but <b>that</b> these vulnerabilities can manifest themselves in different ways. A tendency to externalise and act-out when in emotional distress often masks the vulnerabilities of <b>young</b> <b>men.</b> This is compounded by the fact <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are significantly less likely than young women to seek help for physical, emotional and other problems, leaving them open to prolonged suffering.

40|$|Compared to offline {{gambling}} forms, online gambling {{has been}} hypothesized {{to lead to}} a heightened risk of developing gambling pathology. Suggestions about who the risks apply to have varied. In light of the finding that online gambling and the associated financial difficulties are reported mostly by younger males, some hypotheses identify younger males as an at-risk group. An alternative possibility is <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> males simply display a trend that will emerge population-wide as online gambling proliferates. In this chapter, hypotheses about the population-wide and young-male-specific risks of online gambling are assessed using data from three nationwide Czech surveys. The hypotheses relating specifically to <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are, first, <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are greater risk-takers who enjoy “practicing” in anonymous environments, and, second, <b>that</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are more prone to overspending as a result of losing track of time during play. 20 page(s...|$|R
