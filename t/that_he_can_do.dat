25|$|Part One (Chapters 1 to 15): Gilbert Markham narrates how {{a mysterious}} widow, Mrs Helen Graham, arrives at Wildfell Hall, a nearby mansion. A source of curiosity {{for the small}} community, the reticent Mrs Graham and her young son, Arthur, are slowly drawn into the social circles of the village. Initially Gilbert Markham casually courts Eliza Millward, despite his mother's belief <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> better. His {{interest}} in Eliza wanes as he comes to know Mrs Graham. In retribution, Eliza spreads (and perhaps creates) scandalous rumours about Helen. With gossip flying, Gilbert is {{led to believe that}} his friend Mr Lawrence is courting Mrs Graham. At a chance meeting on a road Gilbert strikes the mounted Lawrence with a whip handle, causing him to fall from his horse. Though she is unaware of this confrontation, Helen Graham still refuses to marry Gilbert, but when he accuses her of loving Lawrence she gives him her diaries.|$|E

Peter is forced to ask Tony Stark for financial assistance, and then seeks counsel with Doctor Strange. The latter informs Peter <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> nothing to grant Aunt May her life back.

Strange heals his wounds and sends him on his way, encouraging him to be by his Aunt's side at her death.|$|E

John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a {{negative}} review {{and called it}} [...] "easily {{the worst of the}} season". He awarded it a 4 out of 10 and concluded that, [...] "We can only hope that none of the remaining episodes are Shiban-related, and pray <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> a much better job when he writes for [...] next season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry [...] "solid and efficient". The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that [...] "as a director [...] makes 'Underneath' shine", but were critical of some of the [...] "trademark X-File moments", citing [...] "the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror" [...] and [...] "the climactic fight in a sewer" [...] as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett.

500|$|John Glover characterizes Lionel as a {{businessman}} who is disappointed with his son. To Glover, Lionel is this [...] "rich and powerful businessman" [...] who sees his son as a [...] "wuss" [...] and [...] "fraidy-cat". It was important to Glover that Lionel appear as human as possible; Glover {{said he does not}} want to simply [...] "twirl [...] mustache". Glover described Lionel as a man who will do whatever he needs to do to get what he wants. He characterizes Lionel as an intelligent man who can read people easily. Lionel uses that ability to further his goals. The character can also get past people's defenses and manipulate them. Glover thinks that type of power would be great if it could be used to help someone other than Lionel. Lionel's character is also connoted by the color scheme that surrounds him; the use of cold blue tones helps to evoke the [...] "sinister" [...] nature of the character. Lionel is also often portrayed in front of a white or [...] "clinical blue" [...] background. Lionel's signature mane of hair is used to symbolize his power—by growing it out and refusing to style it, Lionel attempts to show he is so powerful <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> whatever he wants without any backlash.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{response}} from Christian philosophers, such as Norman Geisler or William Lane Craig {{is that the}} paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, {{does not mean that}} God can do anything at all but, rather, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything that's possible according to his nature. The distinction is important. God cannot perform logical absurdities; he cannot, for instance, make 1+1=3. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible supports this, they assert, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, which says it is [...] "impossible for God to lie." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{realize that}} I shouldn't be {{surprised}} at God's doing things that I can't explain.

Cramer admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> better, and that he can change. He also pointed out the mass illusion on Wall Street and the finance industry in general that, in the words of former Merrill Lynch CEO Stanley O'Neal, [...] "fixed income and credit (i.e. the economy) were no longer cyclical in nature", and that this illusion had permeated Wall Street and all other industries connected to it, including the finance networks.|$|E

Wrayburn emerges from the river on his deathbed, but is ready to marry Lizzie to save her reputation.

Years later, in 1552, the chronicler João de Barros grumbled at the change in name.
