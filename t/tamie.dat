500|$|Due to the {{gameplay}} {{being created}} first, Mitsuda had difficulty pinning down {{what he had}} to do, and wrote songs for the soundtrack based on the gradually-emerging visuals and scenario. Mitsuda estimated that he had written around one hundred songs for the game including test tracks. The opening vocal track, titled [...] "Ring", was written for the opening movie and set to a piece of poetry written by Takahashi: to portray the themes of the game, Mitsuda used three female vocalists, Eri Kawai, Koko Komine, and <b>Tamie</b> Hirose, and recorded in a multiplexer to produce as clear a sound as possible. Kawai also performed vocal work for the track [...] "Destruction". For each of the location themes, Mitsuda used a different primary instrument to create an impression: for instance, for a desert location, he used a sitar, while a location dominated by machinery used electric guitar. All the instrument sounds were created using a synthesizer.|$|E
2500|$|The cuisine of Aix-les-Bains {{is typical}} of Savoy, based on {{products}} of the local soil and mountain meadows, essentially the Bauges. In addition to its famous fondue, there is the pleasing main course of potato doughnuts, and also , péla, tartiflette, diots, polenta and [...] For dessert, there are bugnes, confiture de lait and blueberry pie. Aix tables feature Savoy cheeses such as Abondance, Beaufort, the , , , , Reblochon, Abbaye de <b>Tamié,</b> Tomme de Savoie and still many others.

The local trout, Arctic char and the vendace are pleasing to eat. Also fishing and frying pike delights the taste buds of the inhabitants of Aix-les-Bains. The surrounding forests and mountains of average altitude, such as Mont Revard, offer very popular produce.

50|$|The {{first task}} <b>Tamie</b> Fraser {{undertook}} was {{to supplement the}} surviving settings of the 1927 white and gold Royal Doulton dinner service.
