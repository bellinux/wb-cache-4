5|$|The {{production}} of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), {{released by the}} anterior pituitary gland. TSH release in turn is stimulated by <b>thyrotropin</b> releasing hormone (TRH), released in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. The thyroid hormones provide negative feedback to the thyrotropes TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones are high, TSH production is suppressed. This negative feedback also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{thyroid gland}} {{is the only}} source of thyroid hormone in the body; the process {{requires}} iodine and the amino acid tyrosine. Iodine in the bloodstream is taken up by the gland and incorporated into thyroglobulin molecules. The process is controlled by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, <b>thyrotropin),</b> which is secreted by the pituitary. Not enough iodine, or not enough TSH, can result in decreased production of thyroid hormones.|$|E
25|$|Genes {{believed}} to be involved include those for thyroglobulin, <b>thyrotropin</b> receptor, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4, among others.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterium}} Yersinia enterocolitica bears structural similarity {{with the}} human <b>thyrotropin</b> receptor and was hypothesized {{to contribute to the}} development of thyroid autoimmunity arising for other reasons in genetically susceptible individuals.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines, {{including}} clonazepam, bind to mouse glial {{cell membranes}} with high affinity. Clonazepam decreases release of acetylcholine in the feline brain and decreases prolactin release in rats. Benzodiazepines inhibit cold-induced {{thyroid stimulating hormone}} (also known as TSH or <b>thyrotropin)</b> release. Benzodiazepines acted via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive calcium uptake in experimentation on rat brain cell components. This has been conjectured as a mechanism for high-dose effects on seizures in the study.|$|E
2500|$|Thyroid-stimulating {{immunoglobulins}} {{recognize and}} bind to the <b>thyrotropin</b> receptor (TSH receptor) which stimulates the secretion of thyroxine (T4) and [...] triiodothyronine (T3). [...] Thyroxine receptors in the pituitary gland are activated by the surplus hormone, suppressing additional release of TSH {{in a negative}} feedback loop. [...] The result is very high levels of circulating thyroid hormones and a low TSH level.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{commonly}} included disorders of the endocrine system are congenital hypothyroidism (CH) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). [...] Testing for both disorders {{can be done}} using blood samples collected on the standard newborn screening card. [...] Screening for CH is done by measuring thyroxin (T4), <b>thyrotropin</b> (TSH) {{or a combination of}} both analytes. [...] Elevated 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (17α-OHP) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH, {{most commonly}} done using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, with many programs using a second tier tandem mass spectrometry test {{to reduce the number of}} false positive results. [...] Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of congenital adrenal hypoplasia, which presents with extremely low levels of 17α-OHP.|$|E
2500|$|Hypothyroidism {{is usually}} {{caused by an}} iodine {{deficiency}} that results in the under production of thyroid hormones or an underdeveloped thyroid gland with similar effects. [...] Thyroid hormone release is regulated by a stimulating hormone called <b>thyrotropin</b> (TSH) in a normal functioning person. [...] In abnormal cases when there are lowered levels of thyroid hormone, TSH levels increase to compensate, thus doctors and medical researchers can measure TSH levels to predict hypothyroidism. [...] If interested, a good explanation of this process {{and the consequences of}} abnormal levels of TSH can be found under this link. [...] Reduced levels of thyroid hormones have many physical and cognitive implications for a fetus once fully developed. [...] Because of ethical reasons, most research has been carried out on rats and other mammals. [...] However, in the hypothyroid rat brain, numerous malformations were found: [...] reduced myelin of neurons in the CNS, deficiency of neurons in the cerebral cortex, the visual cortex and auditory cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, which relate to general learning and motor skill acquisition.|$|E
50|$|Experimentally, GT can be {{determined}} by stimulating the thyroid with a high <b>thyrotropin</b> concentration (e.g. by means of rhTSH, i.e. recombinant human <b>thyrotropin)</b> and measuring its output in terms of T4 production, or by measuring the serum concentration of protein-bound 131I after administration of radioiodine.|$|E

50|$|Ions such as {{thiocyanate}} (from {{cigarette smoking}} for example) and perchlorate decrease iodide uptake by competitive inhibition and, {{as a consequence}} of reduced thyroxine and triiodothyronine secretion by the gland, cause, at low doses, an increased release of <b>thyrotropin</b> (by reduced negative feedback), which then stimulates the gland.|$|E
