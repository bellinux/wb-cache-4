500|$|Winslet's weight {{fluctuations}} {{over the}} years have been well documented by the media. She has been outspoken about her refusal to allow Hollywood to dictate her weight. In 2003, the British edition of GQ magazine published photographs of Winslet that had been digitally altered to make her look taller and thinner. Winslet stated that the alterations were made without her consent, and added, [...] "I just didn't want people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a hypocrite and that I'd suddenly lost 30 lbs or whatever". GQ subsequently issued an apology. In 2007, she won a defamation suit against Grazia magazine after it claimed that she had visited a diet doctor. She claimed £10,000 in damages, and donated the amount to an eating disorder charity. She won another case in 2009 against the British tabloid Daily Mail after it printed that she had lied about her exercise regimen. She filed the suit to demonstrate her commitment to the view that women should accept their appearance with pride. She received an apology and a payout of £25,000.|$|E

500|$|During his childhood, and {{owing to}} his {{considerable}} strength and bulk, Steiger {{became known as}} [...] "The Rock". Despite being mocked over his mother's alcoholism, he was a popular figure at school and an able softball player. He displayed an interest in writing poetry and acting during his adolescent years, and appeared in several school plays while at West Side High School in Newark. Tired of fighting with his mother, he {{ran away from home}} at age sixteen to join the United States Navy during World War II. [...] He enlisted on May 11, 1942, and received his training at the U.S. Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island. He joined the newly commissioned USS Taussig (DD-746) on May 20, 1944. While serving as a torpedoman on destroyers, he saw action in the South Pacific, including the Battle of Iwo Jima. Steiger later commented: [...] "I loved the Navy. I was stupid enough <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being heroic". His experiences during the war haunted him {{for the rest of his}} life, particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the sinking of vessels by the Taussig which were known to have women and children aboard. On December 17, 1944, off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines, Steiger and the Taussig encountered a severe typhoon, which became known as Halsey's Typhoon, with winds reaching one hundred knots (115mph) and [...] waves. As a result, three U.S. destroyers were lost, but the Taussig survived, with Steiger tying a rope to himself on deck and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship.|$|E
