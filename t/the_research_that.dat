He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an envoy in a Sindian royal court. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, during which Tod {{was involved in the}} intelligence department, he was appointed Political Agent for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region {{under the control of the}} East India Company. During this period Tod conducted most of <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>that</b> he would later publish. Tod was initially successful in his official role, but his methods were questioned by other members of the East India Company. Over time, his work was restricted and his areas of oversight were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, Tod resigned his post as Political Agent and returned to England.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates whether lack {{of managerial}} skills {{of small business}} owners is {{the main cause of}} business failure in South Africa. It is evident from <b>the</b> conducted <b>research</b> <b>that</b> small business owners lack certain managerial skill such as financial management, marketing and human managerial skills to operate their businesses successfully. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> findings confirmed <b>that</b> entrepreneurs of MSEs are in need of support services. It is equally evident that entrepreneurs of MSEs are constrained not only by financial factors but also by non-financial factors such as lack of education, inadequate technical skills, poor access to markets, lack of information and unreliable infrastructure. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> conducted confirmed <b>that</b> there is relationship between problems experienced by MSEs entrepreneurs and the managerial skills they possess. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> established <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of managerial skills has a negative impact on the success and viability of small businesses. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> challenge would be to increase the pool of capable small business owners in South Africa.
