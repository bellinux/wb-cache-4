40|$|Is it {{possible}} to include food away from home (FAFH) {{in a way that}} is nutritious and economically feasible? According to researchers from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the USDA, it is, as long as foods are chosen carefully. The Health Reform Bill signed into law last month mandates calorie labeling on all restaurant chain menu boards, drivethrough displays, and vending machines, as well as providing additional nutrition information upon request. Given that low-income consumers spend about 27 % of their food dollars on FAFH, an increased interest in nutrition labeling may be on the horizon. The Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), the primary determinant of SNAP benefits, is based on the assumption that all foods are purchased at retail stores; <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>meals</b> eaten away from home are not factored into the TFP. Our ever-growing appetite for the taste, variety, and convenience (time, food availability, cooking skills) of FAFH may shrink our wallets while simultaneously expanding our waistlines. Restaurant food prices are generally higher than retail food prices and foods are often loaded with calories, fat, and sodium while lacking in fiber, calcium, and iron. A recently published analysis of national survey data by the USDA showed that the number of servings of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and milk products per 1000 calories tends to decrease, while intakes of sodium, SoFAAS (saturated/solid fat, alcohol and added sugar) and overall calorie intake increases when adults eat more meals away from home. The original TFP model consists of one model for each of the 15 age and gender groups and 58 food groups. You et al created a non-linear mathematical model of the TFP that includes FAFH using the same type of data as the TFP: food prices, nutrient profiles, and food consumptio...|$|E

50|$|The Court uses {{statutory}} interpretation {{to affirm the}} Commissioner’s approach. First, the Court notes that “traveling” implies being “away from home.” Therefore, a broad interpretation of “away from home” would make the phrase redundant.

50|$|Nearly 400 {{participating}} schools, serving {{an estimated}} 2.8 million students, {{dropped out of}} the School Lunch Program between September 1980 and September 1981.

5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> did {{not qualify}} for a § 162(a)(2) {{business}} expense deduction, then they would be classified as a § 262 personal expense, and would be non-deductible. Whether <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> falls under § 162(a)(2) depends on how the phrase [...] "traveling ... away from home" [...] is interpreted. The Commissioner has interpreted the phrase as requiring the taxpayer to sleep or rest during his trip. The Court found two advantages to the Commissioner’s interpretation. First, the Court noted that a business traveler who is allowed a § 162(a)(2) business deduction receives a windfall, because {{part of what is}} spent on meals represents a personal living expense that other taxpayers are not entitled to deduct at all. Therefore, fairness demands that § 162(a)(2) should not extend to all situations involving business travel. Allowing a taxpayer who has to travel two blocks from his home on a business trip to take a § 162(a)(2) deduction, but not the taxpayer whose business requires no travel at all, illustrates the inequitable result of a contrary approach. Second, the requirement that the taxpayer must sleep away from home in order to qualify for a § 162(a)(2) deduction is a bright-line, easy to administer rule that avoids unnecessary litigation.|$|R
5000|$|The respondent, a {{traveling}} salesman from Tennessee, routinely took same-day business trips throughout 1960 and 1961. He would leave on business {{early in the}} morning and come back by dinner. Because he would eat breakfast and lunch on the road, he deducted <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> those <b>meals</b> from his 1960 and 1961 income tax return pursuant to § 162(a)(2). § 162(a)(2) allows the taxpayer to deduct [...] "traveling expenses incurred while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business." [...] The Commissioner of Internal Revenue ("Commissioner") disallowed the deductions on the ground that the respondent did not meet the definition of [...] "away from home" [...] under § 162(a)(2) because his trip did not require him to sleep or rest. Therefore, the Commissioner ruled that <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meals</b> was not a § 162(a)(2) business expense, but rather a [...] "’personal, living’ expense under § 262." [...] The respondent paid the tax and sued for a refund in the District Court. He received a favorable verdict in the District Court, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The Supreme Court granted certiorari “in order to resolve a conflict among the circuits on this recurring question of federal income tax administration.” ...|$|R
