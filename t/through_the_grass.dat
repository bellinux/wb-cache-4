Hamlin turned sideways and drove <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> in the infield, prompting the second caution on the following lap. Hamlin only sustained minor damage to his splitter.

25|$|During {{the early}} morning {{of the first day}} of battle, small parties of Indians dashed up to the sand bar on horseback several times, but they did little damage to the scouts. The scouts killed their horses for breastworks and dug pits into the soft sand behind them. When the scouts opened fire, the Indians {{attacked}} the island on both sides. Later they crawled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> and shot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> Several scouts who were killed or wounded were hit by the Indian snipers hidden in the grass. The Indians surrounded the island and repeatedly attacked the Scouts. Three scouts hidden in hole on the riverbank shot several Indians from the shore.|$|E

500|$|Kurt Busch {{made a good}} start, {{retaining}} the first position; Jamie McMurray behind him maintained the second position. At {{the end of the}} first lap, McMurray passed Busch.

The Soldier with the Green Whiskers informs Dorothy that Glinda the Good Witch of the South {{may be able to}} help her return home, so the friends begin their journey to see Glinda, who lives in Oz's Quadling Country.
