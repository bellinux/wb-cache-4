5|$|In July 2009, some of Twitter's {{revenue and}} user growth {{documents}} were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll.

No information about how Twitter planned to achieve <b>those</b> <b>numbers</b> was published. In response, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a blog post suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker.|$|E

5|$|The state passed {{legislation}} in 1941 that authorized {{the creation of}} limited-access roadways; the MSHD could prohibit access to a state trunkline from the adjacent properties. Around the same time, single-digit highways like M-9 were renumbered to set aside <b>those</b> <b>numbers</b> for future freeways in the state. During World War II, the Willow Run Expressway, the Detroit Industrial Expressway and the Davison Freeway were built, ushering in {{the beginnings of the}} state's freeway system. These highway improvements were financed by the Defense Highway Act of 1941 to aid in national defense. After the war, the MSHD and the Good Roads Federation studied the highway needs of the state. Their study reported that road maintenance and improvement deteriorated since the Great Depression. It also stated that funding needed to be increased to deal with pressures from traffic increases after the war.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1970s, Glenmalure Park {{regularly}} hosted attendances in {{the region}} of 20,000 people, but as the majority of the Irish public turned its back on Irish football, <b>those</b> <b>numbers</b> declined and despite winning the League of Ireland four times in succession in the 1980s, the attendances for the period averaged approximately a quarter of that figure. The sale of the stadium contributed to a further decline in support. During the homeless years, particularly those spent on the Northside, attendances continued to fall with the exception of those recorded during the club's residence at the RDS, which included an opening attendance of 22,000. Prior to the relocation to Tallaght, the club's support base had been reduced to a hardcore group of over a thousand people. It currently includes approximately 2,700 season ticket holders.|$|E

Clinton and Obama each received over 17million votes during the nomination process with both breaking the previous record. Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman. Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4. Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.|$|E

5|$|In just 50 {{years the}} Mont Blanc massif, and Chamonix and Courmayeur in particular, {{had become a}} popular {{destination}} for many travellers, and its economy changed from 80% agriculture to 80% tourism.

In 1906, the eleventh edition of a guidebook written by Edward Whymper about Chamonix and the Mont Blanc range estimated that 130,000 visitors had gone there during the previous season. It also reported that the railway service to Chamonix, which had previously been suspended in winter, was now running throughout the year. The tourist boom to the mountains had started. In 1924, a Winter Sports Week was held in Chamonix, with patronage from the International Olympic Committee. It attracted over 10,000 paying visitors and was retrospectively named as the first Winter Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|On the field, the Hokies {{were led}} by quarterback Grant Noel, who {{completed}} 146 of his 254 pass attempts for 1,826 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. Noel's favorite passing target was André Davis, who caught 39 passes for 623 yards and seven touchdowns. In recognition of his success, Davis was named a first-team all-Big East selection. Fullback Jarrett Ferguson also set three single-season receiving records by catching 25 passes for 256 yards and three touchdowns, {{all of which were}} school records for a fullback. Despite <b>those</b> <b>numbers,</b> most of Virginia Tech's offense was gained on the ground. At the beginning of the season, running back Lee Suggs was the leader of the Hokies' rushing offense. He set Virginia Tech records for career rushing touchdowns and career touchdowns before suffering a season-ending injury in the Hokies' game against Connecticut. Following Suggs' injury, his role was taken up by freshman running back Kevin Jones, who set a Tech freshman running record by accumulating 957 yards. That figure also was the fifth most in Division I-A, and he was named Big East rookie of the year and an All-American by The Sporting News.|$|E
