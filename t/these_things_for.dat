500|$|According to the literature, {{it appears}} that the {{majority}} of free Athenians owned at least one slave. Aristophanes, in Plutus, portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves. Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of Lysias For the Invalid, a cripple pleading for a pension explains [...] "my income is very small and now I'm required to do these things myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> me." [...] However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in ancient Greece. When Athenaeus cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. Plato, owner of five slaves {{at the time of his}} death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.|$|E

[...] With her finances in an unsteady state – {{she would say}} in 1999 that [...] "Apart from John, the men I have {{fallen in love with}} have never been good at earning a living" [...] – more of her memorabilia of Lennon went up for auction in 1991, including antiques from Kenwood. [...] She said at the time, [...] "I've enjoyed <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> 30 years. But it's time for a change." [...] Another set of items, including some of Lennon's drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995. She later said, [...] "I think in life we collect so much baggage, when you have a clearout, you send it to a car-boot sale, etc. My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie's. When you have to pay the bills, you're not proud and you can't take it with you." ...|$|E

[...] Müller said that the Vatican is certain that the LCWR is [...] "fostering a vision of {{religious}} life that is centered on the Person of Jesus Christ and is rooted in the Tradition of the Church." [...] Phil Lawler of catholicculture.org said that while Catholics should be able to take <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> granted, a Vatican intervention had been necessary in this case. He said that their statements do not guarantee that the Vatican intervention will prove successful, but that they do demonstrate that the process was necessary. When the conclusion was announced in April 2015, Christopher Bellitto, a church historian at Kean University, noted, [...] "Anything coming out of the Vatican this morning is nothing other than a fig leaf because they can't say 'oops' in Latin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Premillennialism {{experienced}} a revival among 17th century Puritans like Thomas Brightman, Joseph Mede, and others. Although {{they were not}} premillennial, the English theologian Daniel Whitby (1688–1726), the German Johann Albrecht Bengel (1687–1752), and the American Jonathan Edwards (1703–58) [...] "fueled millennial ideas with new influence in the nineteenth century." [...] It was authors such as these who concluded that {{the decline of the}} Roman Catholic Church would make way for the conversion and restoration of the nation of Israel. Edwards taught that a type of Millennium would occur [...] "1260 years after A.D. 606 when Rome was recognized as having universal authority." [...] His Puritan contemporaries, Increase Mather and Cotton Mather, openly proclaimed a belief in a literal millennium. Increase Mather wrote [...] "That which presseth me so, as that I cannot gainsay the Chiliastical opinion, is that I take <b>these</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> Principles, and no way doubt but that they are demonstrable. 1. That the thousand apocalyptical years are not passed but future. 2. That the coming of Christ to raise the dead and to judge the earth will be within much less than this thousand years. 3. That the conversion of the Jews will not be till this present state of the world is near unto its end. 4. That, after the Jews’ conversion there will be a glorious day for the elect upon earth, and that this day shall be a very long continuance." ...|$|E
