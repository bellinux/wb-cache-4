5|$|Negative {{effects of}} the coast trade on the native peoples of the Northwest {{included}} waves of epidemic disease, smallpox worst of all. Other health problems included the spread of alcoholism, tuberculosis, venereal diseases including syphilis, and sterility. The coast trade also promoted and enhanced the pre-existing system of native slavery and native slave trading. <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> slaves increased, as did their distribution and exploitation. Despite these negative effects, the North West Coast natives were largely spared the additional effects that would have come had there been more permanent posts, political administration, missionizing, and colonization. The early traders were mostly seasonal visitors and the later HBC posts were few and small. Missionization and direct colonial rule over the coastal natives did not begin in earnest until the late 19th century. During the early 19th century, native culture not only survived but flourished.|$|E

The Allied air attacks were successful in raising the morale of Singapore's civilian population, who believed that the raids marked the impending liberation of the city. <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> civilian casualties from the bombings was low, though civilian workers were killed during attacks on military facilities; one attack rendered hundreds of people homeless.|$|E

5|$|Casey {{returned}} to Washington, D.C. in October 1940 to become {{chief of the}} Design and Engineering Section in the Construction Division of the Office of the Quartermaster General, under Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. An enormous construction program was underway {{to meet the needs}} of World War II. Working with a staff that included George Bergstrom, a former president of the American Institute of Architects, Casey set about revising the standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new triangular division, 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the cantonment areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines. Casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 April 1941.|$|E
5|$|Gregoras {{reports that}} 6,400 cavalrymen and 8,000 infantrymen {{fell in the}} battle, the same number he gives for Walter's forces. According to Muntaner, 20,000 infantrymen were killed, and {{only two of the}} seven hundred knights survived the battle, Roger Deslaur and Boniface of Verona. Like the numbers for <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> troops {{involved}} in the battle, these numbers are unverifiable and probably exaggerated, but they are nevertheless indicative of the scale of the Athenian defeat. In addition, other senior members of the Frankish nobility are known to have survived: Nicholas Sanudo, later Duke of the Archipelago, managed to escape the battlefield, and a few others such as Antoine le Flamenc, who is known to have participated in and survived the battle, were probably captured and later ransomed. Walter's head was severed by the Catalans, and many years later was taken to Lecce in Italy, where his son buried him in the Church of Santa Croce.|$|E
5|$|The Glina massacres were {{killings of}} Serb peasants {{in the town}} of Glina in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) that {{occurred}} between May and August 1941, during World War II. The first wave of massacres in the town began on 11 or 12 May 1941, when a band of Ustaše led by Mirko Puk murdered a group of Serb men and boys in a Serbian Orthodox church before setting it on fire. The following day, approximately 100 Serb males were murdered by the Ustaše in the nearby village of Prekopi. Estimates of <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Serbs killed from 11–13 May range from 260 to 417. Further killings in Glina occurred between 30 July and 3 August of that same year, when 700–2,000 Serbs were massacred by a group of Ustaše led by Vjekoslav Luburić. Ljubo Jednak, the only survivor of these killings, went on to testify at the trials of the several prominent figures in the NDH after the war. Puk was captured by British forces in 1945 while attempting to flee to Austria and was extradited to Yugoslavia the following year, where he committed suicide. Luburić escaped Yugoslavia after the war and moved to fascist Spain, where he was killed by a person generally assumed to be an agent of the Yugoslav State Security Service.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{army that}} crossed the Lithuanian border in early October 1632 had been {{carefully}} prepared and {{was under the}} experienced command of Mikhail Shein, who had previously defended Smolensk against the Poles during the 1609–1611 siege. Estimates {{of the size of}} the Russian forces vary, from 20,000 through 25,000 and 30,000 to 34,500, with 160 artillery pieces. However, the numbers over 25,000 give <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Shein's army when leaving Moscow. A part of this army was left behind as garrisons in newly conquered cities as Dorogobuzh, Belaya and others. Based on the archive documents, the Russian historian Menshikov gives the initial number of Shein's army at Smolensk as 24,000 men but indicates that the number reduced to 20,000 by August when many Russian soldiers left the army to protect their estates endangered by the Crimean khan's summer raid on South Russia.|$|E

Brioux commented again about Degrassi: The Next Generation still being on the schedules, wondering when CTV was going to announce its cancellation and noting that The Amazing Race, which follows it in the scheduling, was watched by ten times the number of Degrassis viewers. That pattern was repeated the following week, when Degrassi: The Next Generation was watched by 222,000 viewers, compared to 1,834,000 viewers for The Amazing Race, 1,579,000 viewers for Desperate Housewives and 1,106,000 viewers for The Mentalist, which were broadcast by CTV later in the evening.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, damaged {{buildings}} polluted {{rivers in}} South Korea with chemicals and heavy metals. The country utilized 30,000soldiers {{to assist in}} cleaning up and repairing storm damage. President Kim Dae-jung authorized emergency funding for disaster aid. Much of Gangneung lost power and water; as a result, relief supplies {{were sent to the}} affected citizens. By ten days after Rusa struck the country, power lines were restored and transportation returned to normal. After an appeal to other residents in the country, the South Korea Red Cross chapter received $49million in donations (₩58billion won), mostly from the country's northwest portion. The agency provided 50,680meals to 16,919families, as well as clothing and cooking supplies. Residents in the country raised about $60million (₩72.1billion won) in disaster relief, the highest such total for a disaster in the nation. The Chinese Red Cross sent $20,000 to the South Korean Red Cross in the weeks after the storm. On September13, the South Korean government declared 203cities and counties as disaster zones, which entitled 8,714families who sustained storm damage to receive government loans. The combined storm damage and floods preceding the storm caused the nation's economy to contract during the third quarter of 2002. The 2003 fiscal year reported a $300million deficit for non-life insurance companies, mostly due to losses from the typhoon. Crop damage from Rusa caused the price of rice to increase to their highest levels since 1980. In the year after the storm, the South Korean government worked to reconstruct damaged roads and provided monthly assistance payments to families who lost their homes. However, many residents remained homeless and were residing in temporary shelters. The country's Habitat for Humanity built 69houses for storm victims in 2003, although that was only for a small portion of <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> people affected. About a year after Rusa hit, Typhoon Maemi also struck South Korea with stronger winds, causing $3.74billion in damage and 117deaths.
