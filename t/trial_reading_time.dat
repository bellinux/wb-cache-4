40|$|Powerize Server 1. 0, {{developed}} by Powerize. com, is a content-based information filtering and retrieval system that presently uses a manually constructed user model {{known as a}} search profile. User modeling captures a user's information needs. A user model can be constructed explicitly by the user or implicitly by exploiting feedback from the user about which documents are relevant. Implicit feedback can be inferred from user behavior without any additional work {{on the part of}} the user. The study reported in this paper investigates a way of implementing the implicit feedback technique of user modeling for the Powerize Server 1. 0. Previous studies on Internet discussion groups (USENET news) have shown <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> to be a useful source of implicit feedback for predicting a user's preferences. In this study, we examined: 1) whether <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> is useful for predicting a user's preferences for academic or professional journal articles, and 2) whether printing behavior adds anything to what we already know from <b>reading</b> <b>time.</b> Two experiments were conducted with undergraduate students using professional articles from the telecommunications and pharmaceutical industries. The results of the experiments showed that <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> could be used to predict the relevancy of documents, although the threshold on <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> required to detect relevant documents would be higher than for USENET news articles. The experiments also showed that printing behavior adds to what can be inferred from <b>reading</b> <b>time.</b> All the documents that were printed in the experiments were relevant, but the <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> for many of these documents was below the mean <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> for all documents read.

40|$|The results {{presented}} in the article are based on first-pass <b>reading</b> <b>times,</b> defined as the sum of fixation durations on a word until the first fixation on any other word. The first-pass <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> on word wt is zero if a later word from the same sentence was fixated before the first fixation on wt. To investigate if our conclusions hold for other reading-time measures, we repeated the analysis using two alternatives: right-bounded and go-past <b>reading</b> <b>time.</b> Right-bounded time is identical to first-pass time except that it includes the durations of fixations on wt that occur after a regression. That is, it equals the total duration of fixations on wt until the first fixation on any later word of the sentence. The go-past <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> {{is defined as the}} total duration of fixations on all words from w 1 (the first word of the sentence) up to wt, starting from the first fixation on wt until the first fixation on any later word of the sentence. 1 As was the case for first-pass, the right-bounded and go-past <b>reading</b> <b>times</b> on wt are zero if a later word from the same sentence was fixated before the first fixation on wt.

Using a tachistoscope, monolingual and Welsh bilingual participants were presented with various configurations of bilingual signing. The amount of information was varied (i. e. the number of lines) and {{a number of}} language-differentiation techniques were implemented. These techniques attempted to aid the perception and recognition of the relevant language and relied either on manipulating the position of the two languages, or by using demarcation (colour, font etc.). With regards to the amount of information presented, it was found that the <b>reading</b> response <b>time</b> for a single line of relevant text within a two-line bilingual sign was not significantly different to the <b>reading</b> response <b>time</b> for a one-line monolingual sign. Thus, participants were able to extract the relevant language from the bilingual sign with no decrement in performance. However, <b>reading</b> response <b>time</b> for a message of two lines of relevant text in a four-line bilingual was significantly longer than the <b>reading</b> response <b>time</b> for a two-line monolingual sign.

Vocal reaction times (RTs), pronunciation <b>times,</b> and total <b>reading</b> <b>times</b> were measured while 25 children with dyslexia and 43 age-matched typically developing readers read singly presented words and non-words that varied for length. Group differences were large for vocal RTs; children with dyslexia were increasingly slower as a function of condition difficulty (over-additivity effect); lexicality and length influenced RTs even when over-additivity was controlled for by z-score transformation. The group differences were also large for vocal total <b>reading</b> <b>times,</b> but the effect of over-additivity was smaller than that of vocal RTs and no selective influence of lexicality and length was detected. Pronunciation times showed very small individual differences and no over-additivity effect; children with dyslexia were more sensitive to the effect of lexicality and length than controls. To assess the contribution of the cognitive and sensory–motor compartments in determining group differences, we applied the difference engine model. As for RTs, the relationship between means and standard deviations closely supported the prediction of a general cognitive delay in the slow group, with no group difference in the sensory–motor compartment.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} the magnitude of lid-induced corneal topography changes as a function of <b>time</b> spent <b>reading</b> and the subsequent time course of regression of these changes. Methods. Six young subjects, five myopes and one emmetrope with normal ocular health, participated in the study. Corneal topography of one eye was measured with videokeratoscopy before four reading sessions of 10, 30, 60, and 120 min duration performed on four separate mornings. Corneal topography was again measured at fixed intervals up to 180 min after each reading session. A control <b>trial</b> without <b>reading</b> was also performed on a separate morning. Results. All six subjects showed significant changes in corneal topography directly after each of the reading sessions. Longer reading periods caused larger corneal changes. Local instantaneous power changes reached up to 5. 95 D (+/- 2. 80 D), whereas refractive power changes in the superior cornea ranged up to 1. 26 D (+/- 0. 44) for the 120 -min <b>reading</b> <b>trial.</b> The duration of regression of corneal changes showed slower recovery <b>times</b> after longer <b>reading</b> periods.

40|$|Abstract. Most {{linguistic}} theories since Chomsky (1973) have {{hypothesized that}} longdistance dependencies crossing multiple clauses are mediated by intermediate structures. This paper provides {{a new source}} of evidence for the existence of such intermediate structures: <b>reading</b> <b>times</b> during online sentence comprehension. The experiment presented here compares <b>reading</b> <b>times</b> for two structures involving the long-distance extraction of a wh-filler: (a) a structure in which a clause intervenes between the endpoints of the extraction, and (b) a structure in which a nominalization of the clause intervenes. The logic of the experiment relies on two hypotheses: first, that intermediate structures mediate the relationship between a wh-filler and its h-roleassigning verb when a clause intervenes between them but not when a nominalization intervenes; and second, that <b>reading</b> <b>times</b> for a word increase as linear distance increases between the word and the position on which it is dependent in the partial structure for the input (Gibson 1998, 2000; Grodner, Watson & Gibson 2000). In combination, these hypotheses predict that <b>reading</b> <b>times</b> at the region in which the verb assigns a h-role to the wh-filler will be faster in the clausal conditions than in the nominalized conditions, because in the clausal conditions intermediate structure mediate the wh-filler verb dependency and cause it to be more local. This prediction was confirmed. 1...|$|R

We consider three types of anaphoric expressions in Subject sentential position: a null pronoun (pro), and two gaps produced by syntactic movement: a WHvariable and a NP copy. Given that coreferential pro exhibits more referential weight than wh- and NP-gaps, and grounded on theories of referential processing based on relations of hierarchy and accessibility of the antecedent, we raise the hypothesis that the more dependent on its antecedent the anaphoric null constituent is, and the more minimal is the distance in terms of hierarchical structure between the anaphoric null element and its antecedent, the lower are the cognitive costs in processing. To test our hypothesis, we registered the eye movements with R 6 -HS ASL system of 20 Portuguese adult native speakers. Text regions including the selected anaphoric expressions were delimited and tagged. We analyzed the <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> of each region taking into account the number and duration of eye fixations per region; we used the <b>reading</b> <b>time</b> by character in milliseconds in order to compare values between regions of different length.
