5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1983, Virginia Tech was placed on {{probation}} by the NCAA for violations stemming from illegal benefits given to players and potential recruits. The probation's main effect was to ban the players who received <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> participating in any postseason game following the 1984 season. Seven of the eight players involved in the scandal either left Virginia Tech or had the probation lifted {{as a result of}} appeals to the NCAA. The eighth, Bruce Smith, did not.|$|E
5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E

This phenomenon is then explained from the view of bias-variance reduction. Moreover, it is shown that even for Boosting, <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> does not always increase consistently along with the increase of the training set size since single learners sometimes may learn relatively more from additional training data that are randomly provided than ensembles do. Furthermore, it is observed that <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> ensemble of unpruned decision trees is usually bigger than that from ensemble of pruned decision trees.

25|$|The Kuznets curve {{implies that}} as a nation {{undergoes}} industrialization – and especially the mechanization of agriculture – {{the center of the}} nation’s economy will shift to the cities. As internal migration by farmers looking for better-paying jobs in urban hubs causes a significant rural-urban inequality gap (the owners of firms would be profiting, while laborers from those industries would see their incomes rise at a much slower rate and agricultural workers would possibly see their incomes decrease), rural populations decrease as urban populations increase. Inequality is then expected to decrease when a certain level of average income is reached and the processes of industrialization – democratization {{and the rise of the}} welfare state – allow for the trickle-down of <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> rapid growth, and increase the per-capita income. Kuznets believed that inequality would follow an inverted “U” shape as it rises and then falls again with the increase of income per-capita.|$|E

25|$|The {{liberalisation}} {{of economy}} {{was intended to}} end the government subsidiaries and to reduce {{the role of the}} government in national economy. Successful attempts were carried out by Sharif to expand the role of the private sector, and to redress the imbalances in social services. From 1990 to 1993, the private and foreign investments were greatly relaxed. This was followed by the liberalisation of the foreign exchange which was readily free, and at the same time, the interest rates were substantially liberalised, credit subsidies were cut, and energy prices were moved much closer to costs. The economic liberalisation and structural reform measures were necessary and had been overdue at that time. However, instead of being pursued with even greater vigor and effectiveness, the liberalisation programme could not substitute for adequate stabilization efforts and macroeconomic stability. By the end of 1993 which was the year of ousting the government of Nawaz Sharif, <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> economic liberalisation were seriously limited in the absence of reduction of effective macroeconomic policies. As it grappled with the ongoing foreign exchange crisis in early 1993–97, Pakistan’s most urgent economic need was to raise both national savings and exports.|$|E

500|$|Constantine's [...] {{first season}} was difficult; {{both he and}} the {{residents}} of the town were at that stage uncertain of each other. Few black people had been seen in Nelson, and although some residents wrote welcoming letters, the Constantines also received racist and abusive ones. He quickly established boundaries over what he considered acceptable, permitting and even sharing small jokes over skin colour but protesting strongly at outright racism. John Arlott wrote: [...] " [...] fought discrimination against his people with a dignity firm but free of acrimony." [...] Although Constantine later attributed some of the initial uneasiness to ignorance, at the time he seriously considered returning to Trinidad after the first season. His wife persuaded him otherwise, pointing out <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> remaining to complete his contract. From 1930 Constantine found life more comfortable; the family began to develop friendships and to engage in the social life of the town.

Moreover, we present a reset strategy for situations where <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> incremental SAT approach seems to decrease.

40|$|A {{rainwater}} {{harvesting system}} (RWHS) is an alternative water resource that collects and stores rainwater from rooftops. It helps smooth out variations in water supply and sustainable water resources management. In this study, we investigated <b>the</b> potential <b>benefits</b> <b>from</b> sharing RWHS with nearby neighbors in a community. We introduced different mean, variance, and correlation in water demand for each water user. A simple case of a community composed of four prospective users is introduced to investigate <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> sharing RWHSs. Using the historical rainfall records from four catchments in South Korea, a storage-reliability-yield analysis is applied to obtain the required storage and corresponding reliability for a given yield ratio. The {{results indicate that the}} required total storage is reduced when RWHSs are shared among users and the rate of reduction is proportional to the degree of sharing. The required total storage was reduced down to 61 % compared to the original storage when RWHSs are shared for a target reliability of 80 %. <b>The</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> sharing also depends on the demands, which are different among users. Test cases with different means and variances as well as correlation disclose the conditions when <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> sharing RWHSs is maximized. The result showed that difference in mean and variance additionally reduces the required storage up to 3 % and correlation in demand also as much affects the required storage...|$|R
