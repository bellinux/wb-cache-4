5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who brings it on board the Enterprise, where it and its quickly-produced offspring are treated as adorable pets. The animals purr a relaxing trill that the crew find soothing. Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E
25|$|A new {{technology}} has been developed and is slowly becoming more popular with police. Called the Rumbler, it is a siren that emits a low frequency sound which can be felt. Motorists that may have loud music playing in their car, for example, may not hear the audible siren of a police car behind them, but will feel the vibrations of the Rumbler. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> that of {{standing next to a}} large speaker with pumped bass.|$|E

They clash constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with Dr. Dillamond. Dr. Dillamond is the only Animal {{professor}} at the university and is beginning to suffer from discrimination, even from the students, which is shown when someone writes [...] "Animals should be seen and not heard" [...] on the chalkboard. He tells Elphaba that there is a conspiracy to stop the Animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it ("Something Bad").|$|E
500|$|When you win a race {{like this}} <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> very, very good.

500|$|Darlington's {{supporters}} consider Hartlepool United {{as their}} main rivals. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> reciprocated: in a 2008 survey, 95% of supporters of both clubs named {{the other as}} their bitterest rivals.

The meeting between the two clubs in 2007 attracted a crowd of 10,121 to the Darlington Arena, the largest attendance for that League fixture for 50 years, though the average League attendance at the stadium declined from over 5,000 in its opening season to 2,744 in 2009–10.|$|E

500|$|Introduced in {{the series}} pilot, Chloe spends much of season one helping her best friend Clark Kent (Tom Welling) stop the {{citizens}} of Smallville who have developed special abilities from genetic mutations, caused by the meteor rocks that fell to Smallville in 1989, from committing crimes. It is established that Chloe {{is the editor of}} the school newspaper the Torch at the start of the first season. Her journalistic curiosity—always wanting to [...] "expose falsehoods" [...] and [...] "know the truth"—causes tension with her friends, especially when she is digging into Clark's past in the season two episode [...] "Lineage". In the early seasons, Chloe hides the fact that she is in love with Clark, although <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> not reciprocated; she confesses her true feelings to Clark in season two's [...] "Fever" [...] while he is sick, but he calls out Lana Lang's name in his delirium. Her feelings for Clark get in the way of her better judgment as she betrays his trust in the season two finale, after witnessing him and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) sharing a kiss in his barn, and agrees to uncover information on Clark for Lionel Luthor (John Glover) in exchange for a job at the Daily Planet.|$|E

500|$|The {{on-screen}} {{relationship between}} Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written {{out of the}} soap due to Bardon's health problems. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and {{was placed in the}} care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the Daily Mirror: [...] "Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> that {{this is the end of}} Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again." [...] It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, [...] "I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was really important to tell this story because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too—not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Presque vu ( [...] , from French, meaning [...] "almost seen") is {{the intense}} {{feeling of being}} on the very brink of a {{powerful}} epiphany, insight, or revelation, without actually achieving the revelation. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> often therefore associated with a frustrating, tantalizing sense of incompleteness or near-completeness.|$|E
