The analysed data and simulations show that the proposed solenoid valve is capable to handle both the flows and the pressure of the hydraulic system.

This data is analyzed to determine a relationship between the generation source span as a function of out of plane velocity components in the resultant wave field. As the span of the cylinder is systematically decreased, we observe the evolution of the wave field towards three-dimensionality. To better understand the nature of these boundary effects, a horizontal cylinder is imaged at four location along its length.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for solving the time-dependent extended-magnetohydrodynamic (X-MHD) equations in two dimensions that has significant advantages over other methods. The stream-function/potential {{representation of the}} velocity and magnetic field vectors, while fully general, allows accurate description of nearly incompressible fluid motions and manifestly satisfies the divergence condition on the magnetic field. Through analytic manipulation, the split semi-implicit method breaks the full matrix time advance into four sequential time advances, each involving smaller matrices. The use of a high order triangular element with continuous first derivatives (C 1 continuity) allows the Galerkin method to be applied without introduction of new auxiliary variables (such as the vorticity or the current density). These features, along with the manifestly compact nature of the fully node-based C 1 finite elements, lead to minimum size matrices for an unconditionally stable method with order of accuracy h 4. The resulting matrices are compatible with direct factorization using SuperLU_dist.

Notably, the minor {{axis of the}} ellipse is seen as larger than is true. This illusory effect {{could be due to}} the simultaneous presence of optical information for the 2 -D ellipse and optical information for the 3 -D tilted circle. The optical information for the circle may bias vision's use of the optical information for the ellipse.

Starting from an ordered state with cylinders parallel to the surface, the applied {{electric field}} enhanced fluctuations at the interfaces of the microdomains. The growth of the fluctuations continued until the cylindrical microdomains broke up into spherical microdomains, similar to that seen in the thermoreversible cylinder-to-sphere order-order transition.

The first part is focused on the case of a cylinder with a small tilt angle between the cylinder's axis and the vertical. The classical mode A well-known for a homogeneous fluid is still present. It is more unstable for moderate stratifications but it is stabilized by a strong stratification. The second part treats the case of a moderate tilt angle. For moderate stratifications, a new unstable mode appears, mode S, characterized by undulated layers of strong density gradients and axial flow. These structures correspond to Kelvin–Helmholtz billows created by the strong shear present in the critical layer of each tilted von Kármán vortex. The last two parts deal with the case of a strongly <b>tilted</b> <b>cylinder.</b> For a weak stratification, an instability (mode RT) appears far from the cylinder, due to the overturning of the isopycnals by the von Kármán vortices.

40|$|The {{microwave}} {{surface resistance}} of potassium in a perpendicular magnetic field, measured by C. C. Grimes in 1969, {{has never been}} completely explained. The sharp cyclotron resonance peak (at a magnetic field Hc) {{is caused by a}} small cylindrical section of Fermi surface created by the charge-density wave (CDW) minigaps, having periodicities K⃗n = (n + 1) Q⃗ - nG⃗ 110. The shape of the observed resonance requires a tilt of the CDW vector Q⃗ away from (110), predicted by Giuliani and Overhauser in 1979. An abrupt drop of the surface resistance for H 3 ̆e Hc is caused by the heterodyne gaps, which have periodicities K⃗n = n(G⃗ 110 - Q⃗). These very small gaps, which begin to undergo magnetic breakdown for fields H 3 ̆e 1 T, interrupt the cyclotron motion of equatorial orbits. The abrupt drop in surface resistance for H 3 ̆e Hc is caused by a partial loss of carrier effectiveness for electrons having velocities nearly parallel to the surface. ^ Microwave transmission through potassium by Dunifer et al. shows five signals. They are Gantmakher-Kaner (GK) oscillations, conduction-electron spin resonance, high-frequency oscillations, cyclotron resonance, and cyclotron-resonance subharmonics. Only the spin resonance has been successfully explained using a free electron model. However, such a model predicts GK oscillations which are too large by several orders of magnitude. Lacueva and Overhauser have shown that CDW energy gaps which cut through the Fermi surface reduce the GK signal. The high-frequency oscillations were shown to result from Landau-level quantization in a Fermi-surface cylinder created by the CDW. In this study we show that oscillatory motion, parallel to the field, of electrons in a <b>tilted</b> <b>cylinder</b> cause the cyclotron-resonance transmission. This signal and its subharmonics would be completely absent without the tilt. Consequently, four of the five transmission signals require a CDW broken symmetry. ...|$|R

For ideal cylinders that can roll without slip or slide without friction on their circular bottoms, the typical rocking motions do not involve collisions. Instead, they involve slow inverted pendulum-like motions interrupted by infinitely fast rolling or sliding motions during which the contact point with the table shifts by a finite angle in infinitesimal time. We derive simple asymptotic formulas for this "angle of turn" of the contact point for two simple cases: sliding without friction and rolling without slip.

Obtaining {{experimental}} {{data on the}} nature of the percolation transition processes in hydraulic drive on the basis of discrete-regulated axial-piston hydraulic machines; the comparison of {{experimental data}} with the results of numerical calculation. Methodology. The study of transient processes was carried out by means of a using a hydraulic drive on the basis of axial piston hydromachines of 403 series, with volume of 112 cubic centimetres on an experimental stand with a capacity recuperation. Pressure in pressure line and hydraulic motor control line, speed of pump rotation and flow rate through overload relief valve continuously registered. The experimental data were compared with results of numerical calculation. Scope of the results. The obtained results can be used when designing more efficient and reliable hydraulic drives of road-building machines. Conclusions. Comparison of experimental data and results of numerical calculation shows that the proposed by authors a mathematical model of hydraulic drive on the base of discrete-controlled axial piston hydromachines with <b>cylinder?s</b> <b>tilting</b> block, adequately reflects basic physical processes that determine the operation of hydraulic drive. For further improvement of the model it?s necessary to specify the model of hydraulic machine?s control block and consider wave effects in the pipelines of pressure line and hydraulic cylinders of pumping unit. ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ?????????????, ?? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????-????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????????, ??????????? ??? ????????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????? ????????????. ???????????? ?????????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ????? ? ????? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ????????????. ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ? ????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ? ?????? ????????? ????. ????????? ????????? ????????????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????-????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????????...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the design of}} an automobile tilting device for tilting of automobile bodies at mechanical workshops, when the need for maintenance arises; especially welding to be performed beneath them is always achieved using an existing traditional tilting technique. The traditional technique involves manual lifting and positioning of the automobile body with one of its sides on the work floor, after which supporting implements such as wooden bars, metal rods, worn-out tyres and pestles are used to keep the tilted bodies at the desired position. This technique has always been resulting to higher worker fatigue and much risk of worker injury, endangering the lives of mechanics. The designing and selection of the automobile tilting device components {{were based on the}} application of machine design and hydraulic principles and laws. The height and the degree of tilt of the device are controlled by the position of the control lever of the direction control valve regulating the fluid flow into the <b>tilting</b> and lifting <b>cylinders.</b> This hydraulic automobile tilting device is designed to provide a more effective and efficient technique for tilting and supporting tilted automobile bodies, thereby minimizing and eliminating the risks involved when employing the existing traditional technique.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{stimulus}} frequency on tilt and translation motion perception was studied during constant velocity off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR), and {{compared to the}} effect of stimulus frequency on eye movements. Fourteen healthy subjects were rotated in darkness about their longitudinal axis 10 degrees and 20 degrees off-vertical at 45 degrees /s (0. 125 Hz) and 20 degrees off-vertical at 180 degrees /s (0. 5 Hz). Perceived motion was evaluated using verbal reports and a joystick capable of recording tilt and translation in both sagittal and lateral planes. Eye movements were also recorded using videography. At the lower frequency, subjects reported the perception of progressing along the edge of a cone, whereas at the higher frequency they had the sensation of progressing along the edge of an upright <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Tilt</b> perception and ocular torsion significantly increased as the tilt angle increased from 10 degrees to 20 degrees at the lower frequency, and then decreased at the higher frequency. The phase lag of ocular torsion increased as a function of frequency, while the phase lag of tilt perception did not change. Horizontal eye movements were small at the lower frequency and showed a phase lead relative to the linear acceleration stimulus. While the phase lead of horizontal eye movements decreased at 0. 5 Hz, the phase of translation perception did not vary with stimulus frequency and was similar to the phase of tilt perception during all conditions. A second data set was obtained in 12 subjects to compare motion perception phase when using a simple push-button to indicate nose-up orientation, continuous setting of pitch tilt alone, or continuous setting of tilt and translation in both pitch and roll planes as in the first data set. This set of measurements indicated that in the frequency range studied subjects tend to lead the stimulus when using a push-button task while lagging the stimulus when using a continuous setting of tilt with a joystick. Both amplitude and phase of tilt perception using the joystick were not different whether concentrating on pitch tilt alone or attempting a more complex reporting of tilt and translation in both sagittal and lateral planes. During dynamic linear stimuli in the absence of canal and visual input, a change in stimulus frequency alone elicits similar changes in the amplitude of both self-motion perception and eye movements. However, in contrast to the eye movements, the phase of both perceived tilt and translation motion is not altered by stimulus frequency over this limited range. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that neural processing to distinguish tilt and translation stimuli differs between eye movements and motion perception...|$|R
