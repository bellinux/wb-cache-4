500|$|Tyler's uneasy {{relationship}} with his party {{came to a head}} during the 22nd Congress, as the Nullification Crisis of 1832–33 began. South Carolina, threatening secession, passed the Ordinance of Nullification in November 1832, declaring the [...] "Tariff of Abominations" [...] null and void within its borders. This raised the constitutional question of whether states could nullify federal laws. President Jackson, who denied such a right, prepared to sign a Force Bill allowing the federal government to use military action to enforce the tariff. Tyler, who sympathized with South Carolina's reasons for nullification, rejected Jackson's use of military force against a state and gave a speech in February 1833 outlining his views. He supported Clay's Compromise <b>Tariff,</b> enacted that <b>year,</b> to gradually reduce the <b>tariff</b> over ten <b>years,</b> alleviating tensions between the states and the federal government.|$|R

That same year, the party began openly advocating various general moralistic policies, such as prohibitions on alcohol, gambling, and prostitution. Other than these religiously motivated restrictions on market activity, the party largely favored free trade, and opposed <b>tariffs.</b> One <b>year</b> later, the twenty-second plank of the 1849 platform praised Lysander Spooner's book The Unconstitutionality of Slavery.|$|R
