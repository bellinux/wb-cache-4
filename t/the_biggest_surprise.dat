5|$|Due to the {{acquisition}} of Coveleski, combined with winning the 1924 World Series, the Washington Senators were considered favorites to win the AL in 1925. During his first season in Washington, Coveleski bounced back from his 1924 season, and by mid-July, critics regarded his success as <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>surprise</b> in baseball; Cleveland considered him to be past his best. He won 20 games and lost five that year, and his ERA of 2.84 led the AL. Coveleski also finished 12th in MVP voting that year. The Senators won the AL and were to face the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1925 World Series, but Coveleski suffered from sore back muscles late in the season. Coveleski pitched two games in the World Series. In game two, he faced Vic Aldridge in a pitcher's duel; the teams were tied at one apiece in the eighth inning, but a Pittsburgh home run led to a 3–2 loss. Aldridge and Coveleski faced off again in game five, and Coveleski allowed four runs in under seven innings, leading to a 6–3 Pirates win. The Senators lost the series in seven games, and he finished with a 3.77 ERA, five walks, three strikeouts, {{and two of the}} Senators' four losses.|$|E

25|$|Aside from Kucinich, Voinovich's other opponents {{included}} State Senator Charles Butts {{and city}} council majority leader Basil Russo. As the election drew closer, The Plain Dealer announced its endorsement of Voinovich. Voter turnout {{in the primary}} was {{greater than that of}} the 1977 race among Perk, Kucinich and Edward F. Feighan. In the 1979 nonpartisan primary election, Voinovich led with 47,000 votes to 36,000 for Kucinich. Russo (who obtained 21,000) and Butts (with 19,000) did not qualify for the general election. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>surprise</b> was Voinovich's showing in predominantly African American wards, where he was expected to finish last. He trailed only Butts, with Kucinich last.|$|E

It was hastily created by NBC {{in response to}} the ratings success of The $64,000 Question, which had premiered on CBS in summer 1955 and almost instantly became a hit. <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Surprise</b> offered a grand prize of $100,000.|$|R

25|$|Following three {{matches in}} the {{qualification}} campaign for Euro 1992, Laudrup opted {{to quit the}} national team in November 1990 (alongside his brother Brian Laudrup and Jan Mølby) following differences with coach Richard Møller Nielsen. The Danes originally failed to qualify but were later given Yugoslavia's place as Yugoslavia were kicked out due to war in their country. Notwithstanding their qualification, Laudrup rated Denmark's chances of success so low he stayed on holiday, a decision he must have regretted as Denmark beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals with legendary keeper Peter Schmeichel surprisingly saving a Marco van Basten penalty in the shoot-out. In the final against world champions and favourites Germany, the Danes stunned {{the world with a}} 2–0 win thanks to goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort, making it arguably <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>surprise</b> in a UEFA European Championship final.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the local}} outrage, Wessels led the unknown South African {{side in the}} tournament. The played against Australia in their opening match and {{produced}} what was arguably <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>surprise</b> of the tournament, by beating the hosts by nine wickets. However, the spectacular victory was followed by consecutive defeats against New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Once again, criticism against Wessels started to mount back in South Africa, with many analysts believing that South Africa's problems were caused by the captain's conservative approach to one-day cricket. South Africa desperately needed to win their next match against the West Indies and, thanks to a vicious bowling assault on their batsmen, the South Africans claimed victory. They won their remaining matches against Pakistan and Zimbabwe, but lost against England. The last group match against India was now vital {{if they were to}} reach the semi-finals of the tournament. Rain-delays caused the match to be played 30 overs a side and, once again, South Africa managed to secure victory after India set an imposing target. Wessels and his team were to play against England in Sydney.|$|E

500|$|Upon the {{suggestion}} of Universal Studios, Roach cast De Niro {{in the role of}} Jack Byrnes due to critical acclaim of De Niro's recent comedy work in films such as Analyze This and in the live-action/animated film The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. De Niro's character Jack Byrnes is Pam's father and a retired CIA operative who is overly protective of his family and has a hard time warming up to his daughters' love interests. The script was not written with De Niro in mind as Jack Byrnes; the first draft of the script was completed in 1996, three years before De Niro appeared in Analyze This. However, shortly after De Niro finished filming The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Universal suggested to Roach that he should cast De Niro for the role to which Roach agrees that he had [...] "no reservations whatsoever." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, De Niro stated that he was in active pursuit of comedic roles since Analyze This. Admitting that he had initial reservations about starring in Meet the Parents, De Niro said that he felt [...] "pushed into it" [...] due to insistence by Jane Rosenthal—De Niro's partner in TriBeCa Productions who also acted as one of the producers of Meet the Parents. Screenwriter Jim Herzfeld and director Jay Roach both confirmed that, after committing to the project and reviewing the script, Robert De Niro was actually the person {{who came up with the}} idea for the famous polygraph test scene. Asked about working with De Niro given the serious nature of his previous roles, Ben Stiller said that [...] "it was a little bit intimidating working with De Niro" [...] but that he [...] "has a great sense of humor and I think that's <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>surprise</b> about him." ...|$|E
