5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> deliquescent.|$|E

It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
