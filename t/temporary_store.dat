25|$|In 1914 a fire {{destroyed}} the Neiman Marcus store {{and all of}} its merchandise. A <b>temporary</b> <b>store</b> was set up and opened in 17 days. By the end of 1914, Neiman Marcus opened in its new, permanent location at the corner of Main Street and Ervay Street.

25|$|Two years later, in October 1873, Field and Leiter {{returned}} to State Street at Washington, opening {{in a new}} five-story store at their old location they now leased from the Singer Sewing Machine Company, Palmer having sold the land site to finance his own rebuilding activities. This store was expanded in 1876, only to be destroyed by fire again in November 1877. Ever tenacious, Field and Leiter had a new <b>temporary</b> <b>store</b> opened {{by the end of}} the month at a lakefront exposition hall they leased temporarily from the city, located at what is now the site of the present Art Institute of Chicago. Meanwhile, the Singer company had speculatively built a new, even larger, six-story building on the ruins of their old 1873 store, which, after some contention, was personally bought by Field and Leiter. Field, Leiter & Company now reclaimed their traditional location at the northeast corner of State and Washington for the last time in April 1879.|$|E

50|$|In 2000, Baddeley {{extended}} the model {{by adding a}} fourth component, the episodic buffer, which holds representations that integrate phonological, visual, and spatial information, and possibly information {{not covered by the}} slave systems (e.g., semantic information, musical information). The component is episodic because it is assumed to bind information into a unitary episodic representation.

The complexity of the management this kind of waste is due to extended half-life of these radionuclides.
