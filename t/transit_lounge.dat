500|$|The song [...] "Pour le monde" [...] ("For the World" [...] in French) was {{inspired}} when Finn was in Paris and observed a demonstration march protesting {{against the war}} on terror, with the chant [...] "Pour le monde pas pour la guerre", which translates to [...] "For the world, not for the war" [...] (which is then sung in English directly after the French on the song).

5000|$|The {{founder of}} the Travelers Aid Society of New York (TAS-NY), Grace Hoadley Dodge, had hoped to unite other Travelers Aid Societies to form a {{national}} association, but she died before this could be accomplished (she died in 1914). Due primarily {{to the efforts of}} TAS-NY General Secretary Orin Clarkson Baker, national unification was finally accomplished in 1917. [...] This association provided a [...] "chain of service," [...] with one agency helping another when inter-city transportation of a client was required. Travelers Aid was one of the original [...] "United Service Organizations" [...] (USO) that provided assistance to traveling service men and women, operating 175 troop <b>transit</b> <b>lounges.</b> Today, Travelers Aid responds to the specific needs of the community. Although each member agency shares the original service of assisting stranded travelers, many Travelers Aid agencies provide shelter for the homeless, transitional housing, job training, counseling, local transportation assistance, and other programs.|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} {{student as}} an object of study has typically been understood through the frame of cultural identity, mapped back to notions of fixed, static notions of cultural difference. In contrast, this study seeks to understand how the practice of international study has emerged as an increasingly popular ‘biographical solution’ (Beck 1992, Bauman 2002) in order to pursue imagined career trajectories in a globalised and competitive world. Informed by recent studies of middle class strategy in Asia (Pinches, 1999) and the transnational Chinese diaspora (Ong 1999, Ang 2001) that challenge essentialist accounts of timeless Asian values and East-West binaries, the paper analyses interview data collected from ‘Asian’ international students attending preparatory programs at an Australian university. Specifically, the paper discusses the disciplinary formation of the ‘international student’ – the take-up of self-Orientalizing discourses (Ong, 1999), and engagement in practices of autoethnography (Pratt, 1998). In addition, the paper explores students’ critiques of, and resistances to Orientalist discourses, and pragmatic willingness to submit to local demands to further their longer term goals. Preparatory programs emerge not so much as life-changing locations but rather necessary <b>transit</b> <b>lounges,</b> for the acquisition of cultural distinctions along their life routes...|$|R
40|$|Students {{enrolled}} in Southern Cross University 2 ̆ 7 s (SCU) Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) are a unique group of senior business people. Their demand for greater flexibility of delivery and portability of study materials was {{the impetus for}} a redesign of this professional degree at SCU. With a rapidly growing student base around Australia and SEAsia, DBA study packages must be suitable for a very mobile and busy professional group. Most have convenient access to computers and network connection, unlike students in many other programs. On the other hand, DBA students do not {{have much time to}} devote to study. They are typically squeezing study in between many other priorities, snatching opportunities to read and write while in <b>transit</b> <b>lounges,</b> in-flight or otherwise en route between engagements. Informal feedback from students has recently indicated their preference for the compact, portable features of CDROM (Meredith, 1997). In this case however, initial considerations of design quickly moved from stand alone CDROM to the CD/online hybrid or 2 ̆ 7 WebCD 2 ̆ 7. Hybrids first made their appearance in 1994, with Microsoft 2 ̆ 7 s Complete Baseball CD being linked to an online supplement, followed in 1995 by a CompuServeCD which allowed subscribers to the periodical to link to various online, downloadable resources and consumer reference groups.
