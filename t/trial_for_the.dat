5|$|After failing his 11-plus exam in 1963, he {{was sent}} to the city's Crown Hills Secondary Modern (rather than the local grammar school), where he was given a <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Leicester Boys Under-Fourteen team. He left school at 15 after being talent-spotted by Coventry City, who signed him up in 1967 as their youth team's goalkeeper. He also played for Oxford United's reserve team and Northampton Town, on loan from Coventry.|$|E
5|$|In 1956–57, McCabe and O'Reilly {{were given}} a {{testimonial}} match by the New South Wales Cricket Association. The match was between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI and acted as a <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> non-Test tour of New Zealand. It raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between McCabe and O'Reilly and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.|$|E
5|$|Never one to shy from violent conflicts, Haywood was {{frequently}} {{the target of}} prosecutors. His <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder of Frank Steunenberg in 1907 (of which he was acquitted) drew national attention; in 1918, {{he was one of}} 101 IWW members convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 during the First Red Scare. In 1921, while out of prison during an appeal of his conviction, Haywood fled to Bolshevik Russia, where he spent the remaining years of his life.|$|E

5|$|Though {{charged with}} both the murders of Patricia Jones and James Kinne, Sharon Kinne was tried {{separately}} for the two crimes. Her <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder of Patricia Jones began in mid-June 1961, with jury selection beginning on or about June 13 and the trial commencing days later with an all-male jury.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murder of Danielle and instead entered a {{manslaughter}} plea {{on the grounds that they}} had agreed to a suicide pact. The prosecution did not accept the manslaughter plea and pursued a <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder of Danielle. However, Wood pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephanie and the attempted murder of Christopher. He also pleaded guilty to stealing £84,000 from clients.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} opposition, in 1849, Paraná was {{appointed}} by the national government as president of Pernambuco Province to investigate a Liberal rebellion {{that had taken place}} a year earlier, and seek a fair <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rebels. Blamed by his party colleagues for the years in opposition and having lost much of his influence within his own party, Paraná accepted the post, believing he could regain his place among his peers. With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to Uruguay in 1851 to forge an alliance with that country, and with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos, against the Argentine Confederation. The alliance triumphed, and the Emperor elevated Paraná to the ranks of the titled nobility.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Riel {{had been}} staying with priests of the Oblate order in Plattsburgh, New York, who {{introduced}} him to Father Fabien Martin dit Barnabé in the nearby village of Keeseville. It was here that he received news of Lépine's fate: following his <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder of Scott, which had begun on 13 October 1874, Lépine was found guilty and sentenced to death. This sparked outrage in the sympathetic Quebec press, and calls for amnesty for both Lépine and Riel were renewed. This presented a severe political difficulty for Mackenzie, who was hopelessly caught between the demands of Quebec and Ontario. However, a solution was forthcoming when, acting on his own initiative, the Governor General Lord Dufferin commuted Lépine's sentence in January 1875. This {{opened the door for}} Mackenzie to secure from parliament an amnesty for Riel, on the condition that he remain in exile for five years.|$|E
5|$|Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a {{time when}} the {{university}} was more crowded than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war. He took part in several sports, representing New College as goalkeeper in matches between the colleges, and being given a <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> University football team, although he was not chosen. He continued to play rackets and began to play real tennis, making such progress and showing such promise that he went on to represent the University successfully and won his Blue. In cricket, Jardine came under the coaching of Tom Hayward who influenced his footwork and defence. Wisden commented in 1928 that Jardine had come with an excellent reputation, but did not quite achieve the success which was expected. His batting ability, particularly defensively, remained unquestioned.|$|E
5|$|Kinne went to <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{murder of}} Patricia Jones in June 1961 and was acquitted. A January 1962 trial {{on charges of}} murdering her husband ended in {{conviction}} and a sentence of life in prison, but the verdict was overturned because of procedural irregularities. The case went to a second trial, which ended within days in a mistrial. A third trial on the charge of murdering her husband ended in a hung jury in July 1964. Kinne was released on bond following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.|$|E

5|$|Kinne's second <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, {{the public was}} initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of}} the trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E
5|$|McCabe ran for an {{administrative}} position with his local club Mosman after his retirement, but was defeated, so {{he never had}} an opportunity to serve with the NSWCA. After the end of his first-class career, McCabe became a keen recreational golfer, but stopped playing in the mid-1950s due to his foot problems and other health issues. In 195657, McCabe and O'Reilly were given a testimonial match by the New South Wales Cricket Association. The match was between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI and acted as a <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> non-Test tour of New Zealand. The match raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between McCabe and O'Reilly, and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.|$|E
5|$|Silcott was 26 {{years old}} when he was arrested, the oldest of the six charged with murder. He was born in Tottenham in 1959; his parents, both Seventh-day Adventists, had arrived in England from Montserrat two years earlier. He told Rose that he had {{experienced}} racism throughout his entire upbringing, particularly from the police. After leaving school at 15, he took a series of low-paying jobs and in 1976 began breaking into houses. The following year he was convicted of nine counts of burglary and sent to borstal for a few months, and in 1979 he was sentenced to six months for wounding. In September 1980 he stood <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder of 19-year-old Lennie McIntosh, a postal worker, who was stabbed and killed at a party in Muswell Hill in 1979. The first trial resulted in a hung jury; a second trial saw him acquitted.|$|E

He played football for his school {{as well as}} for Dudley Schools, Worcestershire and Birmingham and District teams, and also represented his school at morris dancing. He was selected to compete in the National Morris and Sword Dancing Festival, but was also offered a <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> English Schools Football Association's under-14 team, which fell on the same day, and opted to attend the latter.|$|E
5|$|The Grangegorman killings {{were the}} {{homicide}} on 6 March 1997 of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan, patients at St Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital in Grangegorman, Dublin, Ireland. After giving a false confession, Dean Lyons {{was charged with}} the murders and placed on remand. In his statement to the Garda Síochána (police), Lyons gave details that would only be known to the murderer or to the investigators. After Lyons was charged, Mark Nash confessed to the killings, but later retracted his confession. In April 2015, Nash's <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder of Shields and Callinan began after an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the trial from going forward.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the two Eon Productions Bond films {{released}} prior to {{the writing of the}} novel (Dr. No and From Russia with Love) were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used. One of these was the poison gun used in the scene of the attempted assassination of M. The idea was taken from the story of Bohdan Stashynsky, who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961. Stashynsky was put on <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison-spray gun to do it.|$|E

A small-time criminal, Crim, is found with blood on him and is put on <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder. However, an obese man named Ricky {{suspects}} the real murderer is still at large and, {{with the help of}} his friend Marnie, he investigates the crime. Meanwhile, the mayor's widow takes over mayoral duties, women on a local news team compete for attention, the coroner steals the mayor's body, Crim's lawyer does everything he can to keep his cat alive, and Death waits in a motel room to collect the souls of dead Shuckton citizens.|$|E
5|$|Two big set-piece matches, a {{testimonial}} {{match for}} Bradman and a joint benefit for Alan Kippax and Bert Oldfield, {{were used by}} the selectors as a <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1949–50 South African tour. Loxton played in both testimonial matches; he failed to pass 21 in the first match but took a total of 4/100. In the latter match he scored 93. The Victorian all-rounder ended the season with 634 runs at 42.26 and 16 wickets at 24.31 and was selected for the South African tour {{under the leadership of}} the newly appointed captain Lindsay Hassett.|$|E
5|$|While Croitoru was {{awaiting}} <b>trial</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bombing, the Hamilton {{branch of}} Satan's Choice {{was shut down}} after an informant gave the police information about the gang's involvement with drug dealing and extortion. The gang's clubhouse was confiscated and the club's national leadership decided to disband the Hamilton chapter. Croitoru got in a fight in Hamilton with another former Satan's Choice member on January 13, 1998. A police officer saw Croitoru punch the other man {{in the face and}} arrested Croitoru for assault. In addition to the assault charge, Croitoru was charged with extortion from an unrelated incident as well as carrying a concealed weapon and breaking the conditions of his release following the police station bombing. In September 1998, Croitoru was brought to trial {{for his role in the}} bombing. He was convicted and sentenced to 33 months in prison.|$|E
