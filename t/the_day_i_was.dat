She was once noted as saying: The Democratic party is one that I've always observed. I have struggled greatly in life from <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born and I am honored {{to be a part}} of something that focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in that regard for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E
500|$|Bundy {{underwent}} multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and {{an authority}} on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but later changed her impression more than once. She also suggested {{the possibility of a}} multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy [...] "seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person... suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger." [...] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: [...] "He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality... that was <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid of him.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E

500|$|Asche {{is married}} to Angela Albers, whom he presumably met in college at Nebraska. He {{is a fan of}} {{football}} and an ardent supporter of the Nebraska Cornhuskers; he routinely drives six hours to attend their home football games. He also [...] "appreciates the speed and violence of hockey"; conversely, he does not like basketball. During the offseason, he resides in O'Fallon, Missouri, which is barely over [...] from his birthplace of St. Charles, Missouri. According to his MLB.com biography, his hobbies include golfing, fishing, and completing crossword puzzles. In an interview, Asche said his favorite television show was Parks and Recreation, and his favorite food was chicken parmesan. He is close to his family, and noted that he started playing baseball around age five or six, with his first experience being playing in the back yard with his father and brother. When he was first called up to the major leagues, he noted, [...] "Emotions were crazy. Trying to hold back tears seeing your parents in the stands for the first time was tough, then playing on top of that made it a little crazy to start. But that is all part of it. I think the phone call I got to make to my parents <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> called up was the most memorable part ..." ...|$|E
500|$|He commented later: [...] "I took an {{appointment}} to the bench, as did a number of liberal judges, {{and we had to}} uphold the law of the country. It was a moral dilemma to do that, but the approach was that it was better to fight from inside than not at all. The moral dilemma came up when I had to apply the law." [...] He noted in 1992 that most South African judges [...] "applied such [...] laws without commenting upon their moral turpitude." [...] A number, including Goldstone, were more outspoken – a policy that he felt aided the credibility of the courts. There was a fine dividing line between applying moral standards and promoting political doctrines, but Goldstone believed that [...] "in my view, if a judge is to err, it should be on the side of defending morality." [...] He took the view that [...] "judges have a duty to act morally, and if they're dealing with laws which have an unjust effect, I think it's their duty – if they can, within the powers they've got legitimately – to interpret the laws and give judgments which will make them less harsh and less unjust." [...] Being a judge in apartheid-era South Africa was a challenge, but it had its rewards; [...] "I hated in the morning the thought of having to do this for another day, [...] by the end of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> exhilarated at the reaction and how important the work was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the last}} 23 years, from <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{stripped}} of my judgeship to {{the years of}} doing battle in the revolutionary courts of Tehran, I had repeated one refrain: an interpretation of Islam that is in harmony with equality and democracy is an authentic expression of faith. It is not religion that binds women, but the selective dictates of those who wish them cloistered. That belief, along with the conviction that change in Iran must come peacefully and from within, has underpinned my work." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Edvard remembered it, Christian's {{positive}} {{behavior toward}} his children was overshadowed by his morbid pietism. Munch wrote, [...] "My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to {{the point of}} psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born." [...] Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The oppressive religious milieu, Edvard's poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him. One of Munch's younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died {{a few months after}} the wedding. Munch would later write, [...] "I inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's title, Two Eleven, is a {{reference}} to both Norwood's birthday and the day her idol and mentor, entertainer Whitney Houston, died in 2012. Norwood declared selecting a title a [...] "tough decision". About the title, she stated: [...] "Some of the titles I was working with were Rebirth, Reincarnation, Reinvention, Resurrection [...] I just felt like Two Eleven describes all of that. It’s <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born, and each year, I evolve and change with time. It also has {{a whole new meaning}} to it because I gained my angel. My icon is my angel now. It’s all tied in there and I just think it best represents who I am and the responsibilities I have moving on." [...] Dismissing ongoing reproaches, that she was [...] "trying to use the passing of Whitney Houston to sell records," [...] Norwood remarked that the title was nothing but a homage, “I need for everybody to know that, if it wasn’t for Whitney Houston, there would be no me, because she was the possibility for me. She was the vision of my dreams actually coming true, and she meant everything to me.” The official album, photograpphed by Gomillion & Leupold, cover was revealed on August 29, 2012. The deluxe edition cover is entirely identical to the standard edition but is tinged yellow.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{features}} Ullman {{playing an}} array of real-life people aside from a hearty helping of original characters. Impersonations include Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, {{and members of the}} British Royal Family, Camilla Parker-Bowles and Carole Middleton. Ullman received considerable international attention for her portrayal of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. [...] "I'm fascinated by Angela Merkel, so I wanted to be Angela Merkel. I think they're like Trojan horses, these impersonations. I can dress up like them and make them whatever I want them to be, like putting a personality within them. I didn't want to just do a straight impersonation. I wanted to try and show their lives. I always imagine that Angela Merkel is someone that has to be with men all the time, in these rooms having meetings... And I thought, 'I wonder what she's like when she's with her best friend and they just talk about hair and make-up?'" [...] BBC Director-General Tony Hall paid a visit to the set show and caught Ullman playing Merkel singing jazz and scatting about the state of European affairs. [...] "Tony Hall came down to the set <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> singing as Merkel. He said: 'Would you please do this on Newsnight with me?'" [...] On 23 June 2017, BBC One's The One Show reached out to Angela Merkel's office for a statement regarding Ullman's impersonation of her: ...|$|E
