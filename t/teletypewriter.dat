The program {{was created in}} 1979 in {{response}} to information accessibility issues for the Deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a <b>teletypewriter</b> or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving {{the entire state of}} Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, Deaf culture, and information for family members of Deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.|$|E

50|$|RS-232 {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1960 by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) as a Recommended Standard. The original DTEs were electromechanical <b>teletypewriters,</b> and the original DCEs were (usually) modems. When electronic terminals (smart and dumb) began to be used, they were often designed to be interchangeable with <b>teletypewriters,</b> and so supported RS-232. The C revision of the standard was issued in 1969 in part to accommodate the electrical characteristics of these devices.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{electric}} typewriter {{was produced}} by the Blickensderfer Manufacturing Company, of Stamford, Connecticut, in 1902. Like the manual Blickensderfer typewriters, it used a cylindrical typewheel rather than individual typebars. It was not a commercial success, {{which may have been}} because at the time electricity had not been standardized and voltage differed from city to city. The next step {{in the development of the}} electric typewriter came in 1910, when Charles and Howard Krum filed a patent for the first practical <b>teletypewriter.</b> The Krums' machine, named the Morkrum Printing Telegraph, used a typewheel rather than individual typebars. [...] This machine was used for the first commercial <b>teletypewriter</b> system on Postal Telegraph Company lines between Boston and New York City in 1910.|$|E
2500|$|Title IV of the ADA {{amended the}} {{landmark}} Communications Act of 1934 primarily by adding section [...] This section requires that all telecommunications {{companies in the}} U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, {{it led to the}} installation of public <b>teletypewriter</b> (TTY) machines and other TDD (telecommunications devices for the deaf). Title IV also led to the creation, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, of what were then called dual-party relay services and now are known as Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS), such as STS relay. Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are Video Relay Service (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.|$|E
2500|$|When the AP was founded, news {{became a}} salable commodity. The {{invention}} of the rotary press allowed the New York Tribune in the 1870s to print 18,000 papers per hour. During the Civil War and Spanish–American War, {{there was a new}} incentive to print vivid, on-the-spot reporting. Melville Stone, who had founded the Chicago Daily News in 1875, served as AP General Manager from 1893 to 1921. He embraced the standards of accuracy, impartiality, and integrity. The cooperative grew rapidly under the leadership of Kent Cooper (served 1925–48), who built up bureau staff in South America, Europe and (after World WarII), the Middle East. He introduced the [...] "telegraph typewriter" [...] or <b>teletypewriter</b> into newsrooms in 1914. In 1935, AP launched the Wirephoto network, which allowed transmission of news photographs over leased private telephone lines on the day they were taken. This gave AP a major advantage over other news media outlets. While the first network was only between New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, eventually AP had its network across the whole United States.|$|E
5000|$|Some ships, {{including}} {{almost all}} military ships, carry <b>teletypewriters,</b> {{and use them}} to communicate over short wave. This is called [...] "marine radiotelegraphy". The equipment is a shortwave radio transceiver with an attachment that generates and receives audio tones in order to drive the teletypewiter.|$|R
2500|$|The second {{character}} {{in its name}} was originally a slashed zero, a symbol used by old <b>teletypewriters</b> and some character mode operating systems to mean zero.

50|$|Through {{the early}} 1960s GE worked with Dartmouth College on the {{development}} of a time-sharing operating system, which would later go on to become Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS). The system was constructed by attaching a number of <b>teletypewriters</b> to a smaller GE machine called the DATANET-30 (DN-30), which was a small computer that had evolved from an earlier process-control machine.|$|R
5000|$|By 1935, {{message routing}} {{was the last}} great barrier to full automation.

50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, Paul Taylor {{combined}} Western Union Teletype machines with modems to create <b>teletypewriters,</b> known as TTYs. He distributed these early, non-portable devices to {{the homes of}} many in the deaf community in St. Louis, Missouri. He worked with others to establish a local telephone wake-up service. In the early 1970s, these small successes in St. Louis evolved into the nation’s first local telephone relay system for the deaf.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{teleprinters}} using 5-bit codes (see Baudot code) {{typically used}} a stop period of 1.5 bit times. Very early electromechanical <b>teletypewriters</b> (pre-1930) could demand 2 stop bits to allow mechanical impression without buffering. Hardware {{which does not}} support fractional stop bits can communicate with a device that uses 1.5 bit times if it is configured to send 2 stop bits when transmitting and requiring 1 stop bit when receiving.|$|R
50|$|In 1924, the CCITT {{introduced}} the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2) code {{as an international}} standard, {{which was based on}} the Western Union code with some minor changes. The US standardized on a version of ITA2 called the American <b>Teletypewriter</b> code (US TTY) which was the basis for 5-bit <b>teletypewriter</b> codes until the debut of 7-bit ASCII in 1963.|$|E

50|$|Telegraphy {{did not go}} away on radio. Instead, {{the degree}} of {{automation}} increased. On land-lines in the 1930s, <b>teletypewriters</b> automated encoding, and were adapted to pulse-code dialing to automate routing, a service called telex. For thirty years, telex was the absolute cheapest form of long-distance communication, because up to 25 telex channels could occupy the same bandwidth as one voice channel. For business and government, it was an advantage that telex directly produced written documents.|$|R
5000|$|Punched {{tape was}} used as a way of storing {{messages}} for <b>teletypewriters.</b> Operators typed in the message to the paper tape, and then sent the message at the maximum line speed from the tape. This permitted the operator to prepare the message [...] "off-line" [...] at the operator's best typing speed, and permitted the operator to correct any error prior to transmission. An experienced operator could prepare a message at 135WPM (words per minute) or more for short periods.|$|R
50|$|The PC {{keyboard}} {{with its}} various keys {{has a long}} history of evolution reaching back to <b>teletypewriters.</b> In addition to the 'old' standard keys, the PC keyboard has accumulated several special keys over the years. Some of the additions have been inspired by the opportunity or requirement for improving user productivity with general office application software, while other slightly more general keyboard additions have become the factory standards after being introduced by certain operating system or GUI software vendors such as Microsoft.|$|R
