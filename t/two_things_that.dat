25|$|Eggs {{found in}} females {{measured}} up to 5.1mm {{in diameter and}} had large yolk supplies. These large supplies are common among species that live entirely off yolk during their development. Most female frogs had around 40 ripe eggs, almost double that {{of the number of}} juveniles ever found in the stomach (21–26). This means one of <b>two</b> <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> the female fails to swallow all the eggs or the first few eggs to be swallowed are digested.|$|E

Despite this, he disliked other sports and would sneak out of school every Thursday afternoon to the local cinema. Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little to do at the school, and boredom drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E

[...] To teammates and friends, Russell was open and amicable, but was extremely distrusting and cold towards anyone else. Journalists were often treated to the [...] "Russell Glower", described as an [...] "icily contemptuous stare accompanied by a long silence". Russell was also notorious for his refusal to give autographs or even acknowledge the Celtics fans, so far that he was called [...] "the most selfish, surly and uncooperative athlete" [...] by one pundit.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, at Elder's instigation, Harewood {{appointed}} David Pountney {{director of}} productions. In 1985 Harewood retired, becoming chairman of ENO's board the following year. [...] Peter Jonas succeeded Harewood as managing director. The 1980s leadership team of Elder, Pountney and Jonas {{became known as}} the [...] "Powerhouse", initiated a new era of [...] "director's opera". The three of them favoured productions described, contrastingly, by Elder as [...] "groundbreaking, risky, probing and theatrically effective", and by the director Nicholas Hytner as [...] "Euro-bollocks that never has to be comprehensible to anybody but the people sitting out there conceiving." [...] Directors who did not, in Harewood's phrase, [...] "want to splash paint {{in the face of the}} public" [...] were sidelined. A 1980s audience survey showed that the <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> ENO audiences most disliked were poor diction and the extremes of [...] "director's opera".|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the album}} {{received}} one vote in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop music critics poll. Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year. Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said, [...] "it was artistic, it was the merit. ... Part of the reason it's so interesting, {{part of the reason why}} I think this is so good, it's a juxtaposition of <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> you really don't think are meant to be together." [...] Oakland, California rapper Kreayshawn said Lil B [...] "was an influence on me. I was starting to listen to his music and hanging out with him a lot when he was working on Rain in England." [...] Cloud rap duo Main Attrakionz has been compared to the style of Rain in England.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)", a {{marathon}} twelve-minute opus which was edited for single release in some countries. The track {{begins with a}} guitar played {{to sound like a}} revving motorcycle, a reference to Todd Rundgren's contribution in the middle of [...] "Bat Out of Hell". Each verse comprises <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he would do for love, followed by one thing that he would not do. It is that latter parts of each chorus that is the [...] "that" [...] of the title. However, some people misunderstand the lyrics, claiming that the singer never identifies what the [...] "that" [...] is that he is unwilling to do, a confusion that Steinman predicted during production. The song combines stadium rock and ballad for much of its twelve minutes. However, {{near the end of the}} song, a female vocalist is introduced. Credited in the liner notes as Mrs. Loud, this part was sung by Lorraine Crosby.|$|E
500|$|In Cowboys & Aliens, Director Jon Favreau sought [...] a {{plausible}} approach to how humans {{from the late}} 19th century could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry. He said, [...] "It was very well laid out, well planned, {{and there were a}} lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient, so we made sure we earned each step." [...] The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, [...] "It's very easy to just cut the string and then all of a sudden the action starts and you're in Independence Day." [...] Favreau cited the works of John Ford and Sergio Leone as sources of inspiration as well as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own, referencing Alien, Predator, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He said of both genres, [...] "It's about finding the intersection of those two genres [...] [...] [...] If you do it right, it honors both, and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> people understand the conventions of, instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you've seen before." ...|$|E

500|$|SFX {{reviewer}} Ian Berriman gave [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] {{three and}} a half out of five stars. He commented that the ethical debate made it [...] "a surprisingly mature story", but otherwise the Western tropes made it [...] "occasionally feel a little over-familiar". He also felt it was missing [...] "another twist or two", as most of the episode was dedicated to figuring {{out what to do with}} Jex rather than discovering more about him. Berriman also had two [...] "nitpicks" [...] that arose with the plot; the Gunslinger could just walk into the town and take Jex away, or the Doctor could take Jex away in the TARDIS. Dave Golder of the magazine labelled [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] as a [...] "disappointing" [...] science fiction Western episode, writing, [...] "There are some great things about this episode ... But in a show that usually has a lot of fun reinventing TV tropes, too much of [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] feels a bit been-there, done that." [...] Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more critical, writing that he did not [...] "believe" [...] or [...] "feel" [...] it. He felt that Westerns and Doctor Who were <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> [...] "never quite gelled" [...] and also criticised the [...] "languorous pace" [...] the fact that Rory had little to do. However, he did praise the [...] "gorgeous" [...] set and the [...] "cleverly constructed a morality play".|$|E

2500|$|Hynek {{remained}} with Project Sign after it became Project Grudge (though {{he was far}} less involved in Grudge {{than he had been}} in Sign). Project Grudge was replaced with Project Blue Book in early 1952, and Hynek remained as scientific consultant. Air Force Captain Edward J.

2500|$|While {{the central}} concept behind Buffy was [...] "high {{school as a}} horror movie" [...] in small-town America, co-creators David Greenwalt and Whedon were looking to make Angel into a {{different}} [...] "gritty, urban show." [...] Whedon explained, [...] "We wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It's set in Los Angeles {{because there are a}} lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be told. We also wanted to take the show a little older and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way. Buffy is always the underdog trying to save the world, but Angel is looking for redemption. It's those <b>two</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> creatively make the shows different." ...|$|E
