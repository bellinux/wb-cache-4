5|$|One study {{looked at}} how reward {{discounting}} is context specific. By differing {{the time and}} space between small and large rewards, {{they were able to}} test how these factors affected the decision making in <b>tamarins</b> and marmosets. They showed that <b>tamarins</b> will travel longer distances for larger food rewards, but will not wait as long as marmosets. Conversely, marmosets will wait longer, but will not travel as far. They then concluded that this discounting behavior directly correlates to the normal feeding behavior of species. The <b>tamarins</b> feed over large distances, looking for insects. Capturing and eating insects requires a quick and impulsive decision and action. The marmosets, on the other hand, eat tree sap, which takes more time to secrete, but does not require that the marmosets to cover large distances.|$|E
5|$|Delayed {{gratification}} or deferred gratification is {{an animal}} behavior {{that can be}} linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as capuchin monkeys, <b>tamarins,</b> marmosets, rats, and pigeons.|$|E

5|$|Animal Lifestyles, in {{the western}} {{quadrant}} of the zoo, features indoor habitat exhibits. Visitors in the foyer of the building are shown Life in the Water, Life in Air, and Life on Land dioramas. Each diorama holds a carefully controlled environment that features select animals. These central displays broadly relate animals to their surrounds. Exhibits featuring more specific biota branch off from the central foyer. Side exhibits center on cotton-top <b>tamarins,</b> meerkats, emerald tree boas, dwarf mongooses, desert monitors, among others. Some of these exhibits feature critically endangered animals. The Prospect Park Zoo is engaged in breeding species in captivity, {{a part of the}} larger wild life recovery program of the Wildlife Conservation Society.|$|E
5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and <b>tamarins)</b> are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally and sexually.|$|E

25|$|Miniature Monkeys, {{opened in}} May 2004, {{consists}} of two enclosures. The first {{is home to a}} pair of pied <b>tamarins</b> with pygmy marmosets, and the second is shared by three emperor <b>tamarins</b> and three golden-headed lion <b>tamarins.</b> Azara's agoutis, Geoffrey's marmosets, black-tailed marmosets, black lion <b>tamarins,</b> Red Titi and white-faced sakis have also been housed here in the past but have been moved out for various reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{forests that}} golden lion <b>tamarins</b> {{need in order}} to survive are cut down for timber and to make room for cattle ranches, farms and urbanization. Sometimes very small areas or 'pockets' of forest are left but these are too small for the <b>tamarins</b> to survive in. In the past, <b>tamarins</b> were {{collected}} for sale to the pet trade or for use in research laboratories. The golden lion <b>tamarins</b> are located in the South American house.|$|E
25|$|The Lesser Primates {{exhibit is}} home to lemurs and monkeys {{including}} black-and-white ruffed lemurs, black-capped capuchins, Bolivian squirrel monkeys, common marmosets, cotton-top <b>tamarins,</b> emperor <b>tamarins,</b> pygmy marmosets and ring-tailed lemurs.|$|E

25|$|This tiny monkey, {{named for}} its {{beautiful}} golden colour and the long hair around its head which resembles a lion's mane, {{is one of the}} rarest primates in the world. Golden lion <b>tamarins,</b> like many of the other <b>tamarins</b> found in South America, are threatened with extinction in their natural habitat. Dublin Zoo is involved in the international breeding programme and helps to fund researchers who study the <b>tamarins</b> in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamarins</b> act as seed {{dispersers}} {{in tropical}} ecosystems. While larger primates eat larger seeds, <b>tamarins</b> eat the smaller ones. The expelled seeds {{have a higher}} germination rate than others and ingesting larger seeds may help to dislodge and expel intestinal parasites.|$|E

5000|$|Another callitrichid, Weddell’s saddleback <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus fuscicollis weddelli) also occurs {{over much}} of Rondon's {{marmoset}}'s range. [...] However, Rondon's marmoset is rare or absent from areas where Weddell's saddleback <b>tamarin</b> is common. [...] Weddell's saddleback <b>tamarin</b> is known to take over Rondon's marmoset's gum feeding sites.|$|R
25|$|Other studies {{involving}} cotton-top <b>tamarins</b> have {{hinted that}} positive reciprocity and reciprocal altruism are irrelevant in the prosociality of these primates. Some researchers believe these primates tend to cooperate for selfish reasons and {{in situations where}} they incur some benefit for themselves. That is, cooperation in cotton-top <b>tamarins</b> can be better described by mutualism than by true altruism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamarins</b> {{in captivity}} {{have shown the}} ability to {{distinguish}} other individuals based on cooperative tendencies and past behavior. Cotton-tops ultimately use this information to guide future cooperation. Brief periods of defection tend to cause swift, irreparable breakups between these primates and their cooperators. To avoid this, cotton-top <b>tamarins</b> may make economically driven decisions based on the projected incentives of a potential cooperator.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooperative}} breeding hypothesis {{predicts that}} cotton-top <b>tamarins</b> engage with this young-rearing paradigm, {{and in turn}} naturally embrace patterns of prosocial behavior. These monkeys engage in such behavior by acting altruistically within their groups in caring for infants, vocalizing alarm calls, and in sharing food. Though some studies indicate that cotton-top <b>tamarins</b> have the psychological capacity to participate in reciprocally mediated altruism, {{it is unclear whether}} the cotton-top tamarin acts solely using judgements on reinforcement history.|$|E
50|$|Both SpiderMonkey and <b>Tamarin</b> fulfill {{closely related}} goals {{and so were}} both dubbed after monkeys (the spider monkey and the <b>tamarin,</b> respectively).|$|R

50|$|The white-mantled <b>tamarin,</b> Saguinus melanoleucus, is {{a species}} of <b>tamarin</b> from South America. It is found in Brazil, between Rio Jurua and Rio Tarauacá.|$|R
25|$|The {{cotton-top}} tamarin displays {{a wide variety}} of social behaviors. In particular, groups form a clear dominance hierarchy where only dominant pairs breed. The female normally gives birth to twins and uses pheromones to prevent other females in the group from breeding. These <b>tamarins</b> have been extensively studied for their high level of cooperative care, as well as altruistic and spiteful behaviors. Communication between cotton-top <b>tamarins</b> is sophisticated and shows evidence of grammatical structure, a language feature that must be acquired.|$|E
25|$|Another {{way to look}} at {{punishment}} in cotton-top <b>tamarins</b> is by observing their aggressive behavioral responses within and between groups, as well as between species. The cotton-top tamarin, like many marmosets, other <b>tamarins,</b> and specifically those in the genus Saguinus, stages aggressive displays almost exclusively towards fellow monkeys that belong to the same gender. These intrasexual displays of aggression are more frequent in females, and are vital when a breeding female is forcing both subadult and adult females to emigrate out of a familial group.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 500 <b>tamarins</b> lions in the wild, 125 {{of them had}} been reintroduced or had been born to reintroduced individuals. These 125 monkeys lived in 26 groups.|$|E

5000|$|There were {{plans to}} use <b>Tamarin</b> as part of Mozilla 2 (and {{therefore}} Firefox 4). The project to integrate <b>Tamarin</b> and SpiderMonkey was called [...] "ActionMonkey", but was canceled in 2008 because Tamarin's interpreter {{turned out to be}} slower than SpiderMonkey's and because the plans of ECMAScript development shifted from ECMAScript 4, which was partially implemented by then existing <b>Tamarin</b> source code and was meant to be completed by joined efforts of Adobe, Mozilla and its community within the <b>Tamarin</b> Project, to ECMAScript Harmony.|$|R
