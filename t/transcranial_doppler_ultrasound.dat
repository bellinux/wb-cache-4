40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Delayed {{cerebral}} ischemia and vasospasm {{are significant}} complications following SAH leading to cerebral infarction, functional disability, and death. In recent years, CTA and CTP {{have been used}} to increase the detection of delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm. Our aim was to perform comparative-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analyses evaluating CTA and CTP for delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm in aneurysmal SAH from a health care payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a decision model comparing CTA and CTP with transcranial Doppler sonography for detection of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia in SAH. The clinical pathways were based on the "Guidelines for the Management of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Guideline for Healthcare Professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association" (2012). Outcome health states represented mortality and morbidity according to functional outcomes. Input probabilities of symptoms and serial test results from CTA and CTP, <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> and digital subtraction angiography were directly derived from an SAH cohort by using a multinomial logistic regression model. Expected benefits, measured as quality-adjusted life years, and costs, measured in 2012 US dollars, were calculated for each imaging strategy. Univariable, multivariable, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the independent and combined effect of input parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound</b> strategy yielded 13. 62 quality-adjusted life years at a cost of $ 154, 719. The CTA and CTP strategy generated 13. 89 quality-adjusted life years at a cost of $ 147, 097, resulting in a gain of 0. 27 quality-adjusted life years and cost savings of $ 7622 over the <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound</b> strategy. Univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust to plausible input parameter uncertainty. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results yielded 96. 8 % of iterations in the right lower quadrant, representing higher benefits and lower costs. CONCLUSIONS: Our model results suggest that CTA and CTP are the preferred imaging strategy in SAH, compared with <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> leading to improved clinical outcomes and lower health care costs...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{cerebral}} arterial vasospasm and ischaemia, a serious complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Firstly is the noninvasive <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound</b> and transcranial cerebral oximetry techniques evaluated in detecting cerebral arterial vasospasm in clinical practice. Patients were examined during first 14 {{days after the}} bleed. Flow velocities in normo- versus hypertensive patients were also compared. Secondly is the effect in blood viscosity, cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen delivery rate evaluated during the commonly used haemodilutive therapy for vasospasm. Haematocrit after colloid infusion was compared with controls. Both global and regional cerebral blood flow was measured after iso- and hypervolaemic haemodilution. <b>Transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound</b> used daily is a valuable non-invasive bedside method to detect an increased risk for vasospasm. Especially {{when there is a}} rapid increase in mean flow velocity during 24 hours. However, in patients with verified arterial hypertension even a moderately increased mean flow velocity may indicate vasospasm. Transcranial cerebral oximetry may be useful as a complement to <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound</b> as a correlation between reduced cerebral saturation and increased mean flow velocity seem to exist. There is a spontaneous haemodilution after subarachnoid haemorrhage as haematocrit is lowered irrespective of haemodilutive therapy or not. Haemodilutive therapy alone may therefore not be beneficial for SAH patients. Isovolaemic haemodilution does not improve cerebral oxygen delivery although global cerebral blood flow and transcranial Doppler mean flow velocity increases. Nor is hypervolaemic haemodilution beneficial for patients with vasospasm as the increased CBF is counteracted by a reduction in oxygen delivery to the brain...|$|E
40|$|The use of coded {{excitation}} {{and pulse}} compression in <b>transcranial</b> <b>Doppler</b> (TCD) <b>ultrasound</b> systems {{is in the}} very early stages; the optimal processing scheme has yet to be determined.

The results demonstrate that using amplitude-modulated pulses vastly improves the axial resolution and provides a more predictable mainlobe-to-sidelobe distance in the radiofrequency (RF) signal. It is also shown that a Wiener filter can provide better performance than a matched filter, in terms of axial resolution and sidelobe level in the RF signal and signal-to-noise ratio in conventional sonograms.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{determine}} whether combining non-invasive tests for intracranial aneurysms together would significantly improve aneurysm detection over individual tests.  METHODS— 114 patients undergoing intra-arterial {{digital subtraction angiography}} to confirm or exclude an intracranial aneurysm were also examined by CT angiography, MR angiography, and <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> The reviewers and ultrasonographers were blinded to the angiogram result, other imaging results and all clinical information.  RESULTS—The combination of non-invasive tests did improve diagnostic performance on a per patient basis. The combination of power Doppler and CT angiography had the greatest sensitivity for aneurysm detection (0. 83; 05 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 66 - 0. 93) {{and the level of}} agreement for this strategy with the reference angiographic standard was excellent (κ 0. 84; 95 % CI 0. 72 - 0. 95). The improvement in sensitivity of adding power Doppler to CT angiography was not significant (p= 0. 55) but the improvement in the level of agreement with the reference standard was substantial. However, even the most sensitive combination strategy performed poorly in the detection of small (3 - 5 mm) and very small (< 3 mm) aneurysms with a sensitivity of 0. 43 (95 % CI 0. 23 - 0. 66) and 0. 00 (95 % CI 0. 00 - 0. 31) respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—The addition of <b>transcranial</b> power <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasound</b> to either CT angiography or MR angiography does improve diagnostic performance on a per patient basis but aneurysms of 5 mm or smaller can still not be reliably identified by current standard clinical non-invasive imaging modalities. ...|$|R
