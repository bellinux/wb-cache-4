5|$|While {{the rates}} of the leading causes of death, {{cardiovascular}} disease, cancer and lung disease, are similar in women and men, women have different experiences. Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men. Despite this, breast cancer remains the commonest cancer in women in developed countries, {{and is one of the}} more important chronic diseases of women, while cervical cancer remains one of the commonest cancers in developing countries, associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), an important sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>disease.</b> HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases. Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia. A major impediment to advancing women's health has been their underrepresentation in research studies, an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women's health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women's Health Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; {{according}} to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his team-mates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12operations at the nursing home to which he was taken. His condition worsened {{to the point where the}} doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, other than to say he was in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>disease.</b> He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This {{study has}} been {{designed}} in order to detect the relation ship between anxiety and knowledge level about sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> between sex workers in brothel in a high risk group and housewives in low risk group for sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases.</b> Material and Methods: Fifty sex workers and 50 housewives as a control group were included to the study. A questionnaire form and State-Trait anxiety scale were appilied to determine the knowledge level of sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> and the anxiety levels of these women. Results: Sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> knowledge point average was found as medium level in the study group and low level in control group. It has been determined that all women know HIV/AIDS among the most related to the sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> and that they acquire this knowledge from press and health personnel. It was found that both of groups had a medium level of anxiety. No relation between the sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> knowledge points and conditional anxiety points of both groups has been determined. Conclusion: It was seen that both the sex workers in brothel and housewives had knowledge inadequacy about sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases,</b> {{and they did not}} use effective method for the prevention against sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases,</b> and they had medium level anxiety. No relation between the sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> knowledge points and contional anxiety points of both groups has been determined, however, it was found statistically significant the relation between the continuous axiety point and HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B in group and Hepatitis C in control group...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background : This study {{examines}} {{factors that are}} more associated with risk of sexually transmitted bacterial and viral diseases in {{a representative sample of}} American adults. Methods : This is a cross sectional study using secondary data from the 2007 - 2010 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) is the software used in analysis of descriptive data and logistic regression models. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between risk factors and sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases.</b> Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between risk factors and sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> while controlling for confounders. A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was to determine the best predictors of each type of sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases.</b> Results : The sample size for the study population is n= 9, 216. There were four observed risk factors that were significantly associated with both bacterial sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> as well as viral sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> at the 0. 05 level of probability. Lack of health insurance was associated with 1. 66 increased odds of sexually <b>transmitted</b> viral <b>disease</b> compared to 1. 55 increased odds seen in sexually <b>transmitted</b> bacterial <b>disease.</b> History of birth control was associated with 2. 61 and 1. 66 increased odds in sexually <b>transmitted</b> bacterial <b>disease</b> and sexually <b>transmitted</b> viral <b>disease,</b> respectively. Having first sexual encounter in adulthood was associated with 3. 01 increased odds in sexually <b>transmitted</b> bacterial <b>disease</b> and 1. 72 times increased odds in sexually <b>transmitted</b> viral <b>diseases.</b> Multiple sexual partners was associated with decreased odds in both sexually transmitted bacterial and viral sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases.</b> Conclusions : The results of this study indicating differences in factors that are associated with sexually <b>transmitted</b> bacteria <b>diseases</b> and sexually <b>transmitted</b> viral <b>diseases</b> provide evidence for developing public health intervention that is based on type of infection. Public health intervention programs that address sex education, effect of IV drug use, the importance of health insurance, the use of birth control, circumcision, and smoking cessation may help to curb the prevalence of both sexually transmitted bacterial and viral infections in at-risk groups...|$|R
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) has {{recommended}} {{sexually transmitted infection}} as the preferred term since 1999. Sexually transmitted infection is a broader term than sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>disease.</b> An infection is a colonization by a parasitic species, which may not cause any adverse effects. In a disease, the infection leads to impaired or abnormal function. In either case, the condition may not exhibit signs or symptoms. Increased understanding of infections like HPV, which infects {{a significant portion of}} sexually active individuals but cause disease in only a few, has led to increased use of the term STI. Public health officials originally introduced the term sexually transmitted infection, which clinicians are increasingly using alongside the term sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>disease</b> in order to distinguish it from the former.|$|E
