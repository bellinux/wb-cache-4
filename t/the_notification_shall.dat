30|$|A {{big issue}} {{of the program is}} that it {{consists}} of a presence-only dataset that is known to suffer from bias (Blossey and Hunt-Joshi 2003; Fithian et al. 2015). Presence-absence datasets are more reliable. Therefore, we will incorporate notifications in the application to encourage users to report places and times when no encounter took place. The downside of such feature is that it may become annoying. <b>The</b> <b>notification</b> <b>shall</b> therefore only trigger rarely (once a week), with the possibility to turn the feature off. Finally, the notification feature may be used to spread timely information or help educate the citizens for example on the differences between mosquitoes and non-biting mites.|$|E

40|$|Title: Notification {{of animal}} welfare Author: Helen Öhlund The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the {{routines}} of the county administrations in Sweden when it comes to receiving <b>notification</b> from <b>the</b> public about the welfare of animals. According to Jordbruksverket at least 50 % of the screening of animal welfare should be based on routine controls on existing farmers. Today the routine controls only reach a 43 % average for the whole country. A big part of today’s result depends on the amount of time it takes the administrators of animal welfare to process <b>the</b> <b>notifications</b> from <b>the</b> public. To examine why <b>the</b> <b>notifications</b> from <b>the</b> public take too long time, the county administrations were interviewed through phone and e-mail. The interviews were made to see what routines the county administrations had and if the routines could be made more efficient. Jordbruksverket have developed aid to the county administrations in form of simpler checklists for pets and control cards to ease <b>the</b> burden in <b>notification</b> controls. This study shows that a lot of work can be done when it comes to receiving <b>the</b> <b>notification.</b> When receiving <b>notification</b> <b>the</b> administrators can decide if <b>the</b> <b>notification</b> is severe or not. Too little information makes it difficult to determine the gravity of <b>the</b> <b>notification.</b>   Key words: animal welfare, legislation, county administration, notification, Jordbruksverket...|$|R

Method: an observational cross-sectional study as conducted. Data collection was done through referrals made to the Social Service of Clinics Hospital of the Federal University of Pernambuco (HC/UFPE), by reports of professional by itself, a recording instrument from the hospital and copies of <b>the</b> <b>notification</b> form of cases. The project was approved by the Ethics Research Center of Health Sciences of the Federal University of Pernambuco/UFPE with protocol number 13 / 10. All cases were considered of September 2006, when began using <b>the</b> <b>Notification</b> Form from <b>the</b> Ministry of Health until December 2008. Results: <b>the</b> most <b>notification</b> was cases against the child (n= 20, 46, 51 %), while there isn’t registration of cases against the elderly.
