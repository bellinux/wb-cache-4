My paper explores makerspaces and how they theoretically contribute to business generation and sustainment. As defined in <b>the</b> paper, <b>the</b> <b>maker</b> movement will influence entrepreneurship through three principle channels. <b>The</b> <b>maker</b> movement attracts more individuals into product design, and thus may launch more “accidental entrepreneurs” if they find that their user solutions have a market.
