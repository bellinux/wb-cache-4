40|$|Abstract. Five {{methods are}} used to measure values of {{circumferential}} Young’s modulus and three methods {{are used to}} obtain shear modulus using the closed and open ring specimens. Based {{on the assumption that}} the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> a strain gage must yield the correct value of Young’s modulus, the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> a closed ring specimen gives more consistent results than the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> an open ring specimen. For the simplicity of measurement, the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> a closed ring specimen under compression can be used as long as the thickness of the used specimen remains thin enough to neglect the effects of shear deformation. To measure the shear modulus, G 12, both <b>techniques</b> <b>using</b> the open and closed ring seems to have the same trend as a function of thickness. As expected from the loading scheme, the <b>technique</b> <b>using</b> an open ring gives more consistent results for the shear modulus...|$|R

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is a <b>technique</b> <b>used</b> {{for determining}} the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal. From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in the crystal can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E
5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation <b>technique</b> <b>used</b> by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E

5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving <b>technique</b> <b>used</b> to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information).

5|$|Hebron Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a graveyard, consisting of about 700 granite, marble, slate and wooden headstones laid in semi-regular rows running northeast to southeast. The graveyard also abuts the northeastern elevation of the community building. Its interments date from about 1806 to the present; early headstones have deteriorated beyond recognition, and may be older than 1806. Slaves and other people of color are interred in a small area of the graveyard's southeastern section, with simpler markers than the cemetery's other headstones. Although its headstones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks, the graveyard's earliest headstones were simple wooden boards. Several gravestones are ornately carved, including one modeled on a tree stump. The graveyard is active, with the most recent burials at the property's northern end. Dr. William Blum, Sr., an electrochemist at the National Bureau of Standards who invented a chrome plating <b>technique</b> <b>used</b> in banknote printing, is interred at the cemetery.|$|E

Several changes were made including the southeastern tower being rebuilt and the northeastern tower being reinforced by an additional wall and a vaulted story. Moreover, the northern slope of the outer wall was further strengthened with a glacis built from large conglomerate blocks. A building in the center of al-Rahba was erected during this phase, likely replacing an older structure or a courtyard.|$|E

5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar <b>technique</b> <b>used</b> in geodesy and remote sensing.

Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
