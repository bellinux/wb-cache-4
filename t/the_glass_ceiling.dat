5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office of Research on Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that {{one of the best ways}} to advance research in women's health is to increase the proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> metaphor {{has often}} been used to {{describe}} invisible barriers ("glass") through which women can see elite positions but cannot reach them ("ceiling"). These barriers prevent large numbers of women and ethnic minorities from obtaining and securing the most powerful, prestigious and highest-grossing jobs in the workforce. Moreover, this effect prevents women from filling high-ranking positions and puts them at a disadvantage as potential candidates for advancement.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps D'Ascenzo Studios' most varied {{commission}} was for Rodeph Shalom Synagogue (1927) in Philadelphia. The Moorish Revival building {{was designed by}} architects (and brothers) Grant and Edward Simon, and nearly every surface in its sanctuary was covered with decoration. The studio designed its murals, twenty stained glass windows (including <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the dome), lighting fixtures, carpets, and even the bronze ark for the Torah. The studio also created the mosaics on the synagogue's façade, whose colors remain vibrant after nearly ninety years.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> is one {{prevalent}} {{concern about}} the quality of economic opportunity available to women involved in the formal labor market. This phenomenon is the de facto limitation of females' ability to achieve the top levels of leadership in an organization.

500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E
2500|$|In {{her article}} [...] "Women and Politics", Irina Zamfirache claims that <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> can be {{explained}} by woman's place in society.

40|$|<b>The</b> other <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{offers an}} {{insightful}} male perspective to {{a debate on}} the lack of work-family balance in modern day families. Based on research and full of entertaining anecdotes, this book challenges the predominant gender roles that expect a mother to care for her family and doubt her commitment to a career, {{while at the same time}} requiring a father to provide for his family financially and doubting his ability to look after his own children. This is <b>the</b> other <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> - <b>the</b> one reflected in gender inequity in the family home and preventing equality in parenting. <b>The</b> other <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> is perpetuated by both genders equally, and the solution requires compromises from both sides. Charles Areni and Stephen Holden encourage dads to 2 ̆ 7 step up 2 ̆ 7, to take on a bigger share of the burden of home duties. They encourage mums to 2 ̆ 7 let go 2 ̆ 7, to let dad get involved in child-rearing, and to bring to the task his own skills and approaches. Breaking through this other <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> will be good for mum, good for dad - oh, and good for the children too...|$|R

Taking the narratological approach, this research interprets the experiences of seven female managers of Maldives, and being member of the tribe, my personal experiences are shared when the stories of these women were interpreted using thematic analysis. The findings of this research revealed that Maldivian women managers have been prone to various <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> that have been directly related to their job and indirectly related to their job. Hence, the data exposed direct barriers such as perception of male employees towards the female employees, harassment and bullying at work and also various forms of discrimination which led to frustration of the managers. Indirect barriers appeared as the dual role of working women acting as an indirect barrier along {{with the need for}} family support and the lack of support facilities for working women act as indirect <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> which they face outside their jobs...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Margaret Rossiter offered two {{concepts}} {{for understanding the}} mass of statistics on women in science and the disadvantages women continued to suffer. The first she called hierarchical segregation, the well-known phenomenon that as one moves up the ladder of power and prestige fewer females faces are to be seen. This notion is perhaps more useful than that of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling,</b> the supposedly invisible barrier that keeps women from rising to the top because the notion of hierarchical disparities {{draws attention to the}} multiple stages at which women drop off as they attempt to climb academic or industrial ladders. The second concept she offered was [...] "territorial segregation", how women cluster in scientific disciplines. The most striking example of occupational territoriality used to be that women stayed at home and men went out to work.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling,</b> which already is stopping women from climbing higher in {{success in the}} workplace, a parallel phenomenon called the [...] "glass escalator" [...] is occurring. This {{can be defined as}} how more men are joining fields that were previously occupied mainly by women, such as nursing and teaching, and within these job fields, the men are riding right past women and going straight to the top, similarly to if they were on an escalator and a woman was taking stairs. Men are being offered more promotions than women and even though women have worked just as hard, they are still not being offered the same chances as men are in some circumstances. The chart from Carolyn K. Broner, Ph.D. shows an example of the glass escalator in favor of men for female-dominant occupations in schools. While women have mostly occupied the position of teachers, men are taking the higher positions in school systems as deans or principals.|$|E
2500|$|The United Nations had {{concluded}} that women often experience a [...] "glass ceiling" [...] {{and that there are}} no societies in which women enjoy the same opportunities as men. The term [...] "glass ceiling" [...] is used to describe a perceived barrier to advancement in employment based on discrimination, especially sex discrimination. In the United States in 1995, <b>the</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>Ceiling</b> Commission, a government-funded group, stated: [...] "Over half of all Master's degrees are now awarded to women, yet 95% of senior-level managers, of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies are men. Of them, 97% are white." [...] In its report, it recommended affirmative action, which is the consideration of an employee's gender and race in hiring and promotion decisions, as a means to end this form of discrimination. , women accounted for 51% of workers in high-paying management, professional, and related occupations. They outnumbered men in such occupations as public relations managers, financial managers, and human resource managers.|$|E
40|$|Sociality is {{primarily}} a coordination problem. However, the social (or communication) complexity hypothesis suggests that the kinds of {{information that can be}} acquired and processed may limit the size and/or complexity of social groups that a species can maintain. We use an agent-based model to test the hypothesis that the complexity of information processed influences the computational demands involved. We show that successive increases in the kinds of information processed allow organisms to break through <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> that otherwise limit the size of social groups: larger groups can only be achieved at the cost of more sophisticated kinds of information processing that are disadvantageous when optimal group size is small. These results simultaneously support both the social brain and the social complexity hypotheses...|$|R
