40|$|The <b>true</b> <b>armyworm</b> is a migratory pest {{from the}} {{southern}} U. S. that feeds on the leaf tissue of early and late vegetative corn. Adult <b>true</b> <b>armyworm</b> moths are attracted to fields that contain living ground cover, which include fields with grassy weeds or cover crops such as rye or grass. Fields that are minimum, no-till, or contain a cover crop should be scouted for true armyworms in May and June (Fig. 1). Upon arrival, the female moth will lay eggs onto the living ground cover. After hatching, the young larvae will feed on these plants until the plants are completely consumed or removed with herbicides. When the initial host plants are no longer available, the larvae will then move to corn. <b>True</b> <b>armyworm</b> larvae are identified by dull orange stripes found {{on each side of}} their body (Fig. 2). In addition to the six legs found on the thorax of the <b>true</b> <b>armyworm,</b> they also have four prolegs with dark bands on their abdomen (Fig. 3 A). True armyworms are also identified by the network of black lines present on their orange head capsule (Fig. 3 B). On injured plants, larvae can generally be found in the whorl of the plant...|$|E

40|$|I {{report on}} the {{biosynthesis}} and actions of prostaglandins (PGs) in insect immune tissues. PGs, oxygenated metabolites of arachidonic acid, are important mediators of insect cellular defense reactions to infections. While PGs and PG biosynthesis have been recorded in a few insect tissues, there remains a large lacuna {{in our understanding of}} PG biosynthesis in insect tissues. Chapters 2 and 3 add new data on PG biosynthesis by fat body (a major immune tissue) from larvae of <b>true</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Pseudaletia unipuncta, and the tenebrionid beetle, Zophobas atratus. Fat bodies from both species produced four PGs, PGA 2, PGD 2, PGE 2 and PGF 2 α. PGA 2 and PGE 2 were the predominant products in <b>true</b> <b>armyworm</b> fat body whereas PGA 2 and PGF 2 α were predominant products in beetle fat body. Indomethacin and naproxin effectively inhibited PG biosynthesis in both fat body preparations. Unlike the tenebrionid beetle and other invertebrates (as well as mammalian systems) studied to date, the <b>true</b> <b>armyworm</b> fat body did not require the presence of the usual exogenous co-factors (reduced glutathione and hemoglobin) for optimal PG biosynthesis. I infer that, as seen in most animals, these two insect species are competent to biosynthesize PGs, although we can not yet outline the general principles of PG biosynthesis in insects. ^ In mammalian systems, PGs influence cells through their interactions with specific PG receptor sites. Here, I also report the first biochemical characterization of an insect PG receptor in hemocytes prepared from tobacco hornworms, Manduca sexta. The binding of (3 H) PGE 2 was saturable and specific. Mathematical analysis indicate the presence of a single population of PGE 2 binding sites with a KD approximately 35 pmol/mg protein and Bmax approximately 7. 5 fmol/mg protein. The influence of purine nucleotides on binding suggests these are functional G protein coupled binding sites. I infer from these results that the mechanism of PG action in insect cellular immune physiology involves specific G protein couple PG receptors. ^ This research marks a meaningful advance in our understanding of PG biosynthesis and actions in insect immunity. ...|$|E
40|$|The armyworm, {{also known}} as <b>true</b> <b>armyworm,</b> is a common early season pest that {{occasionally}} causes catastrophic losses in small grains. Infestations, which occur in the spring, usually develop first in very thick, lodged stands. The name armyworm derives its name from its behavior of migrating in large numbers into fields similar to invading armies. Cool, wet, spring weather usually favors armyworm development. Distribution The full-grown (1 - 1 / 2 ") armyworm has a greenish brown body with a thin stripe {{down the center of}} the back and two orange stripes along each side. The head is brown with dark honeycombed markings. The small, globular, greenish-white, eggs are laid in clusters of 25 or more on the leaves of grasses...|$|E
40|$|Prevailing abiotic {{conditions}} may positively or negatively impact insects {{at both the}} individual and population levels. For example while moderate rainfall and wind velocity may provide conditions that favour development, as well as movement within and between habitats, high winds and heavy rains can significantly decrease life expectancy. There {{is some evidence that}} insects adjust their behaviours associated with flight, mating and foraging in response to changes in barometric pressure. We studied changes in different mating behaviours of three taxonomically unrelated insects, the curcurbit beetle, Diabrotica speciosa (Coleoptera), the <b>true</b> <b>armyworm</b> moth, Pseudaletia unipuncta (Lepidoptera) and the potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Hemiptera), when subjected to natural or experimentally manipulated changes in atmospheric pressure.

40|$|Traps baited with floral {{chemicals}} on {{the island}} of Hawaii captured several pest moth species. Chrysodeixis eriosoma (Doubleday) (green garden looper), Au- tographa biloba (Doubleday) (bi-lobed looper), and Mythimna unipuncta (Haworth) (<b>true</b> <b>armyworm),</b> all Noctuidae, as well as Hymenia recurvalis (L.) (beet webworm), a Crambidae, were trapped with phenylacetaldehyde (PAA). There was no response by moths to β-myrcene (BM), methyl salicylate (MS), cis-jasmone (CJ), methyl- 2 -methoxy benzoate (MMB), 2 -phenylethanol (2 PE), or linalool (LIN) when these chemicals were tested singly. When other floral chemicals were presented in traps with PAA, numbers of C. eriosoma captured were increased by BM, MS, 2 PE or MMB. Numbers of A. biloba and Peridroma saucia (Hübner) (variegated cutworm) were increased by including BM with PAA in traps. Numbers of M. unipuncta were increased by BM or 2 PE, and numbers of H. recurvalis were increased by MMB or LIN, presented with PAA.

P. unipuncta adult flight activity, monitored by light and pheromone traps, varied significantly with altitude, year or season, but was positively correlated between these two trapping systems.

The number of adults captured influenced {{the performance of the}} two types of traps, with pheromone trap being more effective at low density of moths. Temperature affected the number of adults captured in light and pheromone traps. Consistent patterns occur year after year, especially between July and October, months with high temperatures associated with some rainfall, corresponding to conditions that are suitable for the growth of the armyworm. The highest number of adults and larvae was observed during the summer and in early autumn. The number of larvae was significantly correlated to the number of adults caught in pheromone traps and in light traps, at all the localities.

40|$|The betabaculovirus {{originally}} called Pseudaletia (Mythimna) sp. granulovirus # 8 (MyspGV# 8) {{was examined}} by electron microscopy, host barcoding PCR, and {{determination of the}} nucleotide sequence of its genome. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the occlusion bodies of MyspGV# 8 possessed the characteristic size range and morphology of betabaculovirus granules. Barcoding PCR using cytochrome oxidase I primers with DNA from the MyspGV# 8 collection sample confirmed {{that it had been}} isolated from the <b>true</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Mythimna unipuncta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and therefore was renamed MyunGV# 8. The MyunGV# 8 genome was found to be 144, 673 bp in size with a nucleotide distribution of 49. 9 % G+C, which was significantly smaller and more GC-rich than the genome of Pseudaletia unipuncta granulovirus H (PsunGV-H), another M. unipuncta betabaculovirus. A phylogeny based on concatenated baculovirus core gene amino acid sequence alignments placed MyunGV# 8 in clade a of genus Betabaculovirus. Kimura- 2 -parameter nucleotide distances suggested that MyunGV# 8 represents a virus species different and distinct from other species of Betabaculovirus. Among the 153 ORFs annotated in the MyunGV# 8 genome, four ORFs appeared to have been obtained from or donated to the alphabaculovirus lineage represented by Leucania separata nucleopolyhedrovirus AH 1 (LeseNPV-AH 1) during co-infection of Mythimna sp. larvae. A set of 33 ORFs was identified that appears only in other clade a betabaculovirus isolates. This clade a-specific set includes an ORF that encodes a polypeptide sequence containing a CIDE_N domain, which is found in caspase-activated DNAse/DNA fragmentation factor (CAD/DFF) proteins. CAD/DFF proteins are involved in digesting DNA during apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|A line of {{experiments}} designed {{to test the}} hypothesis that eicosanoids mediate insect microaggregation and nodulation reactions to bacterial infections were conducted on six different insect species including the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, the tenebrionid beetle, Zophobas atratus, <b>true</b> <b>armyworm,</b> Pseudaletia unipuncta, black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon, silkworm, Bombyx mori, and the adult cricket, Gryllus assimilis. ^ Treating insects with the eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitor, dexamethasone, just prior to infection strongly reduced nodulation responses to bacterial infections. The dexamethasone effects were expressed in a dose-dependent manner, and were reversed by treating infected insects with eicosanoid-precursor polyunsaturated fatty acids. Treatments with the saturated fatty acid, 16 : 0, which is not an eicosanoid precursor, did not reverse the dexamethasone effects on nodulation. ^ Nodulation intensity, as measured by numbers of nodules was tightly related to bacterial dosages in M. sexta and Z. atratus. In medium and large Z. atratus larvae, as well as fifth stage M. sexta larvae, a greater number of nodules are formed in response to increased bacterial challenges. A similar pattern emerged from experiments with medium and large size Z. atratus larvae. ^ Experiments designed to test the influence of bacterial species on nodulation intensity for M. sexta and for Z. atratus show variation in number of nodules formed in response to similar challenges with four bacterial species, Serratia marcescens, Sarcina flava, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis. Serratia marcescens and S. flava induced high levels of nodulation in Manduca and Zophobas. Escherichia coli induced lower levers of nodulation in Manduca. Bacillus subtilis induced very little nodulation in Manduca and in Zophobas. ^ Zophobas atratus and M. sexta exhibit different capacities to form nodules in response to similar bacterial challenges and the nodules observed in both species were discreet formations of approximately the same size. The possibility that nodulation is related to the age and size of the insects was considered. Results indicate that the nodulation response occurs in all larval stages examined. However, nodulation intensity is unrelated to either insect biomass or body length. ...|$|E
