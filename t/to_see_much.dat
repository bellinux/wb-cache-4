5|$|In the 197778 season Villa {{reached the}} quarter-final of the UEFA Cup {{where they went}} out 43 on {{aggregate}} against Barcelona. In the domestic league, however, they struggled and Saunders started rebuilding the team. As Saunders began restructuring his team {{in the summer of}} 1979, there were more changes in the boardroom. Doug Ellis set a resolution to have several directors removed from the board. The resolution was not successful and as a result, Ellis resigned from the board. Meanwhile, Saunders brought in several new players who were to become some of Villa's most prolific players in terms of goals and appearances. Allan Evans, Ken McNaught and Kenny Swain were brought into the defence and Des Bremner was brought into the midfield to play alongside Dennis Mortimer and Gordon Cowans. Tony Morley and Gary Shaw were the new strike partnership. When Peter Withe was signed from Newcastle United in the summer of 1980, Saunders had built a team that was <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>much</b> success in the next few years.|$|E

25|$|Concerned {{about the}} effect of the continual {{maternal}} criticism on Victoria's psychological health, Baron von Stockmar asked Prince Albert to intervene and ask the Queen to moderate her demands. However, the Baron was unable to reduce the attacks that the princess suffered from the Russophilic and Anglophobic circles of the Berlin court. For most of the 19th century, Russia and Britain were not just geopolitical rivals in Asia, but also ideological opponents as many in both nations believed autocratic Russia and democratic Britain were destined to battle each for world domination. In Prussia, the Junkers tended <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>much</b> in common with the ordered society of Imperial Russia, and disliked British democracy. She was often hurt by unkind comments from the Hohenzollern family.|$|E

25|$|The Hanging Hills are {{a popular}} outdoor {{recreation}} resource. Hubbard Park features a bandshell and flower gardens {{and is the}} site of a variety of local festivals and concerts, most notably the spring Daffodil Festival. A park road leads to Castle Craig Tower and is open from April through October from 10:00a.m. to 5:00p.m. A number of trails, most notably the 51 mile (80k) blue-blazed Metacomet Trail (maintained by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association), traverse the range. Trails are open to hiking, backcountry skiing, and snowshoeing; roads are open to bicycling and mountain biking. Swimming is prohibited. Rock climbing, prohibited within Hubbard Park, is enjoyed on Cathole Mountain. From the top of the Hanging Hills' many cliffs it is possible <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>much</b> of the Quinnipiac River Valley region, Long Island Sound, and the distant higher peaks of southern New England.|$|E
500|$|In the song's opening verse, Harrison {{admits that}} he [...] "Can't say what I'm doing here" [...] in the {{material}} world, a statement that theologian Dale Allison identifies as Kafkaesque until Harrison offers [...] "eschatological hope" [...] with the subsequent line, [...] "But I hope <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>much</b> clearer". Harrison then states that he uses his body [...] "like a car / Taking me both near and far". Author Ian Inglis regards this as an apt metaphor, since our bodies [...] "are merely the vehicles that carry us on our journeys".|$|E
500|$|The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask runs on an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} engine used in Ocarina of Time and {{requires the use of}} the 4MB Expansion Pak. IGN theorizes this requirement is due to Majora's Masks possible origin as a Nintendo 64DD game, which would necessitate an extra 4MB of RAM. The use of the Expansion Pak allows for greater draw distances, more accurate dynamic lighting, more detailed texture mapping and animation, complex framebuffer effects such as motion blur, and more characters displayed on-screen. This expanded draw distance allows the player <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>much</b> farther and eliminates the need for the fog effect and [...] "cardboard panorama" [...] seen in Ocarina of Time, which were used to obscure distant areas. IGN considered the texture design {{to be one of the}} best created for the Nintendo 64, saying that although some textures have a low resolution, they are [...] "colorful and diverse", which gives each area [...] "its own unique look". Lastly, building interiors are rendered in real-time, unlike the fixed 3D display featured in Ocarina of Time.|$|E

Upon his return he attended the University of Washington, studying painting and sculpture and majoring in interior design. He graduated in 1959.|$|E

2500|$|Henry's {{photography}} {{studio at}} the mall continued <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>much</b> success, so much {{that by the end}} of the third season he received an offer from the magnate of Glossy's, a photo studio franchise, for a $100,000 buyout of Warnimont's, which also included the offer of Henry becoming manager of the Glossy's location. Henry accepted, but soon found that his creativity and business style was not being appreciated by his new employers. He quit Glossy's, but then decided to give into Punky's and Cherie's dream to run their own teen hangout/burger establishment, and invested into another mall property which ended up being splashed with as much color and originality as Punky's bedroom. All involved, which even included Betty and Margaux, unanimously decided on christening it [...] "Punky's Place." [...] Into season four, much of the action continued to take place {{at the mall}}, with Henry, Punky and her friends' efforts to keep their new restaurant afloat and the many teenage misadventures which passed through at Punky's Place.|$|E
