40|$|Purpose: Elevated bite {{forces and}} reduced bone densities and {{dimensions}} associated with posterior {{regions of the}} maxilla cause relatively high failure rates when short dental implants are placed to substitute missing teeth. This study uses the finite element method to evaluate four distinctly different short implant designs (Bicon, Neodent, Nobel Biocare, and Straumann) for their influences on the von Mises stress characteristics within the posterior maxilla. Materials and Methods: Finite element models of the supporting bone and tooth crowns are developed based on computed tomography data, and implant geometries are obtained from manufacturers' catalogs. The finite element models are meshed using three-dimensional hexahedral and wedge-shaped brick elements. Assumptions made in the analyses are: linear elastic material properties for bone, 50 % osseointegration between bone and implant, and crown height-implant length ratio of 2 : 1. Results: Bicon's neck indentation produced reduced stress in the cortical bone {{when compared with the}} Nobel Biocare and Straumann systems. The increased taper of the Neodent design decreased the stress level in cancellous bone. Nobel Biocare's rounded <b>thread</b> <b>crest</b> and reduced thread pitch produced a smoother stress profile. Straumann's increased thread pitch produced elevated stress in the cancellous bone. Generally, stresses were concentrated in the crestal bone region around the implant neck, attributable to the inclined nature of the masticatory force. Conclusion: Nobel Biocare and Bicon systems are recommended for use in type 4 cancellous and cortical bone, respectively.

40|$|Objectives: Reduced bone height, {{elevated}} masticatory {{force and}} increased crown height-implant length ratio are all associated with dental implants of short length {{placed in the}} posterior mandible or maxilla. Consequently, dental practitioners generally aim to increase the bone to implant surface area contact by choosing wider diameters for short implants. With implant designs being driven at times by market demands rather than basic scientific research, the influence of different designs on the stress characteristics in the surrounding bone becomes an important issue. This research uses the Finite Element Method to evaluate the stress characteristics within the posterior maxilla for four distinctly different short implant designs (Bicon, Neodent, Nobel Biocare and Straumann) subject to unfavourable crown height-implant length ratio and masticatory forces. Material and Methods: The four bone-implant systems are modelled using three-dimensional hexahedral and wedge shaped brick elements. Assumptions made in the analyses are: temperature sensitive elements are used to replicate the torque within the abutment screw; crown height-implant length ratio is 2 : 1; 50 % osseointegration between bone and implant; and, linear elastic material properties of bone. Results and Conclusion: Bicon's thread design causes larger stress variances from minimum to maximum when compared to all other systems. The combination of a decreased diameter and increased taperage of the Neodent design increases the stress level {{when compared to the}} Bicon implant. Nobel Biocare's rounded implant <b>thread</b> <b>crest</b> design and reduced thread pitch produces a preferred smoothed out stress profile. Straumann's increased thread pitch gives elevated stress in cancellous bone. Generally, stresses are concentrated in the crestal bone region next to the implant neck, attributable to the combination of crown height-implant length ratio and the inclined nature of the masticatory force.

These modifications included tapered truncation of the <b>thread</b> <b>crests</b> and taper of the whole thread form {{for a portion of}} the nut length. The maximum stress in the bolt always occurred within one pitch of the load bearing face of the nut. Truncating threads increased the maximum bolt stresses.

40|$|Purpose: The general aim of {{this study}} and those {{presented}} in Parts 2 – 4 of this series was to characterize the structure, properties, wear, and fracture of prosthetic retaining screws in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses after long-term use in vivo. This part of the overall investigation addresses whether there are differences in thread wear between the screws closest to the fulcrum and those that are farthest from the fulcrum in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses. Materials and Methods: The total number of prosthetic retaining screws used in this study was 100 (10 new and 90 used). New screws (controls) from Nobel Biocare (NB) were divided into Group 1 (slotted) and Group 2 (hexed). Ninety used screws (in service 18 – 120 months) were retrieved from fixed detachable hybrid prostheses in 18 patients (5 screws from each patient, 60 from NB and 30 from Sterngold). The used screws were divided into 18 groups. Additionally, each group was subdivided into A and B categories. Category A contained the middle three prosthetic screws, which were considered the farthest screws from the fulcrum line. Category B contained the most posterior two screws, which were considered the screws closest to the fulcrum line. All 100 screws were subjected to thorough, nondestructive testing. Results: Light and scanning electron microscopic examination of all used screws for each group revealed surface deterioration of the active profile of the screw threads consistent with adhesive wear. The observed thread profile deterioration ranged from mild to severe. The wear was aggressive enough to cause galling, which led to thinning of the threads and, in severe cases, to knife-edges at <b>thread</b> <b>crests.</b> In ten groups, the most anterior three screws exhibited more wear than the most posterior two screws. In addition to thread wear, severe plastic deformation was detected on the bottom part of each screw for three groups, and a long external longitudinal crack was detected in one screw of Group 2. Conclusions: The findings of this study and those presented in Parts 2 – 4 demonstrate that different retaining screws from the same manufacturer and/or from different manufacturers have different geometrical design, microstructures, major alloy constituents, and microhardness, and that these differences influence their preload and fractured load values. In this part of the overall investigation, the occurrence of galling as a result of wear involving prosthetic retaining screws appears to be an inevitable and unavoidable consequence of long-term use in vivo in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses regardless of the intended/original preload value. The galling rate is greater on the middle three screws compared to the most posterior two screws in fixed detachable hybrid prostheses. The wear pattern is consistent with an adhesive wear mechanism; however, this study does not provide enough data to support a definitive analysis. King Saud Universit...|$|R
40|$|Primary implant {{stability}} {{appears to}} be a prerequisite for successful bone integration of dental implants. A quantitative method of assessing osseointegration becomes essential for serving as a baseline {{and to be able to}} follow the measurement with time. A recently developed apparatus (Osstell; Integration Diagnostics AB, Sweden) uses resonance frequency (i. e. tuning fork principle) to determine implant stability. The use of resonance frequency analysis may provide an objective approach to measuring initial implant stability by being able to detect changes in micromotion that could be associated with increase or decrease in degree of osseointegration. Primary implant stability has been reported to be influenced by the bone quality and quantity, the implant geometry, and the site preparation technique. The purpose of the study is to test implant stability in relation to implant design (<b>thread</b> geometry and <b>crest</b> module) using Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA). The stabilities of 5 implant designs were tested after insertion into pig ribs. It was observed that the pig rib demonstrated type 1 / 2 bone density. Following implant placement, the corresponding transducer for each implant design was attached per-pendicular to the long axis of the pig rib and implant stabilities assessed using resonance frequenc...|$|R

40|$|Introduction – The {{mechanism}} {{and efficiency of}} force transfer by dental implants to surrounding biologic tissues are important determinants {{in the development of}} the implant-to-bone/tissue interface and implant longevity. Threads are used to improve the initial stability by maximizing bone contact through an enlarged implant surface area and thereby favor distribution of interfacial stresses. However, knowledge about optimal thread design for an enhanced implant integration in bone tissue is still lacking. Aim – The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the efficacy of implant micro thread design when combined with macro threads, for bone stimulation. The hypothesis is that the short threads will contribute with compression forces that may stimulate bone healing, while the larger threads will provide with primary stability necessary during the healing process. A further aim was to use an FEA model to describe the optimal thread form for reduced stress concentration immediately after implant insertion as well as after completed bone healing. Materials and methods – In study 1, Two-dimensional finite element models were made from 8 different <b>thread</b> designs. The <b>crest</b> module and apex of the implants were removed from the implant models, in order to enhance the effect of the thread designs only. Thus, the suprastructures and microstructures of the implants were not considered. All the eight implant models were assumed to be embedded in cortical bone. In addition, a 3 D model was used to evaluate stress in the bone generated by 6 different thread designed implants when the implant models included the entire implant. In the In vivo studies 2 and 3, experimental turned implants with a diameter of 4 mm and 8 mm in length were prepared with micro threads in between macro threads along the body of the implants. These were used as test implants. Implants without micro-threads were used as controls. In study 4, similar implants were made but with alteration in depth of the macro-thread to improve the possibility for bone stimulation by compression during healing. Insertion and removal torque analysis along with histomophometric analyses were done to evaluate the bone response. Results – In study 1, stresses were calculated using von Mises stress analysis. The stress levels in the bone were in the range of 5 - 13 MPa in osseointegrated model and 14 - 107 MPa in immediate 2 D models. 3 D Analysis results showed the von Mises stress in the range of 4. 8 - 30. 9 MPa, when a load of 100 N was applied vertically. In Study 4 FEA demonstrated stress levels in the range of 0. 28 MPa to 62 MPa for the control implant model designs, whereas the test implant models displayed a range of 0. 28 MPa to 31 Mpa. In study 2, the mean values of the ITQ for the control and test groups in the tibia were 15 and 20 Ncm respectively, and in the femur, the values were 11 and 12 Ncm, respectively. In study 4, the ITQ values were 11 Ncm and 14 Ncm respectively in the tibia, and in the femur 13 Ncm and 19 Ncm respectively. The RTQ values for the control and test groups in tibia was 11 Ncm and 17 Ncm, respectively and in the femur, 13 Ncm and 23 Ncm, respectively. The histomorphometric analysis of study 3, showed the mean total bone area, BA% (SD) to be higher in the test implants, when compared to the control implants in both the tibia 24 (4), and 21 (4), the femoral bone 29 (5), and 25 (7), respectively with no statistical significance. In study 4, the total bone area BA% was higher for the test implants with a mean value of 72 % compared to 48 % for the control group in tibial bone. In femural bone, the bone area was 63 % for the test and 38 % for the control group implants with p value of 0. 10 for both tibia and femur. Bone to implant contact showed significantly higher value for the test implants in the femur, p= 0. 04. Conclusion – The impact of different thread designs, with respect to the magnitude of the transferred stress peak in the bone, was higher for the immediately inserted implants than for the osseointegrated implant model. The stress distribution was more effective in experimental micro-thread implant models, when compared to the non-micro thread models. The addition of pitch shortened threads in the test implant, did significantly improve the primary and secondary stability of the test implants, when mechanically evaluated with ITQ and RTQ analysis in corticular or trabecular bone rabbit bone. Histomophometrical analysis showed that the addition of the pitch shortened threads in between the macro threads did have a bone stimulatory effect in the femur of the rabbits...|$|R
