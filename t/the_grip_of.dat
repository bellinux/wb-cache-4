5|$|Joe Shea got up {{and started}} calmly with {{a report on the}} state of the investigation. But within a minute, he was rambling, and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. I looked at him and saw my father, in <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> {{dementia}} praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{much older}} than 10,000 years would be {{practically}} impossible in Sweden, because until around 11,000 years ago the area was in <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> a world-wide ice age. Nature conservancy authorities considered putting a fence around the tree {{to protect it from}} possible vandals or trophy hunters.|$|E
5|$|Domnall's rise {{to power}} in the Kingdom of Dublin took place in 1075, after the {{expulsion}} of the reigning Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill, King of Dublin by the latter's overlord, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster. The circumstances surrounding Domnall's accession are uncertain. He may have collaborated with Gofraid to wrench the kingdom from <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> the Uí Briain, or {{he may have been}} installed in the kingship by Toirdelbach himself, and ruled under the latter's overlordship. Whatever the case, Domnall died within the year, and Toirdelbach placed his own son, Muirchertach, upon the throne.|$|E

5|$|Germany {{gradually}} tightened <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> Norwegian society, and the Parliament became defunct {{during the}} rest of the German occupation of Norway. In 1941 Meisdalshagen became a prominent figure in the Norwegian resistance movement against German rule, in the position of district leader of Milorg in Valdres. In 1944 he left Norway and fled to Sweden, where he was a secretary at Flyktningskontoret in Stockholm until 1945. Briefly in 1945 he served as an advisor in London for the coordination of Milorg cells.|$|E
5|$|To African Americans, {{the story}} of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most {{powerful}} image about emerging from <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity – a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today. For me, personally, growing up in far-flung parts of the world and without firm roots, the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home.|$|E
5|$|To {{escape a}} family who does not share her values, Mary befriends Ann, a local girl who educates her still further. Mary becomes quite {{attached}} to Ann who is in <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> an unrequited love and does not reciprocate Mary's feelings. Ann's family falls into poverty {{and is on the}} brink of losing their home, but Mary is able to pay off their debts after her marriage to Charles gives her limited control over her money.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, Soviet {{secondary}} education institutes introduced tuition fees, and the scholarship fund was cut. Shanina received little {{financial support from}} home and on 11 September 1941, she took a job in kindergarten No. 2 (lately known as Beryozka) in Arkhangelsk, with which she was offered a free apartment. She studied in the evenings {{and worked in the}} kindergarten during the daytime. The children liked Shanina and their parents appreciated her. Shanina graduated from college in the 1941–42 academic year, when the Soviet Union was in <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> World WarII.|$|E
5|$|Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as developing from a girl into {{a woman in the}} course of the story: in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors, in that way denying the part of herself that is normally dedicated to Aphrodite. The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made into a woman in <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> an uncontrollable lust. The marriage between her father and mother is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws, profane as well as divine. The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates the most extreme version a seduction can take: the union between two persons who by social norms and laws are strictly held apart.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, {{for the last}} two years as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried fruit from the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.|$|E

5|$|The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished {{is a large}} painting, 399cm (13ft 1in) across. It {{depicts a}} {{defeated}} soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> the victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more {{in keeping with the}} conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{editor of}} the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were {{regularly}} harassed {{by the police and}} Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting, although each time he was acquitted. Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in Prussia collapsed and the king, Frederick William IV, introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country. Consequently, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May. Marx returned to Paris, which was then under <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> both a reactionary counter-revolution and a cholera epidemic and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.|$|E
5|$|A {{battle for}} the lead {{developed}} between Hamilton and Ricciardo, until the Australian moved around Hamilton on lap 15. With <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> the intermediate tyres deteriorating, there were many overtaking manoeuvres on track. Rosberg unsuccessfully tried to overtake teammate Hamilton for second on lap 16, while Verstappen took sixth place from Vettel one lap later, only to run wide and lose the position again. On lap 18, Rosberg moved ahead of Hamilton, {{who was the first}} of the front runners to change tyres at the end of the lap, going for a dry compound. The other frontrunners followed suit over the next couple of laps. Following the pit stops, Ricciardo led from Rosberg, Kvyat and Hamilton. The two Mercedes drivers moved ahead of their respective Red Bull rivals on laps 22 and 23, while Vettel, now in fifth, closed on the leading quartet. On lap 24, he reached Kvyat and overtook him for fourth, while Nico Rosberg extended his lead to Ricciardo to nine seconds by lap 25. Hamilton took second place from Ricciardo one lap later. At the same time, Kimi Räikkönen was forced to retire. So had Massa on lap 24, suffering the same problem that had forced his teammate to stop.|$|E

5|$|The {{cities where}} {{emperors}} lived frequently in this period—Milan, Trier, Arles, Sirmium, Serdica, Thessaloniki, Nicomedia and Antioch—were treated as alternate imperial seats, {{to the exclusion}} of Rome and its senatorial elite. A new style of ceremony was developed, emphasizing the distinction of the emperor from all other persons. The quasi-republican ideals of Augustus' primus inter pares were abandoned for all but the tetrarchs themselves. Diocletian took to wearing a gold crown and jewels, and forbade the use of purple cloth to all but the emperors. His subjects were required to prostrate themselves in his presence (adoratio); the most fortunate were allowed the privilege of kissing the hem of his robe (proskynesis, προσκύνησις). Circuses and basilicas were designed to keep the face of the emperor perpetually in view, and always in a seat of authority. The emperor became a figure of transcendent authority, a man beyond <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> <b>of</b> the masses. His every appearance was stage-managed. This style of presentation was not new—many of its elements were first seen in the reigns of Aurelian and Severus—but it was only under the tetrarchs that it was refined into an explicit system.|$|E
