I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E

25|$|Seydlitz was sighted {{at about}} 2400 by Marlborough, who did nothing. The second {{ship in the}} squadron, Revenge (Captain Kiddle) {{challenged}} the unidentified ship, and received the wrong response, but took no action. Agincourt (Captain Doughty) {{at the rear of}} the line spotted her but did not challenge her so as not <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> division's position away. Light cruisers Boadicea and Fearless (Captain Roper) also spotted Seydlitz, but followed the example of the battleships and did nothing. Roper stated that by the time he could identify the ship, it was too late to fire a torpedo at her (Fearless was capable of 25 knots compared to Seydlitz's maximum 16 knots because of the damage). Seydlitz, already badly damaged and unable to put up much of a fight, was able to limp back to Germany.|$|E

500|$|Modelling atomic {{behaviour}} under incident {{electromagnetic radiation}} using [...] "virtual oscillators" [...] at the absorption and emission frequencies, {{rather than the}} (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They {{led to the development}} of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger. In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that [...] "there is nothing else to do than <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible".|$|E

Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{assessing}} Davies's {{political career}} the historian Alun Morgan notes certain inconsistencies: while calling for unity among leftist factions, Davies frequently rebelled against agreed Labour Party policies. He championed democracy, individual {{liberty and the}} rights of small nations, yet gave the Soviet Union his unvarying and uncritical support. However, he was consistent in certain core areas, often in defiance of official Labour policy: unremitting hostility to US foreign policy, opposition to the party's post-war defence policies (specifically on issues concerning American bases in Britain, rearmament in West Germany, and [...] development of the Polaris submarine programme), and above all commitment to the needs and interests of his Merthyr constituents. His dedication to his own agenda brought him into frequent conflict with party managers, and led to withdrawals of the party whip throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Stating his position in a 1948 letter to the Labour Party general secretary Morgan Phillips, he wrote: [...] "Our movement embraces millions of men and women, and not merely a few hundred MPs and a few dozen... members of the National Executive. I am habitually inclined <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> millions my first thoughts and consideration." [...] Davies's popularity with the voters of Merthyr Tydfil remained constant; he secured 75 per cent or more of the vote in each of the general elections of 1955, 1959, 1964 and 1966.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the original}} Piperjet was designed using the Piper Meridian single-engine turboprop as a template. The new owners of Piper, Imprimis, found fault with this design prompting a revision without direct reference to the Meridian. According to Piper CEO Geoffrey Berger, [...] "We wanted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> jet customers an even roomier light jet that incorporates a scalable design, {{paving the way for}} a future family of competitive business jets,". The new fuselage design provided an additional 4inches of headroom and nine more inches of elbow room and does away with a hump in the cabin floor that accommodated the wing spar in the old design.|$|E

2500|$|This {{motion was}} amended and {{approved}} by resolution of the Dáil, after considerable debate. The Republican, or Anti-Treaty, members had refused to take their seats in the Parliament and {{the opposition to the}} measures was provided by the Labour Party, who likened the legislation to a military dictatorship. On 3 October, the Free State had offered an amnesty to any Anti-Treaty fighters who surrendered their arms and recognised the government. However, there was little response. W. T. Cosgrave, the head of the Provisional Government, told the Dáil in response, [...] "Although I have always objected to the death penalty, {{there is no other way}} that I know of in which ordered conditions can be restored in this country, or any security obtained for our troops, or <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> troops any confidence in us as a government".|$|E
2500|$|Somewhat later, in 1862, the {{residents}} of Placer County (Auburn, Foresthill) came upon a scheme to build a road from the Foresthill divide to Squaw Valley {{with the intent of}} luring immigrant trains away from Nevada City and into Placerville and neighboring vicinities. George Wharton James, the author, described the road as an ill-fated enterprise: [...] "The grade is frightful. For an hour or more, we go slowly up it stopping every few yards or so <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> horses breath," [...] James wrote of a ride on the old road a half century after it was built. [...] "It is hard enough for horses to go up this grade but to pull heavily-ladened (sic) wagons - it seems impossible, [...] " [...] he concluded. Later attempts to improve this road or forge other wagon roads not successful.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding education, she said, [...] "While {{it might}} be popular, it is not {{demanding}} to set standards that all students can meet right away....

[...] She supported [...] "giving local schools control of [...] new education dollars... expanding after-school and weekend class programs... and supports reading and math specialists." [...] She opposed vouchers. “In 2005, she signed legislation creating the Student Excellence Equals Degree (SEED) Scholarship program, which enables students who keep their grades up {{and stay out of}} trouble to go to college for free in the state of Delaware. She also expanded her education specialist program, which has placed reading specialists in every elementary school, to also include a plan to place math specialists in every Delaware middle school.” ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{head of the}} Free State {{government}} {{during the}} Civil War, he was ruthless in {{what he saw as}} defence of the state against his former republican comrades. Although he actually disagreed {{with the use of the}} death penalty in principle, in October 1922 he enacted a Public Safety Bill, which allowed for the execution of anyone who was captured bearing arms against the state or aiding armed attacks on state forces. He told the Dáil on 27 September 1922, [...] "although I have always objected to the death penalty, there is no other way that I know of in which ordered conditions can be restored in this country, or any security obtained for our troops, or <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> troops any confidence in us as a government". His view was that if harsh action were not taken, a guerrilla war could drag on indefinitely, making the achievement of law and order and establishing the Free State impossible.|$|E
2500|$|This did not please Mahathir, who had clashed {{on several}} {{previous}} occasions with the judiciary. In one instance, a government order revoking the work permits of two foreign journalists {{critical of the}} government had been over-ruled by the Supreme Court. Mahathir began making heated attacks on the judiciary, telling Time, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, and we want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> interpretation.' If we disagree, the Courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' If we [...] go along, {{we are going to}} lose our power of legislation." [...] Mahathir also lashed out at [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent," [...] accusing them of playing to public opinion. Immediately after this latter statement, the government reassigned several High Court judges to different divisions, including Justice Harun Hashim who was then hearing the UMNO case. However, as the latter case was already in progress, Harun's transfer would not take effect until the case closed.|$|E
2500|$|Mahathir, who {{had never}} been fond of the judiciary, began making heated {{statements}} about it at this time. Mahathir declared, [...] "The judiciary says, 'Although you passed a law with a certain thing in mind, we think that your mind is wrong, and we want <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>our</b> interpretation.' If we disagree, the courts will say, 'We will interpret your disagreement.' ... We know exactly what we want to do, but once we do it, it is interpreted in a different way." [...] Mahathir also lambasted [...] "black sheep ... who want to be ... fiercely independent" [...] and play to public opinion. Soon after, nine judges sitting on the High Court were reassigned to different divisions; Justice Harun Hashim, who presided over the UMNO case, was transferred from appellate and special powers cases to commercial crimes. However, because the UMNO case was already in progress, his transfer would not take effect until the case closed. Harun later ruled that under the evidence presented, it was clear several UMNO delegates had come from unregistered branches of the party. In line with the law, he declared he was forced to declare UMNO an illegal society, and thereby dismissed the case of the plaintiffs. Mahathir soon formed a new party, UMNO Baru (New UMNO), to replace UMNO. Within a year, the suffix [...] "Baru" [...] was dropped, making it just plain [...] "UMNO".|$|E
