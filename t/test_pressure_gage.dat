40|$|Irrigation {{has been}} an {{essential}} part of Utah’s agriculture since pioneer days. Over half of Utah’s 1. 3 million irrigated acres are watered using surface methods such as flood, furrow, border, or basin irrigation. About 40 % of the irrigated acreage is under some form of sprinkler irrigation, including hand move, wheel move, center pivot, and other types. Low flow or micro-irrigation systems, including drip emitters, emitter tubes, drip tapes, bubblers and micro-sprinklers (sprays) are currently used on {{only a small fraction of}} the total irrigated area, but will become more common as water becomes more scarce and expensive. Currently, low flow and micro-irrigation is primarily used in orchards, vegetables and landscapes. When designed and operated properly, low flow or micro-irrigation systems apply water more efficiently and uniformly than sprinklers or surface irrigation systems, conserving water and generating higher yield per unit of water applied. Most low-flow systems are designed to operate at pressures of 10 to 25 pounds per square inch (psi). Municipal water systems typically deliver water at 50 to 70 psi. Water <b>pressure</b> can be <b>tested</b> with a <b>pressure</b> <b>gage</b> designed for water systems. Some gages are designed to <b>test</b> static <b>pressure</b> and can be fastened directly onto the hose bib or pipe. Other gauges are designed to <b>test</b> the <b>pressure</b> of flowing water, such as in a sprinkler nozzle, by inserting the tester directly into the stream of water. Simple <b>pressure</b> <b>gages</b> can be purchased at a local plumbing or irrigation supply store. For most low-flow systems, a pressure reducer will need to be installed to provide the manufacturer-recommended pressures for low-flow components and fittings.

40|$|The {{inner vessel}} heads {{including}} bypass and beam tubes {{had just been}} welded into place and dye penetrant checked. The vacuum heads were not on at this time but the vacuum shell was on covering the piping penetrating into the inner vessel. Signal boxes with all feed through boards, the instrumentation box, and high voltage boxes were all installed with their pump outs capped. All 1 / 4 -inch instrumentation lines were terminated at their respective shutoff valves. All vacuum piping used for pumping down the inner vessel was isolated using o-ring sealed blind flanges. PV 215 A (VAT Series 12), the 4 -inch VRC gate valve isolating the cyropump, and the rupture disk {{had to be removed}} and replaced with blind flanges before pressurizing due to their pressure limitations. Stresses in plates used as blind flanges were checked using Code calcualtions. Before the CC test, vacuum style blanks and clamps were hydrostatically <b>pressure</b> <b>tested</b> to 150 % of the maximum <b>test</b> <b>pressure,</b> 60 psig. The Code inspector and Research Division Safety had all given their approval to the <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> and procedure prior to filling the vessel with argon. The test was a major success. Based on the lack of any distinguishable pressure drop indicated on the <b>pressure</b> <b>gages,</b> the vessel appeared to be structurally sound throughout the duration of the test (approx. 3 hrs.). A major leak in the instrumentation tubing was discovered at half of the maximum <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> and was quickly isolated by crimping and capping with a compression fitting. There were some slight deviations in the actual procedure used. The 44 psig relief valve located just outside the cleanroom had to be capped until the pressure in the vessel indicated 38 psi. This was to allow higher supply pressures and hence, higher flows through the pressurizing line. Also, in order to get pressure readings at the cryostat without exposing any personnel to the potentially dangerous stored energy near the maximum <b>test</b> <b>pressure,</b> a camera was installed {{at the top of the}} vessel to view the indicator mounted there. The monitor was viewed at the ante room adjacent to the cleanroom. The holding pressure of 32 psig (4 / 5 of the maximum <b>test</b> <b>pressure)</b> was only maintained for about 20 minutes instead of the half hour recommendation in the procedure. We felt that this was sufficient time to Snoop test and perform the <b>pressure</b> drop <b>test.</b> After the test was completed, the inspector for CBI Na-Con and the Research Divison Safety Officer signed all of required documentation...|$|R

40|$|This note describes: the {{rationale}} for the <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> of the inner ECN cryostat vessel, the equipment to be used in this test, the test procedure, the status of the vessel prior to the test, the actual test results, and a schematic diagram of the testing set up and the <b>pressure</b> <b>testing</b> permit. The test, performed in the evening of July 17, 1991, was a major success. Based on a neglible pressure drop indicated on the <b>pressure</b> <b>gages</b> (1 / 4 psi), the vessel appeared to be structurally sound throughout the duration of the test (approx. 1. 5 hrs.). No pressure increases were observed on the indicators looking at the beam tube bellows volumes. There was no indication of bubbles form the soap test on the welds and most of the fittings that were checked. There were some slight deviations in the actual procedure used. The UO filter was removed after the vessel had bled down to about 18 psig in order to speed up that aspect of the test. The rationale was that the higher velocity gas had already passed through at the higher pressures and there was no visible traces of the black uo particles. The rate of 4 psi/ 10 minutes seemed incredibly slow and often that time was reduced to just over half that rate. The testing personnel was allowed to stay in the pit throughout the duration of the test; this was a slight relaxation of the rules...|$|R
