5|$|Following birth it was common, {{particularly}} among richer families, {{to employ a}} wet-nurse {{to care for the}} child, sometimes living in with the family. Few sources give an insight into the experiences of young children in this period. Some parents played with their children and parents demonstrated grief at their loss. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>responsibility</b> for bringing up young children fell on the mother. For older children, the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, {{but it is not clear}} how widely these practices were adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{responsibility for}} investigating the incident lay with the Air Accident Investigation Board/Norway (AAIB/N), although {{the investigation and}} report was a close cooperation with the Interstate Aviation Committee {{and to a lesser}} extent, the Federal Air Transport Agency. AAIB/N had <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>responsibility</b> for investigations at the crash site, cooperation with the Norwegian police and the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration, and writing the report. IAC was responsible for handling the investigations in Russia, the reading of the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder, the relationship with Vnukovo Airlines and a test flight. Both agencies agreed that English was to be the language of the final report; English is one of the ICAO languages.|$|E

5|$|From the 19th century, deputies {{were hired}} in larger areas {{to assist the}} sheriffs. Following the democratization in 1814, the Ministry of Justice was created in 1818 and has since had <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>responsibility</b> for {{organizing}} the police force. The 19th century saw a large {{increase in the number}} of chiefs of police, reaching sixteen by the middle of the century. Christiania established the country's first uniformed corps of constables in 1859, which gave the force a more unified appearance. Similar structures were soon introduced in many other cities. From 1859 the municipalities would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police to use those forces outside the municipal borders. The first organized education of police officers started in Christiania in 1889.|$|E
5|$|The ADF shares {{responsibility}} for counter-terrorism with civilian law enforcement agencies. Under the Australian National Counter-Terrorism Plan the State and Territory police and emergency services have <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{for responding to}} any terrorist incidents on Australian territory. If a terrorist threat or the consequences of an incident are beyond the capacity of civilian authorities to resolve the ADF may be 'called out' to provide support. To meet its counter-terrorism responsibilities the ADF maintains two elite Tactical Assault Groups, the Special Operations Engineer Regiment {{as well as a}} company-sized high readiness group in each Army Reserve brigade and the 1st Commando Regiment. While these forces provide a substantial counter-terrorism capability, the ADF does not regard domestic security as being part of its 'core business'.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{conducted}} {{a series of}} sorties into the North Sea during the war designed to lure out an isolated portion of the numerically superior British Grand Fleet. These operations frequently used the fast battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to raid the British coast as the bait for the Royal Navy. These operations culminated in the Battle of Jutland, on 31 May–1 June 1916, where the High Seas Fleet confronted the whole of the Grand Fleet. The battle was inconclusive, but the British won strategically, as it convinced Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the German fleet commander, that even a highly favorable outcome to a fleet action would not secure German victory in the war. Scheer and other leading admirals therefore advised the Kaiser to order a resumption of the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>responsibility</b> of the High Seas Fleet in 1917 and 1918 was to secure the German naval bases in the North Sea for U-boat operations. Nevertheless, the fleet continued to conduct sorties into the North Sea and detached units for special operations in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Baltic Fleet. Following the German defeat in November 1918, the Allies interned the bulk of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow, where it was ultimately scuttled by its crews in June 1919, days before the belligerents signed the Treaty of Versailles.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>responsibility</b> of {{the missionaries}} was to convert {{as many people}} as possible. They used {{education}} and medical missionary work to assist them. But they also published ridiculing and insulting material on native religion and practices. The popular deity Lord Murugan was specifically targeted. This started the backlash against Christian missionaries. Many early converts like C. W. Thamotharampillai and Carol Visvanathapillai came back to Hinduism. This also resulted in formation of many Hindu Schools and more political awareness for native Tamils. Today around 10% are Christians with Catholics forming 90% of the Christians in Sri Lanka.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} {{attitudes toward the}} family have survived without being questioned.

The norm of patrilineal descent and the assumption that it is sons who bear <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>responsibility</b> for their aged parents remain. The party and government have devoted great effort to controlling the number of births and have attempted {{to limit the number of}} children per couple.
