But all are the same in one point, the mildewed, cankered, gangrened aspect, contrasting so unfavourably with the whitewashed port-towns of the Arabs. The upper stories of wood-work based on masonry, the fronting piazzas or galleries, the huge plank-balconies, and the general use of shingle roofs--in fact, the quantity of tinder-timber, reminding one of olden Cairo, are real risks: {{some of the best}} houses have been destroyed by fire; and, as in Valparaiso and the flue-warmed castles of England, it is only a question of time when the inmates will be houseless. Thanks to the form of ground, the townlet is well laid out, with a gradual rake towards the bay. But there is no marine parade, and the remarkably uneven habitations crowd towards the water-front, like those of Eastern ports, thinning off and losing style inland. The best are placed to catch the 'Doctor,' or sea-breeze: here, as at Zanzibar, the <b>temperature</b> <b>out</b> of the wind becomes unendurable.|$|E

5000|$|C. bescii has {{the highest}} growth <b>temperature</b> <b>out</b> of nine {{different}} isolates in the genus of Caldicellulosiruptor. It can grow at temperatures up to 90° Celsius with an optimum growth temperature of 75° Celsius. In 1990, C. bescii was described formally and the type strain was deposited as DSM 6725. Shortly after, C. bescii was classified {{as a member of}} a new genus Anaerocellum and named Anaerocellum thermophilum, strain Z-1320. Studies were conducted to compare and contrast the strains. A study on the DSM 6725 strain with hemicellulose, cellulose and pectin showed notable differences compared to what was reported with strain Z-1320. The tests showed that DSM 6725 was able to grow on pectin and xylose, while it was previously shown that strain Z-1320 could not utilize xylose and pectin. Another notable difference was in the growth temperature of DSM 6725. [...] DSM 6725 strain could grow up to 90° Celsius while Z-1320 can grow up to 83° Celsius. These differences in the strains lead to the grouping of C. bescii.|$|E

Acid gas used in the gas refinery involving in the prior reaction, has impurities such as: CO 2, H 2 O, DMEA and stays null. Flow meters existing in the acid gas line movement, measure H 2 S and impurities (gas flow in complete). But for estimating the temperature of reaction and controlling it, we need the real amount of gas flow.
