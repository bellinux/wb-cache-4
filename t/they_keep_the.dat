5|$|Sea otters are {{a classic}} example of a {{keystone}} species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. <b>They</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly sea urchins, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the Big Sur coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.|$|E
5|$|Since {{it never}} reached a target, the exact place {{intended}} {{to be hit by}} Flight93 has never been decisively confirmed. Before the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and Mohammed Atef developed a list of potential targets. Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center and all three wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden told 9/11 planner Ramzi bin al-Shibh to advise Mohamed Atta that he preferred the White House over the Capitol as a target. Atta cautioned bin al-Shibh that this would be difficult, but agreed to include the White House as a possible target and suggested <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Capitol as an alternative in case the White House proved too difficult. Eventually, Atta told bin al-Shibh that Jarrah planned to hit the Capitol. Atta briefly mentioned the possibility of striking a nuclear facility, but balked after the other attack pilots voiced their opposition. Based on an exchange between Atta and bin al-Shibh two days before the attacks, the White House would be the primary target for the fourth plane and the Capitol the secondary target.|$|E

500|$|Muskrats {{normally}} live {{in groups}} {{consisting of a}} male and female pair and their young. During the spring, they often fight with other muskrats over territory and potential mates. Many are injured or killed in these fights. Muskrat families build nests to protect themselves and their young from cold and predators. In streams, ponds, or lakes, muskrats burrow into the bank with an underwater entrance. These entrances are [...] wide. [...] In marshes, push-ups are constructed from vegetation and mud.

Although <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles {{his way out of}} the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. Obadiah Stane, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit, as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, Stark keeps his work to himself because he is suspicious of his company.|$|E
500|$|After the sudden, inexplicable {{death of}} a cow on the ranch, Homer sends Lonnie to town to bring Hud to the ranch for his opinion. [...] Lonnie, finding Hud {{just in time to}} take the blame for Hud's tryst with a married woman, protests Hud's putting him in a {{dangerous}} situation as they return to the ranch, with Hud driving over Alma's flowers as they arrive. [...] At the dead animal, Hud shoots several buzzards to scare the flock away against his father's protestations that <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> land clean and shooting them is illegal. [...] Hud states his immunity to laws that inconvenience him, setting the tone of his overall demeanor. [...] Hud is annoyed by his father's decision to summon the state veterinarian, and suggests selling the animals to other ranchers before the news spreads; otherwise, government agents will kill all the cattle and destroy everything they have worked for. He blames his father for not realizing that the cheap Mexican cattle were sick before he bought them. Adhering to his principles, Homer ignores Hud's idea and waits for the veterinarian. Upon his arrival, the state veterinarian immediately issues a legally binding State Livestock Transfer Order directing the quarantine of the ranch for a possible foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. This freezes the movement of all livestock to or from the Bannon ranch, while they await the test results.|$|E

500|$|ILM's {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Scott Farrar said that [...] "not {{only were the}} film's effects ambitious, they also had to be designed for 3-D", and explained the company's solutions for the new perspective: [...] "We did make sure things are as bright as possible; Michael called up theatre owners to make sure <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> lamps bright in the theatres... make everything a little sharper, {{because we know that}} through the steps, no matter what, {{when you get to the}} final screening things tend to go less sharp." [...] On the last weekend of ILM's work on Dark of the Moon, the company's entire render farm was being used for the film, giving ILM more than 200,000 hours of rendering power a day—or equivalent to 22.8 years of rendering time in a 24-hour period. Farrar embraced the detail in creating giant robots for 3-D, making sure that in close-ups of the Transformers' faces [...] "you see all the details in the nooks and crannies of these pieces. It's totally unlike a plain surface subject like a human head or an animated head." [...] The supervisor said that Bay's style of cinematography helped integrate the robots into the scenes, as [...] "Michael is keen on having foreground/midground/background depth in his shots, even in normal live-action shots. He'll say, ’Put some stuff hanging here!' It could be women's stockings or forks and knives dangling from a string out of focus – it doesn't matter, but it gives you depth, and focus depth, and makes it more interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{returns from}} jury duty and learns that, in his week-long absence, his {{co-workers}} {{were forced to}} make up for his vacancy, suffering setbacks and inconveniences in the process. Jim reveals to the camera that, while he was called for duty, he was dismissed at noon and headed home to Pam (Jenna Fischer) and their two children; he saw that Pam was overwhelmed and took {{the rest of the week}} off to help take care of their children. To appease his interested co-workers, Jim fabricates numerous details of his jury duty, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) becomes suspicious when Jim mistakenly refers to a food truck franchise Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) ate at during his jury duty as a [...] "restaurant". Dwight accuses Jim of lying about jury duty and extracts from Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) a promise to fire Jim if he proves he is correct. Ashamed, Jim privately admits his guilt to Andy, who insists that <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> matter a secret so that he will not be held to his promise to fire Jim. However, Dwight increases his attempts to prove Jim's guilt, and Jim finally decides to defy Andy's orders and tell his co-workers the truth rather than wait for Dwight to inevitably expose him. While this angers most of the employees, Dwight is thrilled at the confession and demands that Andy keep his promise to fire Jim. Andy refuses, so Dwight tries to contact Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). To smooth things over, Jim and Pam bring in their children, CeCe and Phillip, to present pictures that CeCe drew for the co-workers. It becomes clear that Jim and Pam drew the pictures themselves, but before the members of the office can berate the couple, the children begin crying loudly, creating a cacophony that Jim and Pam struggle to control, forcing them to take them back to the car. Realizing the stress that having young children causes, the office workers, ultimately, forgive Jim for his behavior and even suggest he leave early to help Pam, which he does.|$|E
