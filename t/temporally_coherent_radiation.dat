However, we model the effects due to interstellar scintillation for this pulsar and show that it reproduces the observed signature. In particular, the temporal coherence time is close to the reciprocal of the decorrelation bandwidth due to diffractive scintillation. Furthermore, comparison of the coherence times of three pulsars reported by Jenet et al.

40|$|Seeding of free-electron lasers (FELs) using {{external}} coherent optical pulses recently {{became an}} area of interest as users demand spectrally and <b>temporally</b> <b>coherent</b> FEL <b>radiation</b> which is not achievable in traditional self-amplified spontaneous emission operation mode. Since temporal and spectral properties of the seed laser pulses are directly imprinted on the electron bunch, a proper characterization of these seed pulses is needed. However, {{the lack of any}} measurement technique capable of characterizing ultrashort seed laser pulses at the laser-electron interaction region is a primary drawback. In thispaper we report indirect measurements of seed laser pulses in an undulator section using a transverse deflecting RF-structure (TDS) at the free-electron laser FLASH at DESY. Temporally chirped and unchirped seed pulse length measurements will be compared with second-harmonic generation frequency-resolved optical gating measurements and theoretical simulations. Using this technique we will demonstrate that pulse artifacts such as pre- and post-pulses in the seed pulse in the femtosecond and picosecond timescales can be identified without any temporal ambiguity...|$|R

40|$|In {{auditory}} scene analysis, population {{separation and}} temporal coherence {{have been proposed}} to explain how auditory features are grouped together and streamed over time. The present study investigated whether these two theories {{can be applied to}} tactile streaming and whether temporal coherence theory can be applied to crossmodal streaming. The results show that synchrony detection between two tones/taps at different frequencies/locations became difficult when one of the tones/taps was embedded in a perceptual stream. While the taps applied to the same location were streamed over time, the taps applied to different locations were not. This observation suggests that tactile stream formation can be explained by population-separation theory. On the other hand, <b>temporally</b> <b>coherent</b> auditory stimuli at different frequencies were streamed over time, but <b>temporally</b> <b>coherent</b> tactile stimuli applied to different locations were not. When there was within-modality streaming, <b>temporally</b> <b>coherent</b> auditory stimuli and tactile stimuli were not streamed over time, either.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} physics of a microbunched {{electron}} beam kicked by the dipole field of a corrector magnet by describing the kinematics of <b>coherent</b> undulator <b>radiation</b> after the kick. Particle tracking shows that the electron beam direction changes after the kick, while {{the orientation of the}} microbunching wavefront stays unvaried. Therefore, electrons motion and wavefront normal have different directions. <b>Coherent</b> <b>radiation</b> emission in a downstream undulator is expected to be dramatically suppressed as soon as the kick angle becomes larger than the divergence of the output radiation. In fact, according to conventional treatments, <b>coherent</b> <b>radiation</b> is emitted along the normal to the microbunching wavefront. Here we show that kinematics predicts a surprising effect. Namely, a description of <b>coherent</b> undulator <b>radiation</b> in the laboratory frame yields the radical notion that, due light aberration, strong <b>coherent</b> <b>radiation</b> is produced along the direction of the kick.
