He never recovered and died on 17 July 1908. He was buried at Wemyss in the Chapel Garden. In a speech in the House of Commons on 21 October 1909, James Falconer MP for Forfarshire said:- “Mr. Wemyss had taken all the risks in developing his property {{at a cost of}} £1,000,000. He has provided employment for thousands of men, had provided them with <b>travelling</b> <b>facilities</b> and built dwelling houses which were a model to everyone. The rates paid in respect of the enterprise amounted to £8,000 to £9,000 a year. I know no instance which is so much to be commended {{from the point of view}} of anyone interested in the development of the country. It is a real romance of enterprise, which has not been equalled in my time in Scotland.” ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} {{bachelor}} thesis, I {{will deal with}} the development of motorism in our country from the turn of the 19 th and 20 th century to the present. The issue will be treated from the social-historical point of view. At the beginning of the last century, a car was owned only by the richest class. Nowadays, hovewer, motorism became an absolute phenomenon and almost each family in the Czech Republic own a car. In my work, I will attempt to find out the main factors leading to this development. I will analyse the increasing living standards of the population. I will deal with the increasing density and quality of the road network in our country. Describing the density of the railway network, or bus connection, I would like to answer the question whether they were able to ensure transport and <b>travelling</b> <b>facilities</b> for inhabitants sufficiently, or whether a car represented a necessary possession in this respect. I will follow the development of our car factories (Škoda plants, Tatra Kopřivnice), concentrating on the sales development on the internal market. At the end of this work, I will sum up the main factors of the motorist development. In my work, I will use published sources and the latest specialized literature...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{exponential}} growth of artistic residencies between 1990 and 2010 {{at an international}} level, artists working in associated mobility programmes have been challenged by unsettled transnational working practices and competition. This, in turn, provides them {{with the opportunity to}} develop their creative processes. It is shown that artists’-in-residence openness and willingness to travel internationally is, on the one hand, related to the development of information technology, and on the other, supported by <b>travelling</b> <b>facilities,</b> which have impact on lifelong learning and cultural maintenance. Whereas change of geographical environment is often associated to psychological and physical conditions, artists’ statements reveal the dichotomy and paradox between globalization, collaboration and dispersion versus isolation, individualism and concentration. Possibilities for documenting and circulating artworks through digital communication tools and in-situ supply support and generate knowledge and recognition. All these possibilities, however, are challenged by uncertainty. The acknowledgment of cultural differences and barriers is expressed by artists in the most varied ways, especially through performance art and site-specific installations. As a source of inspiration, cross-cultural environments are negotiated by artists’ hybrid identities, situated at the intersection of Western and Non-Western aesthetic traditions. Artists’ cross-cultural environments are composed of international and intercultural communication issues and practices, where the sense of place, environmental awareness through multisensory experiences and the importance of everyday routines are reflected. Methodologically, this research is two-fold, based on a qualitative content analysis of selected artists-in-residence statements and artworks, and on a conceptual framework developed on social processes, artists’ individual motivations and technology purposes...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to develop a}} one- and two-element model of the fees {{calculation}} for the use of track infrastructure of Ukrainian railway transport. Methodology. On the basis of this one can consider that when planning the planned preventive track repair works and the amount of depreciation charges the guiding criterion is not the amount of progress it is the operating life of the track infrastructure facilities. The cost of PPTRW is determined {{on the basis of the}} following: the classification track repairs; typical technological processes for track repairs; technology based time standards for PPTRW; costs for the work of people, performing the PPTRW, their hourly wage rates according to the Order 98 -Ts; the operating cost of machinery; regulated list; norms of expenditures and costs of materials and products (they have the largest share of the costs for repairs); railway rates; average distances for transportation of materials used during repair; standards of general production expenses and the administrative costs. Findings. The models offered in article allow executing the objective account of expenses in <b>travelling</b> <b>facilities</b> for the purpose of calculation of the proved size of indemnification and necessary size of profit, the sufficient enterprises for effective activity of a travelling infrastructure. Originality. The methodological bases of determination the fees (payments) for the use of track infrastructure on one- and two-element base taking into account the experience of railways in the EC countries and the current transport legislation were grounded. Practical value. The article proposes the one- and two-element models of calculating the fees (payments) for the TIF use, accounting the applicable requirements of European transport legislation, which provides the expense compensation and income formation, sufficient for economic incentives of the efficient operation of the TIE of Ukrainian railway transport...|$|E
