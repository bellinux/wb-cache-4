5|$|Egyptian forces {{attempted}} a surprise {{attack on the}} crusaders' camp on 9 October, but John discovered their movements. He and his retinue attacked and annihilated the Egyptian advance guard, hindering the main force. The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm blew it near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack; they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on 29 August 1219 without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated. During the ensuing panic, only <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>of</b> John, the Templars, the Hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the Egyptians from destroying their camp.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes we punish non-cooperators in our society. Such {{behavior}} {{could be}} derived from aversive emotion for inequity (inequity aversion) to make non-cooperators cooperative. Thus, punishing behavior derived from inequity {{is believed to be}} important for maintaining our society. Meanwhile, our daily experiences suggest that <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>cooperation</b> by <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> society (<b>cooperation</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group) could change the punishing behavior for non-cooperators even if the inequity were equal. Such effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group cannot be explained by simple inequity aversion. Although punishment-related brain regions have been reported in previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, little is known about such regions affected by <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group. In the present fMRI study, we investigated <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group on the punishing behavior for non-cooperators and its related brain activations by a paradigm in which the degree of the cooperative state varied from low to high. Punishment-related activations were observed in brain regions such as the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The quantity of punishment in a high cooperation context was greater than in a low cooperation context, and activation in the right DLPFC and ACC in a high cooperation context showed greater activity than in a low cooperation context.

5|$|In World War II, {{the bomber}} mafia's {{theory of the}} primacy of unescorted {{daylight}} strategic bombing was proved wrong. Fleets of heavy bombers {{were not able to}} achieve victory without <b>the</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>of</b> the Army and Navy, and required the protection of long-range fighters for deep penetration missions. Overall casualties in the war were not minimal, and victory did not come significantly quicker. Precision in bombing was not achieved until long-range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved, as opponents had warned. The strategic bombing concept, however, was {{a major factor in the}} eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. Its proponents continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age, forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear warfare. The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare.|$|E
