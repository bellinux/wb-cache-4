25|$|He pitched {{for several}} other minor league teams, his hopes {{of making it}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> still alive, but the Army derailed this. After serving {{two years in the}} military, he tried to return to baseball. Though {{hindered}} by an injury to his throwing arm, Pride played three games for the Missoula Timberjacks of the Pioneer League (a farm club of the Cincinnati Reds) in 1960, and had tryouts with the California Angels (1961) and the New York Mets (1962) organizations, but was not picked up by either team.|$|E
25|$|Mack's {{last three}} {{seasons in the}} National League were as a player-manager with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1894 to 1896, with a 149–134 (.527) record. Fired on September 21, 1896, he retired as a {{full-time}} player and accepted a deal from Henry Killilea to act as manager and occasional backup catcher for the minor league Milwaukee Brewers. He agreed to a salary of $3,000 and 25% of the club. He managed the Brewers for four seasons from 1897 to 1900, their best year coming in 1900, when they finished second.

500|$|By April 1925, he was {{starting}} to show promise as a hitter with the Reading Keystones of the International League. Because of his [...]311 batting average and 124 runs batted in, the Chicago White Sox exercised their option they had with Reading, paying $6,000 ($ today) for him, and moved Berg up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> the following year.|$|E

500|$|Drafted in the 19th {{round of}} the 2006 draft by the Minnesota Twins, the 576th player overall, he skipped his senior year of college to begin his pro career. Valencia was {{disappointed}} in his draft position, but said: [...] "realistically, it does not change things for me.

500|$|As a youth, he {{attended}} a five-day baseball fundamentals camp that his father runs for children ages 5–14. [...] His father was also his little league coach until he was 14. [...] His father said: [...] People would say Ike was good because his dad was a player. [...] But it's not that easy.... I can tell Ike how to swing, I can teach him to pitch, [...] the game of baseball, but he's {{the only one to}} make it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues.</b> You can't teach heart and soul. That's what it takes to play in the game.|$|E
500|$|In August 1945, on the {{recommendation}} of Buffalo manager Bucky Harris, the Tigers called him back up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues.</b> [...] With the Tigers were competing for the American League pennant, Oana appeared in three games, one as a starter. [...] Oana compiled a 1.59 ERA in 11 innings for the 1945 Tigers team that won the pennant and the 1945 World Series.

500|$|Despite {{his desire}} {{to go back to}} Japan, Berg {{reported}} to the Senators training camp on February 26, 1933 in Biloxi. He played in just 40 games during the season, and batted only [...]185. The Senators won the pennant, but lost to the Giants in the World Series. Cliff Bolton, the Senators' starting catcher in 1933, demanded more money in 1934. When the Senators refused to pay him more, he sat out and Berg got the starting job. On April 22, Berg made an error, his first fielding mistake since 1932an American League record of 117 consecutive errorless games. On July 25, the Senators gave Berg his unconditional release. He soon returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues,</b> however, after Cleveland Indians catcher Glenn Myatt broke his ankle on August 1. Indians manager Walter Johnson, who had managed Berg in 1932, offered Berg the reserve catching job. Berg played sporadically until Frankie Pytlak, Cleveland's starting catcher, injured himself, and Berg became the starting catcher.|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{stressed}} [...] "patience" [...] {{to begin}} the 1988 season, saying, [...] "We can't just go from the bottom to the top in the snap of a finger... Have patience and stick with the Birds and root for the Birds." [...] After the Orioles lost six consecutive games {{to begin the}} 1988 season, Ripken was fired. Several years later, he said, [...] "It {{was very difficult to}} accept. I had been in the organization. I had worked my way up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues.</b> I spent my life with the Orioles." [...] The move [...] "hurt" [...] and [...] "bothered" [...] Cal Jr., but he worked through it and remained with the team for 13 more seasons, the rest of his career. Billy switched his number from 3 to 7, saying, [...] "I just didn't want to see anybody else wear it." [...] After Hall of Famer Frank Robinson replaced Ripken, the Orioles proceeded to lose 15 more consecutive games to set the record for the longest losing streak to start a season. He finished his managerial record with a record of 68 wins and 101 losses.|$|E
500|$|Feller {{joined the}} Indians {{and made his}} Major League debut on July 19, 1936 in a relief {{appearance}} against the Washington Senators. A month later on August 23, Feller made his first career start against the St. Louis Browns. Indians manager Steve O'Neill had Denny Galehouse warmed up in the bullpen in case the 17-year-old Feller had early troubles, but he struck out all three batters he faced in the first inning, and recorded 15 strikeouts in earning his first career win. His strikeout total was the highest for a (starting) pitching debut. Two weeks later, he struck out 17 batters, tying a single-game strikeout record previously set by Dizzy Dean, in a win over the Philadelphia Athletics. He finished {{the season with a}} 5–3 record, having appeared in 14 games; he had 47 walks and 76 strikeouts in 62 innings. Feller's fame reached such a level that when he returned to Van Meter for his senior year of high school, the governor of Iowa greeted him. His record-setting rookie year made him, according to baseball writer Richard Goldstein, [...] "the best-known young person in America, {{with the possible exception of}} Shirley Temple." [...] Feller's entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> was later described: ...|$|E

500|$|Ross began 2003 {{with the}} AAA Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. On July 4, {{he was called}} up by the Tigers. He made his Major League debut that day, going hitless in two at bats before exiting after getting hit by a pitch in the sixth inning as the Tigers lost 9–8 to the Kansas City Royals. He got his first hit on July 9, an RBI single against Bartolo Colón in a 4–2 victory over the Chicago White Sox. After he had one hit in four games, he was optioned back to Toledo on July 16 {{to make room for}} Danny Patterson, who was {{returning}} from the disabled list. From July 27 to 29, and again from August 17 to 18, Ross homered in three consecutive games for the Mud Hens.

He was recalled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues</b> in September when rosters expanded. On September 2, he hit a grand slam off Cliff Lee for his first Major League home run in an 8–6 victory over the Cleveland Indians, becoming the first Tiger since Milt Cuyler in 1991 to hit a grand slam for his first home run. In that same game, he tore his ACL running to first base, which required season-ending surgery. In six games with the Tigers, Ross had four hits in 19 at bats, including five RBI. Ross was named the Tigers' Minor League Player of the Year, and he was named to Baseball America's postseason All-Star team. For the final time, he was rated as having the best outfield arm in the Detroit organization.|$|E

2500|$|Born in Akron, Alabama, Stephenson {{originally}} {{played baseball}} and football at the University of Alabama {{before he started}} his professional baseball career. A natural athlete who excelled in both sports, Stephenson had a good reputation at the university. Former University of Alabama president George H. Denny described Riggs as [...] "the embodiment of cleanliness, manliness, and courage." [...] He was an All-Southern fullback in 1919 and 1920. He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team. Stephenson sustained a shoulder injury in a football game in 1920 when he dropped back and was tackled {{by a pair of}} linebackers. His injury to his right shoulder was so bad that he had to end his football career as a quarterback, and as a result it greatly affected his throwing abilities. His throwing problems made it difficult for him to turn double plays, but his hitting compensated for those fielding woes. Stephenson quit school at Alabama and immediately made the jump to professional baseball, where he signed with the defending World Series champions Cleveland Indians at the age of 23.. Riggs was {{one of those guys who}} went straight from college <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>leagues.</b>|$|E
