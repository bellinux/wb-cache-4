40|$|We propose an HMM Trajectory Tiling (HTT) {{approach}} to high quality TTS, {{which is our}} entry to Blizzard Challenge 2010. In HTT, first refined HMM is trained with the Minimum Generation Error (MGE) criterion; then trajectory generated by the refined HMM is to guide the search for finding the closest waveform segment “tiles ” in synthesis. Normalized distances between HMM trajectory {{and those of the}} waveform unit candidates are used for selecting final candidates in a unit sausage (lattice). Normalized cross-correlation, a good concatenation measure for its high relevance to spectral similarity, phase continuity and concatenation time instants, is used for finding the best unit sequence in the sausage. The sequence serves as the best segment tiles to closely follow the HMM <b>trajectory</b> <b>guide.</b> Tested in four tasks, {EH 1, EH 2, MH 1 and MH 2 }, of Blizzard Challenge 2010, the new HTT approach delivers high quality, natural sounding TTS speech without sacrificing high intelligibility.

40|$|Object: {{stereotactic}} biopsy is a {{safe and}} effective technique for the diagnosis of brain tumors. The use of intraoperative neuropathological examination has been routinely advocated to increase diagnostic yield, but the procedure lengthens surgical time, may produce false-negative and -positive results, and current biopsy techniques have a very low nondiagnostic rate. Therefore, the authors questioned the need for intraoperative histological evaluation. Methods: the authors prospectively studied all patients undergoing image-guided biopsy {{under the care of}} a single surgeon (P. L. G.) between July 2005 and October 2007. A Stryker neuronavigation system with a <b>trajectory</b> <b>guide</b> was used to plan a single trajectory, and, using a side-cutting biopsy cannula, multiple biopsy samples were taken from between 1 and 4 sites within the tumor. Tissue was inspected macroscopically by the surgeon and was only submitted for neuropathological assessment postoperatively. Results: one hundred thirty-four biopsies were performed during the study. A positive diagnosis was established in 133 cases (99. 3 %). One biopsy was negative (0. 7 %) and postoperative imaging (performed because the tissue was macroscopically normal) demonstrated inaccurate targeting of the lesion. Significant complications were seen in 3 patients (2. 2 %) who all had preoperative WHO performance scores of III or IV. Two patients suffered delayed deterioration and died due to probable surgical complications—one with thalamic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and one with gliomatosis cerebri. One patient with GBM suffered an intracerebral hematoma that was managed conservatively. Postoperative seizures were seen in 4 patients (3 %), and 2 patients (1. 5 %) experienced a transient neurological deficit. Histological diagnosis showed a GBM in 64 cases, Grade III glioma in 19, Grade I or II in 23, metastasis in 10, lymphoma in 13, and other disease in 4. There were 32 patients discharged to home on the same day as surgery. Compared with the authors' previous retrospective audit into 127 biopsies, this technique showed improved diagnostic yield (99. 3 vs 94. 5 %, p = 0. 032) with fewer complications (2. 2 vs 4. 7 % [not statistically significant]). Conclusions: this technique of image-guided biopsy has high diagnostic yield with acceptably low morbidity and may be performed as a day case. Intraoperative neuropathological examination would not have increased the diagnostic yield further in this study, and its routine use may not be necessary. In the authors' department £ 70, 350 (UK) /$ 114, 522 (US) would have been saved by not using intraoperative neuropathology in this series. Therefore, intraoperative neuropathology should no longer be routinely recommende...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new {{numerical}} {{implementation and}} {{a test of}} the modified variational multiconfigurational Gaussian (vMCG) equations are presented. In vMCG, the wave function is represented as a superposition of <b>trajectory</b> <b>guided</b> Gaussian coherent states, and the time derivatives of the wave function parameters are found from a system of linear equations, which in turn follows from the variational principle applied simultaneously to all wave function parameters. In the original formulation of vMCG, the corresponding matrix was not well-behaved and needed regularization, which required matrix inversion. The new implementation of the modified vMCG equations seems to have improved the method, which now enables straightforward solution of the linear system without matrix inversion, thus achieving greater efficiency, stability and robustness. Here the new version of the vMCG approach is tested against a number of benchmarks, which previously have been studied by split-operator, multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) and multilayer MCTDH (ML-MCTDH) techniques. The accuracy and efficiency of the new implementation of vMCG is directly compared with the method of coupled coherent states (CCS), another technique that uses <b>trajectory</b> <b>guided</b> grids.

The tunneling probability of multidimensional barrier systems is still well reproduced by using the complex semiclassical method even in the chaotic tunneling regime, in which a characteristic tunneling phenomenon, i. e. the fringed tunneling, is observed.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a method allowing a quadro-copter with a rigidly attached racket {{to hit a}} ball towards a target. An algorithm is developed to generate an open loop <b>trajectory</b> <b>guiding</b> the vehicle to a predicted impact point – the prediction is done by integrating forward the current position and velocity estimates from a Kalman filter. By examining the ball and vehicle trajectories before and after impact, the system estimates the ball’s drag coefficient, the racket’s coefficient of restitution and an aiming bias. These estimates are then fed back into the system’s aiming algorithm to improve future performance. The algorithms are implemented for three different experiments: a single quadrocopter returning balls thrown by a human; two quadrocopters co-operatively juggling a ball back-and-forth; and a single quadrocopter attempting to juggle a ball on its own.

Our conceptual background is based on the theoretical analysis of innovation put forward by evolutionary thinking. We provide an interpretation of clean technology in terms of <b>trajectories</b> <b>guided</b> by environmental innovations within the boundaries of particular paradigms.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of grassroots social movements variously preoccupied {{with a range}} of external threats, such as diminishing supplies of fossil energy or climate change, has led to increased interest in the production of local food. Drawing upon the notion of cognitive praxis, this article utilises transition as a <b>trajectory</b> <b>guided</b> by an overarching cosmology that brings together a broad social movement seeking a more resilient future. This ‘grand narrative’ is reinforced by ‘transition movement intellectuals’ who serve to shape an agenda of local preparedness in the face of uncertainty, rather than structural analysis of the global system. In this context, growing and producing food offers important multi-functional synergies by reconnecting people to place and its ecological endowments and serves to provide a vital element in civic mobilisation. Yet, local food could also become a means to build international solidarity in defence of food sovereignty and establish a global coalition opposed to the corporate agri-food agenda of biotechnologies, land grabbing and nutritional impoverishment...|$|R
40|$|Self-interference {{embodies the}} essence of the particle-wave {{interpretation}} of quantum mechanics (QM). According to the Copenhagen particle-wave interpretation of QM, self-interference by a double slit requires a large transverse coherence of the incident wavepacket such that it covers the separation between the slits. Bohmian dynamics provides a first step in the separation of the particle-wave character of particles by introducing deterministic <b>trajectories</b> <b>guided</b> by a pilot wave that follows the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. In this work, I present a theory for quantum dynamics that incorporates all quantum (wave) effects into the geometry of the underlying phase space. This geometrical formulation of QM is consistent with quantum measurements and provides an alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of deterministic trajectories. In particular, it removes the need for the concept of wavefunction collapse (of the Copenhagen interpretation) to explain the emergence of the classical world. All three QM formulations (Schrödinger, Bohmian, and geometrical) are applied to the description of the scattering of a free electron by a hydrogen atom and a double slit...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMultiped {{locomotion}} in cluttered environments {{is addressed}} {{as the problem}} of planning acyclic sequences of contacts, that characterize the motion. In order to overcome the inherent combinatorial difficulty of the problem, we separate it in two subproblems: first, planning a <b>guide</b> <b>trajectory</b> for {{the root of the}} robot and then, generating relevant contacts along this trajectory. This paper proposes theoretical contributions to these two subproblems. We propose a theoretical characterization of the <b>guide</b> <b>trajectory,</b> named " true feasibility ", which guarantee that a guide can be mapped into the contact manifold of the robot. As opposed to previous approaches, this property makes it possible to assert the relevance of a <b>guide</b> <b>trajectory</b> without explicitly computing contact configurations. This property can be efficiently checked by a sample-based planner (e. g. we implemented a visibility PRM). Since the <b>guide</b> <b>trajectories</b> that we characterized are easily mapped to a valid sequence of contacts, we then focused on how to select a particular sequence with desirable properties, such as robustness, efficiency and naturalness, only considered for cyclic locomotion so far. Based on these novel theoretical developments, we implemented a complete acyclic contact planner and demonstrate its efficiency by producing a large variety of movements with three very different robots (humanoid, insectoid, dexterous hand) in five challenging scenarios. The planner is very efficient in quality of the produced movements and in computation time: given a computed RB-PRM, a legged figure or a dexterous hand can generate its motion in real time. This result outperforms any previous acyclic contact planner...|$|R

Further, the printed images of Alq 3 film on the OLED substrate were different from the patterns of removed Alq 3 film. Atomic force microscope images indicated that not only direct transfer but also deposition by sublimated vapor of Alq 3 contributed to the pattern formation.

40|$|Abstract. Robots {{can improve}} the {{accuracy}} of image-guided needle placement over traditional free-hand techniques. While many research groups have demonstrated this, widespread clinical adoption of needle placement robots has not immediately followed, because 1) Robots are generally expensive and 2) they are difficult to calibrate and register to the patient in a manner fast and user-friendly enough to be practical in the operating room. Our solution to these considerations is a novel, clinically applicable, low-cost system consisting of a robot (manipulating the needle through a surgeon specified <b>trajectory),</b> <b>guided</b> by tracked freehand 3 Dimensional Ultrasound (3 DUS). We address cost by algorithmically enabling the robot to be unencoded, uncalibrated, and mechanically simple. We address ease of use by eliminating preoperative registration, and nearly eliminating calibration. The surgical tool is tracked and thereby registered imager intra-operatively. A structured 3 DUS volume, created using a tracked conventional 2 DUS probe, provides the basis for accurate and reliable volumetric visualization, simulation, and planning. The system components are integrated using a 3 D Slicer-based software package.

40|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of the metabolic information provided by positron emission tomography (PET) in cases of brain tumour, we have developed a technique to integrate PET images routinely in the planning of stereotactic brain biopsy. We used stereotactic PET with [F- 18]-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-FDG) in 38 patients undergoing brain biopsy. To evaluate the contribution of PET-FDG in guiding brain biopsy, we analyzed the diagnosis provided by the 78 stereotactic trajectories obtained in these patients. We found that stereotactic PET-FDG seemed to provide more information in cases of anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas than in low-grade gliomas. Our results also show that biopsy trajectories performed in areas where increased FDG uptake is found within the lesion boundaries always provide interpretable specimens; this was not the case for <b>trajectories</b> <b>guided</b> by CT only. Therefore, the routine integration PET-FDG in the planning of stereotactic brain biopsy may lead to a reduction in sampling. Recently, we also tested consecutive stereotactic PET with [C- 11]-labelled methionine (PET-Met) and PET-FDG. This technique allowed us to compare accurately the tumoural glucose metabolism and protein synthesis. Our results suggest that stereotactic PET may increase the diagnostic yield of brain biopsy and may improve the understanding of PET in neuro-oncology...|$|R

Specifically, in this interferometer, the atom simply passes through a single-zone optical beam, consisting {{of a pair of}} bichromatic counter-propagating beams that cause optically off-resonant Raman excitations.

Measurements were carried out both in the vent opening itself and in the greenhouse {{at the height of the}} ventilator. Wind blowing parallel to the greenhouse ridge gave rise to an inflow at the leeward part of the ventilator. The influx then follows a spiral <b>trajectory</b> <b>guided</b> by the internal surface of the walls and the shape of the roof before exiting at the upwind end. A large portion of the greenhouse situated between the centre and the upwind wall is ventilated less efficiently than the remainder of the greenhouse creating a large volume of higher temperature air that extends between the centre of the greenhouse and the windward wall. It is shown that the mean and turbulent components of the sensible heat flux through the vent amount to 58 % and 42 % of the total exchange between the greenhouse and its environment. Comparison with previous measurements demonstrates a large dependence of the wind-driven ventilation efficiency on wind speed. This confirms that other ventilation mechanisms, such as the stack effect, become important when the wind speed is low. These measurements are in a very good accord with flow patterns simulated by computational fluid dynamics techniques. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|In {{an atomic}} interferometer, the phase shift due to {{rotation}} {{is proportional to}} the area enclosed by the split components of the atom. However, this model is unclear for an atomic interferometer demonstrated recently by Shahriar et al., for which the atom simply passes through a single-zone optical beam, consisting of a pair of bichromatic counter-propagating beams. During the passage, the atomic wave packets in two distinct internal states couple to each other continuously. The two internal states trace out a complicated <b>trajectory,</b> <b>guided</b> by the optical beams, with the amplitude and spread of each wavepacket varying continuously. Yet, {{at the end of the}} single-zone excitation, there is an interference with fringe amplitudes that can reach a visibility close to unity. For such a situation, it is not clear how one would define the area of the interferometer, and therefore, what the rotation sensitivity of such an interferometer would be. In this paper we analyze this interferometer in order to determine its rotation sensitivity, and thereby determine its effective area. In many ways, the continuous interferometer (CI) can be thought of as a limiting version of the Borde-Chu Interferometer (BCI). We identify a quality factor that can be used to compare the performance of these interferometers. Under conditions of practical interest, we show that the rotation sensitivity of the CI can be comparable to that of the BCI. The relative simplicity of the CI (e. g., elimination of the task of precise angular alignment of the three zones) then makes it a potentially better candidate for practical atom interferometry for rotation sensing.
