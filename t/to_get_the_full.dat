[...] Gower went on to describe the process involved with creating the Children, [...] "The Children of the Forest are fully covered from head to toe, they're glued completely into these prosthetics all over their body."

After the film had been completed Flamant, who could barely drive, took Marèse for a drive, crashed the car and she was killed.

[...] Arnold rechristened the schooner [...] [...] The prisoners had {{reported that the}} lone British warship on Lake Champlain was at Fort Saint-Jean, on the Richelieu River north of the lake. [...] Arnold, uncertain whether word of Ticonderoga's capture had reached Saint-Jean, decided to attempt a raid to capture the ship.

[...] Allen, not wanting Arnold <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> glory for that capture, followed {{with some of his}} men in bateaux, but Arnold's small fleet had the advantage of sail, and pulled away from Allen's boats.

[...] The scout returned later that day, reporting that the British were aware of the fall of Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and that troops were apparently on the move toward Saint-Jean.

Becky Cunningham of GamesRadar {{was fascinated by the}} game's setting and the questions it posed about morality and memory, finding the story worth experiencing. Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for GameSpot, generally enjoyed the story despite noting the main plot becoming complicated quickly, but stated that the ending introduced too many new story elements for comfort. Michael Damiani of GameTrailers found the overall story enjoyable, but gaps in story and character development, along with the need to replay the game <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> story, [...] " [...] you full of questions and doubt from beginning to end." [...] Eurogamer's Chris Schilling was similarly critical of the need to understand terms unfamiliar to series newcomers. He also disliked the length of cutscenes, and the jarring change from grim imagery to lighter subjects like chocobo breeding. Tom Sykes of Official Xbox Magazine said that the setting and story's superficial similarities to the later Harry Potter books improved the story after the confusing opening. Game Informers Matt Miller stated that the story started strongly, but was made less enjoyable when it began focusing on the game's overarching narrative and said the abundance of characters had a negative impact on their characterization. RPGFan's Stephen Meyerink, despite saying the game had [...] "goofy faces and silly moments", found the story and themes engaging. Samuel Roberts of PC Gamer was less positive, feeling that the story and characters reminded him too much of poor-quality anime series.|$|E

2500|$|Due to delays {{during the}} {{refitting}} and later {{problems with the}} steam heating system, the first voyage of SuomenJoutsen was delayed until late December. Captain Arvo Lieto proposed postponing the departure until the next autumn as Christmas was drawing near and the sea was already freezing, but on 21 December 1931 President P. E. Svinhufvud ordered the ship to begin her first international school sailing under the Finnish flag. SuomenJoutsen was towed to the sea on the following day, {{but she had to}} wait for favourable winds outside Porkkala until 28 December, at which point she had already been grounded once. The streak of bad luck continued when the ship was anchored in Trongisvágsfjørður in Suðuroy, Faroe Islands, after stopping to purchase more lubrication oil at Trongisvágur. SuomenJoutsen dragged her anchors in a storm measuring 11–12 on the Beaufort scale, drifting stern first towards the shore. After two trawlers and a tugboat managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> rigged ship safely to the harbour, it was found out that the rudder had been damaged and the ship was towed to England for drydocking. After repairs, SuomenJoutsen continued to the Canary Islands, where she remained for three weeks while Captain Lieto was relieved of command and replaced by John Konkola, who served as the captain of the school ship for six full and two partial voyages. From the Canary Islands, SuomenJoutsen headed south, but the refrigeration system failed [...] before the Equator and she had to turn back before a line-crossing ceremony could be held. However, the crew got some consolation when news about the end of prohibition in Finland reached the ship while she was sailing towards Finland in the Baltic Sea. SuomenJoutsen arrived in Finland on 22 May 1932 and was drydocked at Suomenlinna shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|These draft {{notes are}} from a {{graduate}} course given by the author in Berkeley during the spring semester of 2005. They cover the basic ideas of a new, geometric approach to geometric measure theory. They begin with a new theory of exterior calculus at a single point. This infinitesimal theory extends, by linearity, to a discrete exterior theory, based at finitely many points. A general theory of calculus culminates by taking limits in Banach spaces, and is valid for domains called ``chainlets'' which are defined to be elements of the Banach spaces. Chainlets include manifolds, rough domains (e. g., fractals), soap films, foliations, and Euclidean space. Most {{of the work is}} {{at the level of the}} infinitesimal calculus, at a single point. The number of limits needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> theory is minimal. Tangent spaces are not used in these notes, although they can be defined within the theory. This new approach is made possible by giving the Grassmann algebra more geometric structure. As a result, much of geometric measure theory is simplified. Geometry is restored and significant results from the classical theory are expanded. Applications include existence of solutions to a problem of Plateau, an optimal Gauss-Green theorem and new models for Maxwell's equations. Comment: 153 page, 7 figure...|$|R
