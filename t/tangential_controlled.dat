After {{a description of the}} numerical method, several optimisation strategies are presented, aiming at identifying vortex systems providing drag reduction or special topology of the flow. On the one hand, strategies as simple as cylinder rotation or bidimensional stationary profiles of velocity are considered. On the other hand, an outlook of full 3 D <b>tangential</b> <b>controls</b> is presented, which may be mixed or not with the simple strategies above...|$|R

We argue that strategies that control viewpoint on the tangent plane of automatically-selected points projecting to the occluding contour can be very useful for local, global, qualitative, as well as quantitative shape recovery. This paper studies the design and implementation of an uncalibrated hand-eye system for <b>tangential</b> viewpoint <b>control.</b> We show that <b>tangential</b> viewpoint <b>control</b> can be accurately performed in real time using an uncalibrated camera to control a robot manipulator with at least three degrees of freedom. The only requirement is that at least four points can be identified on the robot’s end-effector and can be tracked across frames. ...|$|R

The proposed controller allows the achievement of the decoupling of the normal force and <b>tangential</b> velocity <b>control</b> loops and can be expressed as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) time-varying proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method...|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} numerical computations of {{flow control}} within an aggressive serpentine inlet duct (L/D = 1. 5) at a Mach number of M = 0. 45 are presented. Two flow configurations including baseline flow (no flow control) and active flow <b>control</b> via steady, <b>tangential</b> <b>control</b> jet are considered. A stabilized {{finite element method}} is employed to perform turbulence simulations 16 using two variants of the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model; the original S-A one-equation model 29 in an unsteady Reynold-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation (URANSS) and a hybrid S-A model 30 in a Detached eddy simulation (DES). Furthermore, computations are performed using adaptive meshing techniques developed for unstructured grids including boundary layer elements 24 to make such flow simulations practically feasible and efficient. Numerical results using two turbulence models are compared with experimental measurements 33 of static and total pressure for the baseline flow whereas numerical results based on URANSS and DES are compared {{in the case of}} flow control. Results obtained from URANSS using the original S-A model fail to predict key aspects of this complex flow with adverse pressure gradient and flow separation, whereas DES substantially improves the prediction...|$|R

40|$|The {{trajectory}} {{and reach}} of jets issuing from <b>tangential</b> <b>control</b> ports at {{the periphery of}} a vortex amplifier’s swirl chamber depend largely on design geometry, size and pressures applied. Excessive control port pressure causes these jets to extend too far {{across the face of}} the radial supply ports, to impact on the opposing supply port wall whereupon, they bifurcate to create back diffusion of control port flow along the supply port channels. Flow through vortex amplifier geometry is simulated using a baseline Reynolds stress turbulence model with CFX automatic wall treatment. Anisotropic stress and vortex stretching in the swirl chamber and outlet have not prevented convergence (based on normalised vortex amplifier residuals). Known flow structures are reproduced. This paper is focussed on simulation close to pressures needed for bifurcation. Just before the point on an operating characteristic at which bifurcated tangential flow appears, the recirculation zone crossing most of the radial supply stretches to intermittently cut off the radial flow. The steady state results indicate asymmetry between the four ports, as smoke visualisation tests also imply. The transient results are sufficient to demonstrate time-dependent structures and suggest periodicity of flow structures. The model can be used to inform design and operability studies. Moreover, a curious near-wall structure of spinning flow not previously reported has been predicted close to the axis and hugging the swirl chamber wall opposite the outlet, at radii within the forced part of the Rankine vortex...|$|R
40|$|Given an Euler-Lagrange {{system and}} a convex polytope in its output space, we design a {{switched}} feedback controller that drives the output to the polytope. On the polytope, the system output tracks assigned trajectories or follows assigned paths. The study of this problem is motivated by industrial applications such as robotic painting, welding and three dimensional printing. Many engineering systems, such as robotic manipulators, can be modelled with Euler-Lagrange equations, and many engineered surfaces, designed using software, are naturally modelled as convex polytopes. We use feedback linearization to decompose the design problem into two subproblems; stabilizing the polytope surface, and controlling its motion along the surface. The first subproblem, known as {{the design of the}} transversal controller, leverages the fact that a polytope can be represented as a finite union of facets. The controller determines the closest facet to the system output and stabilizes that facet by stabilizing its corresponding hyperplane via feedback linearization. The transversal dynamics can be stabilized using linear controllers. At the boundary of a facet, we propose a switching law that ensures weak invariance of the polytope for the closed-loop system. The second subproblem, known as the design of the tangential controller, enforces desired dynamics while the system output is restricted to the polytope. We investigate control specifications such as following a predefined path on the surface and tracking a trajectory that moves along the surface. The separation of the transversal and <b>tangential</b> <b>control</b> design phases is possible because feedback linearization decouples the transversal and tangential dynamic subsystems. This approach to control design is demonstrated experimentally on a four degree-of freedom robotic manipulator. The experimental implementation is made robust to modelling uncertainty via Lyapunov re-design methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{tests the}} {{following}} hypotheses in multi-digit circular object prehension: {{the principle of}} superposition (i. e., a complex action can be decom-posed into independently controlled sub-actions) and the hierarchical organization (i. e., individual fingers at the lower level are coordinated to generate a desired task-specific outcome of the virtual finger at the higher level). Subjects performed 25 trials while statically holding a circular handle instrumented with five six-component force/moment sensors under seven external torque conditions. We performed a principal compo-nent (PC) analysis on forces and moments of the thumb and virtual finger (VF: an imagined finger pro-ducing the same mechanical effects of all finger forces and moments combined) to test {{the applicability of the}} principle of superposition in a circular object prehen-sion. The synergy indices, measuring synergic actions of the individual finger (IF) moments for the stabil-ization of the VF moment, were calculated to test the hierarchical organization. Mixed-effect ANOVAs were used to test the dependent variable differences for different external torque conditions and different fin-gers at the VF and IF levels. The PC analysis showed that the elemental variables were decoupled into two groups: one group related to grasping stability control (normal force control) and the other group associated with rotational equilibrium <b>control</b> (<b>tangential</b> force <b>control),</b> which supports the principle of superposition. The synergy indices were always positive, suggesting error compensations between IF moments for the VF moment stabilization, which confirms the hierarchical organization of multi-digit prehension...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{new set of}} {{relative}} orbit elements (ROEs) is used to derive a new elliptical formation flying model. In-plane and out-of-plane motions can be completely decoupled, which benefits elliptical formation design. The inverse transformation of the state transition matrix is derived to study the relative orbit control strategy. Impulsive feedback control laws are developed for both in-plane and out-of-plane relative motions. Control of in-plane and out-of-plane relative motions can be completely decoupled using the ROE-based feedback <b>control</b> law. A <b>tangential</b> impulsive <b>control</b> method is proposed to study the relationship of fuel consumption and maneuvering positions. An optimal analytical along-track impulsive control strategy is then derived. Different typical orbit maneuvers, including formation establishment, reconfiguration, long-distance maneuvers, and formation keeping, are taken as examples to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} proposed control laws. The effects {{of relative}} measurement errors are also considered to validate the high accuracy of the proposed control method...|$|R
40|$|Pneumatic {{active control}} of {{asymmetric}} vortical flows around a slender pointed forebody is investigated using the three dimensional {{solution for the}} compressible thin-layer Navier-Stokes equation. The computational applications cover the normal and <b>tangential</b> injection <b>control</b> of asymmetric flows around a 5 degree semi-apex angle cone at a 40 degree angle of attack, 1. 4 freestream Mach number and 6 x 10 (exp 6) freestream Reynolds number (based on the cone length). The effective tangential angle range of 67. 5 approaches minus 67. 5 degrees is used for both normal and tangential ports of injection. The effective axial length of injection is varied from 0. 03 to 0. 05. The computational solver uses the implicit, upwind, flux difference splitting finite volume scheme, and the grid consists of 161 x 55 x 65 points in the wrap around, normal and axial directions, respectively. The results show that tangential injection {{is more effective than}} normal injection...|$|R

Emphasis is placed on smoke- and surface oil-flow visualization, force measurements, and velocity and pressure measurements using a 5 -hole probe. It is shown that the tangential blowing significantly alters the flow field downstream of the slot and creates large side forces and yawing moments to very high angles of attack. Effectiveness of the tangential blowing is discussed in terms of jet momentum, blowing location, slot area, and Reynolds number. The concept proved to be efficient at small blowing rates and at high angles of attack...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Isolated {{papillary}} {{muscles and}} enzymatically dissociated myocytes of guinea-pig hearts are routinely used for experimental cardiac research. The aim {{of our study}} is to investigate adult mammalian ventricular slices as an alternative preparation. METHOD: Vibratome cut ventricular slices (350 microm thick) were examined histologically and with 2 -photon microscopy for fibre orientation. Intracellular action potentials were recorded with conventional glass microelectrodes, extracellular potentials were measured with tungsten platinum electrodes and multi-electrode arrays (MEA). RESULTS: Dominant direction of fibre orientation was absent in vertical and horizontal transmural slices, but was longitudinal in <b>tangential</b> slices. <b>Control</b> action potential duration (APD(90), 169. 9 +/- 4 ms) and drug effects on this parameter were similar to papillary muscles. The L-type Ca-channel blocker nifedipine shortened APD(90) with a half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of 4. 5 microM. The I(Kr) blocker E 4031 and neuroleptic drug risperidone prolonged APD(90) with EC(50) values of 31 nM and 0. 67 microM, respectively. Mapping field potentials on multi-electrode arrays showed uniform spread of excitation with a mean conduction velocity of 0. 47 m s(- 1).

40|$|SummaryEvolution of the {{mammalian}} brain encompassed {{a remarkable}} increase in {{size of the}} cerebral cortex, which includes tangential and radial expansion. However, the mechanisms underlying these key features are still largely unknown. Here, we identified the DNA-associated protein Trnp 1 as a regulator of cerebral cortex expansion {{in both of these}} dimensions. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo demonstrate that high Trnp 1 levels promote neural stem cell self-renewal and tangential expansion. In contrast, lower levels promote radial expansion, with a potent increase of the number of intermediate progenitors and basal radial glial cells leading to folding of the otherwise smooth murine cerebral cortex. Remarkably, TRNP 1 expression levels exhibit regional differences in the cerebral cortex of human fetuses, anticipating radial or tangential expansion. Thus, the dynamic regulation of Trnp 1 is critical to <b>control</b> <b>tangential</b> and radial expansion of the cerebral cortex in mammals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} friction in gear pairs by using tribometer that provides diskon-disk contact. When gear teeth mesh, there {{is a combination of}} sliding friction and rolling friction, and in that, the values of sliding and rolling velocity are changed, as well as contact pressure. For the simulation of changes of velocities disk of various diameters with <b>controlled</b> <b>tangential</b> velocities are applied, and this enables a broad range of combinations of sliding velocity and rolling velocity. High and variable values of contact pressures that appear in real gear pairs are realized by the combination of variable values of normal load and dimensions (diameter and width) of the disks. Friction coefficient is used as the indicator of friction magnitude. By knowing the changes of contact conditions and friction coefficient during the meshing of one pair of gear teeth it is possible to determine total gear pair power losses. Diskon-disk contact provides the most realistic simulation of gear teeth meshing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, new finite {{difference}} methods {{based on}} the augmented immersed interface method (IIM) are proposed for simulating an inextensiblemoving interface in an incompressible two-dimensional flow. The mathematical models arise from studying the deformation of red blood cells in mathematical biology. The governing equations are incompressible Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations with an unknown surface tension, which should be determined {{in such a way}} that thesurfacedivergence of the velocity is zero along the interface. Thus, the area enclosed by the interface and the total length of the interface should be conserved during the evolution process. Because of the nonlinear and coupling nature of the problem, direct discretization by applying the immersed boundary or immersed interface method yieldscomplexnonlinear systems to be solved. In our new methods, we treat the unknown surface tension as an augmented variable so that the augmented IIM can be applied. Since finding the unknown surface tension is essentially an inverse problem that is sensitive to perturbations, our regularization strategy is to introduce a <b>controlled</b> <b>tangential</b> force along the interface, which leads to a least squares problem.

40|$|We refine {{and advance}} {{a notion of}} {{parallel}} composition to achieve {{for the first time}} a stability proof and empirical demonstration of a steady-state gait on a highly coupled 3 DOF legged platform controlled by two simple (decoupled) feedback laws that provably stabilize in isolation two simple 1 DOF mechanical subsystems. Specifically, we stabilize a limit cycle on a tailed monoped to excite sustained sagittal plane translational hopping energized by tail-pumping during stance. The constituent subsystems for which the controllers are nominally designed are: (i) a purely vertical bouncing mass (controlled by injecting energy into its springy shaft); and (ii) a purely <b>tangential</b> rimless wheel (<b>controlled</b> by adjusting the inter-spoke stepping angle). We introduce the use of averaging methods in legged locomotion to prove that this “parallel composition” of independent 1 DOF controllers achieves an asymptotically stable closed-loop hybrid limit cycle for a dynamical system that approximates the 3 DOF stance mechanics of our physical tailed monoped. We present experimental data demonstrating stability and close agreement between the motion of the physical hopping machine and numerical simulations of the (mathematically tractable) approximating model.

40|$|Metal {{deposition}} is an {{additive manufacturing}} technique with many similarities to multilayer laser welding. Volvo Aero {{is interested in}} using the method in a future rocket exhaust nozzle structure. It is then important to understand what type of material characteristics the process produces and how this will influence the mechanical response of the structure.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using forebody <b>tangential</b> blowing to <b>control</b> the roll-yaw motion of a {{wind tunnel model}} is experimentally demonstrated. An unsteady model of the aerodynamics is developed based on the fundamental physics of the flow. Data from dynamic experiments is used to validate the aerodynamic model. A unique apparatus is designed and built that allows the wind tunnel model two degrees of freedom, roll and yaw. Dynamic experiments conducted at 45 degrees angle of attack reveal the system to be unstable. The natural motion is divergent. The aerodynamic model is incorporated into the equations of motion {{of the system and}} used for the design of closed loop control laws that make the system stable. These laws are proven through dynamic experiments in the wind tunnel using blowing as the only actuator. It is shown that asymmetric blowing is a highly non-linear effector that can be linearized by superimposing symmetric blowing. The effects of forebody tangential blowing and roll and yaw angles on the flow structure are determined through flow visualization experiments. The transient response of roll and yaw moments to a step input blowing are determined. Differences on the roll and yaw moment dependence on blowing are explained based on the physics of the phenomena...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA better {{understanding}} of the hygro-mechanical behaviour of poplar wood (Populus alba L.) is proposed by means of restrained swelling tests. Small clear specimens were tested along their <b>tangential</b> direction in <b>controlled</b> climatic conditions; a dry climate (30 % relative humidity and 30 °C temperature) and a humid one (80 % relative humidity and 30 °C temperature) were cyclically set and kept constant each during 7 days. In these conditions, three matched specimens were tested at the same time along the tangential direction: specimen A free to shrink and swell, specimen B free to shrink and prevented from swelling beyond its initial dimension, specimen C prevented from shrinking and swelling. A specific device was set up to monitor strain and/or stress on each specimen. During the adsorption phase, compression forces (on specimens B and C) were measured, and during the desorption step, compression set shrinkage (compression strain at zero load) and tension stress (on specimens B and C, respectively) were measured. In this paper, the dedicated experimental device is presented and a deep analysis of experimental curves is then proposed by means of a rheological approach. By the analysis, some basic data are obtained (swelling coefficient, swelling pressure and compression set shrinkage), and a complex behaviour of wood made of reversible and irreversible phenomena is characterized...|$|R
40|$|Pyramidal neurons of the {{mammalian}} {{cerebral cortex}} are {{generated in the}} ventricular zone of the pallium whereas the subpallium provides the cortex with inhibitory interneurons. The marginal zone contains a subpial stream of migratory interneurons and two different classes of transient neurons, the pioneer neurons provided with corticofugal axons, and the reelin-expressing Cajal–Retzius cells. We found in cultured slices that the medial ganglionic eminence provides the reelin-negative pioneer neurons of the marginal zone. Pioneer neurons sent long projection axons that went through the cortical plate and reached the subplate and the lateral border of the lateral ganglionic eminence. In the cultured slices, pioneer neurons were functionally mature: they displayed a voltage-gated sodium current, expressed functional α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, and showed γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) postsynaptic events that were modulated by presynaptic AMPA receptors. Pioneer neurons expressed the adhesion molecules L 1 and TAG- 1; the latter {{has been reported to}} <b>control</b> <b>tangential</b> migrations to the neocortex [Denaxa, M., Chan, C. -H., Schachner, M., Parnavelas, J. & Karagogeos, D. (2001) Development (Cambridge, U. K.) 128, 4635 – 4644], and we show here that the pioneer neurons of the marginal zone are the cellular substrate of such a function.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} visual-control {{algorithm}} for driving a mobile robot along the reference trajectory. The configuration of the system consists of a two-wheeled differentially driven mobile robot that is observed by an overhead camera, which can be placed at arbitrary, but reasonable, inclination {{with respect to the}} ground plane. The controller must be capable of generating appropriate <b>tangential</b> and angular <b>control</b> velocities for the trajectory-tracking problem, based on the information received about the robot position obtained in the image. To be able to track the position of the robot through a sequence of images in real-time, the robot is marked with an artificial marker that can be distinguishably recognized by the image recognition subsystem. Using the property of differential flatness, a dynamic feedback compensator can be designed for the system, thereby extending the system into a linear form. The presented control algorithm for reference tracking combines a feedforward and a feedback loop, the structure also known as a two DOF control scheme. The feedforward part should drive the system to the vicinity of the reference trajectory and the feedback part should eliminate any errors that occur due to noise and other disturbances etc. The feedforward control can never achieve accurate reference following, but this deficiency can be eliminated with the introduction of the feedback loop. The design of the model predictive control is based on the linear error model. The model predictive control is given in analytical form, so the computational burden is kept at a reasonable level for real-time implementation. The control algorithm requires that a reference trajectory is at least twice differentiable function. A suitable approach to design such a trajectory is by exploiting some useful properties of the Bernstein-Bézier parametric curves. The simulation experiments as well as real system experiments on a robot normally used in the robot soccer small league prove the applicability of the presented control approach...|$|R

Six microjets were installed in the ground plane in a circular configuration at a radial spacing of 1. 53 nozzle diameters, and an angle of 0 and 300 to <b>tangential.</b> Baseline and <b>control</b> temperature readings at the ground plane and acoustic readings at the sideline angles of 70, 80 and 900 were obtained with the microjets operating at pressures ranging from 200 to 900 psig. Additionally, {{in order to determine}} the fluid-mechanical mechanisms responsible for the control effect on the noise, high-speed images and video were obtained and analyzed. From measurements of the average and fluctuating ground plane temperature measurements, it was found that modifications to the High Temperature Supersonic Jet Facility at Florida State University allowed for measurements of impinging jet characteristics that were congruent with previous studies. Ground plane microjets were found to be effective in reducing feedback tones as a result of the impinging geometry of the jet. They were also effective at reducing the broadband spectral noise for lower temperatures. At temperatures higher than 600 °F, however, an increase in the broadband noise was produced as a result of water microjets. At microjet injection pressures at and above 800 psig, additional noise suppression was achieved for the cold operating condition. From obtained high-speed images and video, it was found that the breakup of the microjet in the shear layer (of the shear variety), and the entrainment of fine mist into the inception of the shear layer was responsible for the reduction in strength and size of large-scale vortical structures. At higher pressures, additional noise suppression is produced as a combined result of the breaking of the feedback loop and the microjet's ability to penetrate to the high-speed side of the shear layer. by Paul Aaron Ragaller.
