The latter was denied by organisers, SYOGOC Chairman Ng Ser Miang saying: [...] "ust look at the faces of the children that are there, the sparkle in their eyes and the smiles on their faces.

However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works.

For the performance, Madonna invited {{a member of the}} audience to join her during the song, and while dancing with them and playfully spanking the guest, she finished the performance giving a banana as a [...] "gift". The first guest during the opening night in Montreal, Quebec, Canada was the song's producer Diplo. The singer turned him around and simulated insertion of the fruit, while saying: [...] "There’s so many <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do with a banana."

As part of its program, NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about Connotations. While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score, Copland said, [...] "It {{seems to me that there}} are two <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do when listening to any new work. The most important thing is to lend yourself—or to put it another way—try to be as sensitive as you can to the overall feeling the new piece gives off. The second way is to listen with some awareness of the general shape of the new piece, realizing that a composer works with his musical materials just as an architect works with his building materials in order to construct an edifice that makes sense." [...] He then discussed the work briefly but in some detail.|$|E

500|$|When {{designing}} the game world, the team initially created a [...] "hybrid city", which producer Dan Houser describes as [...] "a post industrial Midwest slash east coast generic" [...] city. Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design {{on a real}} location meant [...] "you {{have a lot of}} <b>things</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say about it". As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in Grand Theft Auto (1997), basing it loosely on New York City. The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing Brooklyn and Queens, a commercial centre resembling Manhattan, and suburbs similar to New Jersey. The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to [...] "start out feeling poor and work to being richer". Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a [...] "hybrid of a generic American city", including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia. He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously. Sam Houser cited films and shows like Heat (1995) and The Sopranos (1999–2007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game. He also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda series (1986–present) and the film Goodfellas (1990), describing Grand Theft Auto III as [...] "a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG". Dan Houser also cited The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 64 as influences.|$|E

[...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together when we saw it on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if we could bring back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason why {{she did not want to}} conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I was complaining to everyone who was listening. One time I made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened? It saddened Carey that R and hip-hop music was being [...] "bowled over" [...] by dance music, and therefore wanted to remain true to herself by making traditional R music: ...|$|E
