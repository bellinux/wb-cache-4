Results: In line with the predictions, {{there is a difference between}} the behavior and the attendance of Dutch and immigrant parents. Conclusions: There is indeed a significant difference in the attendance of <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> <b>The</b> Dutch <b>parents</b> are often present at the pre-trial detention hearing. Furthermore there is a difference in the behavior, but this doesn‟t mean that there is also a difference in the involvement of <b>the</b> <b>parents.</b> Keywords: youth court, parents, immigrants, involvement, children...|$|R

5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of <b>the</b> <b>parent,</b> not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of <b>the</b> <b>parent.</b> This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E

5|$|There {{is a kind}} of {{continuum}} {{with three}} semi-distinct categories dealing with anthropogenic hybridization: hybridization without introgression, hybridization with widespread introgression (backcrossing with one of <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> species), and hybrid swarms (highly variable populations with much interbreeding as well as backcrossing with <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> species). Depending on where a population falls along this continuum, the management plans for that population will change. Hybridization is currently an area of great discussion within wildlife management and habitat management. Global climate change is creating other changes such as difference in population distributions which are indirect causes for an increase in anthropogenic hybridization.|$|E
5|$|This strong odour can be {{detected}} {{half a mile away}} by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport it some distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result. The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> tree.|$|E
