5|$|In 1779, the Comanches began raiding the Bucareli area, and the {{settlers}} chose to move further {{east to the}} old mission of Nacogdoches, where they founded the town of the same name. The new town quickly became a waystation for contraband. The settlers did not have authorization <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> <b>and</b> no troops were assigned to protect the new location until 1795.|$|E
5|$|P.N.03 was {{developed}} {{on a tight}} schedule {{in an attempt to}} offset Capcom's poor fiscal year. However, the game received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Several critics found the game repetitive and unintuitive. They were divided on its gameplay mechanics: some disliked its controls—specifically the inability <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> shoot simultaneously—while others compared it favorably to golden age arcade games. Mikami repurposed ideas from P.N.03 in his 2010 game Vanquish.|$|E
5|$|The tablebase {{contains}} the game-theoretical value (win, loss, or draw) of each possible move in each possible position, {{and how many}} moves {{it would take to}} achieve that result with perfect play. Thus, the tablebase acts as an oracle, always providing the optimal moves. Typically the database records each possible position with certain pieces remaining on the board, and the best moves with White <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> with Black to move.|$|E

5|$|When bees become {{intoxicated}} from ethanol consumption or poisoned {{with other}} chemicals, their balance is affected, {{and they are}} wobbly when they walk. Charles Abramson's group at Oklahoma State University has put inebriated bees on running wheels, where they exhibit locomotion difficulties. They also put honey bees in shuttle-boxes that used a stimulus to encourage the bees <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> <b>and</b> found that they were less mobile as they became more intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the land}} was {{required}} for housing and a school, Tranmere were forced <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> the name went with them. The present Prenton Park was opened by the Mayor of Birkenhead, Councillor George Proudman, on 9 March 1912. Their first match was played against Lancaster Town in the Lancashire Combination. There were stands (also known as bleachers) {{on both sides of}} the pitch, a paddock and three open terraces, the general format which remained until 1994.|$|E
5|$|Beyond: Two Souls is an {{interactive}} drama action-adventure game, requiring the player <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> guide the character into interactions with objects and other non-player {{characters in the}} scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. At almost any time, however, the player (or second player during a two-player game) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an incorporeal entity, exists permanently in noclip mode and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.|$|E
50|$|The game {{presents}} the player with two {{views of the}} playing area — one from above and one from the side. Using these views, the player selects among six thrusters to fire, controlled by keys on the keyboard: T <b>and</b> B <b>to</b> <b>move</b> up <b>and</b> down, < <b>and</b> > <b>to</b> <b>move</b> left <b>and</b> right, and H <b>and</b> F <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward or backward.|$|R

5|$|Flotilla is a {{three-dimensional}} simultaneous turn-based strategy space combat video game {{set in a}} randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to their ships, which are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion {{over a period of}} 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to their ships, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank move and focus fire. An attack move orders the ships <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, Gale {{received}} {{orders that}} the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division would take Pont Audemer. Convinced {{he was in}} a better position to capture the crossing over the River Risle there, he ordered the Netherlands Infantry Brigade <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> join the 5th Parachute Brigade in taking the town. On 26August the men of the parachute brigade, some mounted on the Cromwell tanks of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, raced towards the bridge from the east while the Dutch headed there from the west. The Dutch brigade arrived first, just minutes after the Germans destroyed the bridge, slightly ahead of the 7th Parachute Battalion. The Dutch brigade moved to secure the heights overlooking the river, while the 5th Parachute Brigade occupied the town.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a {{six degrees of}} freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters in that it allows the player <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, turn on the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or turn on the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas.|$|E

In the Rex, or green, reality, Michael has noticed that Rex has focused a lot on tennis lately, as it was his mother's sport. Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) has been talking with Rex lately about his feelings. In the Hannah, or red, reality, Hannah {{is trying to}} write the late Rex out of their lives, wanting <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> try for another child.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{planners}} {{intended for}} three divisions to attack Taejon from three directions, supported by tanks. The North Korean 3rd Division {{was ordered to}} attack from the north, against the flank. The North Korean 4th Division would attack across the Kum River from the east and south, in order to envelop Taejon and the US 24th Infantry Division with it. Eventually they would also be supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division. Although the North Korean 2nd Infantry Division was ordered to attack from Chongju against the American right flank, it was slow <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> arrived too late {{to participate in the}} battle.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June, Morris {{ordered the}} 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the Papuan Infantry Battalion, as Maroubra Force, to defend Kokoda. The Japanese {{landed in the}} Buna area on 21 July. At this point, B Company of the 39th Infantry Battalion was at Kokoda, with C Company {{advancing}} along the track, departing Illolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> most of it had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was sanguine about this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause the Japanese to withdraw to Buna. Blamey was not so sure, and ordered Major General Arthur Allen's 7th Division to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force.|$|E

5|$|Seven of {{the nine}} {{surviving}} stones are under 90 centimetres (3 feet) tall, {{but two of the}} north-west stones are considerably larger. Located opposite the circle's two shortest stones, one is thin and pointed, reaching 2.1 metres (7 feet) high, while the other is broader, measuring 1.8 metres square (6 feet by 6 feet). The largest of the stones weighs approximately 7.3 tonnes (8 tons) and would have required the efforts of many people <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> erect it.|$|E
5|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of a hollow metal tube attached to a tripod, with a rudimentary breech at one end. Rounds were fired {{with the use of}} black powder ignited by a standard musket percussion cap, and it had an effective range of between 100 and 150 yards. Although it was cheap and easy to manufacture, it did have several problems; it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenades it used as one type of ammunition had a tendency to break inside the breech, damaging the weapon and injuring the crew. Production began in late 1940, and by the beginning of 1943 nearly 19,000 were in service. Like many obsolete Home Guard weapons, it was eventually replaced by other weapons, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in {{standard}} first-person shooters, the player must control a flying ship {{that has a}} {{six degrees of freedom}} movement scheme, allowing the player <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>and</b> rotate in any 3D direction. In addition to a single-player campaign mode, Descent 3 features an online multiplayer mode where numerous players can compete against each other in eight different game types. The game features both indoor and outdoor environments, made possible {{with the use of a}} hybrid engine that combines the capabilities of a portal rendering engine with those of a flight simulator-like terrain engine.|$|E
