5|$|Sylvia warblers are {{unusual in}} that they vigorously defend <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use {{identical}} habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> never overlap. Similar songs are {{a feature of the}} Sylvia warblers as a group, and {{it has been suggested that}} this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.|$|E

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland. Males {{attract a}} mate by singing from regular {{positions}} {{at the edge of}} <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> throughout the breeding season. These birds are monogamous, taking only one mate at a time, and pairs often remain together for several years. If singing males come within contact of each other, they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature; if that fails to make the other bird leave, they stiffen their body, droop their wings, raise their tails, and stick their head straight out. Males guard <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> year-round.|$|E
5|$|In earlier times, when large {{populations of}} {{springbok}} roamed the Kalahari desert and Karoo, millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long {{that could take}} several days to pass a town. These mass treks, known as trekbokken in Afrikaans, took place during long periods of drought. Herds could efficiently retrace their paths to <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> after long migrations. Trekbokken is still observed occasionally in Botswana, though on a much smaller scale than earlier.|$|E
5|$|In {{their summer}} camps, {{starting}} in January, male grey-headed flying foxes set up mating territories. Mating territories are generally 3.5 body lengths along branches. These flying foxes' neck glands enlarge in {{males in the}} mating season, and are used to mark the territories. The males fight to maintain <b>their</b> <b>territories,</b> and this {{is associated with a}} steep drop in the males' body condition during this time.|$|E

When they were given audience they informed the Senate about the treaty between Philip and Antiochus and complained of Philip's attacks on <b>their</b> <b>territories.</b> In response to these complaints the Romans sent three ambassadors, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, Gaius Claudius Nero and Publius Sempronius Tuditanus to Egypt with the orders to go to Rhodes after speaking with Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> when breeding, {{but they may}} join mixed feeding flocks at other times. Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E

5|$|The Australian magpie was {{subdivided}} into three {{species in the}} literature {{for much of the}} twentieth century—the black-backed magpie (G. tibicen), the white-backed magpie (G. hypoleuca), and the western magpie (G. dorsalis). They were later noted to hybridise readily where <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> crossed, with hybrid grey or striped-backed magpies being quite common. This resulted in them being reclassified as one species by Julian Ford in 1969, with most recent authors following suit.|$|E
5|$|The Old Swiss Confederacy in the 17th {{century was}} a {{federation}} of thirteen largely independent cantons. The federation comprised rural cantons {{as well as}} city states that had expanded <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> into the countryside by political and military means {{at the cost of}} the previously ruling liege lords. The cities just took over the preexisting administrative structures. In these city cantons, the city councils ruled the countryside; they held the judicial rights and also appointed the district sheriffs (Landvögte).|$|E
5|$|The brush cuckoo (Cacomantis variolosus), pallid cuckoo (C. pallidus), Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chrysococcyx basalis), and black-eared cuckoo (C.osculans) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites of the red-capped robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, which are then raised by the robins as their own. Red-capped robins have been observed to be particularly aggressive in driving Horsfield's bronze cuckoos from <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> in Terrick Terrick National Park in a field study, and no nests were found parasitised there.|$|E

5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within <b>their</b> <b>territories,</b> such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female of the species reach sexual {{maturity}} after 1 year of life. The breeding season occurs in the spring and early summer. The males arrive before {{the beginning of the season}} to establish <b>their</b> <b>territories.</b> The males use a series of courtship displays to attract the females to their sites. They run around the area either to showcase their territory to the females or to pursue the females. The males also engage in flight to showcase their wings. They sing and call as they perform all of these displays. The species can remain monogamous for many years, but incidents of polygyny and bigamy have been reported to occur during the bird's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend <b>their</b> <b>territories</b> from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend <b>their</b> <b>territories,</b> nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E
