2500|$|On October 28, 2007, Boras and New York Yankees {{third baseman}} Alex Rodriguez {{exercised}} {{the right to}} opt out of Rodriguez's original 10-year, $252 million contract, with three years and $72 million remaining. Boras and Rodriguez were criticized for the timing of the decision, which leaked during Game 4 of the 2007 World Series. Rodriguez met with Yankees officials in Miami, and afterward Rodriguez instructed Boras to finalize a record-breaking 10-year, $275 million contract. Boras and the Yankees then crafted a series of unique marketing bonuses <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> Rodriguez an additional $30 million for tying and surpassing Willie Mays, Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron, and Barry Bonds on the all-time home run list. If Rodriguez passes Bonds, his contract will be worth $305 million, the first contract in team sports history to eclipse the $300 million milestone. [...] The high-profile opt-out and negotiations strained Boras and Rodriguez's relationship, and Rodriguez hired Madonna's manager to be his marketing representative, but Boras retained his role as Rodriguez's baseball agent and has since reported that their relationship is [...] "repaired".|$|E
