However, during the colonial rule, the figurines were sold to Westerners for their cultural value. The earliest recorded history of these figures was provided by Reverend George Brown {{during his visit to}} an area on the west coast at Patpatar of southern New Ireland where the language spoken was Hinsal. Brown had noted that these figures were kept in a large, painted, corner house, which was well maintained on protected land. The building had kept two, large, painted human figures (one large male figure and the other smaller but not intended for worship) inferred to be linked <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of superstition as people danced in front of the figures. Women and children were prohibited entry. The last of the figurines was created ca. 1910.|$|E
