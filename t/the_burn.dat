5|$|The small burns {{that are}} tributaries to the East Burn {{contributed to the}} {{draining}} of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. <b>The</b> <b>burn</b> emerges from a deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison's Flour Mills before running parallel to the harbour wall and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison's buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>burn.</b> The flour millers chose this area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than for the need to use <b>the</b> <b>burn</b> to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills. This burn flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally {{it was used to}} create Raith Lake (with its tributary, the Dronachy Burn). The mill owners in Linktown also made use of <b>the</b> <b>burn.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 17, 2014, Stanislaus National Forest {{issued an}} order closing the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>burn</b> area to the public through November 18, 2014, citing safety issues from potential falls of heavily burned trees, rock falls, and uneven ground. The decision was met with disappointment by morel mushroom hunters who had looked forward to extensive post-fire fruiting of this highly sought-after mushroom. The safety rationale was questioned, as Yosemite National Park, which largely prohibits mushroom collecting, had opened up <b>the</b> <b>burn</b> areas within its boundaries to the public earlier in the month. Some mushroom hunters stated {{that they would be}} willing to sign liability waivers in order to enter the area, but the Forest Service rejected this idea, stating they were ultimately responsible for the safety of those entering the area. Extensive harvesting of morels in the Rim Fire area nevertheless took place in May 2014, in a few cases legally by special permit, but in most cases through illegal harvesting. The closure of <b>the</b> <b>burn</b> area was also criticized by the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors for, among other reasons, causing the cancellation of grazing allotments by local ranchers.|$|E

5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and <b>the</b> <b>burn</b> area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. <b>The</b> <b>burn</b> is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E
5|$|The next day, after final checks were completed, the {{expended}} LM {{ascent stage}} was jettisoned. Because of a failure by {{the crew to}} activate a certain switch in the LM before sealing it off, it initially tumbled after separation and did not execute the rocket burn necessary for the craft's intentional de-orbit. The ascent stage eventually crashed into the lunar surface nearly {{a year after the}} mission. The crew's next task, after jettisoning the Lunar Module ascent stage, was to release a subsatellite into lunar orbit from the CSM's Scientific Instrument Bay. <b>The</b> <b>burn</b> to alter the CSM's orbit to that desired for the subsatellite had been cancelled; as a result, the subsatellite lasted half of its anticipated lifetime. Just under five hours later, on the CSM's 65th orbit around the Moon, its Service Propulsion System main engine was reignited to propel the craft on a trajectory that would return it to Earth. The SPS engine performed <b>the</b> <b>burn</b> flawlessly despite the malfunction that had delayed the lunar landing several days before.|$|E

5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of <b>the</b> <b>burn.</b> Superficial burns may be managed {{with little more than}} simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, {{officials}} {{announced that the}} estimated containment date had been delayed until July 7. According to a Forest Service Spokesman, the final 7% of the perimeter was in extremely rough terrain that was close to impossible for hand crews or bulldozers to reach. Due {{to the difficulty of}} access the fire remained only 96% contained on July 9 and the estimated containment date was pushed back to July 21. Due to favorable conditions, on July 12, the Sherpa fire was 100% contained ahead of schedule. Because of the threat of flare ups within <b>the</b> <b>burn</b> area, patrols continued for several days.|$|E
5|$|There {{are good}} {{examples}} of horizontal water mills, also known as Norse or Clack Mills, around Dutch Loch. Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs, built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill-stone was sited. Inside the building there was a fixed lower millstone, and a rotating upper millstone driven by the water falling onto the paddles below. Some were still in use on Papa Stour {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, and there is still a working example of one of these mills on <b>the</b> <b>Burn</b> of Clumlie, at Troswick in the south Mainland of Shetland.|$|E

After approximately two km the track is left and <b>the</b> <b>burn</b> is crossed (no bridge) to its southern bank. It is then a walk south through pathless heather to reach the eastern ridge which is followed to the summit.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>burned</b> and {{unburned}} plots {{were different}} in some dimensions of stand condition in 2014 (Table 1).
