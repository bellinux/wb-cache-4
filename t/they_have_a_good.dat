5|$|There {{are eight}} public and one private {{universities}} in Hong Kong, the oldest being the University of Hong Kong (HKU), established in 1910–1912. The Chinese University of Hong Kong {{was founded in}} 1963 to fulfill {{the need for a}} university with a medium of instruction of Chinese. Competition among students to receive an offer for an undergraduate programme is fierce as the annual number of intakes is limited, especially when some disciplines are offered by select tertiary institutions, like medicine which is provided by merely two medical schools in the territory, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong and the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to the public post-secondary institutions there are also a number of private higher institutions which offer higher diplomas and associate degree courses for those who fail to enter a college for a degree study so as to boost their qualification of education, some of whom can have a second chance of getting into a university if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> performance in these sub-degree courses.|$|E

25|$|Studying bilingual {{acquisition}} {{is important}} because it may have real effects on academic performances for bilingual children in school. Research has shown that vocabulary size is an indicator of academic performance and literacy. As we know, different contexts can cause differences in vocabulary in each language. Despite these differences, have suggested that bilingual children are not necessarily disadvantaged in academic performance or academic spoken language because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> grasp on the language used for their academics. Regardless, home vocabulary is still relevant to academic life, and it is important to get a better balance in vocabulary acquisition to be able to effectively communicate in both languages.|$|E

Homer, having just anxiously arrived to check up on them, sees Artie kissing an unwilling Marge and, unaware of the true premises, is devastated, and leaves with Lenny away from Springfield. Lenny seems similarly dejected about his relationship with Carl; he and Homer get a job in an oil field in West Springfield, a likely death spot for the two of them. On the way there, they discuss the loves they left behind. All cacti resemble Marge to Homer, and Lenny mournfully points out the image of Carl that he carved on a mountain one blissful summer. Meanwhile, Marge leaves Artie furiously, only to discover what Homer had done when she gets home. She finds he is not there and that he had left a tape behind.|$|E

2500|$|Granular {{activated}} carbon has a relatively larger particle size compared to powdered {{activated carbon}} and consequently, presents a smaller external surface. Diffusion of the adsorbate is thus an important factor. These carbons {{are suitable for}} adsorption of gases and vapors, because they diffuse rapidly. Granulated carbons are used for water treatment, deodorization and separation of components of flow system and is also used in rapid mix basins. GAC can be either in granular or extruded form. GAC is designated by sizes such as 8×20, 20×40, or 8×30 for liquid phase applications and 4×6, 4×8 or 4×10 for vapor phase applications. A 20×40 carbon is made of particles that will pass through a U.S. Standard Mesh Size No. 20 sieve (0.84mm) (generally specified as 85% passing) but be retained on a U.S. Standard Mesh Size No. 40 sieve (0.42mm) (generally specified as 95% retained). AWWA (1992) B604 uses the 50-mesh sieve (0.297mm) as the minimum GAC size.

Months later, Tom attends co-worker Millie's wedding and tries to avoid Summer on the train, but she spots him and invites him for coffee. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time at the wedding, dance together, and Summer catches the bouquet.

2500|$|Employment {{agencies}} play three {{roles in}} the process: recruiter, immigration consultant and mediator. A labour recruiter can be either public or private and offers labour recruitment services. These businesses profit from the recruitment of migrants workers from one country and their allocation in jobs in another. Agents charge fees and commission for their services to migrant domestic workers. Sri Lankan migrant domestic worker pay an estimated $1300–1600 to a Lebanese agent while potential workers in the Philippines and Ethiopia pay between $2,400-3500 and $1,700-2100 respectively. [...] The Lebanese agent will also earn anything between $300 and 600 in commission in addition. This money covers travel costs, Lebanese government visa fees, and the agency fee. In some cases, the first three months' salary is signed away as payment. The agency fees {{cover the cost of}} airfare, government charges for issue of visas and agency commissions. The residency, work permit, notary fee and annual insurance are not included in the initial sum and are the responsibility of the employer sum which is calculated to US$500. There is a difference in the amount the agency receives for each group of workers depending on their country of origin. One example is the migrant workers from the Philippines who demand higher costs and monthly salaries because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> command of English, both spoken and written. They are deemed better educated and therefore are given a higher respect as maids than those from other countries. Some employment agencies contract migrant domestic worker out on short-term contracts at a cost of up to $450 per month. The high prices involved in recruiting a migrant domestic worker means that employers take precautions to make sure the worker does not leave their position before their contract is up. The migrant domestic worker is also required to make a deposit of $1,000 in a Lebanese back in order to cover return ticket home, which is never available to the worker. Because of the conditions present in Lebanon, legal and illegal agencies flourish and due to the Kafala system a migrant has to rely on agencies to find a Lebanese sponsor and employer.|$|E
