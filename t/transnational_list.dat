50|$|As of 2011 reforms by Liberal Democrat MEP Andrew Duff {{are being}} {{considered}} by Parliament, which {{are seen as}} the most significant overhaul of the electoral system since elections began. 25 extra MEPs would be added on a transnational European list with its candidates being selected by the European party groups rather than national member parties. The candidate lists would have to represent a third of member states and {{are seen as a}} way to personalise and dramatise the elections to re-engage an apathetic electorate. Duff sees the next Commission President possibly coming from the <b>transnational</b> <b>list.</b> Duff's proposals also include a single electoral roll, regular reapportioning of seats, one set of immunity rules and the holding of elections in May rather than June. However, due to a waning of support and possible opposition from member states, Duff has taken the proposal back to committee to get broader support before putting them before the plenary in autumn 2011.|$|E
40|$|Emmanuel Macron is {{the first}} European leader to be elected on a {{platform}} that embraces the electoral reform of the European Parliament. He is convinced that, in order to change the Union, the EP needs greater legitimacy, and that such legitimacy will only come if {{the relationship between the}} Parliament and the electorate gets to be closer and more direct. In this Discussion Paper, Andrew Duff examines the likelihood of electoral reform of the Parliament, and whether or not the circumstances today are right to introduce a <b>transnational</b> <b>list</b> on the ballot in time for the European elections of May 2019. Many electors in the polling stations would be amazed; some would be confounded; but most would enjoy their first material prize from the privilege they enjoy as European Union citizens. European democracy would be refreshed. Mr Macron would have delivered...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} article is to {{understand}} the dynamics underlying the birth, the development and the eventual failure of the Duff proposal of 2009 - 2012, an ambitious attempt to change the provisions governing the elections for the European Parliament. In particular, the way agenda-setting on electoral reform is shaped in the European Union will be analysed, trying to understand if the current stalemate on the issue can be explained in light of factors specific to the EU. The report presented by liberal MEP Andrew Duff {{at the beginning of}} the seventh legislature called on Member States to gather a Convention, in order to introduce fundamental improvements in the way Members of the European Parliament are elected. Among the envisaged changes, the creation of a pan-European constituency to elect twenty-five Members on <b>transnational</b> <b>lists</b> represented the most controversial issue. After having analysed its main elements, the path of the Duff report from the committee of Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) to the plenary will be analysed. It will be concluded that a sharp contrast exists between the way electoral issues are raised in the AFCO committee and the way the Parliament as a whole deals with them. Moreover, diverging interests between national delegations inside groups seem to play a decisive role in hampering electoral reform. While further research is needed to corroborate the present findings, the analysis of the Duff proposal appears to shed light on the different barriers that ensure electoral reform is taken off the agenda of the Union, and on the relative weight each of them carries...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though the}} European {{elections}} {{were meant to}} boost European integration, this objective was hardly achieved, as they were commonly labelled „second order elections”. After summarizing the causes and consequences of this general agreed perception, my paper presents an institutional attempt, coming from the European Parliament, to reform its elections. I consider that this initiative is anchored in a dichotomic new theoretical approach – the Europeanization of European elections. Its aim is to reform the European elections from a supranational perspective, through the introduction of <b>transnational</b> party <b>lists,</b> starting with 2014. This challenging initiative {{was approved by the}} Constitutional Affairs Committee of the European Parliament and, waiting for the plenary vote, it already has big supporters, as well as critics...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{high-tech}} and telecommunication, non-ferrous sector has {{a crucial role in}} industries development. Cooper, nickel, aluminum, zinc, lead and tin are used, directly or indirectly, in most of the technologies, especially in high-tech production. The paper present a short index of the global investments for the non-ferrous <b>transnational</b> corporations <b>listed</b> on London Metal Exchange. The non-ferrous investment index presented in the paper refers to the most profitable corporation exports on world, European Union (EU 28) and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) level. The export concentration, estimated through Herfindahl-Hirschmann index on world, EU 28, CEE and Romanian level, show that the non-ferrous industry is in full process of releasing. The cases presented in the article show that the non-ferrous companies invest intensively in equipment and technologies with superior production capacities, which combat pollution given by non-ferrous processes, research and development for the non-ferrous innovative technologies, and creating new markets. Sustainable and intelligent development is the inflexion point of the non-ferrous transnational corporation investments. The research is predominant in exploration of the transnational corporations’ internet pages and reports, and statistical calculus from international trade websites...|$|R
40|$|Transnational {{communities}} are social groups {{that emerge from}} mutual interaction across national boundaries, oriented around a common project or 'imagined' identity. This common project or identity is constructed and sustained through the active engagement and involvement of {{at least some of}} its members. Such communities can overlap in different ways with formal organizations but, in principle, they do not need formal organization to be sustained. This book explores the role of transnational communities in relation to the governance of business and economic activity. It does so by focusing {{on a wide range of}} empirical terrains, including discussions of the Laleli market in Istanbul, the institutionalization of private equity in Japan, the transnational movement for open content licenses, and the mobilization around environmental certification. These studies show that transnational communities can align the cognitive and normative orientations of their members over time and thereby influence emergent <b>transnational</b> governance arrangements. <b>List</b> of figures page List of tables List of appendices Notes on contributors Preface Part I Introduction Transnational communities and governance Marie-Laure Djelic and Sigrid Quack Global structures: markets, organizations, networks – and communities?

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the {{international}} community {{of public and private}} actors have embraced corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a means of corporate governance by which to mitigate business malfeasance. Resistance from transnational corporations and states has led the United Nations and other multi-lateral organisations like the OECD to promote CSR in lieu of enforcing binding international laws developed to protect human rights and the environment. While both international human rights (IHRL) human rights law and environmental law (IEL) has broad acceptance among most states, many of these states have a poor record of enforcing their obligations, particularly when international human rights and environmental obligations impede the operations of powerful transnational corporations within states' territory. Despite CSR measures, human rights violations and ecocide continue to characterise the operations of many TNCs in many states. The emergence of neo-liberalism as dominant paradigm of governance in the international political economy since the 1980 s has coincided with increased rhetoric about states' commitments to uphold human rights and environmental protection. States have similarly reduced enforcement of these duties. The hegemony of neoliberalism galvanised a counter-hegemonic movement from civil society to try to combat human rights abuses and environmental destruction by TNCs. Civil society demands through NGOs to corporate abuses pose a serious challenge to the neo-liberal market. States and inter-governmental organisations (IGOs) faced with ignoring these demands and losing legitimacy with civil society, or enforcing their statutory and international law duties against TNCs and risk losing their investment and support, found relief in CSR. CSR is a compromise construct that enunciates human rights and environmental protection norms but allows TNCS to choose whether or not to comply under voluntary compliance regimes. CSR does the ideological work of cloaking TNCs in the mantle of good corporate citizenship. Further, TNCs argue that enlightened self-interest compels voluntary compliance with CSR initiatives so obviating the need for compulsory enforcement. The neoliberal supremacy in state, international and corporate governance also coincides with the greatest growth in the number and power of TNCs, {{as well as with the}} greatest decline in biodiversity loss and rise of greenhouse gas emissions, in human history. This thesis therefore argues that current measures to curtail the human rights abuses and biodiversity degradation perpetrated by TNCs are inadequate. The thesis contrasts Rio Tinto's stated commitment to human rights and environmental values in Australia and the region with its practices. Rio Tinto's commitment to CSR has not resulted in improved universal human rights and environmental outcomes when domestic legislation is weak or unenforced. This thesis extrapolates from the case study operations of Rio Tinto to generalise about activities of less well-known companies operating in a regulatory vacuum in third world states. The thesis concludes that CSR is only conducive to protecting human rights and environmental protection under the glare of publicity and civil society scrutiny as in Australia and is totally ineffective in disciplining corporations' operations in poor or corrupt states. This thesis studies the activities of the UK-Australian joint <b>listed</b> <b>transnational</b> mining company Rio Tinto in Australia and its three mines the Asia-Pacific region. Rio Tinto is a consistent high performer in national and international CSR reports, promotes human rights activities in Australia and is a foundation member of the United Nation's Global Compact. Many huge mining projects are on Aboriginal people's traditional lands, and until 1995 their relationship was poor. After the Australian High Court held that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders had radical title in Mabo v Queensland [No. 2] in 1992, the federal government enacted the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) to codify Mabo's implications. The new Act was bitterly fought by mining companies for two years, but became a game changer with respect to Rio Tinto's relations with Aboriginal people, with whom Rio Tinto now has positive relations. In contrast, in developing states in the Asia-Pacific such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, high levels of official corruption and the legacies colonialism, Rio Tinto's operations are associated with gross human rights violations that are tantamount to genocide and ecological degradation on an ecocidal scale...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} NADIR {{project was}} to organise European animal {{infectiology}} centres to achieve economies of scale, modernise existing facilities and improve cooperation and complementarities. The project proposed to: - Set up an Internet-based platform designed to organise the collaboration between partners in a secure and optimal way and provide internal as well as external organisations {{with access to the}} network's infrastructures - Strengthen the exchange of best practices, training, and the validation of protocols - Coordinate the management of material resources, including animal lines, and in-house developed tools in relationship with related European project and initiatives - Jointly undertake research activities aimed at upgrading the services provided by NADIR infrastructures: characterise animal lines, customise imaging technologies, develop monitoring molecular tools and create new animal models. - Conceive, structure and manage transnational access to the NADIR infrastructures. The initial objectives were to prioritise Nadir research activities, to implement exchanges of resources between partners and to allow access to the 14 NADIR animal facilities. Eighteen meetings have been organised to complete these tasks from May 2009 {{to the end of the}} project in December 2013. Exchange of best practices has been initiated through the Biosafety/biosecurity/best practices meetings attended by Nadir partners and an invited institute (IVI, Mittelhaüsern, Berne). Very fruitful, these exchanges of experience between leading European institutes in the field allowed reaching a consensual report advising animal facilities for the containment of farm animal species infected with class 3 pathogens as well as for ethical aspects of experimental infections. During the second period, a range of training courses for improved use of animals has been conducted. Next to coordination of studies performed within the NADIR research activities and the <b>transnational</b> access, a <b>listing</b> of animal models available within the consortium was compiled The joint research activities of the project had been designed to sustain the improvement of the services provided by the infrastructures through (i) better characterisation of animal lines, (ii) progress in detection and diagnostic of diseases, (iii) development of infection process monitoring tools. It has produced more than 60 research publications and contributed to more than 80 communications. According to the first objective, chicken, sheep, pig and fish lines have been genotyped and the susceptibility of different animal lines have been assessed by infections with various pathogens., Several immunological tools specific for farm animals have been produced and their use optimised. In the frame of the second objective, experience in a telemetric transmission of physiological parameters that can be used to monitor the animal response to infectious diseases was exchanged between partners. Devices dedicated to these tasks have been compared and several have been successfully tested to be used in pigs and ruminant species. Imaging in vivo the infectious process in small animal species through fluorescent or bioluminescent markers has been achieved in pilot experiments conducted in a BSL 3 animal facility. A number of new diagnostic procedures using immunological tools and molecular technologies (microarrays for pathogens and their host) were developed as well as multi-diagnostic assays for monitoring infection processes in animals. The Recent evolution of the European sanitary status and of institutes' objectives needed to prioritise a limited number of infectious diseases to work on. A common consensus was reached to prioritise emerging viral zoonoses. The documentation of cell culture systems and the challenge experiments of vector-borne disease agents in different host species were performed, in order to generate defined positive tissue samples, and to study the pathogenicity of these agents, which included the most relevant fish pathogens towards a better understanding of their species spectrum and transmissibility. The “Call for Transnational Access” allowing external users to perform experiments in the BSL 3 facilities proposed by NADIR has been disseminated by partners and through the communication channels developed within the project. A blog-like website has been created and has been promoted through Linkedin Groups in order to increase the people in contact with NADIR. A total of 60 transnational access proposals from 16 European countries have been evaluated by the scientific panel and 43 have been realised and reported. Among these, four accesses were headed by private companies and 39 by public laboratories. The most frequent demands concerned studies on the pathogenesis of infectious diseases or vaccine development. Improvement of diagnostic and characterization of pathogen isolates was a second objective of many studies with the aim of developing an improved control of farm animal infectious diseases and zoonosis...|$|R
