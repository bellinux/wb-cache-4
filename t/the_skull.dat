5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> {{it has a}} {{significantly}} longer rostrum (the front part of <b>the</b> <b>skull)</b> and diastema (the gap between the incisors and the molars). Furthermore, it has shorter molar rows in both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. The back end of the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate), which is located in front of the first molars, is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The sutures of the maxillary and palatine bones (the line where the two bones, part of <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> join) are straight and parallel to each other, the toothrows, and the midline of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> in eastern voalavo. Northern voalavo, in contrast, are more curved. Statistical analysis of measurements of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and teeth clearly separates the two species of Voalavo.|$|E
5|$|Sculpturing is seen {{on many of}} <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> bones, in {{the form}} of long grooves, pits and protrusions. Like other ceratosaurs, the frontal bones of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> roof were fused together. Carnotaurines {{commonly}} had bony projections from <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> Carnotaurus had two pronounced horns, projecting outward above the eyes, while its close relative Aucasaurus had smaller projections in the same area. Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus had a single bony horn or dome, projecting upwards from <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> These projections, like the horns of many modern animals, might have been displayed for species recognition or intimidation. In Arcovenator, the dorsal margin of the postorbital (and probably also the lacrimal) is thickened dorsolaterally, forming a strong and rugose bony brow ridge rising above the level of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> roof. Maybe this rugose brow ridge supported a keratinous or scaly structure for displays.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>skull</b> of RAM 14000 {{is almost}} complete, {{with the left}} side only lacking {{a piece of the}} maxilla.

The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} {{described by}} Brown, Prosaurolophus maximus was known from a skull and jaw. Half of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> was badly weathered {{at the time}} of examination, and the level of the parietal was distortedly crushed upwards to the side. The different bones of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> could be easily defined, {{with the exception of the}} parietals and nasal bones. Brown found that <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> of the already described genus Saurolophus is very similar overall to, but also smaller than <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> of P. maximus. A unique feature of a shortened frontal in lambeosaurines is also found in Prosaurolophus, and the other horned hadrosaurines Brachylophosaurus, Maiasaura, and Saurolophus. Although they lack a shorter frontal, the genera Edmontosaurus and Shantungosaurus share with saurolophins an elongated dentary.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. <b>The</b> <b>skull</b> contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of}} the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|An osteological {{examination}} of the bones showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, {{which may have been}} destroyed by Victorian building work. It was immediately apparent that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. <b>The</b> <b>skull</b> shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base of the back of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> had been completely cut away by a bladed weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another bladed weapon had been thrust through the right side of <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. Bladed weapons had clipped <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and sheared off layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s skull indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a sharp implement, as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered arm that afflicted the character in William Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E

5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, the right side of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed.

5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by features of <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> On {{the tip of}} a ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E

5|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} phylogenetic analyses of the group, Gardiner (1983) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade: a bone at the back of <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> the parasphenoid, is connected to another bone on the underside of <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> the pterygoid; large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids; the stapes (a bone involved in hearing) is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward; the cleithrum, a bone in the pectoral girdle, is thin; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch. Additional features were given by Godfrey et al. (1987), including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital at the back of <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> small projections (uncinate processes) on the ribs, and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade.

5|$|In {{the course}} of evolution, <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> has been {{modified}} in most diapsids from the original version evident in the fossil record. However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – a temporal fenestra {{on each side of}} <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw is firmly attached to <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> This makes for a very rigid, inflexible construction. Testudines (turtles and tortoises) have anapsid skulls – they lack any temporal fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost the temporal openings rather than never having had them.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1909 that an Apatosaurus skull was found during the first expedition, led by Earl Douglass, to what would {{become known as the}} Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument. <b>The</b> <b>skull</b> was found a short {{distance}} from a skeleton (specimen CM3018) identified as the new species Apatosaurus louisae, named after Louise Carnegie, wife of Andrew Carnegie, who funded field research to find complete dinosaur skeletons in the American West. <b>The</b> <b>skull</b> was designated CM11162; it was very similar to <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> of Diplodocus. Another smaller skeleton of A.louisae was found nearby CM11162 and CM3018. <b>The</b> <b>skull</b> was accepted as belonging to the Apatosaurus specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientistsmost notably Osbornrejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and skeleton.
