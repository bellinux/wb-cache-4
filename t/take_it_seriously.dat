5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} college, VanDerveer {{took a year}} off, with a plan {{to return}} to law school. When she ran out of money she returned home. When her parents realized she was doing little beyond playing chess and sleeping, they urged her to help with her sister Marie's basketball team. Her sister was five years younger, and by the time Marie reached high school, the school had basketball teams for girls. The experience was exasperating in some ways, as the girls did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously,</b> but VanDerveer realized coaching was something she loved.|$|E
25|$|While Locke {{had always}} wanted to be a writer, it was in the 1950s that she began to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b> In 1949 she edited Gordon Watson, New Zealander, 1912–45: His Life and Writings, and in 1950 she wrote a {{political}} history of the Canterbury region, The Shepherd and the Scullery Maid, 1850–1950: Canterbury Without Laurels, both published by the Communist Party. In 1954 she self-published a book of her poetry, The Time of the Child: A Sequence of Poems. Writing became very important to Locke, who managed to keep a room to herself in their tiny house for more than 50 years.|$|E

25|$|During the epidemic, normal {{gameplay}} was disrupted. Player responses varied but resembled real-world behaviors. Some {{characters with}} healing abilities volunteered their services, some lower-level characters {{who could not}} help would direct people away from infected areas, some characters would flee to uninfected areas, and some characters attempted to spread the disease to others. Players in the game reacted to the disease {{as if there were}} real risk to their well-being. Blizzard Entertainment attempted to institute a voluntary quarantine to stem the disease, but it failed, as some players didn't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously,</b> while others took advantage of the pandemonium. Despite certain security measures, players overcame them by giving the disease to summonable pets. Blizzard was forced to fix the problem by instituting hard resets of the servers and applying quick fixes.|$|E
25|$|At work, Cindy {{searches}} through {{pictures of}} lighthouses before finding {{the one from}} the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy warns everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter. Her boss interrupts her, and the anchor mechanically recites the wrong message. The Logans <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> since they encountered an alien disguised as Michael Jackson, and President Baxter Harris personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect. The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistakenly returned it to Blockbuster, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.|$|E
25|$|Tuck played {{high school}} {{football}} in Alabama at Central Coosa County. He played for legendary coach Andrew Slome. Growing up, Tuck's favorite football teams were the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys, but his favorite sport was basketball. Although he began playing football in the seventh grade, Justin only began to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> in his freshman {{year of high school}} where he originally started out as a quarterback before changing positions to tight end and defensive end. His accolades include earning Alabama Class 4A Player of the Year as a senior in 2000, as well as lettering in football at both linebacker and tight end. For his career at Central-Coosa, Tuck recorded 492 tackles with 37 sacks, 26 forced fumbles, and 17 fumble recoveries. As a tight end, Tuck had 115 catches for 2,106 yards and 17 touchdowns. Subsequently, Tuck also won two state championships {{as a member of the}} high school basketball team.|$|E

500|$|Robertson-Glasgow {{described}} Chapman {{as among}} the greatest fielders of all time, and The Times observed that [...] "at his best he {{had been one of}} the finest fielders ever to play for England". In his earlier years, he fielded in the deep but when he played for Kent and England, he was positioned closer to the batsmen—usually at gully or silly point. The Cricketer commented that his [...] "capacious hands made him a brilliant close-to-the-wicket fielder, and some of his catches were miraculous". In his youth, Chapman bowled quite regularly, but his negative experience bowling for Berkshire lessened his enthusiasm, and he did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E

Initially unaware of the purpose of the exercise, the employees do not all <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b> Once the job in New York is revealed, Andy and Dwight step up their efforts, Stanley tries to be enthusiastic but gives up, and Jim decides to interview for the same position that Michael is pursuing.

500|$|His bowling {{was smooth}} and effortless, with a {{classical}} action. He could bowl fast, but more often bowled at fast-medium pace. He could make the ball swing in humid weather, and deliver off-spin when conditions were suitable. However, Hammond was reluctant to bowl, particularly for Gloucestershire. Bill Bowes believed {{that he was a}} very good bowler who would not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b> In his obituary, Wisden said that [...] "at slip he had no superior. He stood all but motionless, moved late but with uncanny speed, never needing to stretch or strain but plucking the ball from the air like an apple from a tree." [...] He was also able to field further away from the batsmen than was the norm, particularly in his younger days, as he could chase the ball quickly and had a very good throwing arm.|$|E

[...] Hiro Ugaya, a Tokyo-based journalist and media commentator, assumed that [...] "images of cultures outside of one's own in mass media are always different from the reality. [...] When you're {{trying to reach the}} majority of consumers, images tend to be lowest common dominator". Nobuyuki Hayashi, also a well-known Tokyo-based tech and social media expert, commented that most of the reactions on Twitter were favorable, adding that people who blamed Lavigne for racism are non-Japanese, but society from Japan did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{comments}} of alt.tv.simpsons have been quoted or {{cited in the}} writings of mass media commentators. This has led to situations in which relations between writers and viewers have become strained. In 1994, Simpsons creator Matt Groening acknowledged he and the other show runners have been reading the newsgroup and in frustration said, [...] "Sometimes I feel like knocking their electronic noggins together". In another case, writer Ian Maxtone-Graham made comments about the fans on the Internet in an interview with The Independent, calling them [...] "beetle-browed" [...] and saying, [...] "That's why they're on the Internet and we're writing the show." [...] Writer Bill Oakley used to respond to select Simpsons fans through e-mail in a friendly manner, but by 1996 claimed [...] "here are people who <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> to the point of absurdity". In a 1994 Life in Hell cartoon Matt Groening implied that he read the newsgroup.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{opined that}} the Underwood {{character}} is less interesting once he achieves {{his goal of}} becoming president and actually has to govern.

[...] "But when a cartoon becomes president, it starts to look too fake to be real, but too real to be a cartoon. Frank plays the role of President Bartlett, a cartoon president doing things that would actually, in reality, be kind of great. But Bartlett was too good to be true, and the old Frank was too evil to be true. President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy, and so the props take center stage." ...|$|E

[...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two takes that were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one is never going to make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!" [...] Ultimately, Scott felt that [...] "if you pull it too far out of context and try to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously,</b> it's a bit too rock video at times." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Yellow" [...] {{was written}} in [...] Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after {{finishing}} recording [...] "Shiver", the band took a break and {{went out of the}} studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously</b> [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started off a lot slower", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, [...] "and it sort of got a bit heavier".|$|E

500|$|Aware {{that some}} {{scholars}} might reject any {{view of the}} development of homosexuality resembling psychoanalytic theory and object to studies that appear to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously,</b> Bell et al. noted that while they gave psychoanalytic theory considerable attention, many of the variables used in their statistical analyses pertained to [...] "experiences occurring outside our respondents′ original households", including relationships with peers, labeling by others, dating experiences, and sexual experiences. They added that it was not easy to answer objections to the use of retrospective data, given the unresolved issue of how accurate their respondents′ recollections of childhood were, and that even a longitudinal study would have been open to question. Bell et al. observed that some gay rights activists might object to their study on principle, and suspect them of being motivated by a desire {{to find a way to}} prevent homosexuality and reduce its incidence, while other critics might regret their involvement in a tradition of inquiry that has so far supported the majority view that homosexuality is a perversion or deviation, and be concerned that their study would be used to reinforce social prejudice against homosexuals. In response to these potential criticisms, Bell et al. argued that ideas about the development of homosexuality contribute to prejudice against homosexuals, and that so long as [...] "the heterosexual majority" [...] accepted largely untested theories that see homosexuality as the result of a bad upbringing, their negative attitudes toward homosexuals would never change.|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{were due}} to begin their first American tour in May 1980. While Curtis had {{expressed}} a desire to take time off to visit a few acquaintances, he feigned excitement about the tour around the band because {{he did not want to}} disappoint either his bandmates or Factory Records. At the time, Curtis's relationship with his wife, Deborah (the couple had married in 1975 as teenagers), was strained. Contributing factors were his ill health, his excluding her from band activities, and his affair with a young Belgian woman named Annik Honoré whom he had met on a 1979 European tour. The evening before Joy Division were to fly out for their first American tour, Curtis returned to his home in Macclesfield to talk to his by then estranged wife. He asked her to drop the divorce suit she had filed; later, he told her to leave him alone in the house until he caught a train to Manchester the following morning. Early on 18 May 1980, having spent the night watching the Werner Herzog film Stroszek, Curtis hanged himself in his kitchen. Deborah discovered his body later that day when she returned to their home. It came as a shock both to the band members and their management. In 2005, Wilson recollected: [...] "I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously.</b> That's how stupid we were".|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was very}} {{negative}} towards the episode, saying, [...] "This episode conveys {{a strong sense}} of a writer, director and actors merely going through the motions, collecting their sizable paychecks while running out the clock on the season and series. The plot is not compelling, the agents themselves seem not to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>seriously,</b> and the doppelgangers around whom the action revolves are little more than ciphers." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two wrote, [...] "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that seems to want to die now, please. [...] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, [...] "the guest cast {{is one of the worst}} ever. [...] Griffin [...] simply is not up to the task; she can not differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [...] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom." [...] i09 reviewer Cyriaque Lama named [...] "The Kathy Griffin Twins" [...] the tenth [...] "Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters of the Week", and derided her performance as the Templeton twins. In 2016, in a ranking of all episodes of the series from best to worst, Vulture.com named [...] "Fight Club" [...] the worst episode of the series.|$|E
