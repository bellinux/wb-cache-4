5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions {{had to be}} made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>Radicals</b> denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, <b>the</b> <b>Radicals</b> retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln's {{appointments}} {{were designed}} to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>radicals</b> refused, however, to {{recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified with those of <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject {{to the laws of}} physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In its latest variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, {{the armed}} forces forced <b>the</b> <b>Radicals</b> from power and {{improved}} economic conditions, but political turbulence intensified. In 1932, Argentina required immigrants to have a labour contract prior to arrival, or proof of financial means of support. The Roca-Runciman Treaty of 1933 gave Argentina a quota of the British market for exports of its primary products, but the discriminatory British imperial tariffs {{and the effects of}} deflation in Britain actually led to a small decline of Argentine exports to Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1964 riot in Hama and other cities, <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> were on the retreat and the Aflaqites regained control for a brief period. Bitar formed a new government which halted the nationalisation process, reaffirm respect for civil liberties and private property. However, these policy changes did not win sufficient support, and the population at large still opposed Ba'ath Party rule. The upper classes continued to disinvest capital and smuggle capital out of the country, and the only foreseeable solution to this loss of capital was continuing with nationalisation. The party's left-wing argued that the bourgeoisie would never be won over unless they were given total control over the economy as they had before. It was this power struggle between the moderate Aflaqites who dominated the National Command of the Ba'ath Party and <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> who dominated the Syrian Regional Command of the Ba'ath Party which led to the 1966 coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|It {{resulted}} in an overwhelming victory for the right, with the CEDA and <b>the</b> <b>Radicals</b> together winning 219 seats. Although the political situation was complicated, parties of the right won around 3,365,700 votes, parties of the centre 2,051,500 votes, and parties of the left 3,118,000 according to one estimate. Turnout was around 8,535,200 votes, 67.5% of the electorate. The right had spent far more on their election campaign than the Socialists, who campaigned alone. Women, in their first election, mainly voted for the centre-right. The Communist Party, with perhaps 3,000 members, were at this point not significant. Nationalist Basques won twelve of seventeen Basque seats, a considerable victory. Keeping their promise, the CNT proclaimed a revolution. There were many reasons the Socialists and Republicans lost out; the female vote alone cannot explain the shift. Among them was the disunity of the political left compared to the right, {{in a system that}} favoured broad coalitions. <b>The</b> <b>Radicals</b> and their supporters had also shifted to the right. Abstentionalism hindered Socialist and Republican candidates. Overall, the political system in Spain had changed dramatically since the last election.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second Zurich disputation, many in the radical wing of the Reformation became {{convinced}} that Zwingli was making too many concessions to the Zurich council. They rejected the role of civil government and demanded the immediate establishment of a congregation of the faithful. Conrad Grebel, the leader of <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> and the emerging Anabaptist movement, spoke disparagingly of Zwingli in private. On 15 August 1524 the council insisted on the obligation to baptise all newborn infants. Zwingli secretly conferred with Grebel's group and late in 1524, the council called for official discussions. When talks were broken off, Zwingli published Wer Ursache gebe zu Aufruhr (Whoever Causes Unrest) clarifying the opposing points-of-view. On 17 January 1525 a public debate was held and the council decided in favour of Zwingli. Anyone refusing to have their children baptised was required to leave Zurich. <b>The</b> <b>radicals</b> ignored these measures and on 21 January, they met {{at the house of}} the mother of another radical leader, Felix Manz. Grebel and a third leader, George Blaurock, performed the first recorded Anabaptist adult baptisms.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials {{who had received}} Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous, since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, {{and most of the}} officials <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.|$|E
5|$|Created as a {{parliamentary}} borough in 1832, Oldham's first parliamentary representatives were <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> William Cobbett and John Fielden. Winston Churchill began {{his political career}} in Oldham. Although unsuccessful at his first attempt in 1899, Churchill was elected as the member of Parliament for the Oldham parliamentary borough constituency in the 1900 general election. He held the constituency for the Conservative Party until the 1906 general election, {{when he won the}} election for Manchester North West as a Liberal MP. After he became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1940, Churchill was made a Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Oldham, on 2 April 1941.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> three <b>radical</b> axes meet in {{a single}} point, <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> center, for <b>the</b> {{following}} reason. <b>The</b> <b>radical</b> axis {{of a pair of}} circles is defined as the set of points that have equal power h with respect to both circles. For example, for every point P on <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> axis of circles 1 and 2, the powers to each circle are equal, h1 = h2. Similarly, for every point on <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> axis of circles 2 and 3, the powers must be equal, h2 = h3. Therefore, at the intersection point of these two lines, all three powers must be equal, h1 = h2 = h3. Since this implies that h1 = h3, this point must also lie on <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> axis of circles 1 and 3. Hence, all three radical axes pass through the same point, <b>the</b> <b>radical</b> center.|$|R

5|$|De Montfort {{returned}} to England in April 1263 and convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford {{to pursue a}} renewed anti-Poitevin agenda. Revolt broke out shortly afterwards in the Welsh Marches and, by October, England faced a likely civil war between Henry, backed by Edward, Bigod and the conservative barons, and de Montfort, de Clare and <b>the</b> <b>radicals.</b> De Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt. Henry and Eleanor were trapped in the Tower of London by the rebels; the Queen attempted to escape up the River Thames to join Edward's army at Windsor, but was forced to retreat by the London crowds. De Montfort took the pair prisoner, and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry's name, the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own, trusted men.|$|E
5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's General Order Number 40 {{was quickly}} {{condemned}} by Republicans in Washington, especially by <b>the</b> <b>Radicals,</b> while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless {{of the situation}} in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew {{to the extent that he}} was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in the 1868 election. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the 22 Floréal coup in France {{undermined}} Delacroix, {{because it}} inspired more sympathy by French foreign minister Talleyrand for the Dutch opposition members who demanded the ambassador's recall. At the same time, Daendels became disaffected {{with the regime}} he had helped put into power because of the depredations of the purging commissions. His French colleague General Joubert was displeased with <b>the</b> <b>radicals</b> because of conflicts about the co-dominion of Flushing. Finally, the newly appointed Agenten were disturbed about the inefficiency of the Uitvoerend Bewind. All these disaffections came together with the putsch on June 12, 1798, of that recidivist, general Daendels, in which he disturbed a dinner party of Delacroix and {{three members of the}} Uitvoerend Bewind, violating the diplomatic immunity of the ambassador by putting pistols to his chest.

5|$|Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, {{leader of}} the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an {{understanding}} with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, {{to the delight of}} white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that <b>the</b> <b>Radicals</b> would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Manuel Azaña Díaz and Indalecio Prieto {{worked to}} unify the left and combat its extreme {{elements}} in {{what would become the}} Popular Front; this included staging of large, popular rallies,. Lerroux's Radical government collapsed after two significant scandals, including the Straperlo affair. However, president Niceto Alcalá Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, and called elections. Zamora had become disenchanted with Robles's obvious desire {{to do away with the}} republic and establish a corporate state, and his air of pride. He was looking to strengthen a new center party in place of <b>the</b> <b>Radicals,</b> but the election system did not favour this. Manuel Portela Valladares was thus chosen to form a caretaker government in the meantime. The Republic had, as its opponents pointed out, faced twenty-six separate government crises. Portela failed to get the required support in the parliament to rule as a majority. The government was dissolved on 4 January; the date for elections would be 16 February.|$|E
