5|$|Adrenal {{insufficiency}} (the {{deficiency of}} glucocorticoids) occurs in about 5 in 10,000 {{in the general}} population. Diseases classified as primary adrenal insufficiency (including Addison's disease and genetic causes) directly affect <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex.</b> If a problem that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis arises outside the gland, it is a secondary adrenal insufficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is at the}} centre of each adrenal gland, and is {{surrounded}} by <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex.</b> The chromaffin cells of the medulla are the body's main source of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by the medulla. Approximately 20% noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and 80% adrenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} zone of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> is the zona glomerulosa. It lies immediately {{under the}} fibrous capsule of the gland. Cells in this layer form oval groups, separated by thin strands of connective tissue from the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.|$|E
40|$|Estrogen is a {{steroid hormone}} that regulates embryogenesis, cell {{proliferation}} and differentiation, organogenesis, {{the timing of}} parturition, and fetal imprinting by carrying chemical messages from glands to cells within tissues or organs in the body.

5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased stimulation of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Apart from {{suppression of the}} axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} (also known as suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce {{a variety of}} hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. <b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> itself {{is divided into three}} zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.|$|E
25|$|Because 11Î²-hydroxylase {{activity}} {{is not necessary}} {{in the production of}} sex steroids (androgens and estrogens), <b>the</b> hyperplastic <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> produces excessive amounts of DHEA, androstenedione, and especially testosterone.|$|R

25|$|Androstenedione (Andro): an {{androgenic}} steroid {{produced by}} <b>the</b> testes, <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex,</b> and ovaries. While androstenediones are converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgens, {{they are also}} the parent structure of estrone.|$|R
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognized}} works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 {{with the publication of}} On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule, by the English physician Thomas Addison. In his monography, Addison described what the French physician George Trousseau would later name Addison's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations. In 1894, English physiologists George Oliver and Edward Schafer studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their pressor effects. In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> to treat Addison's disease. Edward Calvin Kendall, Philip Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the adrenal hormones.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{produces}} {{three main}} types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) {{produced in the}} zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes {{that take place in}} cortical cells. The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
25|$|DHEA is {{produced}} in the zona reticularis of <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{under the control of}} adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and by the gonads under the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It is also produced in the brain. DHEA is synthesized from cholesterol via the enzymes cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1; P450scc) and 17Î±-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), with pregnenolone and 17Î±-hydroxypregnenolone as intermediates. It is derived mostly from <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex,</b> with only about 10% being secreted from the gonads. Approximately 50 to 70% of circulating DHEA originates from desulfation of DHEA-S in peripheral tissues. DHEA-S itself originates almost exclusively from <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex,</b> with 95 to 100% being secreted from <b>the</b> <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> in women.|$|E
40|$|Cortisol {{production}} by <b>the</b> human fetal <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{has been shown}} to be not adequate at early gestation.
