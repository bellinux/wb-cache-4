500|$|Kristen Stewart {{was on the}} set of Adventureland when Hardwicke {{visited her}} for an {{informal}} screen test that [...] "captivated" [...] the director. Hardwicke had trouble finding an actor otherworldly enough to play vampire Edward Cullen. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> a call about a guy in London. [...] "I looked at a couple pictures and was like, ‘I’m not sure,’?" [...] Hardwicke says. [...] "He had been fired from his last job, he was unemployed, he was in debt." [...] Pattinson flew to Los Angeles on his own dime to read with Stewart. Shiloh Fernandez, Jackson Rathbone, Ben Barnes, and Robert Pattinson were the final four up for the role of Edward. Hardwicke did not initially choose Robert Pattinson for the role of Edward Cullen, but after an audition at her home with Stewart, he was selected. Hardwicke said, [...] "Kristen was like, ‘It’s got to be Rob!’ She felt connected to him from the first moment. That electricity, or love at first sight, or whatever it is." [...] Hardwicke gave him the part, but he had to make a promise. [...] "You’ve got to realize that Kristen is 17 years old," [...] Hardwicke told him, [...] "She’s underage. You’ve got to focus, dude, or you’re going to be arrested. I made him swear on a stack of Bibles." [...] Pattinson was unfamiliar with the novel series prior to his screen test but read the books later on. Meyer allowed him to view a manuscript of the unfinished Midnight Sun, which chronicles the events in Twilight from Edward's point of view.

[...] Meyer was [...] "excited" [...] and [...] "ecstatic" [...] in response to the casting of the two main characters.

2500|$|Sandé {{said that}} the first track on the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] was a huge [...] "epic pop song" [...] which had {{sweeping}} strings. It came about when {{she was having a}} late night conversation with Naughty Boy, the song's producer with whom she worked throughout the whole album. She said that Naughty Boy had a beat running in the background, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> the first line of the song and the song began to write itself from there. She said; [...] "I love how songs like that develop: before we knew it, we were putting strings on with a synth, Naughty Boy suggested the Funky Drummer loop and it came together really organically." [...] The song was heavily compared to Massive Attack's [...] "Unfinished Sympathy", however Sandé said that she takes it as a compliment as she is a big fan of Massive Attack. However, she said lyrically or melodically the songs are not similar, but the Funky Drummer loop has been used so much and it has strings on people and that is why the connection is made between the two songs. She said she was glad if people get the same vibe from the song, as she loves the song and said the song was [...] "really exciting". Sandé said she also [...] "designed" [...] the song for a night club moment, where everyone can put their hands in the air. The song's genre featured a dubstep pop. Sandé {{said that the}} song was {{based on the fact that}} she believes in God and heaven, although she does not follow a religion. She said that what inspired her the most to write the track was her idea of heaven, which was being surrounded by music and somewhere which is very calm, and she wrote about that in [...] "Heaven".|$|E
