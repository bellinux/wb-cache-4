5|$|However, {{the results}} of Horner and colleagues, Prieto-Márquez, and McDonald and colleagues, which {{consider}} the North American Protohadros to be the closest relative of Eolambia, contradict this hypothesis. <b>This</b> <b>alternative</b> interpretation suggests that the common ancestor of Eolambia, Protohadros, and more derived hadrosauroids was not exclusively Asian, but instead distributed across Asia and North America. McDonald and colleagues further suggested that Eolambia and Protohadros represent a localized group of hadrosauroids endemic to North America, much like other groups of styracosternans throughout the Cretaceous. Such contemporary groups included a central Asian group of Shuangmiaosaurus, Zhanghenglong, and Plesiohadros.|$|E

5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped {{vectored}} thrust twin-Spey design {{as an alternative}} to the BS100. <b>This</b> <b>alternative</b> engine arrangement was widely seen as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E

The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks, which today is memorialized in Idaho's Massacre Rocks State Park.|$|E
5|$|The Word for World is Forest {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Hainish universe, which Le Guin {{introduced}} in her first novel Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In <b>this</b> <b>alternative</b> history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works.|$|E

5|$|The binary GCD {{algorithm}} is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations by exploiting the binary representation used by computers. However, <b>this</b> <b>alternative</b> also scales like O(h²). It is generally {{faster than the}} Euclidean algorithm on real computers, even though it scales in the same way. Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers a and b. The binary algorithm can be extended to other bases (k-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases in speed. Lehmer's GCD algorithm uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximate}} 650 feet long, {{was released}} on June 17, 1910. Some trade publications list {{the length of the}} film as 1000 feet though. The United Kingdom release of the film may have had the name of the hero changed to Peter. A synopsis in The Bioscope on October 27, 1910 refers to the hero by the name Peter. <b>This</b> <b>alternative</b> name for the hero of the story {{can be found in the}} 1910 publication of Reader 1st-4th by D. Appleton and Company. A review in The Moving Picture World was neutral because it lacked specific praise or criticism of the production. The film had a wide release, advertisements for the showing in theaters include those in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Indiana, and Missouri. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of sound films before dubbing and subtitling, one way to present a film to a foreign {{audience}} was to record the film with a translated screenplay with foreign-language cast. As this was a time consuming and expensive procedure, most filmmakers who did this tended to only make one alternative language feature. Producer Seymour Nebenzal felt that creating <b>this</b> <b>alternative</b> version would enhance international sales for The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. The French-language screenplay was adapted by René Sti. Lang was fluent in French and directed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse in both French and German. Actor Karl Meixner played Hofmeister in both versions of the film as he was bilingual. Rudolf Klein-Rogge also features as Mabuse in the French version with his lines being dubbed. The French version, titled Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse, was edited by Lothar Wolff in France while the film was still in production.|$|E

5|$|In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} the formation, as a whole, was not to stay together, saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would break apart. Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes, and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring <b>this</b> <b>alternative.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Royal Commission's {{proposals}} were extensively debated. Hendrick van Kol, {{who was one}} of the leaders of the Social Democratic Workers' Party, argued that building up a strong fleet would hinder Dutch neutrality by making it impossible to avoid battle with foreign fleets which passed through NEI waters en route to other destinations. Other critics of the plan believed that it would be unwise for the Netherlands to join the naval arms race which was taking place in Europe at the time, and that competition between the major powers meant that none of them would allow another nation to occupy either the Netherlands or the NEI. The Dutch Army also opposed the development of a strong fleet in the NEI, arguing that a land force centered on Java would be better able to mount a prolonged resistance against a large invasion force and that reducing the size of the Army to fund the fleet would leave it unable to suppress insurrections. The Governor-General of the NEI, Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg, argued that both a stronger Army and Navy were necessary, and advocated for seven battleships to be stationed in the Indies. He believed that the cost of <b>this</b> <b>alternative</b> could be managed by reducing the planned battleship force in European waters to three small ships. Other supporters of the proposal, led by the Onze Vloot ("Our Fleet") naval advocacy association, argued that it was necessary to build a strong fleet which was capable of defending the NEI as the loss of the colonial empire would greatly damage the Dutch economy and reduce the country's prestige. The Dutch Naval staff also debated the relative merits of torpedo boats and battleships, and concluded that while small craft and submarines were suitable for defending the Netherlands, large warships were needed to effectively protect the sprawling East Indies.|$|E
