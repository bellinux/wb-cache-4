2500|$|Some scholars, such as Kenneth Doo Young Lee, {{interpret}} the Lotus Sutra {{to imply that}} [...] "women were capable of gaining salvation", either after they first turned into a man, or being reborn in Pure Land realm after following the Path. Peter Harvey lists many Sutras that suggest [...] "having faded out <b>the</b> <b>mind-set</b> of a woman and developed <b>the</b> <b>mind-set</b> of a man, {{he was born in}} his present male form", and who then proceeds to follow the Path and became an Arahant. Among Mahayana texts, there is a sutra dedicated to the concept of how a person might be born as a woman. The traditional assertion is that women are more prone to harboring feelings of greed, hatred and delusion than a man. The Buddha responds to this assumption by teaching the method of moral development through which a woman can achieve rebirth as a man.|$|E

Portraying her as an unconventional and [...] "good-hearted kid," [...] Maharidge reported that Sierra took a telemarketing job following the cessation of the controversy: [...] "She was supposed to make two sales a day. The first day, she made five sales, and continued at that rate. When I again talked with her in the winter, she was living in a dorm and attending Marshall University in West Virginia. She was happy and her only complaint was that the classes were too easy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In any event, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas {{became a}} {{benchmark}} in American literature about U.S. {{society in the}} early 1970s. In Billboard magazine, Chris Morris said, [...] "Through Duke and Gonzo's drug-addled shenanigans amid the seediness of the desert pleasure palaces, it perfectly captured the zeitgeist of the post–'60s era". In Rolling Stone magazine, Mikal Gilmore wrote that the novel [...] "peers into {{the best and worst}} mysteries of the American heart" [...] and that Thompson [...] "sought to understand how the American dream had turned a gun on itself". Gilmore believes that [...] "the fear and loathing Thompson was writing about — a dread of both interior demons and the psychic landscape of the nation around him — wasn't merely his own; he was also giving voice to <b>the</b> <b>mind-set</b> of a generation that had held high ideals and was now crashing hard against the walls of American reality".|$|E

40|$|Within a few years, China will be {{the strongest}} and largest {{economy in the world}} and for that reason alone it is {{impossible}} to not hear or know about this country. China is known for its well structured and thought through policies and society structure. Since 1978, when the one child policy was implemented, many complications have occurred due to the changes caused by the policy. The collection of empirical data was done through authors and researchers, who have written reports and made research in this particular field. Additionally we analysed the collected data through the use of Foucault and Foucault inspired theories. We are interested in doing this project, as the problem that we are investigating is an on going problem. We are curious about <b>the</b> <b>mind-sets</b> of <b>the</b> population and how the government is involved in shaping these. What we learned was that China’s society is very complex and intricate, and how the government has a heavy influence on <b>the</b> <b>mind-sets</b> of <b>the</b> population. There are a lot of issues regarding investigating the one child policy, but we chose the issues of the labour market because this was the most interesting aspect. The results were very surprising and multifaceted...|$|R

We test this model in a 2 [*]×[*] 2 design in four Romanian organizations.

Universities that formerly performed many innovations and created technological spillovers should be more desorptive-oriented than others (Arbussà and Coenders 2007), while firms that have some kind of ability to evaluate information (scientific capabilities) and hence the ability to utilize it (technological capabilities) consequently possess highly absorptive capacity and the probability to innovate (Arora and Gambardella 1994). The interaction between universities and firms may then contribute to fill the gap between explorative and exploitative learning capabilities, preventing the valley of death situation.|$|R
