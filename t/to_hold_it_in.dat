5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on {{campaign}} against the Goths) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour. The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius {{had been dead for}} several months by the date stated.|$|E
5|$|At the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the night, and subsequently fell back.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the First Battle of Ruweisat Ridge, which {{commenced}} on 14–15 July, Inglis {{failed to}} adjust his artillery support following concerns raised by Kippenberger and Jim Burrows, the commanders of the brigades {{involved in the}} planned advance on the defended ridge. Instead, he chose to rely on assurances from his corps commander, Lieutenant General William Gott, that British armour would provide any necessary assistance. This {{proved to be a}} mistake; although the brigades manage to seize the ridge, they were unable <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the face of stronger than expected counterattacks, and the expected armour support never fully eventuated. Afterwards, while Inglis was critical of the conduct of the brigades and laid primary blame for the failure on them and the lack of armour, he overlooked the influence of his own role as divisional commander on the outcome of the battle. An attack mounted a few days later by 6th Brigade was a further failure and highlighted Inglis' failings as a divisional commander by not ensuring adequate support from his corps commander.|$|E

5000|$|Doherty {{has played}} {{his entire career}} with a warped cue {{randomly}} selected from the cue rack in his local snooker club, Jason's. Doherty humorously revealed that the club manager originally wanted £5 for it but Doherty haggled him down to £2. Ken Doherty explains, [...] "It's warped. I {{must be one of}} the few professionals playing with a warped cue, but I wouldn't dream of changing it. I have got used <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a certain way, with my eye trained on a piece of grain." ...|$|R

25|$|Hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} observed to use tools when breaking open nuts, for example, {{pieces of wood}} {{being used as a}} wedge. Several birds have wrapped a piece of leaf around a nut <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. This behaviour is also shown by palm cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus). It seems that the hyacinth macaw has an innate tendency to use tools during manipulation of nuts, as naïve juveniles tried out a variety of objects in combination with nuts.|$|E
25|$|Many women, such as {{beauty pageant}} {{participants}} and transgender people, create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly pulling {{them together and}} up. Types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of moleskin under the breasts with tape at the ends <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. Use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes, blisters and skin being torn off.|$|E
25|$|A cricket cap {{is a type}} of soft cap, {{often made}} from felt, that is a {{traditional}} form of headwear for players of the game of cricket, regardless of age or gender. It is usually a tight-fitting skullcap, usually made of six or eight sections, with a small crescent shaped brim that points downwards over the brow to provide shade for the eyes. It is often, but not always, elasticised at the rear <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place upon the wearer's head. Sometimes, rather than tight-fitting, the cricket cap comes in a baggy variety, that is always kept in place by elastic.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the liquor controversy growing in the province, there was another testing of citizens' sentiment on an issue. The government decided to hold a plebiscite among egg producers {{on whether or not}} to establish a compulsory egg marketing board. That plebiscite was originally to be held in June 1957, but Leonard Halmrast, the Minister of Agriculture, decided <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with the liquor plebiscite so that the sentiment of Egg producers could be tested {{at the same time as}} voters for the liquor plebiscite, to save costs. That decision later led to controversy when numerous producers were missed after the plan was defeated in a close vote.|$|E
25|$|The Sec-dependent {{system is}} divided into three {{pathways}}. TAAs are one of those pathways and also go by the name type Vc secretion pathway. The mechanism is split into two. First, the protein must move across the inner membrane or, in other words, translocate, in a Sec-dependent manner via the periplasm. The signal peptide on the N-terminus acts as a temporary tether <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. Next, it must move to the outer membrane. The trimerisation aids translocation, and no translocation would occur without its beta-barrel membrane anchor. The type V secretion system is described as non-fimbrious, meaning that the bacterial cells do not use long physical appendages named pili to attach to one another.|$|E
25|$|Into the 2000s, {{the school}} came under {{criticism}} {{for keeping the}} entirety of the increasingly taxed Norval property while so little of it was actually used; this argument has gained increased credence in light of the consistent yearly tuition hikes and mounting legal costs. Despite repeated assertions that the college had no intention of selling the property, citing not only rapidly increasing land value, but also an intention <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> order to prevent industrial development on land that contains a variety of wildlife, including spotted deer and hares, UCC sold {{a small portion of the}} acreage in 2007 to help cover costs related to the 2003 class action lawsuit brought against the school by former students. In 2011, the Norval Long-Range Planning Committee recommended that Norval's facilities should be expanded to allow for more overnight students and co-educational use.|$|E

25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
500|$|The whole stern {{had broken}} away; {{as it was}} not near the main {{wreckage}} and {{has not yet been}} found, it can be assumed this did not occur on impact with the sea floor. The missing section came away roughly where the torpedo had hit, raising questions of possible structural failure. The stern area had also received several hits, increasing the torpedo damage. This, coupled with the fact the ship sank [...] "stern first" [...] and had no structural support <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place, suggests the stern detached at the surface. In 1942 Prinz Eugen was also torpedoed in the stern, which collapsed. This prompted a strengthening of the stern structures on all German capital ships.|$|E
500|$|In early 1645, Blake sent raiding parties {{out from}} Taunton that, {{according}} to Hyde, controlled {{a large area}} and disrupted activities throughout Somerset. Around that time, Lord Goring, the lieutenant-general of the south-eastern counties in the Royalist army, requested troops from the King {{so that he could}} mount a [...] "large-scale southeastern campaign". His request was rejected, and he was despatched to the South West instead. He duly changed his focus, electing to target first Weymouth, and then Taunton, both Parliamentarian strongholds in the area. He took Weymouth, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the face of Parliamentarian reinforcements. In a letter he received from the King shortly after that loss, he was ordered to gather the Royalist forces of the area together in order to [...] " [...] those parts of the rebels' forces." ...|$|E

500|$|The Mont Blanc massif has {{provided}} numerous opportunities for academic research, {{dating back to}} the very first ascent of Mont Blanc in 1786 during which Michel Paccard carried scientific equipment to confirm it as the highest summit. In 1820, an ill-fated expedition led by Dr Hamel included pigeons intended for release at varying altitudes to measure the impact of reduced air density on their ability to fly. In 1890, Joseph Vallot built a small meteorological observatory at approximately [...] between the Dôme du Goûter and Mont Blanc's summit from where numerous measurements and scientific experiments were conducted. One study involved taking simultaneous temperature measurements made over many months at Chamonix, the Grands Mulets and at the observatory itself. In 1893, Pierre Janssen constructed an astronomical observatory on the top of Mont Blanc, partially buried within the summit ice <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. A [...] telescope and a spectrograph for measuring the oxygen content of the sun were installed. The observatory was removed when it started to collapse around 1906.|$|E

Immediately following this ceremony, the cortege is reformed and proceeds to exit the church, with the priest singing the Magnificat once again.|$|E
2500|$|The 30A plug is {{the largest}} of the family.

Plugs and sockets were usually of an industrial waterproof design with a screw locking ring on the plug <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the socket against waterproof seals, and sockets often had a screw cap chained to them to be used when no plug was inserted to keep them waterproof. Use of the BS546 30A plugs and sockets diminished through the 1970s as they were replaced with BS 4343 (which later became IEC 60309) industrial combo plugs and sockets.|$|E
25|$|The Ravitch {{technique}} is an invasive surgery that {{was introduced in}} 1949 and developed <b>in</b> the 1950s. <b>It</b> involves creating an incision along the chest through which the cartilage is removed and the sternum detached.
