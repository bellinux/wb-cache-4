25|$|Masturbation among {{adolescents}} contributes to them developing {{a sense of}} mastery over sexual impulses, {{and it has a}} role in the physical and emotional development of prepubescents and pubescents. Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals {{in much the same way}} as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection, or <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated and bored. Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|Participation is {{involvement}} in life situations and everyday activities. Participation includes {{the domains of}} self-care, productivity and leisure. In fact, communication, mobility, education, home life, leisure and social relationships require participation and are indicators {{of the extent to}} which a child functions in his or her environment. Barriers can exist on three levels: micro, meso and macro. First, the barriers at the micro level involve the person. Barriers at the micro level include the child's physical limitations (motor, sensory and cognitive impairments) or their subjective feelings regarding their ability to participate. For example, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> not participate in group activities due to lack of confidence. Second, barriers at the meso level include the family and community. These may include negative attitudes of people toward disability or lack of support within the family or in the community. One of the main reasons for this limited support appears to be the result of a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding the child's ability to engage in activities despite his or her disability. Third, barriers at the macro level incorporate the systems and policies that are not in place or hinder children with CP. These may be environmental barriers to participation such as architectural barriers, lack of relevant assistive technology and transportation difficulties due to limited wheelchair access or public transit that can accommodate children with CP. For example, a building without an elevator will prevent the child from accessing higher floors.|$|E

500|$|Alternatively, the two {{variations}} of RAD may develop {{from the same}} inability to develop [...] "stranger-wariness" [...] due to inadequate care. Appropriate fear responses may {{only be able to}} develop after an infant has first begun to form a selective attachment. An infant who is {{not in a position to}} do this cannot afford not to show interest in any person as they may be potential attachment figures. Faced with a swift succession of carers <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> have no opportunity to form a selective attachment until the possible biologically-determined sensitive period for developing stranger-wariness has passed. It is thought this process may lead to the disinhibited form.|$|E
500|$|In DSM-IV-TR the {{inhibited}} form {{is described}} as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses (e.g., <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> respond to caregivers {{with a mixture of}} approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting or may exhibit [...] "frozen watchfulness", hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour). Such infants do not seek and accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain [...] "proximity", an essential element of attachment behavior. The disinhibited form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments (e.g., excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures). There is therefore a lack of [...] "specificity" [...] of attachment figure, the second basic element of attachment behavior.|$|E
500|$|Social context {{involves}} {{pointing out}} social norms and violations of these norms. This form of context is most {{commonly found in}} conversation, as opposed to reading or other word learning environments. A child's understanding of social norms can help them to infer the meaning of words that occur in conversation. In an English-speaking tradition, [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you" [...] are taught to children {{at a very early}} age, so they are very familiar to the child by school-age. For example, if a group of people is eating a meal with the child present and one person says, [...] "give me the bread" [...] and another responds with, [...] "that was rude. What do you say?", and the person responds with [...] "please", <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> not know the meaning of [...] "rude", but can infer its meaning through social context and understanding the necessity of saying [...] "please".|$|E

500|$|Upon birth, a {{child is}} {{initiated}} into the family ritually according to the Rig Veda for the Rigvedi Brahmins. The naming ceremony of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> happen many weeks or even months later, and {{it is called the}} barsa. In many Hindu communities around India, the naming is almost often done by consulting the child's horoscope, in which are suggested various names depending on the child's Lunar sign (called Rashi). However, in Deshastha families, the name that the child inevitably uses in secular functioning is the one decided by his parents. If a name is chosen {{on the basis of the}} horoscope, then that is kept a secret to ward off casting of a spell on the child during his or her life. [...] During the naming ceremony, the child's paternal aunt has the honour of naming the infant. When the child is 11 months old, he or she gets their first hair-cut. This is an important ritual as well and is called Jawal.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Marie met Lieutenant Gheorghe Cantacuzène, a member, albeit {{through an}} illegitimate branch, {{of an ancient}} Romanian princely family and a {{descendant}} of Prince Șerban Cantacuzino. Although not very good looking, Cantacuzène stood out using his sense of humour and fashion, {{as well as his}} talent in horse-riding. The two soon became romantically involved, but their affair was terminated after it became known by the public. As much as she condemned Marie's behaviour, her mother allowed her to come to Coburg when, in 1897, she apparently became pregnant. Historian Julia Gelardi believes that Marie gave birth to a child at Coburg; <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> either have been stillborn or sent to an orphanage immediately following its birth. There was speculation on whether Marie's second daughter, [...] "Mignon", was Cantacuzène's daughter, and not Ferdinand's. Over the following years, Marie was also rumoured to have been romantically linked to Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia, Waldorf Astor, Prince Barbu Știrbey and Joe Boyle. In 1903, Ferdinand and Marie inaugurated Pelișor, an Art Nouveau castle in Sinaia that King Carol commissioned for the royal couple. Marie only learned of the extent of repression used to quell the 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt once {{it was too late to}} intercede. She afterwards took to dressing quite often in folk costume, both at home and in public, initiating a fashion trend among young upper-class women.|$|E
2500|$|In Conservative Judaism, the Milah l'Shem giur {{procedure}} is also performed {{for a boy}} whose mother has not converted, but with the intention that the child be raised Jewish. [...] This conversion of a child to Judaism without {{the conversion of the}} mother is allowed by Conservative interpretations of halakha. Conservative Rabbis will authorize it only under the condition that the child be raised as a Jew in a single-faith household. Should the mother convert, and if the boy has not yet reached his third birthday, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> be immersed in the mikveh with the mother, after the mother has already immersed, to become Jewish. [...] If the mother does not convert, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> be immersed in a mikveh, or body of natural waters, to complete the child's conversion to Judaism. This can be done before the child is even one year old. If the child did not immerse in the mikveh, or the boy was too old, then <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>may</b> choose of their own accord to become Jewish at age 13 as a Bar Mitzvah, and complete the conversion then.|$|E
