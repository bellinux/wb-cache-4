5|$|Perl 5.004 was {{released}} on May 15, 1997, and included among other things the UNIVERSAL package, giving Perl a base object <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>all</b> classes were automatically derived {{and the ability to}} require versions of modules. Another significant development was the inclusion of the CGI.pm module, which contributed to Perl's popularity as a CGI scripting language.|$|E

5|$|Gary Edward Varner (born March 10, 1957) is an American philosopher specialising in {{environmental}} ethics, philosophical {{questions related to}} animal rights and animal welfare, and R. M. Hare's two-level utilitarianism. He is currently {{a professor in the}} Department of Philosophy at Texas A University, and has been based at the university since 1990. He was educated at Arizona State University, the University of Georgia and the University of Wisconsin–Madison; at Madison, where he was supervised by Jon Morline, he wrote one of the first doctoral theses on environmental ethics. Varner's first monograph was In Nature's Interests?, which was published by Oxford University Press in 1998. In the book, Varner defended a form of biocentric individualism, according <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>all</b> living entities have morally considerable interests.|$|E

5|$|Later in Monk's Café, Jerry {{goes back}} on the deal and decides {{not to take the}} place because George wants it. The two {{continue}} to argue about who should own it, and decided that neither of them should take it. A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, {{but it is clear that}} Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>all</b> three ask what the apartment's rent is.|$|E

Meanwhile, Stewie’s time machine plans are accidentally discovered by Lois, who shows them around to the bar's patrons. Angered and upset that his plans have been discovered, Stewie runs upstairs. Soon after, the wives storm the bar and Lois tells them that she only wants to feel appreciated and special, something <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>all</b> the other women relate. Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally starts a fire.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several early Christian fathers and hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit. Where Symeon differed from his predecessors was in his transparent and open sharing of his most interior experiences. Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given {{in the context of}} his teaching that the direct experience of God was something <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>all</b> Christians could aspire.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} with Libya, the imposition by Nigeria {{of an economic}} boycott, and international pressure led to a new international peace conference in Lagos in August, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>all</b> eleven factions present in Chad participated. A new accord was signed on 21 August, under which a new GUNT was to be formed, open to all factions. The French troops were to leave Chad and {{be replaced by a}} multinational African peace force. The new GUNT took office in November, with Goukouni President, Kamougué Vice-President, Habré Defence Minister and Acyl Foreign Minister. Despite the presence of Habré, the new composition of the GUNT had enough pro-Libyans to satisfy Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|Varner's In Nature's Interests? {{offers a}} {{resolution}} of the debate between individualistic approaches to animal rights and holistic accounts of environmental ethics. Varner defends an interest-based biocentric individualism according <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>all</b> living beings—including plants—have morally significant interests that ground prima facie (though overridable) duties. The approach follows {{in the tradition of the}} work of Kenneth Goodpaster and Paul Taylor, though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in its focus on interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear utilitarian commitments.|$|E
