5|$|Kisnorbo scored {{his first}} goal for Leeds against Millwall {{on his return}} to the {{starting}} lineup after missing the previous game against Norwich City having picked up an illness on international duty. His international call-ups along with other internationals at Leeds resulted in games against Swindon Town and Bristol Rovers being postponed. Kisnorbo missed the games against Kettering Town, Oldham Athletic and local rivals Huddersfield Town through an injury he picked up in training. He had not recovered from injury <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a part in the squad in the FA Cup replay to Kettering.

5|$|Other policemen {{arrived in}} Houndsditch, {{and began to}} attend to the wounded. Tucker's body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the London Hospital (now the Royal London Hospital) in Whitechapel Road. Choate was also taken there, where he was {{operated}} on, but he died at 5:30 am on 17 December. Bentley was taken to St Bartholomew's Hospital. He was half-conscious on arrival, but recovered enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a conversation with his pregnant wife and answer questions about the events. At 6:45pm on 17 December his condition worsened, and he died at 7:30. The killings of Tucker, Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders of police officers carried out in Britain in peacetime.|$|E

Subsequently, on his journey into exile, the 14th Dalai Lama completely repudiated the agreement, which he has repeated on many occasions.

25|$|Once work on {{the actual}} Chrono Cross started, the initial vision beyond {{character}} recruitment was even more expansive. The game initially was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the player recruit any person they encountered, through either interacting or battling them. However, eventually the development team found this to be too ambitious, and narrowed it down to 64 playable characters, and then again down to 45 characters for the final game, which were then drawn by character designer Nobuteru Yūki. The backgrounds of some minor characters were left {{to members of the}} staff. The development team also considered the idea of having each character have their own ending, each with three variant scenarios based on events occurred in the game, leading to over 120 endings, but the idea was scrapped as being not feasible.|$|E

500|$|Cohan viewed Bela as [...] "a {{young woman}} {{trying to make}} a living and find some kind of reason in her world" [...] who was [...] "a little damaged." [...] The actress shared Gamble's opinion of Bela's {{behavior}} being a façade, and incorporated into her performance the idea of Bela hiding her true self, with Cohan feeling that her character created a persona to shield her from [...] "real strong connections". This defensiveness prevented her from opening up to the Winchesters, with whom Cohan believed Bela [...] "would have loved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a normal relationship". Contrary to Kripke and Gamble's assessment of Bela as amoral and uncaring, Cohan envisioned the character as having [...] "fits of conscience" [...] offscreen throughout the third season.

500|$|In {{response}} to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to {{advance the cause of}} homosexuals and provide social opportunities where gays and lesbians could socialize without fear of being arrested. Los Angeles area homosexuals created the Mattachine Society in 1950, in the home of communist activist Harry Hay. Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist [...] "sexual deviants" [...] with legal troubles. Facing enormous opposition to its radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gays and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals. Soon after, several women in San Francisco met in their living rooms to form the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) for lesbians. Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the episode was a one line concept card stating [...] "Lightning Boy" [...] {{that had been}} tacked to a board in series creator Chris Carter's office since the first season. Carter's idea was solely about a boy who could control lightning, and the concept wasn't fleshed out into an episode until the third season. Writer Howard Gordon stated that the key moment in the episode's conception came {{when he decided to}} use the boy's power as a metaphor for disenfranchised adolescence. Gordon described the episode's concept as [...] "Beavis and Butt-head electrified". Gordon claimed that the episode suffered conceptually having come directly after a trilogy of mythology episodes. Story editor Frank Spotnitz claims that there were originally ideas on incorporating some of the events from that trilogy into this episode, but those ideas were eventually scrapped due to the producer's desire for each episode <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> its own integrity and stand alone. Spotnitz said the episode was a risky one to do for a show with an adult audience due to the high school setting {{and the fact that the}} episode was about adolescence and violent impulses when one is a kid.|$|E

500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still better to get rid of the junta and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E
