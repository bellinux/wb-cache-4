In later periods ancient jade shapes, shapes derived from bronze sacrificial vessels, and motifs of painting were used, essentially to demonstrate the craftsman's extraordinary <b>technical</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{praised the}} film with the {{following}} statement, [...] "Two years ago, Walt Disney Pictures reinvented the animated feature, not only {{with an eye toward}} pleasing children, but also with an older, savvier audience in mind. Disney truly bridged a generation gap with The Little Mermaid... Now, lightning has definitely struck twice with Beauty and the Beast." [...] Awarding the film a perfect score of four stars, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared Beauty and the Beast positively to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio, writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast reaches back to an older and healthier Hollywood tradition in which the best writers, musicians and filmmakers are gathered for a project on the assumption that a family audience deserves great entertainment, too." [...] In 2001 Ebert again gave the IMAX re-release a full 4 out of 4 stars. James Berardinelli of ReelViews rated the film similarly while hailing it as [...] "the finest animated movie ever made", writing, [...] "Beauty and the Beast attains a nearly-perfect mix of romance, music, invention, and animation." [...] The use of computer animation, particularly in the ballroom sequence, was singled out in several reviews as one of the film's highlights. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, calling the film [...] "A delightfully satisfying modern fable, a near-masterpiece that draws on the sublime traditions of the past while remaining completely in sync with the sensibility of its time." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It is a surprise, in a time of sequels and retreads, that the new film is so fresh and altogether triumphant in its own right." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Beauty and the Beast is certainly adequate holiday entertainment for children and their more indulgent parents..... But the film has little of the <b>technical</b> <b>facility,</b> vivid characterization and emotional impact of Disney past." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{while the}} {{euphonium}} was not historically {{part of the}} standard jazz big band or combo, the instrument's <b>technical</b> <b>facility</b> and large range make it well-suited to a jazz solo role, and a jazz euphonium niche has been carved out over the last 40 or so years, largely starting with the pioneer Rich Matteson (see [...] "List of important players" [...] below). [...] The euphonium can also double on a trombone part in a jazz combo. Jazz euphoniums {{are most likely to}} be found in tuba-euphonium groups, though modern funk or rock bands occasionally feature a brass player doubling on euphonium, and this trend is growing.|$|E

2500|$|His {{parents were}} American, {{but he was}} trained in Paris prior to moving to London. Sargent enjoyed {{international}} acclaim as a portrait painter, although not without controversy and some critical reservation; an early submission to the Paris Salon, his Portrait of Madame X, was intended to consolidate his position as a society painter, but it resulted in scandal instead. From the beginning his work was characterized by remarkable <b>technical</b> <b>facility,</b> particularly {{in his ability to}} draw with a brush, which in later years inspired admiration as well as criticism for a supposed superficiality. His commissioned works were consistent with the grand manner of portraiture, while his informal studies and landscape paintings displayed a familiarity with Impressionism. In later life Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work, and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working en plein air. He lived most of his life in Europe. [...] Art historians generally ignored the society artists such as Sargent until the late 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Rutter's {{music is}} very popular, {{particularly}} in the USA. In the UK many hold him in high regard, {{as illustrated by the}} following quotation from a review in the London Evening Standard (25 September 2005): [...] "For the infectiousness of his melodic invention and consummate craftsmanship, Rutter has few peers". [...] Sue Lawley referred to Rutter as [...] "the most celebrated and successful composer of carols alive today" [...] and Sean Rafferty heralded Rutter as [...] "a creator of not just carols, but wonderfully great things for the human voice." [...] One British composer, David Arditti, didn't regard him as a sufficiently [...] "serious" [...] composer, saying that Rutter is [...] "hard to take seriously, because {{of the way in which}} his sheer <b>technical</b> <b>facility</b> or versatility leads to a superficial, unstable crossover style which is neither quite classical nor pop, and which tends towards mawkish sentimentality in his sugarily-harmonised and orchestrated melodies." [...] The Guardian remarked that [...] "it is as a writer of carols that he has really made his mark … His larger-scale works – particularly the Gloria (1974), Requiem (1985) and Magnificat (1990) – are also well established in the choral repertoire." [...] David Willcocks considered Rutter [...] "the most gifted composer of his generation." ...|$|E
