500|$|Fonville noted at {{the time}} that, in his opinion, speed was more {{essential}} than beef and weight in the shot put. Speaking about his technique, Fonville said, [...] "You concentrateand <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> try to explode across the circle." [...] His coach, Ken Doherty, described Fonville as [...] "one of the hardest working, most studious athletes" [...] he had ever coached. Doherty also added that Fonville's technique distinguished him from most shot putters: [...] "Fonville drives completely across the ring in one continuous motion. Previously, most shotputters made their initial hop and hesitated before their final drive. ... Any track coach looking at him, would recognize all the points of good form. The {{only difference is that}} he has unusual speed and quicknessand he is the greatest competitor I've ever coached." [...] One columnist described Fonville's steady improvement from his freshman year in 1946 through his junior year in 1948 and concluded: [...] "Small as shot-putters go, Fonville is the greatest in the long history of sensational [...] heavers." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{the process}} for Yield and Binaural, band members worked on {{material}} individually before starting the recording sessions together. According to Cameron, everyone in the band had [...] "four or five" [...] ideas coming into the sessions, and there was [...] "a lot to just kind of weed through and work on." [...] The band often recorded material intended to be demo recordings, but lead vocalist Eddie Vedder would come along and record his vocals afterwards, stating, [...] "I just sang it, that's the take." [...] Regarding the creative process, guitarist Stone Gossard said that while playing alone [...] "the anal-retentive side of you goes, 'I think I could play better.'", but when reuniting [...] "the entire band goes 'No, it's great as it is,' <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> get in the mood and embrace it." [...] Gossard stated that [...] "the process of letting go is constant in this band", adding that bandmembers would arrive with [...] "a clear idea of what a song is going to be" [...] but eschew for other musical ideas while discussing the song with the group. Riot Act was the first Pearl Jam album to feature Kenneth [...] "Boom" [...] Gaspar on Keyboards, most notably on the song [...] "Love Boat Captain". According to Gaspar, the song initially developed out of a jam session he had with Vedder in Hawaii shortly after the two first met. When they were done, Vedder asked Gaspar if he was [...] "ready to go to Seattle." [...] According to Gossard, bringing in Gaspar was about being [...] "open to new things," [...] while Vedder stated Gaspar [...] "was able to find his place" [...] and fit in easily with the band dynamics. Guitarist Mike McCready {{said that he had}} always wanted the band to feature keyboards.|$|E

2500|$|Bjelland {{has been}} noted by music critics for her unique {{screaming}} vocals. Journalist Richard Cromelin noted in a 1992 Los Angeles Times profile that [...] "She retches her enraged lyrics, her screams skid across the beat and collide with the blunt riffs. Her voice erupts into laughs and gargles, then croons down low with eerie detachment." [...] Commenting on her musical aspirations, Bjelland said: [...] "It should sound like nothing that you've heard before. That's my intention... Like my singing, all I {{try to do is}} I just push myself into things where I think I can't reach notes and stuff. Sometimes it sounds really ridiculous, but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> kind of work on it." [...] In Babes in Toyland, Bjelland's instrumentation and songwriting have been described as [...] "ugly, crunching post-punk," [...] supplemented by [...] "rudimentary" [...] guitar chords.|$|E
2500|$|The use of voxels, however, meant 3D accelerators couldn't be used, {{as there}} would be too many polygons for a card to render. Instead, the {{designers}} used a fast rectangular rendering routine that rendered a rectangle whenever it had to draw a polygon. Speaking in 2014, Castle said [...] "people ask {{me all the time}} [...] "Why didn't you just use 3D?" [...] Well, that's easy to say now we have full rendering pipelines and shaders, but back <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> didn't. You had a few vertex-shaded polygons and the texel mapping just wasn't accurate on a lot of the cards. Nowadays I'd do it all in 3D." [...] Another reason for not using 3D accelerators was that the game features roughly 140 locations, most of them open to player exploration. Each of these locations featured millions of polygons, well beyond the capabilities of even the most high end graphics cards of the time.|$|E

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> want to forget this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, so you could surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out and doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
