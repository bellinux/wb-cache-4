Trying to save what could still be saved, an operation <b>to</b> <b>sift</b> <b>through</b> the debris was started by Zachi Zweig and Gabriel Barkay. The ongoing Temple Mount Sifting Project has resulted in the recovery of many architectural fragments from the Second Temple buildings as well as remnants from all other historical periods since the First Temple Period.|$|E

This hope inspired them and their successors <b>to</b> <b>sift</b> <b>through</b> the mountains of rubbish at Oxyrhynchus for the next century. Their efforts were amply rewarded: {{it has been estimated}} that over 70% of all the literary papyri so far discovered come from Oxyrhynchus, both copies of well-known standard works (many in versions significantly closer to the originals than those that had been transmitted in medieval manuscripts) and previously unknown works by the greatest authors of antiquity.|$|E

In March 2008, the band attempted to enter the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only musical act to perform in all seven continents in nine months, planning to perform in Antarctica for an audience of scientists. However, the group was unable to make the flight from Punta Arenas, Chile to Antarctica due to poor weather. Despite this unsuccessful attempt, the group felt energized from the experience and became inspired to write more music. This led to more material <b>to</b> <b>sift</b> <b>through</b> when the band decided to enter the studio. Fall Out Boy spent time during June 2008 formulating ideas at Avron's home, where [...] "three to four" [...] song ideas were developed. Lead vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump and bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz began turning these ideas into songs over the following month. Wentz explained that the process was the same as usual: [...] "I'll go over to Patrick's house and he'll kind of just sit there and play songs, and I'll be like, 'Ah, that one's awesome!'" ...|$|E

In what Gladwell contends is an age of information overload, he finds that experts often make better decisions with snap judgments than they do with volumes of analysis. This is commonly called [...] "Analysis paralysis." [...] The challenge is <b>to</b> <b>sift</b> <b>through</b> and focus on only the most critical information.

Brandy McDonnell of NewsOK was mixed, writing that Goodrem [...] "boasts a lovely clear voice, but the uneven and slickly produced album, clearly designed to appeal to mainstream radio, doesn't do much to separate her from the Natasha Bedingfields and Colbie Caillats already crooning over the airways," [...] but went on to praise the [...] "'pop jewels' among all the sludge and rocks to make it worth the effort <b>to</b> <b>sift</b> <b>through</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bowie Kuhn {{replaced}} William Eckert as the Commissioner of Baseball in 1969. In {{the wake}} of Ted Williams' 1966 Hall of Fame induction speech urging the induction of Negro leaguers, and {{on the recommendation of}} the Baseball Writers' Association of America, Kuhn empowered a ten-man committee <b>to</b> <b>sift</b> <b>through</b> hundreds of names and nominate the first group of four Negro league players to go to the Hall of Fame. Because Paige pitched in Greensboro in 1966, he would not have been eligible for enshrinement until 1971, as players have to be out of professional baseball {{for at least five years}} before they can be elected. All of the men on the committee agreed that Paige had to be the first Negro league player to get elected, so this gave Kuhn plenty of time to create some sort of Negro league branch in the Hall of Fame. On February 9, 1971, Kuhn announced that Paige would be the first member of the Negro wing of the Hall of Fame. Because many in the press saw the suggestion of a [...] "Negro wing" [...] as separate-but-equal and denounced major league baseball for the idea, by the time that Paige's induction came around on August 9, Kuhn convinced the owners and the private trust of the Hall of Fame that there should be no separate wing after all. It was decided that all who had been chosen and all who would be chosen would get their plaques in the [...] "regular" [...] section of the Hall of Fame. Paige could not get a job in the major leagues after part of his HOF induction speech was misinterpreted as bitter anger, instead of grateful, by the still largely white baseball elite. Satchel enjoyed a brief run of renewed popularity after his HOF induction appearing on a few TV shows and making the rounds of the Major Leagues Old Timers Games Circuit. After the buzz died down he took a job with the Tulsa Oilers minor league team in the early 1970s as their pitching coach. During the mid-to-late 1970s he finally slowed down his traveling ways making only occasional personal appearances at mostly minor league stadiums and banquets. In 1980 Satchel was named vice-president of the Triple-A Springfield Cardinals, although it was mostly an honorary position.|$|E
