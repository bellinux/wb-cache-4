5|$|Britain was {{challenged}} again by France under Napoleon, {{in a struggle}} that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations.</b> It was not only Britain's position {{on the world stage}} that was at risk: Napoleon threatened to invade Britain itself, just as his armies had overrun many countries of continental Europe.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>nation</b> {{theory was}} {{opposed by the}} Deobandi scholars, a {{departure}} from the position of their predecessors Shah Waliullah, Syed Ahmed and Muhammad Ismail. The principal of Darul Ulum Deoband, Maulana Hussain Ahmad Madni, not only opposed <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nation</b> theory but sought to redefine Indian Muslim nationhood. He advocated Indian nationalism, believing that nations in modern times were formed on the basis of land. [...] He and other leading Deobandi ulama endorsed territorial nationalism, arguing that Islam permitted it. Despite opposition from most Deobandi scholars, Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi and Mufti Muhammad Shafi instead opted to justify <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nation</b> theory and concept of Pakistan. Likewise, the Barelwi ulama supporting the Muslim League and its Pakistan demand, argued that befriending 'unbelievers' was forbidden in Islam.|$|R

5|$|Successive Australian governments saw good {{relations}} {{and stability in}} Indonesia (Australia's largest neighbour) as providing an important security buffer to Australia's north, but the East Timor issue complicated co-operation between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations.</b> Australia provided important sanctuary to East Timorese independence advocates like José Ramos-Horta (who based himself in Australia during his exile).|$|E

His father named him in honour of Argentine footballer Diego Maradona despite the rivalry between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations,</b> and he has an elder brother named Jair after Brazilian player Jairzinho. Despite {{regularly}} playing street football, Costa did not believe as a child that he would turn professional, {{in part due to}} the remote location of his hometown. He has since set up a football academy in his hometown, where he pays all the costs. Costa is a fan of Palmeiras.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{victories}} of Barack Obama and the Democratic Party in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, {{relations between}} Bolivia and the U.S. improved slightly, and in November 2009 the countries entered negotiations to restore diplomatic relations. After the U.S. backed the 2011 {{military intervention in}} Libya by NATO forces, Morales condemned Obama, calling for his Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations</b> restored diplomatic relations in November 2011, although Morales refused to allow the DEA back into the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, Napoleon and Czar Alexander {{met at the}} Congress of Erfurt to {{preserve}} the Russo-French alliance. The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807. By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was {{under pressure from the}} Russian nobility to break off the alliance. A major strain on the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations</b> became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.|$|E
5|$|In foreign policy, Key has {{supported}} closer {{relations with the}} United States, an ANZUS defence partner. On 4 November 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and New Zealand Foreign Minister Murray McCully signed the Wellington Declaration. The agreement signals {{an increase in the}} strategic partnership between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations</b> and covers areas of co-operation including nuclear proliferation, climate change and terrorism. This was followed in June 2012 by a companion document, the Washington Declaration. Since 2008 Key has also engaged in Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations with the United States and other Asia-Pacific economies.|$|E
50|$|This {{criticism}} {{has received a}} mixed response in Pakistan. A poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan in 2011 shows that {{an overwhelming majority of}} Pakistanis held the view that separation from India was justified in 1947.

In his absence, Monty Noble captained the Australian team against the touring English in 190304.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2005, North Korea and South Korea held {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} possibility of sending a united team to the 2008 Olympics. The proposal failed, because of disagreements about how athletes would be chosen; North Korea was demanding a certain percentage representation for its athletes. A subsequent attempt to broker an agreement for <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations</b> to walk together during the March of Nations failed as well, despite their having done so during the 2000 and 2004 Games.|$|E

5|$|The convoy {{had also}} been {{augmented}} by the United States government, in both cargo and shipping, as repayment for French financial, moral and military support during the American Revolution. In supporting the French Revolution in this way, the American government, urged especially by Ambassador Gouverneur Morris, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France. Friendly relations between the United States and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>nations</b> would be engaged in the Quasi War.|$|E
