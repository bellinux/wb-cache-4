However, {{little has}} been reported on their potential effects on cast automotive aluminum alloys. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the tribological properties of as-sprayed NiCrBSi and WC/ 12 Co Flame Spray coatings applied to two cast aluminum alloys: high-copper LM 24 (AlSi 8 Cu 3 Fe), and low-copper LM 25 (AlSi 7 Mg). Potential interactions between the mechanical properties of the substrate and the deposited coatings were deemed to be significant. Microstructural, microhardness, friction, and wear (pin-on-disk, microabrasion, <b>Taber</b> <b>abrasion,</b> etc.) results are reported, and the performance differences between coatings on the different substrates were noted. The coefficient of friction was reduced from 0. 69 - 0. 72 to 0. 12 - 0. 35. Wear (pin-on-disk) was reduced by a factor of 103 - 104, which was related to the high surface roughness of the coatings. Microabrasion wear was dependent on coating hardness and applied load. <b>Taber</b> <b>abrasion</b> results showed a strong dependency on the substrate, coating morphology, and homogeneity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} nano-silica {{particles}} on the protective properties of polyurethane (PU) coatings has been investigated. Current PU clear coats have shown promising scratch, abrasion and UV resistance properties, however their corrosion resistance {{has not been}} much investigated. This study focuses {{on the effect of}} non-polar nano-silica particles on electrochemical properties of 2 -pack polyurethane matrix. Nano silica was incorporated at different levels into acrylic polyol/HDI polyisocyanate polyurethane matrix and cured at three different temperatures (20 °C, 70 °C and 110 °C). DC resistance technique and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) have been employed to evaluate protective properties. Free films were prepared to determine the water-uptake using coating capacitance function measured {{in the early stages of}} exposure. Also the effect of nanoparticles on cross-linking density and glass transition temperature (Tg) was investigated by Dynamical Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) technique. Abrasion resistance was evaluated using <b>Taber</b> <b>abrasion</b> tester by measuring the weight loss from a coated panel. Electrochemical results showed a positive effect on the permeability properties for PU coatings with 5 % of embedded nano-silica particles. Also coatings cured at higher temperatures showed improved protective properties. The Tg also increased with elevated curing temperature which was attributed to an increase in cross-linking density. The <b>Taber</b> <b>abrasion</b> test indicates that both, nano-silica particles and higher curing temperatures enhance abrasion resistance...|$|E

Various amounts of carbonated silica particles directly added into carbonated soybean oil (CSBO) and carbonated polypropylene glycol (CPPG) resin mixture to prepare polyurethane–silica nanocomposite coating compositions by nonisocyanate route using an aliphatic diamine as a curing agent.

This multilayer system is designed to shield the infrared energy of solar spectrum by interference reflection. The abrasion resistance of the multilayer stacks was also estimated by the Haze value after the <b>Taber</b> <b>abrasion</b> test.

40|$|The {{influence}} offormulation components on the physical, {{mechanical and}} optical properties of hot melt thermoplastic road markings was studied. To minimize {{the number of}} experiments, mixture method {{was used as an}} effective tool for experimentaldesign. Binder (rosin ester and hydrocarbon based resins), pigment (TiO 2), filler (talc) and plasticizer (long oil alkyd resin and dibutyl phthalate) were taken into consideration as the key factors at different levels. A range offormulations were prepared by melt blending of variables and other required components. Softening point temperature (Tsp) and its changes (ΔTsp), <b>Taber</b> <b>abrasion</b> resistance, color difference (ΔE) before and after exposure to the accelerated weathering conditions and heat stability test, were chosen as the key responses. A window of optimum end-use properties of thermoplastic road marking formulations was narrowed down within the range of desired responses in quadratic model using DX v. 7. 1. 3 program. The results showed that the optimized formulations were very close to those from the regression analysis, and the mixture experimental design was an effectual method to optimize the composition of a thermoplastic road marking formulation with respect to its properties.

40|$|Functional {{coatings}} {{on position}} 1 produce a huge interest in many fields of applications. Since these coatings {{are exposed to}} atmospheric conditions and natural environment such as dust, dirt or salt, their resistance to mechanical abrasion and their chemical stability is crucial for their function over lifetime. The use of float glass and a heat treatable and bendable coating is necessary for cost-effective production of curved and toughened glass. At Fraunhofer IST a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coating has been developed for position 1 based on a high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) generator. For depositing ITO films at varying deposition parameter a prototype power supply from Advanced Energy was used. This technique offers the interesting possibility to achieve films with low surface roughness and excellent conductivity by using an inline sputter coater. The ionization of the sputtered material helps structuring the formation in the initial steps of film growth. The deposition at low substrate temperatures shows superior electrical properties compared to DC sputtering [1]. Fields of application for this coating are photovoltaics, low emissivity coatings, heat mirrors or panel heaters as well as touch panels and displays. ITO film properties have been studied by optical spectroscopy (UV/VIS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Mechanical stability has been tested by <b>taber</b> <b>abrasion</b> and analysed with haze measurements. Furthermore, the results are compared to conventional DC sputtered ITO films and evaluated in respect of lifetime stability as well as coat and bend applicability...|$|E
40|$|A {{cavitating}} high-pressure water-jet {{provided the}} means by which a range of materials (plastics, clay and concrete) were eroded. The measured erosion resistance was a proxy for an initially unknown combination of other properties: strength, fracture toughness, impact resistance, hardness, surface roughness, and limiting service temperature. To ascertain the cause of damage to sewers during high-pressure water-jetting, information about which material properties contributed to the measured erosion resistance under a standard high-pressure water-jetting test were found. The experimental work, and published literature, provided a database of physico-mechanical, physico-chemical, thermal and tribological material properties each of which in turn were correlated with the measured jetting resistance. The properties best correlated with the jetting resistance were: maximum service temperature (R 2  =  0 ṡ 93), elastic modulus (R 2  =  0 ṡ 90), surface roughness (R 2  =  0 ṡ 89), density (R 2  =  0 ṡ 87), and thermal conductivity (R 2  =  0 ṡ 87). The correlation coefficient between jetting resistance and impact resistance (R 2  =  0 ṡ 56) lay just outside the top 10, suggesting that this was not an impact problem but a more complex combination of strength, roughness, and heat dissipation despite actual failures ultimately resulting from fracture (for which toughness was nevertheless also poorly correlated (R 2  =  − 0 ṡ 38)). Traditional mechanical wear, abrasion, and erosion resistance parameters (<b>Taber</b> <b>abrasion</b> (R 2  =  − 0 ṡ 24), limiting pressure-velocity (R 2  =  − 0 ṡ 57), and wear index (R 2  =  − 0 ṡ 23)) failed to correlate with the jetting resistance...|$|E

Bisphenol-A glycerolate (1 glycerol/phenol) diacrylate resin {{was added to the}} inorganic part in predetermined amounts. The resultant mixture was utilized in the preparation of free films as well as coatings on aluminum substrates. Thermal and mechanical tests such as DSC, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), and tensile and shore D hardness tests were performed on free films. Water contact angle, gloss, <b>Taber</b> <b>abrasion</b> test, cross-cut and tubular impact tests were conducted on the coated samples. SEM examination and EDS analysis was performed on the fractured surfaces of free films. The hybrid coatings on the aluminum sheets gave rise to properties such as moderately glossed surface; low wear rate and hydrophobicity. Tensile strength of free films increased with up to 10 % inorganic content in the hybrid structure and this increase was approximately three times that of the control sample. As expected; the % strain value decreased by 17. 3 with the increase in inorganic content and elastic modulus values increased by a factor of approximately 6. Resistance to ketone-based solvents was proven and an increase in hardness was observed as the ratio of the inorganic part increased.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the structural weight of many common commercial aircrafts is composed of high strength aluminum alloys. The properties of high performance aluminum alloys such as a high strength to weight ratio (specific strength), ease of recycling, crash energy absorption capacity, and corrosion resistance make them ideal {{for use in the}} aerospace field. As a result of the high performance nature of the parts and specific properties of the materials, manufacturing requires intricate casting, precision machining, and specific heat treatments – which results in expensive components. As a result of its excellent corrosion resistance properties, pure aluminum coatings are commonly used in the aerospace field for corrosion protection of steel, aluminum alloy components, and titanium alloy components. The common method to deposit these coatings is called ion vapour deposition (IVD). These IVD aluminum coatings provide the coating adhesion, coverage, thickness, and corrosion resistance required to protect the part. The present study was motivated by the potential use of the cold gas dynamic spray (CGDS) process to repair a) damaged aluminum alloy aerospace parts and b) damaged pure aluminum IVD coatings. The primary research objective was to successfully produce these repairs using commercially available aluminum alloy feedstock powders deposited with commercially available CGDS equipment. This work was treated as prequalification work for The Boeing Company to commercialize this process and therefore the repairs aim to meet the same standards (military and industrial) required of the original aluminum alloy parts and IVD aluminum coatings. The use of CGDS was shown in this research to be a very promising as a process for the restoration of aluminum alloy aerospace components. The adhesion strength of the repaired aluminum components was found to be well above the accepted range for thermally sprayed repairs according to industrial standards. The repairs were subjected to a highly corrosive environment and showed only minor pitting. These sites could be reduced in the future with improved machining techniques and attention to surface detail prior to exposure to the salt fog. The only requirement that the repaired components did not meet was for the wear properties of the anodized layer, measured thought <b>Taber</b> <b>abrasion</b> testing. The results of this test, at times, approached the desired values, and it is believed that, in the future, the quality and consistency of the coatings could be improved and the test would meet industrial standards. The results of this research show that the use of CGDS as a process for the restoration of damaged aluminum IVD coatings is possible and is a promising alternative to conventional methods. The CGDS coatings were scrutinized to the same level as required of IVD coatings when they replaced toxic cadmium coatings in the late 1980 s. The coating adhesion, demonstrated through glass bead abrasion and strip rupture testing, was shown to meet the current industrial standards. The corrosion testing of the repairs resulted in no visible red rust of the steel components, even when the steel was exposed...|$|E
