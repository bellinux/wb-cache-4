500|$|Charlie McCollum for the Knight Ridder {{newspapers}} {{said that}} the first half fell flat on promises made to rejuvenate the series, adding that [...] "Storm Front" [...] represented [...] "a confusing premise, flat production and recycled stories." [...] Jamahl Epsicokhan, at his website Jammer's Reviews, gave both parts {{two and a half}} out of four stars. He wrote that the episode [...] "inherits so much nonsensical time-travel baggage from previous episodes (including last season's final 60 seconds) that the premise is all but indefensible" [...] and ultimately the episode [...] "breaks down the entire temporal war (at least I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does)</b> to a single battle in Earth's past, that revolves around a single sci-fi MacGuffin: Vosk's conduit that the Nazis are constructing for him." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Redux" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, awarded {{the first episode}} a C+ rating and wrote that [...] "'Redux ' {{was a pretty good}} episode back in 1997. It’s not a very good episode now". VanDerWerff noted that the idea that Mulder had killed himself was not effective because the show's audience knew that a movie had been scheduled for release in the summer of 1998. Finally, he called the episode's ending [...] "one of the show’s weaker cliffhangers". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave {{the first part of the}} episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the story's pacing, noting that the episode [...] "is all plot, plot, plot. [...] much of the plot is unbelievable." [...] Furthermore, Vitaris criticized several plot holes in the episode, including Mulder's easy entrance into the Department of Defense and the characters antics, such as his attack of Ostelhoff. However, despite the overall negative review, Vitaris did mention that, [...] "There's only one truly galvanizing scene, as that's the confrontation between Scully and Skinner after he follows her to the lab where she is performing her DNA test." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two heavily criticized the [...] "Skinner-as-traitor" [...] plot, noting sardonically that [...] "the production team aren't going to do , and the shock 'villain in the room' reveal will be Section Chief Blevins–a character so important in the framework of the series that, barring his appearance in the Season Four finale, we haven't seen him in ninety-four episodes." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files named [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II", together, as the tenth best [...] "Episode of All Time". In his critique of [...] "Redux", he noted [...] "While many people don't care for 'Redux', I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> a good job of preparing us for the second hour (although, it invalidates Gillian's emotional context from the S4 finale)." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E
2500|$|Searle argues that, without [...] "understanding" [...] (or [...] "intentionality"), {{we cannot}} {{describe}} what {{the machine is}} doing as [...] "thinking" [...] and, since it does not <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have a [...] "mind" [...] in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that [...] "strong AI" [...] is false.|$|E

2500|$|Mulroney's [...] was {{released}} on September 10, 2007. Mulroney criticizes Trudeau for avoiding military service in World War II, and favourably references sources that describe the young Trudeau as holding anti-Semitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators. Tom Axworthy, a prominent Liberal strategist, responded that Trudeau should be judged on his mature views. Historian and former MP and Trudeau biographer John English said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> any good {{to do this kind}} of historical ransacking to try to destroy reputations".|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{was raised}} in the Church of Christ. According to Thompson, his values come from [...] "sitting around the kitchen table" [...] with his parents, and from the Church of Christ. While talking to reporters in South Carolina, Thompson said, [...] "I attend church when I'm in Tennessee. I'm [...] in McLean right now. I don't attend {{regularly}} when I'm up there." [...] On occasion, Thompson attended Vienna Presbyterian Church in Vienna, Virginia. He did not speak much about his religion during his campaign, saying, [...] "Me getting up and talking about what a wonderful person I am and that sort of thing, I'm not comfortable with that, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> me any good." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in {{an answer}} to a {{parliamentary}} question, that [...] "Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq {{of weapons of mass}} destruction..." [...] In November of that year, Blair further stated that, [...] "So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not régime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> enormous damage to the Iraqi people ... so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, {{but on the other hand}} I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brennan next {{turned to}} the workers' first two claims. [...] The {{majority}} noted that NLRA Section 8(a)(3) contains two provisions which clearly permit agency fee agreements. For the majority, [...] "The statutory question presented in this case, then, is whether this 'financial core' includes the obligation to support union activities beyond those germane to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. We <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not." [...] The majority reviewed the Court's previous decision in Machinists v. Street and found it controlling. The majority further concluded that Section 8(a)(3) and Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act were statutorily equivalent. The majority reviewed at length the legislative history of both the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act to provide support for this conclusion, and to show why in each case Congress had approved of agency fee agreements. Relying on the Court's analysis of the Railway Labor Act in Street, the Supreme Court said CWA was not justified in concluding that Section 8(a)(3) permits the collection of agency fees {{in excess of the}} amount necessary to cover the costs of collective bargaining. The majority further found that the legislative history of the NLRA, the Taft-Hartley Act, and the Railway LAbor Act (RLA) showed that Congress intended to restrict agency fee agreements to cover collective bargaining alone and no other purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Monson {{booked a}} two-hour session with songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter to adjust {{one of their}} compositions. Finishing the {{adjustment}} in 45 minutes, they {{decided to use the}} remaining time to write another song so that they would not waste the money for the studio time they paid for. [...] "Good for You" [...] was subsequently written in 45 minutes. It began with Monson playing its bassline and putting a snap on it before Michaels freestyled the opening lyric, [...] "I'm on my 14 carats". Her lyrics were influenced by her boyfriend who told her, [...] "Julia, you never write any happy songs for me. It's kind of sad," [...] to which she responded: [...] "Fine, I'll write a good song about you, shut up!". Tranter's lyrics were inspired by his ex-boyfriend who preferred him to dress femme. Upon hearing [...] "Good for You", the trio's A told them that the song should be recorded by Selena Gomez, despite Tranter initially thinking the song was [...] "too indie" [...] for her. The A sent the track to the singer who [...] "freaked out", deeming it the artistic direction she had envisioned for her second studio album, Revival (2015). She described the song as [...] "a piece that was just everything I feel a woman should embody, but not in the obvious way" [...] and explained to iHeartRadio: [...] "I think it just sets the tone perfect for the record just because it's sexy, but not trying too hard. The track and everything kind of does it itself. It's sensual, it reps women in a good way. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> something to a woman when they look good".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, my {{object in}} that, was, almost entirely, to persuade you to reform, {{without having to}} speak to you directly.

If the Committee <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> <b>it</b> may request information from the minister responsible for the bill or seek advice more widely. The Committee can simply publish the correspondence with the minister, or publish {{a report on the}} bill where this is thought to be necessary or desirable. These reports inform the deliberations of the House of Lords on the bill in question.|$|R

Football club AZ (Alkmaar Zaanstreek) was founded in Zaandam on May 10, 1967.|$|R
60|$|I {{have read}} {{a good deal}} of Mr. Hayward's version, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>done</b> in a very manly style; but I do not admit the {{argument}} for prose translations.
