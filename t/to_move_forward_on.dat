5|$|Reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) {{encompasses}} five key issues: {{categories of}} membership, {{the question of}} the veto held by the five permanent members, regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council and its working methods, and the Security Council-General Assembly relationship. Member States, regional groups and other Member State interest groupings developed different positions and proposals on how <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> this contested issue.|$|E
5|$|In February 2003, it was {{announced}} that production for Beyond the Sea was becoming fast tracked with Spacey as lead actor, co-writer, producer and director, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) agreed to cover distribution duties in North America. The following August, with principal photography to begin in just weeks, MGM dropped out as distributor and main financier over scheduling conflicts. To accumulate financing of the film's $25 million budget, which came from foreign production companies, Spacey performed six songs at the November 2003 American Film Market. Lions Gate Entertainment quickly picked up the distribution duties and Spacey found enough investors from England and Germany to continue <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{attacked}} {{once again}} down the Graveyard Road, with 150 volunteers (nicknamed the Forlorn Hope detachment) {{leading the way}} with ladders and planks, followed by the divisions of Blair and Brig. Gen. James M. Tuttle, arranged in a long column of regiments, hoping to achieve a breakthrough by concentrating their mass on a narrow front. They were driven back {{in the face of}} heavy rifle fire. Blair's brigades under Cols. Giles A. Smith and T. Kilby Smith made it as far as a ridge 100 yards from Green's Redan, the southern edge of the Stockade Redan, from where they poured heavy fire into the Confederate position, but to no avail. Tuttle's division, waiting its turn to advance, did not have an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward.</b> <b>On</b> Sherman's far right, the division of Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele spent the morning attempting to get into position through a ravine of the Mint Spring Bayou.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jackson {{was working with}} Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Films to {{purchase}} the film rights of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, while 20th Century Fox was trying to hire him for the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes. Jackson turned down Planet of the Apes and because Weinstein was taking longer than expected to buy The Lord of the Rings rights, Jackson decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> King Kong. Weinstein was furious, and, as a result, Jackson proposed a deal between Universal and Miramax that the two studios would equally finance King Kong with Jackson's production company Wingnut Films. Universal would receive distribution rights in the United States, while Miramax would cover foreign territories. Jackson was also warranted the right of final cut privilege, {{a percentage of the}} gross profits, as well as artistic control; Universal allowed all filming and visual effects to be handled entirely in New Zealand. The deal was settled in April 1996, and Jackson, along with wife Fran Walsh, began working on the King Kong script. In the original draft, Ann was the daughter of famed English archaeologist Lord Linwood Darrow exploring ancient ruins in Sumatra. They would come into conflict with Denham during his filming, and they would uncover a hidden Kong statue and the map of Skull Island. This would indicate that the island natives were the last remnants of a cult religion that had once thrived on Asia's mainland. Instead of a playwright, Jack was the first mate and an ex-World War I fighter pilot still struggling with the loss of his best friend, who had been killed in battle during a World War I prologue. The camera-man Herb is the only supporting character in the original draft who made it to the final version. The fight between Kong and the three V. rex also changed from the original draft. In the draft, Ann is actually caught in the V. rex jaws, where she becomes wedged, and slashed by the teeth; after the fight, Kong gets her out but she is suffering from a fever, from which she then recovers.|$|E

25|$|At dawn on August 18, Warren {{advanced}} to the south through rain and over muddy roads, pushing aside Confederate pickets and a cavalry brigade, and reached the railroad at Globe Tavern around 9 a.m. Parts of the division under Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin began to destroy the track while a brigade from Brig. Gen. Romeyn B. Ayres's division formed in line of battle and moved north to block any Confederate advance from that direction. Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler's division was held in reserve. Ayres encountered Confederate troops at about 1 p.m. and Warren ordered the division under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> Ayres's right {{in an attempt to}} outflank the Confederate left.|$|E
25|$|On March 29, 2010, D.C. Superior Court Judge Natalia Combs Greene granted partial summary {{judgment}} and {{a motion to}} dismiss to Marriott, the city, and WCSA. A partial out-of-court settlement had already been reached by the parties giving JBG Cos. some limited ability <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> the condo project, but that agreement now seemed unnecessary given the court's ruling. Public officials were pleased with the court's ruling, and believed the convention headquarters project would move ahead quickly. The amended order can be viewed here. City officials said groundbreaking on the hotel would occur in May or June 2010, and WCSA officials said the construction bonds could brought to the market within 60 to 75 days.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} trial service {{began on}} the railway after inauguration in October 2016. At that time, the railway was still not fully operational. Due to issues with the electric service in particular in the section between Mieso and Dembele, trains had to use both electrical and diesel locomotives to be able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward.</b> <b>On</b> 9 May 2017 {{it was possible to}} perform a first thorough stress test with more than 30 trains on the line at the same time. Passenger trains ran between Furi-Labu and Dire Dawa, while freight services started in both directions between the Port of Doraleh and the Modjo Dry Port near Mojo railway station. This first test failed, which was attributed to electrical supply shortages between urban and rural areas along the line.|$|E
50|$|In {{a letter}} dated November 5, 1917, George J.

50|$|Singh himself wished <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> nationally <b>on</b> social justice-related issues, {{which would}} in {{addition}} consolidate the caste coalition {{that supported the}} Janata Dal in northern India, and accordingly decided to implement {{the recommendations of the}} Mandal Commission which suggested that a fixed quota of all jobs in the public sector be reserved for members of the historically disadvantaged so-called Other Backward Classes. This decision led to widespread protests among the upper caste youth in urban areas in northern India. OBC reservation (less creamy layer) was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2008.|$|R

25|$|According to {{a report}} written in 2011 by Vanity Fair {{contributing}} editor David Rose, Afghan Wireless's founder Ehsan Bayat had acted as a confidential informant for the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's Joint Terrorism Task Force since 1998. In a joint endeavor with the National Security Agency known as Operation Foxden, the FBI intended to install equipment into Afghan Wireless's infrastructure that would allow American intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on cell phone calls in Afghanistan. While the operation was in its planning stages, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13129, which prohibited US citizens from {{doing business with the}} Taliban. In the interests of completing Operation Foxden, the FBI and NSA aided Bayat and his British partners in circumventing the executive order's ban by transferring ownership of Afghan Wireless to a shell company based in Liechtenstein. Before the plan could be put in place, the American Central Intelligence Agency raised objections to Operation Foxden, citing their traditional preeminence over the FBI in conducting foreign intelligence gathering. The operation was finally authorized <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> September 8, 2001—but the September 11 attacks just three days later and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan rendered the project moot.|$|E
25|$|The Rock Band Network is a {{downloadable}} {{content service}} designed by Harmonix and Microsoft to allow artists and labels to author ("chart") their own songs for play in Rock Band. Using special software provided by Harmonix, these songs are peer-reviewed for content before {{being put on}} the Network, and users {{will be able to}} browse through the available songs by several means. The Network will augment the songs added by Harmonix as downloadable content for the game. The Network became publicly available to Xbox 360 players on March 4, 2010, with all of the songs immediately available to the Network Store for Xbox 360, and certain selections of songs available to the PlayStation 3 and Wii. A major update of the Network was released early in 2011, after Rock Band 3 release, to including authoring tools for normal and Pro keyboards and vocal harmonies, but will not initially support Pro guitar/bass authoring until Harmonix is able to judge the support required for these tools. Harmonix also plans to better support the PlayStation 3 through this iteration. Due to lack of interest and difficulties with Nintendo's Wii storefront, Harmonix has discontinued making Network songs available for the Wii. Xbox 360 players will still be able to create and add songs to the Rock Band Network following the April 2, 2013 end of regular DLC, but Harmonix has stated that while these mechanisms are generally automated, they are based on third-party technology like Microsoft XNA, and should those services cease, so will the functionality of the Network. As release of Network songs for the PlayStation 3 require Harmonix to be fully involved, no further Network songs will be available for the PlayStation 3 after April 2, 2013. The Network was fully shuttered in September 2014 to allow Harmonix <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> other projects. Rock Band Network songs are incompatible with Rock Band 4 at launch; however, Harmonix has stated they will explore the logistics of bringing RBN songs into Rock Band 4 after completing the transition of all official DLC, packs, and disc exports.|$|E

40|$|Starting from a politicized {{outlook on}} climate change, this essay criticizes {{mainstream}} journalistic norms {{for failing to}} enable an agonistic, democratic debate about how <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward.</b> Based <b>on</b> a targeted search for examples from the reporting (and reflection thereof) of two Dutch-speaking alternative news sites (DeWereldMorgen and De Correspondent), we seek to illustrate how their respective (climate) journalists look for truth, generate democratic debate and hold power accountable by combining practices from constructive journalism, slow journalism and advocacy journalism. We find these journalists to focus on patterns, root causes and underlying values, rather than on novelty or exceptional events. Furthermore, an impartial and detached style of reporting is explicitly denounced {{in favor of an}} open and reflexive choice of news-making based on advocacy...|$|R

500|$|Warner Bros. {{was less}} willing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> development, despite their enthusiasm for Hamm's script, which Batman co-creator Bob Kane greeted with {{positive}} feedback. Hamm's script was then bootlegged at various comic book {{stores in the}} United States. Batman was finally given the greenlight to commence pre-production in April 1988, after the success of Burton's Beetlejuice (1988). When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction Batman was going in. Hamm explained, [...] "They hear Tim Burton's name and they think of Pee-wee's Big Adventure. They hear Keaton's name and they think of any number of Michael Keaton comedies. You think of the 1960s version of Batman, {{and it was the}} complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didn't believe us."

500|$|There is {{widespread}} {{frustration with the}} land title system. [...] Privatising home ownership {{and the creation of}} a market economy with long term leases is seen by some commentators as the best option <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> Palm. [...] This proposal is described as giving Indigenous people [...] "skin in the game" [...] and empowerment. [...] In the period 1999 to 2007 35houses were replaced due to damage. [...] Noel Pearson of the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership argues that housing degradation in these communities has more to do with overcrowding and poor construction than it does with poor tenancy. [...] However he adds that Aboriginal people naturally take much better care of property that they have constructed or paid for themselves, than they do that which has been handed to them 'on a plate' and which they have had little personal engagement in. [...] The push for privatisation of title was led by the Australian Government (through Mal Brough, Indigenous Affairs Minister), Noel Pearson, and some families on the island (the community is very divided on this issue). The proposal had partial (or cautious) support from the then Federal Australian Labor Party Opposition.|$|E

In July 2004, Keenan performed at Serj Tankian's [...] (System of a Down) and Tom Morello's (Rage Against the Machine) Axis of Justice concert - an event for musicians to advocate for political and social causes. At the performance, Keenan announced that A Perfect Circle would be releasing a collection of political cover songs. During the beginning of the touring cycle for Thirteenth Step, Howerdel and Keenan discussed potential ideas for a third studio album. An early idea was to record an album of cover songs, though they were initially hesitant, feeling they needed a meaningful reason to warrant doing it. Keenan, who had been very critical of President George W. Bush during the touring cycle, proposed tying the concept together as a political-themed covers album, with Howerdel, while generally apolitical publicly, felt was worth pursuing in their post-September 11th attacks political and social climate. The two put their plans on hold temporarily and decided <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>forward</b> <b>on</b> the project as the band's third studio album.
