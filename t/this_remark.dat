5|$|<b>This</b> <b>remark</b> {{and others}} {{made in the}} same {{interview}} were seen as {{a change in the}} tone, but not in the substance of the teaching of the Church, which includes opposition to same-sex marriage. Certain dissenting Catholic groups oppose the position of the Catholic Church and seek to change it.|$|E
5|$|The best {{interests}} of society require that causes of action should not be deferred an unreasonable time. <b>This</b> <b>remark</b> is peculiarly applicable to land titles. Nothing so much retards the growth and prosperity of a country as insecurity of titles to real estate. Labor is paralysed where the enjoyment of its fruits is uncertain; and litigation without limit produces ruinous consequences to individuals.|$|E
5|$|In February 1869 Smetana had {{the text}} {{translated}} into French, {{and sent the}} libretto and score to the Paris Opera with a business proposal for dividing the profits. The management of the Paris Opera did not respond. The opera was first performed outside its native land on 11 January 1871, when Eduard Nápravník, conductor of the Russian Imperial Opera, gave a performance at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg. The work attracted mediocre notices from the critics, one of whom compared the work unfavourably to the Offenbach genre. Smetana was hurt by <b>this</b> <b>remark,</b> which he felt downgraded his opera to operetta status, and was convinced that press hostility had been generated by a former adversary, the Russian composer Mily Balakirev. The pair had clashed some years earlier, over the Provisional Theatre's stagings of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar and Ruslan and Lyudmila. Smetana believed that Balakirev had used the Russian premiere of The Bartered Bride {{as a means of}} exacting revenge.|$|E

Rumor and speculation points to Porter Rockwell, Joseph Smith's personal bodyguard, as the would-be assassin. Rockwell denies <b>this,</b> <b>remarking</b> {{that if it was}} him, Boggs would not have recovered.|$|R
25|$|Griffin later {{explained}} that she meant <b>this</b> <b>remark</b> not as a slight on Jesus, {{but rather as a}} satire of celebrities who thank Jesus profusely and nonsensically for their awards, especially artists who themselves are controversial in their speech and actions.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{pesticide}} endosulfan has been banned, India is slow to phase it out. In {{spite of its}} known negative health effects, Pawar made a remark that endosulfan is not yet proved dangerous. <b>This</b> <b>remark</b> prompted activist Vandana Shiva to call him a corrupt minister.|$|E
25|$|After the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, at a Madhya Pradesh {{election}} {{rally in}} Indore, Rahul Gandhi claimed that {{a police officer}} has told him that Pakistan's ISI was trying to recruit disgruntled riot-affected youngsters. However, the district administration, the UP state government, the Union Home Ministry, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the Intelligence Bureau (IB) denied any such development. <b>This</b> <b>remark</b> drew heavy criticism from various political outifts such as BJP, SP, CPI and JD(U). Congress's Jairam Ramesh said Gandhi needed to apologise to the Muslim community for <b>this</b> <b>remark.</b> In reply to the ECI's show-cause notice to explain why action should not be initiated against him for violating the Model Code of Conduct, Gandhi said that he didn't intend to exploit communal sentiments but was referring to divisive politics.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt never forgave him for <b>this</b> <b>remark,</b> and Moses {{later said}} that this {{incident}} was {{the root of the}} antipathy between them that lasted into Roosevelt's later presidency. Moses, who also served as New York's Secretary of State for two years during this period, used his influence with the legislature and control of the parks budgeting process to keep the TSPC's finances low enough that it could barely maintain existing facilities under its jurisdiction, much less acquire right-of-way or hire staff.|$|E
25|$|To <b>this</b> <b>remark,</b> the Buddha {{tells them}} that the Brahmins have indeed {{forgotten}} about their past if they said such things. The {{fact is that the}} women in the Brahmin caste can get pregnant, give birth, and take care of their children. But the Brahmins still say that they are born from the Mouth of the God Brahma and other (castes) are born from Brahma's feet. Thus, the Brahmin's words are untrue. The Buddha said that the Brahmins are not speaking truthfully and they will reap a bad result from their own deeds.|$|E
25|$|A raggedly-dressed {{and dirty}} old man {{came on board}} there who {{appeared}} to be somewhat superior to the fishermen who brought him. Rather disconcerted at not being offered a seat, he expressed a desire to leave. Once it was learned that he was the principal person in the village, he was invited down to a seat on the gun-deck, where he was closely questioned as to just where the ship was and the extent of government and defenses. Being informed the ship bore an envoy anxious to reach the capital, the old man cheerfully said the ship might return northward to it in three or four days. <b>This</b> <b>remark</b> was forgotten at the time, and ruefully recalled after the mission failed to receive an official invitation to Hue.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>remark</b> refers {{among other}} things to Newton's finding, {{supported}} by mathematical demonstration, that if the inverse square law applies to tiny particles, then even a large spherically symmetrical mass also attracts masses external to its surface, even close up, exactly as if all its own mass were concentrated at its center. Thus Newton gave a justification, otherwise lacking, for applying the inverse square law to large spherical planetary masses {{as if they were}} tiny particles. In addition, Newton had formulated in Propositions 43-45 of Book 1, and associated sections of Book 3, a sensitive test of the accuracy of the inverse square law, in which he showed that only where the law of force is accurately as the inverse square of the distance will the directions of orientation of the planets' orbital ellipses stay constant as they are observed to do apart from small effects attributable to inter-planetary perturbations.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} {{remained in}} the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony {{was held at the}} airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, {{the first of its kind}} in some thirty years, marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. That the smooth proceedings of this event had been derailed by the student movement embarrassed the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path. The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the Great Hall of the People amidst the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square. When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told the Soviet leader, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that <b>this</b> <b>remark</b> was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. The statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.|$|E
25|$|Further, Blanc {{had written}} a book in 1867, which Seurat read the year he began his studies at the École, and which was to {{strongly}} influence him during his formative years—the Grammaire des arts du dessin. Near {{the beginning of this}} book, Blanc had claimed that Nicolas Poussin’s The Finding of Moses was an exemplary case of how art should idealise nature, concluding his passage, ‘This is how a scene from everyday life suddenly becomes raised to the dignity of a history painting.’ <b>This</b> <b>remark</b> seems pertinent to the Bathers, which certainly shares a number of compositional elements with Poussin’s masterpiece of 1638. Both works show to the right a lowered male figure, and to the left a reclining male figure painted from behind. The horizon in both paintings is punctured just off-centre with a head, and in both paintings the river is spanned with a distant bridge, with block-like buildings on the left bank and trees on the other. And both pictures have a flat-bottomed boat at the centre-right.|$|E

500|$|The {{composer}} {{admitted that}} Connotations possessed [...] "a rather severe and somewhat intellectual tone." [...] However, {{while he did}} not {{expect it to be}} an immediate success, he had still hoped that the music's intensity and drama might lend it some appeal. While Copland maintained that [...] "It bothers me not at all to realize that my range as a composer includes both accessible and problematic works," [...] composer and musicologist Peter Dickinson notes [...] "a tone of defensiveness" [...] in <b>this</b> <b>remark.</b> Nevertheless, Connotations abrasiveness to many listeners might not have been the only factor in its initial failure.|$|E

40|$|In his posthumously {{published}} "Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics" Ludwig Wittgenstein devotes a small {{section on}} the First Incompleteness Theorem by Kurt Gödel. <b>This</b> <b>remarks</b> have been harshly criticized by early commentators, who have accused Wittgenstein of lacking understanding of the topic. In <b>this</b> thesis Wittgenstein's <b>remarks</b> are reevaluated and compared with other remarks on the topic, which are scattered throughout his published works and his Nachlass. It turns out that Wittgenstein wasn't actually commenting on the mathematical aspects of the Theorem, but that his critique is about the conceptual and metaphysical aspects of Gödel's work...|$|R

500|$|The team played East Zone in Calcutta as {{the city}} was {{in the grip of}} deadly pro-independence riots. Miller's friend Denis Compton was batting for East Zone when rioters invaded the pitch. Their leader ran up to Compton and said: [...] "Mr Compton, you very good player, but you must stop". In later years, {{whenever}} Miller opposed Compton, he would quote <b>this</b> <b>remark</b> when Compton came to the crease. In 2005, the ECB and Cricket Australia decided that the player adjudged the Player of the Series in the Ashes would be awarded the Compton–Miller Medal, recognising their friendship and rivalry.|$|E
500|$|After {{witnessing}} early mechanical {{television in}} action, Commissioner Lafount {{said that the}} FRC was doing all it could to help develop the still-infant technology in terms of regulatory issues. He wrote in 1931 that, [...] "I believe that television is destined to become the greatest force in the world. I think it will have more influence over the lives of individuals {{than any other single}} force." [...] <b>This</b> <b>remark</b> has been quoted in several books about the history of television. [...] He at the same time proposed the censorship of television, in order that objectionable images not be seen and the amount of advertising not be excessive.|$|E
500|$|A {{controversy}} erupted when Tharoor, {{responding to}} {{the question as to}} whether he would travel in [...] "Cattle class", replied that he would [...] "out of solidarity with all our holy cows". <b>This</b> <b>remark</b> on Twitter (...) , was alleged to equate the travelling public to cattle and taunt his party, the Indian National Congress over its austerity drive. Tharoor's explanation that [...] "cattle class" [...] was a well-established phrase for economy class travel, and that it attacked the airlines and not the passengers, was ignored in the outcry. It was also reported that Congress may take action against him. However, this was subsequently resolved when the prime minister pointed out to the media that the statement was [...] "a joke".|$|E
