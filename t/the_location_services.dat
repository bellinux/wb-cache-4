40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} <b>location</b> <b>service</b> for Beacon Vector Routing (BVR), a {{point-to-point}} routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. A <b>location</b> <b>service</b> is necessary for decoupling the static node identifiers and dynamic BVR coordinates. This allows a node to use unique identifiers when communicating with a destination node, instead of using coordinate information directly. Our scheme uses beacons in the network as distributed look-up servers; each containing mappings of identifiers to coordinates. When a node wants to route data to another node, the sending node passes the destination node’s identifier and the payload to <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>service.</b> <b>The</b> <b>location</b> <b>service</b> resolves <b>the</b> destination node’s identifier to its associated coordinates and uses BVR to route the payload to that node.

Many schemes have been proposed to protect users’ location privacy when they request the location-based services. k-anonymity [13, 14] provides a form of plausible deniability by ensuring that the client cannot be individually identified {{from a group of}} k clients. Mix zone-based schemes [15] divide the whole region into application and mix zones. Clients report their locations in application zones and receive new, unused pseudonyms at mix zones.

40|$|Abstract — Location-based routing {{significantly}} {{reduces the}} control overhead in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) by utilizing position information of mobile nodes in forwarding decisions. However a location service is needed before any forwarding scheme can be applied. Therefore the scalability of <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>services</b> directly affects the overall scalability of location-based routing. Recently, several location service schemes have been proposed, {{most of which}} are evaluated based on only one or two performance metrics, and under only the uniform traffic pattern. We believe that a comprehensive comparative study is needed to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} design trade-offs in developing scalable location services. In this paper, we first present a taxonomy of existing schemes and explore the design space and tradeoffs involved. We then develop a common theoretical framework to analyze five existing and representative schemes in terms of three important cost metrics – location maintenance cost, location query cost, and storage cost – and under different traffic patterns. Our analysis shows that the design of location services involves tradeoffs among all three cost metrics, and overlooking any of them may lead to biased conclusions. We also show that some of the schemes are more effective in exploiting localized traffic patterns, thereby more suitable for large scale MANETs, where traffic patterns are more likely to be highly localized.
