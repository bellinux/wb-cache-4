He subsequently spent six weeks in hospital. Gleeson said of that time, [...] "I spent six weeks in hospital staring at the ceiling. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> my sporting career done. Sport was {{a huge part of}} my life and that was probably the hardest thing I've ever gone through." [...] That accident was the coaching catalyst for Gleeson. In 1990 at just 22, Gleeson became the coach of the Warrnambool Mermaids in the Country Victorian Invitational Basketball League (CVIBL). In his first season as coach, he guided the Mermaids to the championship. In 1992, he was appointed Head Coach of the Warrnambool Seahawks, a position he held for two years. In 1993, he earned the role of Head Coach of the Victorian Basketball All Star Team.|$|E
2500|$|A {{particularly}} brutal session {{took place}} at Satellite Park Studio in Malibu. [...] "It was like a month of, we'd basically broken up, fired Bob , he quit {{and then there were}} those times where it was like, 'Oh my God, that's magic, how do we get more of that?'" [...] Maida even quit once after firing Rock at a group meeting. [...] "For me <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> it. I was pretty much done with the band [...] [...] [...] It was really dark," [...] Maida Noted. Pressure was also coming from the band's management and the record company, who continued to fund the band's sessions. Raine commented, “I think we were at, like, 35 songs, and we all sat in a room and said, ‘Yeah, but there’s only eight that we all like.’ Everyone’s really frustrated.... And I think Bob had even lost perspective at this point. We’re sitting there in this shitty little studio in Malibu, and it just got a little aggressive and agitated in the room." ...|$|E
2500|$|Had Microsoft {{brought the}} first Zune to market {{at the same}} time as the iPod, or even the Zune HD at the time of the iPod Touch, it might have been a serious {{competitor}} to those players. [...] "By that point, iPod had become the world's de facto digital entertainment device," [...] he recalled. [...] "To beat it, Microsoft needed to offer something that would make Apple's device look pitifully old-fashioned. The Zune HD didn't do that. Its design marked it as being different from an iPod, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the only difference. There was no reason to buy the Zune unless you wanted to stand apart from the Apple cult. And there was a cost to standing apart from Apple: Because of its popularity, there were millions of apps and accessories for the iPod. As good as it was, the Zune HD couldn’t match Apple’s sheer market power." [...] Nevertheless, it was an effective enough product that Manjoo had started using it as his primary music player." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, The Offspring {{released}} the Baghdad 7". This EP was {{the turning point}} for the band; due to its success the band signed with Epitaph Records. Thom Wilson, who produced The Offspring's first two albums, {{had been trying to}} get the Offspring to switch to Epitaph, a label run by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. Gurewitz felt that The Offspring was just not quite pronounced enough for his label, but Baghdad convinced him to give the band a shot. Wilson and The Offspring entered the studio again and recorded Ignition. Released in 1992, Ignition exceeded all of the label's and band's expectations. Following the subsequent touring to support Ignition, The Offspring began writing new material for their third album in mid-1993. Recording sessions for Smash took place in January and February 1994 at Track Record in North Hollywood. On the recording process of the album, frontman Dexter Holland told Flux Magazine in 1994, [...] "When we recorded this album, our last one has sold maybe 15,000 copies, so the possibility of us getting played on the radio or anything like <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> nonexistent. Especially because this kind of music is not generally considered acceptable by the mainstream - so, for something like this to happen, it really took us by surprise." ...|$|E

But she could not understand why he always wanted to go to a different church; she did not see why he should not pick out one church and stick to it: the ministers seemed to be all alike, and she guessed one was pretty near as good as another. 'Manda Grier said she guessed they were all Lemuel to her; and Statira said well, she guessed <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> so. She no longer pretended that he was not the whole world to her, either with him or with 'Manda Grier; she was so happy from morning till night, day in and day out, that 'Manda Grier said if she were in her place she should be afraid something would happen.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not think}} the dinner, in a culinary point of view, was {{anything}} extraordinary. The king ate and drank but little, for, unlike his two brothers and predecessors, he is said to be abstemious. The Daupin played a better knife and fork; but on the whole, the execution was by no means great for Frenchmen. The guests sat so far apart, and the music made so much noise, that conversation was nearly out of the question; though the King and the Dauphin exchanged a few words {{in the course of the}} evening. Each of the gentlemen, also, spoke once or twice to his female neighbour, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the amount of the discourse. The whole party appeared greatly relieved by having something to do during the desert, in admiring the service, which was of the beautiful Sèvres china.

60|$|All {{this will}} serve {{to explain the}} terms on which Mrs Dale was living at the Small House,--a matter needful of {{explanation}} sooner or later. Her husband had been the youngest of three brothers, and in many respects the brightest. Early in life he had gone up to London, and there had done well as a land surveyor. He had done so well that Government had employed him, and for some {{three or four years}} he had enjoyed a large income, but death had come suddenly on him, while he was only yet ascending the ladder; and, when he died, he had hardly begun to realise the golden prospects which he had seen before him. This had happened some fifteen years before our story commenced, so that the two girls hardly retained any memory of their father. For {{the first five years of}} her widowhood, Mrs Dale, who had never been a favourite of the squire's, lived with her two little girls in such modest way as her very limited means allowed. Old Mrs Dale, the squire's mother, then occupied the Small House. But when old Mrs Dale died, the squire offered the place rent-free to his sister-in-law, intimating to her that her daughters would obtain considerable social advantages by living at Allington. She had accepted the offer, and the social advantages had certainly followed. Mrs Dale was poor, her whole income not exceeding three hundred a year, and therefore her own style of living was of necessity very unassuming; but she saw her girls becoming popular in the county, much liked by the families around them, and enjoying nearly all the advantages which would have accrued to them had they been the daughters of Squire Dale of Allington. Under such circumstances it was little to her whether or no she were loved by her brother-in-law, or respected by Hopkins. Her own girls loved her, and respected her, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> all that she demanded of the world on her own behalf.|$|E
6000|$|For the rest, Albert's {{position}} {{among them}} was what Friedrich of Sachsen's had been; worse, not better; and the main ultimate difference was, he did not die of it, like Friedrich of Sachsen; but found an outlet, not open in Friedrich's time, and lived. To the Ritters, and vague Public which called itself the Reich, Albert had promised he would refuse the Homage to Poland; on which Ritters and Reich had clapt their hands: and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> all the assistance he got of them. The Reich, as a formal body, had never asserted its right to Preussen, nor indeed spoken definitely on the subject: {{it was only the}} vague Public that had spoken, {{in the name of the}} Reich. From the Reich, or from any individual of it, Kaiser or Prince, when actually applied to, Albert could get simply nothing. From what, Ritters were in Preussen, he might perhaps expect promptitude to fight, if it came to that; which was not much as things stood. But, from the great body of the Ritters, scattered over Germany, with their rich territories (BALLEYS, bailliwicks), safe resources, and comfortable [...] "Teutschmeister" [...] over them, he got flat refusal: [The titles HOCHMEISTER and TEUTSCHMEISTER are defined, in many Books and in all manner of Dictionaries, as meaning the same thing. But that is not quite the case. They were at first synonymous, so far as I can see; and after Albert's time, they again became so; but at the date where we now are, and for a long while back, they represent different entities, and indeed oftenest, since the Prussian DECLINE began, antagonistic ones. Teutschmeister, Sub-president over the GERMAN affairs and possessions of the Order, resides at Mergentheim in that Country: Hochmeister is Chief President of the whole, but resident at Marienburg in Preussen, and feels there acutely where the shoe pinches,--much too acutely, thinks the Teutschmeister in his soft list-slippers, at Mergentheim in the safe Wurzburg region.] [...] "We will not be concerned in the adventure at all; we wish you well through it!"
