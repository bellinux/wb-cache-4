5|$|Contracts {{were signed}} at Spring's tavern {{and it was}} {{arranged}} for the fight to take place at Hanslope, Buckinghamshire.

5|$|Liverpool's {{opponents in}} the third round were Olympiacos of Greece. The first leg was held at Olympiacos' home ground, the Karaiskakis Stadium.

5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and {{the production}} team became aware of {{a problem with the}} ending. In the original ending, Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages rapidly as he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow enough time for this. Because the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E

Among the items Berg took with him to Japan were a 16-mm Bell & Howell movie camera and a letter from MovietoneNews, a New York City newsreel production company with which Berg had contracted to film the sights of his trip. When the team arrived in Japan, he gave a welcome speech in Japanese and also addressed the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected {{to the satisfaction of}} the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E
5|$|Rolle {{was forced}} to redshirt the 2007–08 season due to {{transfer}} rules. In his first game as a Bulldog, on November 15, 2008, he registered nine rebounds and eight points, including four consecutive points within <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>to</b> propel Louisiana Tech past Louisiana-Lafayette, 61–59. Rolle's first double-double came against Grambling State on November 18, with 12 points and 14 rebounds. He led the team in scoring with a then-career high of 17 points in a blowout 78–55 loss to #10 UCLA on December 28, while also contributing seven rebounds. On January 29, 2009, Rolle had a perfect night from the field, shooting 11-for-11 with 23 points. In a 60–52 defeat {{at the hands of}} Utah State on February 7, Rolle fell and injured his hip early in the game, but he came back later to finish with eight points. He had a season high 25 points to go along with 11 rebounds and four blocked shots in leading the Bulldogs to a victory over Murray State 69–60 on February 21. In the next game, an 80–71 win over New Mexico State, Rolle equalled his season high in points (25) and grabbed 12 rebounds.|$|E

5|$|Tolliver {{began his}} junior year facing Florida State, a game where he {{suffered}} a hairline fracture in his foot, leaving him doubtful for the match. He missed the first three {{games of the season}} but returned in Texas Tech's fourth game against Baylor, completing 14 of 25 passes for 189 yards, a touchdown and an interception in a 36–22 loss. Tolliver's next big performance came against TCU, the same team he defeated 63–7 as a freshman. He threw a touchdown pass to Wayne Walker in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> beat TCU, 36–35. He finished the season having passed for 1,422 yards and seven touchdowns in eight games. The next season, his senior year, Tolliver and Texas Tech sought to win the Southwest Conference. He started the season strong, throwing an 85-yard pass against Arizona—it was the third-longest pass in school history—but the Red Raiders started with two losses. By the end of the season, Tolliver had set 16 school records and was awarded the Southwest Conference Sportsmanship Award by the league's officials. After four seasons with the Texas Tech Red Raiders, he set the school record for career passing yards (6,756), career pass attempts (1,008), career pass completions (493), career touchdown passes (38), season passing yards in 1988 (2,869), and single game passing yards (446) against Oklahoma State University in 1988. Tolliver was inducted into Texas Tech's Hall of Honor in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Following {{criticism}} {{over the}} sensitivity of their tyre compounds, tyre supplier Pirelli announced changes to their tyre allocation for the Spanish Grand Prix, making pit strategy {{the focal point of}} the Grand Prix. Pirelli would later diagnose the problems with the tyre compounds as originating from developing them on a testing chassis that was two years out-of-date at the time. Lewis Hamilton took his third pole of the season, edging out Williams driver Pastor Maldonado by half a second, while Maldonado's team-mate Bruno Senna was eliminated early when he spun. Hamilton was later excluded from the qualifying results after his car did not have enough fuel to return to the pits for scrutineering, promoting Maldonado to pole position and moving Hamilton to the back of the grid. Fernando Alonso took the lead of the race at the first corner, but Maldonado reclaimed it during the second round of pit stops, when his team forced Ferrari to pit early while Alonso was held up by the Marussia of Charles Pic. Maldonado maintained a lead of seven seconds over Alonso, but a mistake by his crew during the third pit stop cost him time and left him vulnerable to the Ferrari driver in the final stint of the race. Meanwhile, third-placed Kimi Räikkönen moved to an ambitious strategy that would see him attempt to force Maldonado and Alonso to race beyond the life expectancy of their tyres, allowing him to swoop in at <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> steal first place. Räikkönen's strategy failed as Maldonado withstood pressure from Alonso for fifteen laps, winning the race by three seconds and becoming the first Venezuelan driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix. It was Williams's first win in one hundred and thirty Grand Prix starts; their previous race win was Juan Pablo Montoya's victory at the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton recovered from twenty-fourth on the grid to finish eighth, while Sebastian Vettel overcame a drive-through penalty and an unscheduled stop for a technical fault that forced his team to replace his front wing to make a late move on Nico Rosberg for sixth place that would preserve his championship lead.|$|E
5|$|The Penguins {{began the}} Eastern Conference Semi-final against their Atlantic Division rival New York Rangers on April 25. The team overcame a 3–0 deficit {{to defeat the}} Rangers, 5–4 in Game 1. Hossa tied the game 4:40 into the third period, and Sykora took the lead twenty seconds later. After Scott Gomez tied the game at four, Malkin scored the game-winning goal, {{deflecting}} a shot by Crosby with 1:41 left. In Game 2, Staal scored a powerplay goal to take a 1–0 lead. In the last minute, Adam Hall shot the puck down ice, and it drifted into the empty net. Marc-Andre Fleury saved all 26 shots, and the Penguins took a 2–0 lead in the series. The Penguins entered Game 3 at Madison Square Gardens after going 0–3–1 in the building during the regular season. They led 3–1 after the first period, before Jaromir Jagr tied the game. Malkin scored on the powerplay with 2:07 left {{in the second period}} to take the lead, and Malone added a goal in the third to give the Pens a 5–3 win, and a 3–0 series lead. The Penguins lost their first game of the post-season in Game 4 against the Rangers. Jagr scored in the second period, Brandon Dubinsky in the third and Jagr scored again on an empty net goal in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> force Game 5. In Game 5, the Penguins took a 2–0 lead in the second period after goals from Malkin and Hossa before the Rangers tied in the third. The game entered overtime, the first of the playoffs for the Penguins, where Hossa scored his second goal of the game 7:10 in. With the goal, the Penguins advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals.|$|E
