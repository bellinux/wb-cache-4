40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} made of the behaviour of "very thin" <b>torispherical</b> <b>ends</b> subjected to internal pressure. The seventeen ends tested were full-size production ends made from stainless steel, with thickness to diameter ratios (te/Di) varying from 0. 002 to 0. 001. At each value of te/Di the knuckle radius (ri) and crown radius (Ri) were varied to cover the range of ends frequently used. Each end was stain gauged on both inner and outer surfaces and then pressurised until buckling occurred in the knuckle region. The strain gauges were monitored throughout each test thus giving a detailed coverage of the strain distribution. High compressive hoop strains, shown to exist on both surfaces of the knuckle, are responsible for the buckling mode of failure. A shape/thickness survey was performed on each end prior to pressure testing. The effects of thickness reductions and deviations of curvature from the nominal are discussed. Residual strain measurements were made on three ends and were shown to be significantly large in the pressed and spun manufactured ends. A study of the effect of work hardening on the properties of the material from which the ends were made is also presented. It is shown that the proof stress and Vickers hardness number increases rapidly when the material is work hardened. The dependence of the elastic stress indices, limit pressures and first buckling pressures on wall thickness, knuckle radius and crown radius has been examined. The design implications of the study are discussed and a method for predicting the first buckling pressure of production ends given...|$|E

According to fabrication and strength of material requirements, a group of compromised counters are studied. According to ASME Section VIII and BS 5500 pressure vessel codes, a reasonable buckling pressure limit is proposed.

A minimum weight optimization problem based on buckling pressure is studied. Two different size <b>torispherical</b> dome <b>end</b> examples are selected and studied.

40|$|A {{detailed}} survey (la) ? of {{the variations in}} crown curvature, knuckle curvature and thickness {{of a number of}} thin <b>torispherical</b> pressure vessel <b>ends</b> has shown that actual dimensions may differ significantly from nominal dimensions. Numerical stress analysis using the finite element method has been carried out to assess the effects of these shape imperfections on the stresses in some of the thin <b>torispherical</b> pressure vessel <b>ends</b> considered in reference (4). The results have been compared with those for the corresponding perfect ends. In several cases significant increases in stress levels are predicted due to thickness and especially curvature variations.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a feasibility study on structural analysis of pressure-containing structures subject to external blast loads using finite element and volume simulation software. A {{basic understanding of}} the main factors influencing the results of such analyses was established in an earlier study. An extensive series of computations have now been performed {{and the results are}} presented and discussed in detail in this report. These involve a 3 -D simulation of a large steel vessel of hypothetical design containing pressurised water and subject to an explosive blast from a charge located directly underneath the lower <b>torispherical</b> <b>end.</b> The top is closed by a flat lid arrangement. The properties of the explosive material, the air and water environments and the vessel steel were taken from the literature. For the latter, elastic-plastic material properties at 20 Â°C have been considered. The vessel is located in a bunker and by using FSR boundary conditions the reflections of the pressure waves on the bunker walls are also considered. To provide a cross-check on the computational results, some simplified analyses were performed using engineering and empirical formulae to estimate the pressure loads need to produce yielding and failure of the vessel, {{as well as of the}} corresponding quantities of explosives that would be needed to produce sufficient shock wave pressures.

The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{with the use of}} elastic buckling analysis was applied to predict the critical buckling pressure.
