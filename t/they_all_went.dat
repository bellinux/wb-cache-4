25|$|The {{leader of}} the group was called Grandpa. The other koledari {{gathered}} at his house {{on the eve of}} koleda, and at midnight <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> out and started their activities. Walking through the streets of the village they shouted and made noise with their bells and ratchets. Most were armed with sabers or clubs. One of them, called Bride, was masked and costumed as a pregnant woman. He held a distaff in his hand and spun hemp fibers. The koledari teased and joked with Bride, which gave a comic note to the koleda. Some of them were called alosniks, the men possessed by the demon ala. There could have been other named characters in the group.|$|E

25|$|After four days, Scott {{began to}} pretend that he had changed his mind, feigning tears and remorse, {{in the hope that}} this would in due course {{give him a chance to}} escape. The final day of his {{imprisonment}} he spent watching films on New Age religions and channeling, even though neither are related to Pentecostalism. Scott's plan ultimately worked; Ross, pleased with the apparent success of the deprogramming session, proposed that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> out to meet with Scott's family for a celebratory dinner. In the restaurant, Scott was allowed to go the restroom by himself; he ran out and called the police, who arrested Ross and his companions on suspicion of unlawful imprisonment.

During the flight, according to Poulton, Marriott was drinking heavily, was in a foul mood, and the two argued constantly. After arriving in the UK, a mutual friend met them and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> to one of Marriott's favourite restaurants, The Straw Hat {{in the village of}} Sawbridgeworth for dinner, where he consumed more alcohol. After dinner, they returned to their friend's house and decided to stay overnight, since it was late, but upstairs in bed, Marriott and Poulton continued to argue. Poulton finally fell asleep and later woke to discover that Marriott had taken a taxi to his home in the nearby village of Arkesden.|$|E
25|$|If, {{instead of}} hitting a {{detector}} screen, {{one of the}} beams of atoms {{coming out of the}} Stern-Gerlach apparatus is passed into another (inhomogeneous) magnetic field oriented in the same direction, all of the atoms will be deflected the same way in this second field. However, if the second field is oriented at 90° to the first, then half of the atoms will be deflected one way and half the other, so that the atom's spin about the horizontal and vertical axes are independent of each other. However, if one of these beams (e.g. the atoms that were deflected up then left) is passed into a third magnetic field, oriented {{the same way as the}} first, half of the atoms will go one way and half the other, even though <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> in the same direction originally. The action of measuring the atoms' spin with respect to a horizontal field has changed their spin with respect to a vertical field.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the fine artists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, illustrators once played a powerful role in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests. One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of Collier's, Everybody's, Farm & Fireside, The Farmer's Wife, Liberty, Parents and People's Home Journal from 1923-31. These seven magazines once ranked among the most widely circulated. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> out of business a long time ago, except for Parents. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost/decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers. The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially Photoshop).|$|E
500|$|After the filming, Burton {{said of the}} cast, [...] "All I can say is {{this is one of}} {{the best}} casts I've ever worked with. These people are not {{professional}} singers, so to do a musical like this which I think is one of the most difficult musicals, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> for it. Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E

In the preceding weeks, Konnan, James and Killings appeared together on the pay-per-views in varying combinations, but June 18 {{was the first time}} all three appeared together. At first, they did spots where the three of them were made fun of other TNA wrestlers and, occasionally, each other. They also began wrestling together as a three-man tandem in dark matches and on TNA Xplosion. Starting on July 16 of that year, they began with a series of vignettes where <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> to the settings of their individual stereotypes. In the first one, the three went to the ghetto, where B.G. ended up dressed like a pimp.

2500|$|A {{story of}} the origin of fairies appears in a chapter about Peter Pan in J. M. Barrie's 1902 novel The Little White Bird, and was {{incorporated}} into his later works about the character. Barrie wrote, [...] "When the first baby laughed for the first time, his laugh broke into a million pieces, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> skipping about. That was the beginning of fairies." [...] Fairies are seen in Neverland, in Peter and Wendy, the novel version of J. M. Barrie's famous Peter Pan stories, published in 1911, and its character Tinker Bell has become a pop culture icon. When Peter Pan is guarding Wendy from pirates, the story says, [...] "After a time he fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter's nose and passed on." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 0530 on 6 June 1944, {{the first}} wave of attackers {{approached}} the beach, the 741 Tank Battalion (Duplex drive (DD) Sherman amphibious tanks destined for the eastern half of Omaha were guided by LCC-20). At 0542, {{the first wave}} was dispatched. At 0641 PC-552 reported to [...] that the entire first wave foundered. The waves were too high and many DDs destined for Omaha were swamped and sank while still well off shore. On other beaches the commanders realized the danger and brought their DDs much closer inshore before launching allowing them to reach the shore. PC-552 spent the next 45 minutes picking up survivors, but watched many of the soldiers drown in front of them, helpless to do anything about them. Crewmen Ted Guzda described the scene saying, [...] "We were the control vessel for {{the first wave of}} the invasion, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> down, we picked up all the survivors and threw them on deck." [...] Ted Guzda recalled, [...] "Later we had to sink most of ," [...] he said. [...] "We took off whatever identification they had, put weights on them and sank them. There was nothing else we could do." [...] Some soldiers were so weak from exposure, sailors from PC-552 were required to be lowered by rope to the water to place ropes around the soldiers to pull them from the water. Those soldiers did not have the strength to raise their arms to grab hold of the rope.|$|E

2500|$|On Monday morning Byrne brought {{two horses}} to be shod, but the {{blacksmith}} suspected something strange in his manner, so {{he noted the}} horse's brands (according to Kenneally, the blacksmith {{was struck by the}} quality of these so-called police horses and thus noted their brands; according also to this version, the shoeing of the horses was charged to the government of New South Wales). About 10am the Kellys, with their hostage Constable Richards, went from the barracks, closely followed on horseback by Hart and Byrne. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> to the Royal Hotel, where Cox, the landlord, told Richards that his companions were the Kellys. Ned Kelly said they wanted rooms at the Royal, and revealed his intentions to rob the bank. Hart and Byrne rode to the back and told the groom to stable their horses, but not to give them any feed. Hart went into the kitchen of the hotel, a few yards from the back entrance to the bank. Byrne then entered the rear of the bank, when he met the accountant, Mr Living, who told him to use the front entrance. Byrne displayed his revolver and induced him to surrender. Kenneally wrote, [...] "The shock caused Living to stutter and it has been alleged that he stuttered {{for the rest of his}} life." [...] Byrne then walked him and Mackie, the junior accountant, into the bar, where Dan Kelly was on guard. Ned Kelly secured the bank manager, Mr Tarleton, who was ordered to open the safes. When this was done, he was put in with the others. All were liberated at a quarter to three.|$|E
2500|$|Six weeks later, {{the rest}} of her friends {{returned}} to Storybrooke, but with a horrifying and shocking twist, their memories were wiped out once again and wearing Arthurian attires. As it turned out Emma made an appearance as the Dark One, with her new attire. Henry asks what happened to her, and she told them that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> to Camelot to remove the darkness from her and they all failed (except Henry). Emma with her powers turned Sneezy into stone, proclaiming that there's no savior in the town. Emma surprisingly gave the Dark One dagger to Regina with the intention that if she goes too dark Regina would be the only one that would willingly [...] "put her down." [...] Shortly after this, Hook attempts true love's kiss with Emma in the hopes that the Dark One's curse would break, but ultimately failed, as Emma has fully embraced the darkness. Unbeknownst to the others, Emma currently has possession of the Excalibur in a locked room inside of her new house. She intends to make Excalibur and the Dark One's dagger whole again, as with it she will be able to snuff out the light forever and become invulnerable. However, she must recruit a hero to do so, as she cannot remove the sword; the hero she chooses is her predecessor Rumplestiltskin, who she tells finally has a chance to become a hero. She planned to siphon the darkness out of both of them and put it Zelena, who she forced into an accelerated labor to avoid killing Robin's child, and slay her. She regains her memories of what Hook plans, by resurrecting all the Dark Ones as part of his revenge. At first, Emma plans to absorb all the darkness inside her and kill herself. Things do not go according to plan when Hook steals it from her. Killian orders her to kill him, taking in all the darkness and Emma slays him with Excalibur while the darkness is removed from her, reverting to her old self. After blackmailing Mr. Gold for tricking her and Hook into making him the Dark One again, she and her friends and family descend into the Underworld to find Hook and plans to split her heart in half and share it with him like her parents.|$|E
