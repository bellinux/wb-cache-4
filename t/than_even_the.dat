5|$|Oryzomys antillarum was a {{medium-sized}} rodent, about {{as large as}} O.couesi. According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were reddish, slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small ears were black on the outer and yellow {{on the inner side}} and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish, but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the reddish Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris natator, for Ray and found that they were more reddish <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> most strongly colored animals from Florida.|$|E

Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure sound out of low-end instruments, {{such as the ones}} improved by Yutaka Usui, a Japanese-born craftsman.|$|E
25|$|By 1980s the {{original}} Bedek maintenance business was conducting extensive overhauls {{on dozens of}} different aircraft types, working on engines as well as airframes and interiors, IAI could provide more comprehensive refurbishments <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> aircraft manufacturers themselves. The unit had 4,000 employees by the mid-1980s and overhauled a huge range of aircraft, from propeller-driven trainers to airliners; including big civil aviation programs, such as conversion of Boeing 747s to freighters.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{historical}} decline of fishing and whaling in New England, New Bedford {{continues to be}} a leading fishing port. In 2011, New Bedford was the highest-valued port in the nation, a title it has held for twelve straight years. $369 million worth of seafood crossed its docks, making it more valuable <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> most productive Alaskan fishing ports. While volume is below other major ports, New Bedford retains is top position due largely to its scallop fishery.|$|E

25|$|In May 2015 it was {{announced}} that Law will portray a conservative Italian American Cardinal who is elected Pope in response to what is perceived as rampant liberalism in the Catholic Church. A ten-episode series, The Young Pope is being jointly produced by Rupert Murdoch's paybox Sky and France's Canal Plus with HBO and directed by Academy Award winning director Paolo Sorrentino. Taking the name Pius XIII, the new Pope proves to be far more conservative <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> Vatican was prepared for and is shown grappling with personal crisis as well as issues involving doctrine and church discipline.|$|E
25|$|A natural {{development}} from digital delay-processing hardware was {{the appearance of}} software-based delay systems. In large part, this coincided with the popularity of both professional and consumer audio editing software. Software delays, in many cases, offer much greater flexibility <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> most recent digital hardware delays. Abundant system memory on modern personal computers offers practically limitless storage for the audio buffer, and the natural efficiency of audio delay algorithms has made the implementation trivial for delays offering shifting or random delay times, or the insertion of other audio effects during the feedback process. Many authors of software plugins have added functionality to emulate {{the sounds of the}} earlier analog units.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of both Season 3 and Season 4 are {{diplomatic}} in nature; Season 3, in particular, has many stories that take place away from the battlefield. How different races and planets {{are affected by the}} galaxy-wide war are shown, as well as how the Republic Senate can make a bigger difference <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> Jedi Council at times. The {{first half of}} Season 3 is used mainly to make the Clone Wars series more cohesive as these first episodes created better chronology, setting themselves in and among the previous two seasons' episodes. The second half of both seasons, Anakin steps a little closer to the dark side. Meanwhile, the Sith experience turmoil among themselves.|$|E

25|$|The enthusiasm, however, {{proved to}} be short lived. Auckland's {{successor}} as Governor General, Lord Ellenborough, appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and {{for the duration of}} his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, Lord Hardinge, was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse, had seemingly affected Cautely's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in Great Britain and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the North-Western Provinces, with James Thomason as Lt. Governor, and in British India with Lord Dalhousie as Governor-General. Canal construction, under Cautley's supervision, now went into full swing. A 350-mile long canal, with another 300 miles of branch lines, eventually stretched between the headworks in Hardwar and—after splitting into two branches at Nanau near Aligarh—the confluence with the Ganges at Cawnpore (now Kanpur) and with the Jumna (now Yamuna) mainstem at Etawah. The Ganges Canal, which required a total capital outlay of £2.15 million, was officially opened in 1854 by Lord Dalhousie. According to historian Ian Stone: It was the largest canal ever attempted in the world, five times greater in its length than all the main irrigation lines of Lombardy and Egypt put together, and longer by a third <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> largest USA navigation canal, the Pennsylvania Canal.|$|E

After Lisa criticizes Bart for selling his soul, Bart responds: [...] "Poor gullible Lisa. I'll keep my crappy sponges, thanks." [...] Turner comments: [...] "Here Bart is the epitome of the world-weary hipster, using the {{degraded}} language of modern marketing to sell off the most sacred parts of himself because he knows that some cheap sponge is more real, hence more valuable, <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> loftiest of abstract principles." ...|$|E

60|$|All {{these things}} happen on Christmas Eve, they are all told of on Christmas Eve. For ghost stories to be told on any other <b>evening</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of <b>the</b> twenty-fourth of December would be {{impossible}} in English society as at present regulated. Therefore, in introducing the sad but authentic ghost stories that follow hereafter, I {{feel that it is}} unnecessary to inform the student of Anglo-Saxon literature that the date on which they were told and on which the incidents took place was--Christmas Eve.|$|R
500|$|Jae-Ha Kim, {{a writer}} for Chicago Sun-Times, noted, that [...] "Is It Scary" [...] shows a [...] "darker side of Jackson <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> tabloids would have you believe". Neil Strauss, {{a writer for}} The New York Times, {{described}} [...] "Is It Scary" [...] as [...] "sounding more like the ghoulish rocker Marilyn Manson than the Motown prodigy that he is." [...] A longtime commentator on Jackson's public life, J. Randy Taraborrelli, gave a retrospective analysis on Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mixs critical reviews in the biography, The Magic & the Madness (2004). Taraborrelli argued that certain sections of the world took interest in tabloid stories about Jackson's personal life over his musical career.|$|E
500|$|Cartoon Network {{originally}} aired [...] "Bad Timing" [...] on March 3, 2014. Over {{a million}} and a half people saw the episode live on broadcast. Television critic Emily Nussbaum gave this episode praise in The New Yorker, comparing it to a fairy tale characterized by laughter and sorrow. Kohn called its mood happy yet miserable the same, evoking more emotions as a whole <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> preceding episode. The A.V. Club writer Oliver Sava gave it an A grade, finding it, like Kohn, emotionally intense. Kohn praised the episode for supplying Lumpy, a usually arrogant character, with a tragic circumstance. Sava saw the character as more explored that way. Nussbaum, who considered the episode proof of her intricacy as a character, wrote that Lumpy appropriately shows pathos.|$|E
500|$|Negative {{societal}} {{attitudes and}} stereotypes about {{people with disabilities}} like SCI affect interpersonal interactions and self-image, with important implications for quality of life. In fact, for women, psychological factors have a more important impact on sexual adjustment and activity than physical ones. Negative attitudes about disability (along with relationships and social support) are more predictive of outcome <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> level or completeness of injury. Stereotypes exist that people with SCI (particularly women) are uninterested in, unsuitable for, or incapable of sexual relationships or encounters. [...] "People think we can only date people in wheelchairs, that we're lucky to get any guy, that we can't be picky", remarked Mia Schaikewitz, who is profiled [...] in Push Girls, a 2012 reality series about four women with SCI.|$|E

50|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the group}} has been confused due to poor specimen collection as well as very limited morphological characteristics, and most are discovered by entomologists rather <b>than</b> nematologists. <b>Even</b> <b>the</b> best-studied species, Romanomermis culicivorax, has an unclear taxonomic status.|$|R
500|$|The Courageous class {{comprised}} three battlecruisers, {{known as}} [...] "large light cruisers", that were nominally designed to support Admiral of the Fleet Lord John Fisher's Baltic Project, which {{was intended to}} land troops on the German Baltic Coast. The ships of this class were fast but very lightly armoured {{with only a few}} heavy guns. They were given a shallow draught, in part to allow them to operate in the shallow waters of the Baltic but also reflecting experience gained earlier in the war. To maximize their speed, the Courageous class were the first capital ships of the Royal Navy to use geared steam turbines and small-tube boilers. This made them the fastest capital ships in existence, slightly faster <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> Renown-class ships.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews also {{commented on}} the game's {{relationship}} with Final Fantasy VII. 1UP.com called {{it one of the}} best prequels of all time, arguing that it [...] "does a better job of putting players in FFVII's world <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> original game did." [...] While GameTrailers stated that Crisis Core [...] "doesn't take the easy way out and photocopy the source," [...] they found it, unlike Dirge of Cerberus, to be appealing. Computer and Video Games mentioned that despite the game's main story only lasting 12 hours, the side-quests helped expand the game's length. They further praised the battle system, claiming [...] " [...] never becomes tiresome," [...] and {{the fact that some of}} the weak points from Final Fantasy VII ("lengthy wandering, and an overlong center") were not issues in this game.|$|E

[...] Mompó's origins are cloudy, but he was educated and quite possibly a lawyer. [...] He had acquired a reputation as a troublemaker in Lima. [...] Mompó was imprisoned there, possibly meeting Antequera in prison, but at some point either escaped or was exiled. [...] He eventually made his way to Paraguay, where he spread his ideas about government {{and the role of the}} people, which were considered radical at the time. [...] According to Mompó, the Paraguayans had been within their rights when they overthrew Reyes and defied García Ros; political authority rested on the assent of the común, the community. [...] The power of the people, Mompó said, was greater <b>than</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> King or the Pope.|$|E
