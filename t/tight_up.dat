2500|$|When Nathan Moore {{had split}} his {{property}} in 1910, he deeded the southern 60feet (18.3m) {{of his original}} [...] of Forest Avenue frontage to his daughter. [...] Since the two yards remained contiguous, {{the fact that the}} dividing lot line was <b>tight</b> <b>up</b> {{against the side of the}} Hills House posed no problem. However, in 1946, Nathan Moore died and his estate passed to the Hills family. Mary and Edward sold the Moore house the next year, but retained an additional 40feet (12.2m) of land to provide space for a side yard and garden north of their home. [...] Following her husband's death in 1953, Mary Hills continued to reside in the house until she sold it and moved to an apartment in 1965.|$|E

Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can't deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What's that you say?' (pretending that the kitten was speaking.)

60|$|General Bourke {{was an old}} soldier, {{who told}} the truth in {{saying that he had}} hunted over the same ground sixty years ago. But he had not been at it ever since, for he had in the {{meantime}} seen a great deal of hard active service, and obtained high military reputation. But he had again taken kindly to the national sport of his country, on returning to his own estate {{at the close of the}} Peninsular War; and had ever since attended the meets twice a week through every winter, with fewer exceptions than any other member of the hunt. He always wore top-boots--of the ancient cut, with deep painted tops and square toes, drawn <b>tight</b> <b>up</b> over the calf of his leg; a pair of most capacious dark-coloured leather breeches, the origin of which was unknown to any other present member of the hunt, and a red frock coat, very much soiled by weather, water, and wear. The General was a rich man, and therefore always had a horse to suit him. On the present occasion, he was riding a strong brown beast, called Parsimony, that would climb over anything, and creep down the gable end of a house if he were required to do so. He was got by OEconomy; those who know county Mayo know the breed well.|$|E

6000|$|I {{was greatly}} indebted to Noah, for his dexterity in helping me {{to a good}} fit with my court-dress. There was not time for much particularity, for we were in {{momentary}} expectation of Judge People's Friend's return. All we could do, therefore, {{was to make a}} belt of canvas (the captain being always provided with needles, palm, etc., in his bag), and to introduce the smaller end of the tail {{through a hole in the}} belt, drawing its base <b>tight</b> <b>up</b> to the cloth, which, in its turn, was stitched round our bodies. This was but an indifferent substitute for the natural appendage, it is true; and the hide had got to be so dry and unyielding, that it was impossible for the least observant person to imagine there was a particle of brains in it. The arrangement had also another disadvantage. The cauda stuck out nearly at right angles with the position of the body, and besides occupying much more space than would probably be permitted in the royal presence, [...] "it gave any jackanapes," [...] as Noah observed, [...] "the great advantage over us, of making us yaw at pleasure, since he might use the outriggers as levers." [...] But a seaman is inexhaustible in expedients. Two [...] "back-stays," [...] or [...] "bob-stays" [...] (for the captain facetiously gave them both appellations) were soon [...] "turned in," [...] and the tails were [...] "stayed in, in a way to bring them as upright as trysail masts"; to which spars, indeed, according to Noah's account of the matter, they bore no small resemblance.|$|E
60|$|In fact, {{there was}} much that was {{extremely}} pleasant about the little place when the warm weather came, {{and it was not}} wonderful to us that Jenny was willing to remain. It was very quiet; we called one another to the window if a large dog went by our door; and whole days passed without the movement of any wheels but the butcher's upon our street, which flourished in ragweed and butter-cups and daisies, and in the autumn burned, like the borders of nearly all the streets in Charlesbridge, with the pallid azure flame of the succory. The neighborhood was in all things a frontier between city and country. The horse-cars, the type of such civilization-- full of imposture, discomfort, and sublime possibility--as we yet possess, went by the head of our street, and might, perhaps, be available to one skilled in calculating the movements of comets; while two minutes' walk would take us into a wood so wild and thick that no roof was visible through the trees. We learned, like innocent pastoral people of the golden age, to know the several voices of the cows pastured in the vacant lots, and, like engine-drivers of the iron age, to distinguish the different whistles of the locomotives passing on the neighboring railroad. The trains shook the house as they thundered along, and at night were a kind of company, while by day we had the society of the innumerable birds. Now and then, also, the little ragged boys in charge of the cows--which, tied by long ropes to trees, forever wound themselves <b>tight</b> <b>up</b> against the trunks, and had to be unwound with great ado of hooting and hammering-- came and peered lustfully through the gate at our ripening pears. All round us carpenters were at work building new houses; but so far from troubling us, the strokes of their hammers fell softly upon the sense, like one's heart-beats upon one's own consciousness in the lapse from all fear of pain under the blessed charm of an anaesthetic.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all <b>tighted</b> <b>up</b> waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|R
40|$|Iceberg-cube mining is {{to compute}} the GROUP BY partitions, for all GROUP BY {{dimension}} lists, that satisfy a given aggregate constraint. Previous works have pushed anti-monotone constraints into iceberg-cube mining. However, many useful constraints are not anti-monotone. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for pushing general aggregate constraints, called Divide-and-Approximate. This strategy divides the search space and approximates the constraint in subspaces by a pushable constraint. As the strategy is recursively applied, the approximation approaches the given constraint and the pruning <b>tights</b> <b>up.</b> We show that all constraints defined by SQL aggregates, arithmetic operators and comparison operators can be pushed by Divideand -Approximate.
