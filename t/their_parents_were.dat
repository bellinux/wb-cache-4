5|$|East German {{citizens}} {{could also}} emigrate through the semi-secret route of being ransomed by the West German {{government in a}} process termed Freikauf (literally the buying of freedom). Between 1964 and 1989, 33,755political prisoners were ransomed. A further 2,087prisoners were released to the West under an amnesty in 1972. Another 215,000people, including 2,000children cut off from <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>were</b> allowed to leave East Germany to rejoin their families. In exchange, West Germany paid over 3.4 billion DM– nearly $2.3billion at 1990 prices– in goods and hard currency.|$|E

5|$|Mario and Aldo were {{surprised}} to find a half-mile dirt racing track when they moved to Nazareth. The twins worked on a 1948 Hudson Commodore modified funded by money that they earned in their uncle's garage in 1959. They took turns racing the old Hudson on oval dirt tracks near Nazareth in 1959. They did not tell their parents that they were racing. The twins each had two wins after their first four races. Aldo was seriously hurt {{near the end of}} the season, and <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> unhappy to find out that the twins were racing. Mario had 21 modified stockcar wins in 46 races in 1960 and 1961.|$|E

5|$|Ely was {{enrolled}} at Washington High School in Portland, Oregon. He {{did not play}} in the school band, but had a passion for singing. In 1959, Lynn Easton's mother invited him to play at a Portland hotel gig, with Ely singing and playing guitar with the backup band and Easton on the drum kit. The two teenagers grew up together, as <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> close friends. Easton and Ely performed at yacht club parties, and soon added Mike Mitchell on guitar and Bob Nordby on bass to round out a band. They called themselves The Kingsmen, taking the name from a recently disbanded group. The Kingsmen began their collective career playing at fashion shows, Red Cross events, and supermaket promotions, generally avoiding rock songs on their setlist. Ely played with the Kingsmen as he attended Portland State University.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his first}} {{marriage}} he {{had a number of}} affairs with other women. He had no children, having been rendered sterile by radiation treatment, but in the 1950s offered to adopt his brother Paul's two children, Denise and George, when <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> experiencing trouble in their relationship. Paul declined the offer, with Denise and George later noting that they had no great affection for Hergé, deeming him awkward around children. Hergé was raised as a Catholic although was never a devout practitioner of the religion. His adherence to Catholicism declined in later life as he developed a keen interest in Taoism, and became an agnostic. He was a fan of the Tao Te Ching and Arnaud Desjardins' The Path to Wisdom, as well as Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics and the work of Jean-Émile Charon.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder.|$|E

25|$|Many {{children}} in care were untruthfully told that <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> dead or had abandoned them. It was common policy to prevent parents from visiting.

The Tsar also objected to a British son-in-law, due to the general anti-English feeling in Russia {{following}} the Crimean War. The Tsarina regarded the British customs as peculiar and the English people as cold and unfriendly. She was convinced that her daughter would not be happy there. However, marriage negotiation began in July 1871, only to be stalled in 1872.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} factor determining social mobility in Finland was education. Children who attained {{a higher level of}} education than <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>were</b> often able to rise in the hierarchy of occupations. A tripling or quadrupling in any one generation of the numbers receiving schooling beyond the required minimum reflected the needs of a developing economy for skilled employees. Obtaining advanced training or education was easier for some than for others, however, and the children of white-collar employees still were more likely to become white-collar employees themselves than were the children of farmers and blue-collar workers. In addition, children of white-collar professionals were more likely than not to remain in that class.|$|E

Usually the parent on the far side held an object or toy that the baby liked, or found interesting. The race was treated much like a horse race (to get points the Bungalow Heads had to bet on which baby they thought would win) up to and including the humorous commentary where other 'race tracks' are referred to as if baby racing was a popular sport.|$|E
