5|$|The series {{received}} generally positive reviews. Critics particularly praised Druckmann's {{writing and}} character development, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of Hicks' illustrations. The series was also a commercial success, with some issues requiring reprinting due to high demand.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Bangkok docked in Singapore on May 6, Kalākaua {{had had enough of}} formal events, turning down the offer of {{accommodations}} at Government House in favor of <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of a hotel. Nevertheless, Governor Frederick Weld held a formal reception and state dinner for him.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{commented that}} the book seemed to be aimed at fans of The Simpsons rather than a more general audience. Other criticisms {{included}} <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of the writing {{and a lack of}} interesting stories. In 2004, Cartwright adapted the book into a one-woman show, which she has performed in the UK and North America, including at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.|$|E

5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In stark contrast to <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{highlights}} {{the social context}} and everyday life of his characters. He {{has been compared to}} William Faulkner who also created a similar fictional town and likewise explored with humour and compassion the energy of ordinary life. Narayan's short stories have been compared with those of Guy de Maupassant because of his ability to compress a narrative. However he has also been criticised for <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of his prose.|$|E

5|$|Super Monkey Ball {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> and subtle depth of its control scheme {{as well as}} the new multiplayer modes not present in its arcade counterpart, although some felt its presentation was lacking. The game was commercially successful and remained one of Sega's best-sellers in the United States for much of 2002, eventually spawning a direct sequel, Super Monkey Ball 2, and an entire Super Monkey Ball franchise.|$|E
5|$|The album {{includes}} fifteen {{tracks and}} met with mostly positive reviews by critics, most commenting {{on the ability of}} the performer and <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of the arrangements.

5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in late May, co-directed by the singer and her {{production}} team, Haus of Gaga. The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga's previous work, and portrays her dancing on a fire-escape and walking on a lonely street. Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back-up dancers, as well as using only one outfit designed by Versace. Critics lauded <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of the video, while comparing it to the works of Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Madonna. Gaga has performed the song in award shows, music festivals and her concert tours.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Italy, and directed by Tom Munro. It shows Madonna escaping the paparazzi {{on the back of}} a convertible. She travels throughout the city and the Italian countryside, while picking up men from the roadside and having a party on the car. The video received general acclaim from critics, who commended <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of the video and labeled it as Madonna's most fun video in years. The song was included on the setlist of The MDNA Tour where she performed it while playing a guitar.|$|E

5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{versatility}} of {{the process}} and <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though flux-cored arc welding is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the game mechanics, Naka {{was inspired by}} Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E

It also promotes activism within the community to create engaged, educated citizens.|$|R
5|$|Refined cuisine {{could be}} moralized {{as a sign}} of either civilized {{progress}} or decadent decline. The early Imperial historian Tacitus contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table in his day with <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of the Germanic diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, unadulterated by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was considered a more civilized form of food than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism, as it might be the product of animal sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Smart's Hymns {{are one of}} {{the first}} works of hymns {{dedicated}} to children, and they are intended to teach Christian virtues. Unlike some of the other works produced by Smart after his release from a mental asylum, such as A Song to David or Hymns and Spiritual Songs, this work was a success and went into many immediate editions. Part of the success of this work lies in <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> and accessibility of the text. However, Smart died before he ever saw the proceeds of the work and never learned of the book's success.|$|E

Its PlayStation 3 re-release was the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and won the Best Downloadable Game award at the 2008 Game Developers Choice Awards. It was nominated for awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). Reviewers praised Flows visual and audio appeal, but noted <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> of its gameplay; several considered it to be more of an art piece than a game.|$|E
