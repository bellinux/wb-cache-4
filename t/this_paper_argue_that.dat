It is argued that rigid television scheduling and the flow of television series as ‘slow release’ is increasingly less compatible with potential viewing patterns of everyday, western urban viewers, and that access to television series through DVD releases and Internet downloads results from an emerging cultural desire or demand by viewers for greater control over the temporal aspects of television entertainment...|$|E

Numerically, this has been done for a toy model of interacting agents.

The primary focus has been {{to increase the amount}} of intergroup contact between the two dominant groups (Protestant and Catholic) through developing shared space. Outlining a body of developing research, the present paper argues that shared space does not necessarily mean that groups interact in a meaningful way with one another. This is evidenced through data which examined intergroup behaviour in integrated secondary schools, further education college classes and a cross-community group in Northern Ireland. Results show that even in what is deemed as shared space, Protestant and Catholic young people remain highly segregated in homogenous groups at the individual level.
