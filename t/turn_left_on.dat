2500|$|Floors in the Pentagon are {{lettered}} [...] "B" [...] for Basement and [...] "M" [...] for Mezzanine, both {{of which}} are below ground level. The concourse is located on the second floor at the Metro entrance. Above ground floors are numbered 1 to 5. Room numbers are given as the floor, concentric ring, and office number (which is in turn the nearest corridor number followed by the bay number). Thus, office 2B315 is on the second floor, B ring, and nearest to corridor 3 (between corridors 2 and 3). One way to get to this office would be to go to the second floor, get to the A (innermost) ring, go to and take corridor 3, and then <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> ring B to get to bay 15.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{brick and}} stone shelter {{leading to the}} entrance of the 72nd Street subway station, one of the first 28 subway stations in Manhattan, remains located on one of the wide islands in the center of Broadway, {{on the south side of}} West 72nd Street. [...] For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square. [...] In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block. [...] While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection. [...] Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.|$|E
2500|$|The paratroopers {{concluded}} {{that they would not}} be rescued, and that the Egyptians would not take prisoners. Some of them contemplated committing suicide before the Egyptians broke in. At 2:00 AM, Gonen called, asked for Amit, and ordered him [...] "Move out. Report implementation in ten minutes. Out". Amit woke Yoffe up and Yoffe agreed that moving out would be the best solution. Yoffe got up and tried to make a few steps before saying [...] "I can't walk". Other wounded men got up to see if they could. Amit ordered his men out, two of whom had to be carried out on stretchers, while some had to be supported by others. They came out under artillery cover, with the leading squad not carrying any wounded. They did not follow Gonen's route, instead opting to go north across the broad avenue and then <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> a parallel side street. They could not move quietly because of broken glass and other debris. Egyptian soldiers passed by several times, occasionally passing through gaps in the column, but did not challenge them, perhaps believing they were Egyptians. After almost two hours, they reached the Sweetwater Canal, outside the area under Egyptian control. They followed its inner face toward a vehicular bridge marked on the map, but a few score yards before it they reached a railroad bridge, which did not appear on the map. They could hear that the vehicular bridge was guarded by Egyptians, but the railroad bridge was not and they crossed it. Shortly before dawn, they reached Keren's force outside the city.|$|E

However, some cities specifically permit <b>turning</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> a red signal. An explicit green or blinking orange left signal also permits a turn on red, which usually means that conflicting traffic is {{not permitted to}} enter the same road.|$|R

They would then <b>turn</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> Merle Haggard Drive. Passengers would then re-enter the airport at Wings Way, a distance of approximately 2.5 mi. There is a long term plan to extend Wings Way through the airport, which would provide a more direct connection, but there is no date for construction.|$|E
