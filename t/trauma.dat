It has been proved that though the modern severe blunt hand <b>traumas</b> have mainly open character, the existence of various injuries of fascias does not provide complete decompression of compartments of hand and wrist.

Material: experiment covered 186 sportsmen of 14 - 17 years old age. Quantitative indicators of limbs’ <b>traumas</b> and damages were registered in competition and training processes during yearly macro-cycle by results of processing of official competitions’ records and by medical records of football players. Results: application of stretching techniques in training process and in football players’ physical rehabilitation permitted to reduce quantitative indicators of <b>traumas</b> of upper and lower limbs from 18 (season 2012 - 2013) to 7 cases (season 2013 - 2014). Indicators of football players <b>trauma’s</b> relapses reduced by 7. 93 %. In structure of upper and lower limbs’ <b>traumas</b> of younger age groups indicators of lower limbs’ <b>traumas</b> prevail. In older age groups <b>traumas</b> of upper limbs prevail.

Other possible causes include gout, sarcoidosis, CREST syndrome, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, uremia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Students’ medical records were analyzed in the research. Results: with every year of study in university the quantity of <b>traumas</b> decreased. In 1 st year students we found 10 <b>traumas,</b> in 4 th year - 5. Ligament sprains are the most frequent kinds of <b>traumas.</b> In total we found 33. 3 %.

Among all kinds of injuries caused by traffic accidents in Vietnam, the percentage of this sickness type is not small. To contribute to reduce dramatic consequences, this study concentrates on estimation of danger level of various aspects which can lead to the skull <b>traumas.</b> A survey using questionnaire was carried out by interviewing the patients and/or their accompanied persons at Viet-Duc University Hospital, one top medical emergency center in Hanoi.

40|$|Continuous and Present Traumatic Stress (CTS) is {{different}} from <b>traumas</b> {{that happened in the}} past. <b>Traumas</b> enacted by institutions and systems (for example, Japanese internment after Pearl harbor and recent backlash against Arabs and Muslims after September 11) are different from <b>traumas</b> enacted by individuals or Nature.

40|$|Studies {{have found}} a {{stronger}} association between anger and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity in military populations than in nonmilitary populations. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain this difference: Military populations {{are more prone to}} anger than nonmilitary populations, and <b>traumas</b> experienced on deployment create more anger than nondeployment <b>traumas.</b> To examine these hypotheses, we evaluated the association between anger and PTSD severity among never-deployed military service members with nondeployment <b>traumas</b> (n = 226) and deployed service members with deployment <b>traumas</b> (n = 594) using linear regression. We further examined these associations stratiﬁed by gender. Bivariate associations between anger and PTSD severity were similar for nondeployment and deployment events; however, gender modiﬁed this association. For men, the association for deployment events was stronger than for nondeployment events (β =. 18, r =. 53 vs. β =. 16, r =. 37, respectively), whereas the reverse was true for women (deployment: β =. 20, r =. 42 vs. nondeployment: β =. 25, r =. 65).
