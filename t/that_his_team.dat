5|$|European {{dominance}} was at {{the forefront}} of United's agenda during the 1997–98 season. Having failed to take their chances in a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was resolute to go one step further and emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing any talk <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|This result marked Manchester United's {{first defeat}} of 1999. It {{was the second}} {{consecutive}} year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger described it as psychological boost to beat his opponents and felt the win showed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> were ready for the upcoming season. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, on the other hand, believed the defeat highlighted his players needed more game time.|$|E
5|$|After the race, Häkkinen {{remained}} in the Drivers' Championship lead with 74 points. Michael Schumacher was second with 68 points, seven points ahead of Coulthard and nineteen ahead of Barrichello. Ralf Schumacher passed Fisichella for fifth place with 20 points, and Frentzen moved ahead of teammate Trulli and Salo. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren maintained their lead with 125 points and Ferrari {{remained in}} second with 117 points. Williams increased their lead over Benetton to twelve points, and Jordan remained fifth with 13 points. Given Häkkinen's increased lead, Michael Schumacher acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> lacked speed against McLaren in the season's four remaining races but remained confident of winning the world championship.|$|E

5|$|As league champions, Arsenal contested the 1991 FA Charity Shield against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who {{had beaten}} Nottingham Forest {{to win the}} 1991 FA Cup Final. Anders Limpar was absent for Arsenal, as he had {{sustained}} a knee injury while on duty for Sweden. David O'Leary started {{in place of the}} injured Steve Bould and midfielder David Hillier was picked ahead of Michael Thomas in midfield. In spite of dominating territorial advantage, Arsenal were held to a 0–0 draw, meaning each team held the trophy for six months. Graham commentated that Arsenal played below their usual standard and accepted <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> needed to work on their finishing, in order to make use of their possession.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} {{season in the}} Mountain West, the Bulldogs became co-champions with a 7-1 conference record. This was the Bulldogs' first {{appearance}} in the Hawaii Bowl. Coming into the 2012 season, Bulldogs' coach Tim DeRuyter said <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> would challenge for a Mountain West Conference title. After making good on that promise, the Bulldogs attempted to achieve their first bowl victory since the 2007 Humanitarian Bowl. A victory in the Hawaii Bowl would have given Fresno State a 10-win season {{for the first time}} since 2001, when quarterback Derek Carr's older brother David was the Bulldogs' quarterback.|$|E
5|$|Sakic led the Avalanche {{in scoring}} {{again in the}} 2001–02 season, {{finishing}} sixth in the league with 79 points. On March 9, 2002, he played in his 1,000th career game. The Avalanche once again reached the Western Conference Finals, but lost to the eventual Cup-winning Detroit Red Wings. The following year, Sakic appeared in only 58 games and finished with just 58 points. He rebounded the following year, finishing third in the league with 87 points.

5|$|The only goal of {{the match}} came in the second half; Arsenal {{substitute}} Gilberto Silva on his debut collected a pass from Dennis Bergkamp and struck the ball through goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek's legs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger praised the match-winner in his post-match interview, while opposing manager Gérard Houllier felt the result showed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> needed more game time and attention to passing, in order to improve. The result meant Arsenal was {{the first team to}} win the Shield outright 11 times, while it marked Liverpool's first defeat at the Millennium Stadium.|$|E
5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept using and refining Crystal Tools. For , the engine was adjusted to make it more suitable to games with an open world design.|$|E

At the event, his pass to Bello during the slam dunk contest appeared on SportsCenter. The following week, he played at the UIC Pavilion in the fourth annual adidas Nations global experience with many of the world's elite high school players.

5|$|Few {{teams were}} {{interested}} in Pujols because of uncertainty about his age, which position he would play, and his build. Tampa Bay Rays scout Fernando Arango recommended <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> sign Pujols, and quit his job when Tampa Bay failed to do so. Pujols was not drafted until the 13th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, when the St. Louis Cardinals selected him with the 402nd overall pick. Pujols initially turned down a $10,000 bonus and spent the summer playing for the Hays Larks of the Jayhawk Collegiate League (a summer league in the National Baseball Congress); his total of 48 runs batted in (RBIs) with the team was tied for ninth with Tyler Wasserman in Larks' history. When the Cardinals increased their bonus offer to $60,000, he signed.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his four}} {{consecutive}} championships with Simeon, Parker (and Chicago's Simeon) {{were compared to}} McClain (and Peoria's Manual). Peoria's Journal Star emphasized that McClain was 32–0 as a starter in IHSA play because in the 1994–97 time period the IHSA was only divided into two classes. Thus, Manual had to wade through an 8-round tournament instead of the 7-round modern 4-class format. However, Simeon won 6 of its 7 games in its final championship by more than 10 points, while Manual only won 3 of its 8 by such a margin. In the postgame press conference, Simeon Coach Smith emphasized <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> had to endure the pressure of playing a national schedule that included games against elite teams in distant venues. Note, that with the 4-class system rather than the 2-class system of the past, the 2013 Class 3A IHSA champion was CPL runner-up Morgan Park, who split 2 neutral court 2013 games with Simeon. As noted above, Rose-era Simeon teams only won 2 championships in the 2-class era. Adding Parker's 55-11 start to a 33–1 junior year and a 30–3 senior season gives him a 118–15 legacy compared to Rose's 120–12.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test, MacLaren shared a century opening {{partnership}} with Tom Hayward and scored 116 {{to become the}} first man to score four Test centuries. This was the last Test century by an England captain in Australia for 57 years. Barnes bowled with great success; Colin Blythe and Len Braund, like Barnes chosen by MacLaren and making their Test debuts, performed effectively and England won by an innings. The remaining four Tests were lost as the team suffered from a lack of effective bowlers. MacLaren severely overbowled Barnes, who took 13 wickets, in the second Test; the bowler was injured in the next game and took no further part on the tour. MacLaren was successful with the bat. He scored 92 in the fourth Test, made centuries in the two first-class games played in between the Test matches, and finished top of the batting averages. Critics judged <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> had performed well despite the heavy defeat, and his captaincy attracted praise. In addition, the team were considered to be the best fielding side to visit Australia. In the Test series, MacLaren scored 412 runs at 45.77, while in all first-class matches he hit 929 runs at 58.06.|$|E
50|$|McLaren noticed <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team's</b> {{cars were}} less {{innovative}} than the Chaparrals of rival driver/designer Jim Hall, but their superior reliability was rewarded {{by race and}} championship victories.

Leonardo fights Raphael, but when he breaks Leonardo's swords, Raphael is forced to leave. The generals seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants to be free of his curse of immortality. The generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer the world.|$|E
5|$|Once half-time was reached, it {{was clear}} that Scotland, and Jim Leighton in particular, were in difficulty. In the {{dressing}} room, Leighton admitted that the reason he had missed the cross {{at the end of the}} first half, which led to the last-ditch save at the feet of Mark Hughes, was that he was shortsighted and had lost one of his contact lenses. Not only that, but he did not have a spare pair with him. Leighton had not been forthcoming about his eyesight because of fears that it might harm his career. As a consequence, that the goalkeeper even needed lenses was something <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> mates, Alex Ferguson (who was also Leighton's club manager at Aberdeen) or, most importantly, Jock Stein did not know.|$|E
5|$|Sutil {{was given}} a 20-second time penalty by the {{stewards}} as he was deemed to gain an advantage by taking the outside line at turn seven on the first lap. This demoted him from eighth to tenth, and promoted Hülkenberg from ninth to eighth and Massa from tenth to ninth. Following a protest from Force India, Hülkenberg was issued a 20-second time penalty after the stewards deemed him to have gained an advantage by corner cutting. This ruling meant Hülkenberg was demoted to tenth while Massa moved up to eighth and Sutil inherited ninth. Force India withdrew an appeal of Sutil's penalty following the decision, and Williams technical director Sam Michael said <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> had accepted the stewards' judgement. The stewards elected not to penalise Senna after examining a video of his collision with the stationary Kobayashi.

She also finds an insect {{in the body of}} another prisoner. Dr. Osbourne, who has become infected, reveals <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme {{produced}} by the insect. However, the insect has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts. Osbourne claims that the insect and its contagion were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment.

5|$|The {{previous}} {{season was}} a transitional period for Arsenal. The club transferred {{a number of}} first-team players such as defenders Sol Campbell and Lauren to Portsmouth and winger Robert Pirès to Spanish club Villarreal. After lengthy negotiations, Ashley Cole moved to Chelsea {{on the final day}} of the summer transfer window, in exchange for £5million and defender William Gallas. Arsenal played their home games at the newly constructed Emirates Stadium and drew their first game against Aston Villa. After a defeat by Bolton Wanderers, manager Arsène Wenger admitted <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> were unlikely to make a serious challenge for the Premier League. Despite being a young and inexperienced team, however, Arsenal reached the final of the League Cup, where they were beaten 2–1 by Chelsea. Elimination in the UEFA Champions League in the knockout stage (two-legged matches played home and away) and FA Cup in the space of four days followed – the club lost three games in succession for the first time since October 2002.
