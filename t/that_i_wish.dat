I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequentially, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God.|$|E

500|$|In 1902 Robey {{created the}} {{character}} [...] "The Prehistoric Man". [...] He {{dressed as a}} caveman and spoke of modern political issues, often complaining about the government [...] "slapping another pound of rock on his taxes". The character was received favourably by audiences, who found it easy to relate to his topical observations. That year he released [...] "The Prehistoric Man" [...] and [...] "Not <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> to Say Anything" [...] on shellac discs using the early acoustic recording process.|$|E

500|$|In a 2001 Interzone essay, author Gene Wolfe defended Brooks' {{derivation}} {{of material}} from Tolkien: [...] "Terry Brooks {{has often been}} disparaged for imitating Tolkien, particularly by those reviewers who find his books inferior to Tolkien's own. I can say only <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> there were more imitators -- we need them -- and that all imitations of so great an original must necessarily be inferior." [...] In a commentary for The New York Times Book Review, Frank Herbert, author of the science fiction novel Dune, also defended Brooks, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|The lecture {{upon which}} Eureka was based also {{received}} negative reviews. Poe's friend Evert A. Duyckinck {{wrote to his}} brother that the lecture bored him to death {{and that it was}} [...] "full of a ludicrous dryness of scientific phrase—a mountainous piece of absurdity." [...] A local newspaper called it [...] "hyperbolic nonsense". though one publication, the Courier and Enquirer, called it [...] "a nobler effort than any other Mr. Poe has yet given the world". Audience members said it was not persuasive or simply too long. Even so, Poe considered Eureka to be his masterpiece. He believed the work would immortalize him because it would be proven to be true. In the Preface, Poe said: [...] "It is as a Poem only <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> this work to be judged after I am dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Lovato had no {{interest}} in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother. She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, [...] "He was mean, but {{he wanted to be a}} good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [...] taking care of you and doing the job <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> I could do'." [...] She has written multiple songs about him. Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013, at age 53. After his death, Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and in his honor she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program.|$|E

500|$|The Rio Branco Cabinet, {{increasingly}} divided, {{resigned in}} June 1875 after having served for four years. The Cabinet's viability had been impaired by the ongoing crisis with the Catholic Church {{and an international}} financial crash that caused the failure of several Brazilian banks. The Emperor attempted, without success, to convince Paranhos to continue {{as head of the}} government. Paranhos replied in a letter: [...] "Your Majesty knows <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to deliver my post to whoever is better to occupy it. If I have not become sick in public thus far, {{there is no doubt that}} I am tired." [...] PedroII had no intention on naming the 2nd Viscount of Uruguai as Rio Branco's replacement, to prevent the ultraconservative faction from coming to power. Instead, he called on the Duke of Caxias to head a new cabinet.|$|E
500|$|While Wollstonecraft does {{call for}} {{equality}} {{between the sexes}} in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state {{that men and women}} are equal. What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour. Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: [...] "Let it not be concluded <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue. I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature. In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God." [...] Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her.|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{was written}} by Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and its {{producer}} Ian Kirkpatrick, and was included on Dua Lipa's eponymous debut studio album in 2017. Lipa worked on the record during three years, stating that the extended process led to her writing and recording songs until {{she felt she had}} a considerable amount to pick from. When asked what it was like working with younger artists like Lipa and Noah Cyrus, Warren stated that they both were [...] "older souls" [...] and that she helped them to express what they wanted to say. [...] "In both cases they were pretty comfortable telling those stories. [...] end up being true to each artist because it is coming from their story, too," [...] Warren said. Kirkpatrick also engineered and programmed the track, while Chris Gehringer mastered it and Josh Gudwin mixed it. Talking about the song, the artist explained that [...] "'New Rules' is quite different to a lot of tracks on the album. I wanted it to feel very new [...] It's the breakup song <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> I had when I was breaking up with someone" [...] and that [...] "It's about keeping your distance from someone who's bad for you. I'm setting some rules down so [...] won't go back to that person." [...] "New Rules" [...] was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017 as the album's sixth single. It impacted the same format in the United States on 22 August 2017. Three days later, a remixed version by Australian DJ Alison Wonderland was released on iTunes.|$|E

2500|$|Good {{food is a}} {{keystone}} (along with reading) of Wolfe's mostly leisured existence. [...] He is both a gourmand and a gourmet, enjoying generous helpings of Fritz's cuisine {{three times}} a day. Shad roe is a particular favorite, prepared {{in a number of}} different ways. [...] Archie enjoys his food but lacks Wolfe's discerning palate, lamenting in The Final Deduction (chapter 9) that [...] "Every spring I get so fed up with shad roe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to heaven fish would figure out some other way. [...] Whales have." [...] Shad roe is frequently the first course, followed by roasted or braised duck, another Wolfe favorite.|$|E

2500|$|In 1928, Panzram {{was arrested}} for {{burglary}} in Washington. During his interrogation, he voluntarily confessed to killing two boys. In light of his extensive criminal record, he received a 25-years-to-life sentence. Upon arriving at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, he warned the warden, [...] "I'll kill the first man that bothers me", and was given a solitary job in the prison laundry room. On June 20, 1929, he beat the laundry foreman to death with an iron bar, {{and was sentenced to}} death. He refused to allow any appeals of his sentence. In response to offers from death penalty opponents and human rights activists to intervene, he wrote, [...] "The only thanks you and your kind will ever get from me for your efforts on my behalf is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> you all had one neck and that I had my hands on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{discovered}} {{three sets}} of human remains in the garden, {{a decision was made}} to thoroughly search the entire property. Rose was placed into a safe house in the nearby town of Dursley as police commenced their search inside 25 Cromwell Street. Informed of this fact, and with the formal interviews conducted by the investigative team lasting up to 16 hours each day and including persistent questioning as to the whereabouts of his first wife and stepdaughter, Fred authorised his solicitor to pass a note he had written to the leader of the murder investigation: Superintendent John Bennett of the Gloucestershire Police. This note read: [...] "I, Frederick West, authorise my solicitor, Howard Ogden, to advise Superintendent Bennett <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> to admit a further (approx) nine killings, expressly Charmaine, Rena, Lynda Gough and others to be identified. F. West." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burr made {{repeated}} {{trips on}} behalf of the United Service Organizations (USO). He toured both Korea and Vietnam during wartime and once spent six months touring Korea, Japan, and the Philippines. He sometimes organized his own troupe and toured bases both in the U.S. and overseas, often small installations that the USO did not serve, like one tour of Greenland, Baffinland, Newfoundland and Labrador. Returning from Vietnam in 1965, he made a speaking tour of the U.S. to advocate an intensified war effort. As the war became more controversial, he modified his tone, called for more attention to the sacrifice of the troops, and said, [...] "My only position on the war is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> it were over." [...] In October 1967, NBC aired Raymond Burr Visits Vietnam, a documentary of one of his visits. The reception was mixed. [...] "The impressions he came up with are neither weighty nor particularly revealing", wrote the Chicago Tribune; the Los Angeles Times called Burr's questions [...] "intelligent and elicited some interesting replies".|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw {{gave the}} film four stars in September 2001, {{choosing}} {{it as the}} best film of the week. He praised Takeshi Kitano's performance as the teacher {{and some of the}} scenes as [...] "a stunningly proficient piece of action film-making, plunging us into a world of delirium and fear." [...] He notes that, among [...] "the hail of bullets and the queasy gouts of blood, troubling narratives of yearning and sadness are played out. It is as if the violence of Battle Royale is not a satire of society at all, but simply a metaphor for the anguish of adolescent existence." [...] He concluded that, while some [...] "will find the explicit violence of this movie repulsive", it [...] "is a film put together with remarkable confidence and flair. Its steely candour, and weird, passionate urgency make it compelling." [...] Bryant Frazer of Deep Focus [...] gave it a B+ rating and called it [...] "a vicious take-off on reality TV that turns a high-school milieu dominated by cliques and childish relationships into a war zone." [...] British critic Jonathan Ross stated that [...] "if you want to catch a wildly original and super-cool slice of entertainment before it gets remade and ruined by the Americans, then I suggest you try hard not to miss it" [...] and concluded that [...] "it's a wildly imaginative example of just what can be achieved in a teen movie." [...] In 2009, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino praised Battle Royale as the best film he had seen in the past two decades, stating that, [...] "If there’s any movie that’s been made since I’ve been making movies <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> I had made, it’s that one." ...|$|E
