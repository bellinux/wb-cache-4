Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> Norway and decided to use this {{as a starting point for}} the defence.|$|E
5|$|At all levels, Scouts {{are governed}} by an {{executive}} of trustees, known as executive committees – these could be volunteers from the local community who have had ties with the association, either themselves or through their children.

40|$|This thesis explores {{current and}} {{historical}} child custody {{laws in the}} State of Arizona and how they have correlated with child development theories. It discusses the impact child development theories have had on Arizona child custody cases. Additionally, it includes an overview of early Arizona Supreme Court cases and the implications it has on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. The thesis also provides insight to problems with Arizona courts and the actors involved with making the decision for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child. The investigation demonstrates a disconnection between judicial discretion and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child standard. An example from the United States Supreme Court case Troxel v Granville (1999) is reviewed to illustrate how courts discretion, in general, can be misused. Overall, court discretion in Arizona is liberal and the impact it has on child custody decisions can sometimes conflict with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child...|$|R

In the summer of 1970 she was awarded a grant to work at Marian Wright Edelman's Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator Walter Mondale's Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. There she researched various migrant workers' issues including education, health and housing. Edelman later became a significant mentor. Rodham was recruited by political advisor Anne Wexler to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate Joseph Duffey, with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the ways in which}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child has been used as an argument for state-authorized assessments of persons who are aspiring to parenthood, but who are not yet parents, i. e. of parent potential rather than parental performance. The policies included in the analysis concern three different areas in which assessment of parental potential is made: adoption, assisted reproduction and presumptive parents with intellectual disabilities. <b>The</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child as an argument for state-authorized assessments of parent potential, I argue, varies with the amount of involvement from state authorities that is needed in the process of creating a family. The state claims the right to assess the parent potential of individuals only when it contributes to the creation of families in which there are no or only partial biogenetic links between parents and child. This {{does not mean that the}} state does not aim to encourage women who belong to what is perceived as a risk group to refrain from having children. The argument used in this effort, however, is not <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child, but <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman herself...|$|R
