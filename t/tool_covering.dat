50|$|Master carvers {{then used}} the durable plaster {{cast as a}} {{measuring}} <b>tool,</b> <b>covering</b> {{the surface of the}} plaster cast with hundreds of pencil marks and metal pins, or points, which served as registration marks for a pointing machine. The pointing machine was moved repeatedly from the points on the plaster cast to corresponding areas on a block of marble to guide the carver's tools as he translated the composition into marble. The tool would then be moved, over and over again, hundreds of times, from the points on the plaster to the corresponding locations on the block of marble. Each time, the tool would measure the depth and location on the marble block, creating a three-dimensional guide that helped the marble carver replicate the artist's original form more quickly and with greater ease. When creating the finished marble versions, fine details including the cross and locket, and the chains were finalised, and differ slightly between the different marble versions. The Smithsonian American Art Museum holds the original 1843 pointed-plaster mold that served as the model for the marble versions of the Greek Slave, along with numerous other smaller casts from Powers' studio.|$|E
