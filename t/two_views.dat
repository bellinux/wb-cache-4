5|$|John Koller {{explains}} {{the role of}} intent in Jainism with {{the example of a}} monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not be guilty. The crucial difference between the <b>two</b> <b>views</b> is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorising it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an intent to do violence and hence entail his guilt. So the absence of intent does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVirB 8 is a {{critical}} component of the Brucella suis type IV secretion system (T 4 SS). We previously showed that the transmembrane (TM) domain plays an essential role in interactions of this protein with itself and the other proteins of the T 4 SS. We report that a point mutation in this TM domain stabilizes homodimers of VirB 8 and heterodimers with VirB 10. A similar variant of Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB 8 showed the same phenotype. The B. suis VirB 8 variant was unable to complement a virB 8 mutant and displayed a dominant negative phenotype when expressed in wild type B. suis. We suggest that interaction of VirB 8 with VirB 10 could {{play a major role in}} the correct function of the B. suis VirB T 4 SS.

40|$|AbstractThe TRAPP vesicle-tethering complex {{consists}} {{of more than}} 10 distinct polypeptides and is involved in protein transport. Using the C 2 subunit as bait we identified SPATA 4, a spermatocyte-specific protein of unknown function, as an interacting partner in a yeast two hybrid screen. Further studies indicate SPATA 4 interacts with the C 2 portion of the TRAPP complex. SPATA 4 fractionates with both cytosolic and nuclear fractions suggesting it may have several distinct functions. SPATA 4 {{is one of only}} three human proteins that contain a DUF 1042 domain and we show that C 2 does not interact with another one of the DUF 1042 domain-containing proteins. Our results suggest a role for SPATA 4 in membrane traffic and a specialized function for TRAPP in spermatocytes.

The Soviet and Russian view is that of 2,377 Finnish prisoners of war who reached the prison camps 1,954 were {{returned}} after the Moscow Armistice. The Finnish view is that of the original approximately 3,500 Finnish prisoners of war, only about 2,000 were returned (more than 40% perished). The difference can be at least partially explained by the Soviet practice of counting only the prisoners who survived to reach a prison camp.|$|E

25|$|There were <b>two</b> <b>views</b> on {{the role}} the IMF should assume as a global {{economic}} institution. American delegate Harry Dexter White foresaw an IMF that functioned more like a bank, making sure that borrowing states could repay their debts on time. Most of White's plan was incorporated into the final acts adopted at Bretton Woods. British economist John Maynard Keynes imagined that the IMF would be a cooperative fund upon which member states could draw to maintain economic activity and employment through periodic crises. This view suggested an IMF that helped governments and to act as the United States government had during the New Deal in response to World War II.|$|E
25|$|Japan's {{approach}} to ruling Taiwan could be roughly divided into <b>two</b> <b>views.</b> The first, supported by Gotō, held {{that from a}} biological perspective, the natives could not be completely assimilated. Thus, Japan would have to follow the British approach, and Taiwan would never be governed {{exactly the same way}} as the Home Islands but would be governed under a whole new set of laws. The opposing viewpoint was held by future Prime Minister Hara Takashi, who believed that the Taiwanese and Koreans were similar enough to the Japanese to be fully absorbed into Japanese society, and was thus in favor of using the same legal and governmental approaches on the colonies as those used in the Home Islands.|$|E
25|$|Jesus' {{death and}} resurrection {{underpin}} a variety of theological interpretations as to how salvation is granted to humanity. These interpretations vary widely in how much emphasis they place {{on the death of}} Jesus as compared to his words. According to the substitutionary atonement view, Jesus' death is of central importance, and Jesus willingly sacrificed himself as an act of perfect obedience as a sacrifice of love which pleased God. By contrast the moral influence theory of atonement focuses much more on the moral content of Jesus' teaching, and sees Jesus' death as a martyrdom. Since the Middle Ages there has been conflict between these <b>two</b> <b>views</b> within Western Christianity. Evangelical Protestants typically hold a substitutionary view and in particular hold to the theory of penal substitution. Liberal Protestants typically reject substitutionary atonement and hold to the moral influence theory of atonement. Both views are popular within the Roman Catholic church, with the satisfaction doctrine incorporated into the idea of penance.|$|E

25|$|While {{artists in}} the North found limited {{opportunity}} to produce the religious iconography which had long been their staple—images of religious subjects were forbidden in the Dutch Reformed Protestant Church—the continuing Northern tradition of detailed realism and hidden symbols appealed to the growing Dutch middle classes, who were replacing Church and State as the principal patrons {{of art in the}} Netherlands. Added to this was the Dutch mania for horticulture, particularly the tulip. These <b>two</b> <b>views</b> of flowers—as aesthetic objects and as religious symbols— merged to create a very strong market for this type of still life. Still life, like most Dutch art work, was generally sold in open markets or by dealers, or by artists at their studios, and rarely commissioned; therefore, artists usually chose the subject matter and arrangement. So popular was this type of still-life painting, that much of the technique of Dutch flower painting was codified in the 1740 treatise Groot Schilderboeck by Gerard de Lairesse, which gave wide-ranging advice on color, arranging, brushwork, preparation of specimens, harmony, composition, perspective, etc.|$|E
25|$|In his What About Those Who Have Never Heard? Sanders tells a {{story about}} a college student who {{rejected}} Christianity because, he claimed, it “damns to hell all those who never hear about Jesus.” Sanders replied that though some Christians held that position there are several other views which have been affirmed by Christians throughout history. In his book, No Other Name, he discusses a range of views affirmed by Christians. Sanders coined the term “restrictivism” for the view that Christian salvation is possible only for those who have heard about the gospel of Jesus and put their faith in Jesus prior to their death. Those who die without knowing about Jesus cannot inherit eternal life. The second view he discusses is universalism (or apokatastasis) according to which every human who has ever lived will be redeemed. Between these polar views are what Sanders calls the “wider hope” and he spends the most time on <b>two</b> <b>views</b> in this category. One is what he calls eschatological evangelization or postmortem salvation. In this view if a person dies without having heard of Jesus then he or she will encounter Jesus after death and be provided an opportunity to put their faith in Jesus. The final position Sanders covers is the one he affirms: inclusivism. The unevangelized are saved by the work of Jesus if they respond in faith to God based on the revelation they have available.|$|E

500|$|Mark Lawson of The Guardian {{noted that}} the cause of Cal's {{hermaphroditic}} condition is an inherited recessive gene. According to UC Riverside psychology professor Sonja Lyubomirsky, the novel examines how an individual's traits are due neither solely to nature nor solely to nurture. Similarly, Cal's gender cannot be defined solely as male or female. Rather, it is both male and female. Addressing how genetic determinism may have renewed the antediluvian beliefs about destiny, Eugenides refutes the post-Freudian beliefs that a person's traits are mainly due to nurture. Thus, the novel pits evolutionary biology against free will.
