5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> was {{designed}} to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. <b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> received multiple awards upon release.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trailer</b> was {{produced}} and {{made by the}} Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for Killzone 2 and Mass Effect 2. According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director {{and the director of}} <b>the</b> <b>trailer,</b> Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating <b>the</b> <b>trailer,</b> allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted <b>the</b> <b>trailer</b> to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.|$|E
