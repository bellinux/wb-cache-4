40|$|We present {{measurements}} and calculations of the terahertz (THz) electric field measured in the near field of a metal tip used in THz apertureless near-field optical microscopy (THz-ANSOM). An analytical model in which we treat the metal tip as a linear wire antenna allows us to predict {{almost all of the}} features observed in the measurements, such as the relatively slow decay of the near-field amplitude when the tip-crystal separation increases. When the tip-crystal separation is modulated, in conjunction with lock-in detection at the modulation frequency, a smaller THz spot size is observed underneath the tip. A comparison with analytical expressions shows that in this case the electric field originates predominantly from the tip apex, with negligible contributions from the <b>tip</b> <b>shaft.</b> In the unmodulated case, the observed signal is the spatial integral of the electrooptic (EO) effect over the interaction length between the THz near field and the probe laser pulse. In the modulated case, to a good approximation, we find that the signal is proportional to the value of the THz near field at the surface of the EO crystal only.

40|$|Visibility of {{the needle}} <b>tip</b> and <b>shaft</b> is {{important}} during ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia {{in order to prevent}} nerve trauma. <b>Tip</b> and <b>shaft</b> visibility is reduced when needles are inserted in-plane at wide angles and out-of-plane at narrow angles to the ultrasound probe. Although textured needles are more reflective than smooth needles, we hypothesised that poor visibility of the <b>tip</b> and <b>shaft</b> still remained using the above angle-probe combinations. In a single-blind study, we compared the visibility of a textured Tuohy needle, a textured single-shot needle and a conventional smooth-surfaced Tuohy needle when inserted into the biceps and deltoid muscles of a soft embalmed cadaver. One hundred and forty-four needles were block-randomised to in-plane and out-of-plane insertions at 30 °, 45 °, 60 ° and 75 ° to the ultrasound beam. Two blinded raters assessed needle tip visibility on video recordings of the insertions using a binary scale (0 = not visible, 1 = visible) and shaft visibility using a 5 -point Likert scale. The median (IQR [range]) proportions of visible needle tips were 83 % (67 – 83 [50 – 100]%) for the textured Tuohy, 75 % (67 – 83 [33 – 83]%) for the textured single-shot needle and 33 % (33 – 46 [0 – 50]%) for the smooth-surfaced Tuohy (p = 0. 0007).

A Moir pattern results from the overlap of two repetitive patterns with slightly different periods. With this technique, it is possible to detect very small differences in spacing and hence radial growth in a rotating disk due to a flaw such as a crack. The experiment involved etching a circular reference pattern on a subscale engine disk that had a 50. 8 mm (2 in.) long notch machined into it to simulate a crack.

However, it is extremely challenging to directly measure pore {{fluid pressure}}s in low-permeability mudstones. We developed a new pressure penetrometer, the Temperature-Two-Pressure (T 2 P) probe, which allows the pore fluid pressure to be accurately inferred from partial dissipation records. We used the strain path method to simulate pore pressure generation and dissipation due to penetration of penetrometers with various geometries. Our theoretical analyses suggest that one of the key controls on soil behavior is the undrained rigidity index.
