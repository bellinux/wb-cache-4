25|$|As {{a general}} example, if a null {{hypothesis}} {{is assumed to}} follow the standard normal distribution N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis can either mean (i) the mean is not zero, or (ii) the variance is not unity, or (iii) the distribution is not normal, depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> performed. However, supposing we manage to reject the zero mean hypothesis, even if we know the distribution is normal and variance is unity, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.|$|E
25|$|For limited applications, Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) can supplement or possibly replace {{the use of}} wind tunnels. For example, the experimental rocket plane SpaceShipOne was designed without any use of wind tunnels. However, on one test, flight threads were attached {{to the surface of}} the wings, performing a wind tunnel <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> during an actual flight in order to refine the computational model. Where external turbulent flow is present, CFD is not practical due to limitations in present-day computing resources. For example, an area that is still much too complex for the use of CFD is determining the effects of flow on and around structures, bridges, terrain, etc.|$|E
25|$|The next evening, Zack is {{preparing}} to film a scene between Stacey and another actor, Lester, {{that was supposed to}} have been with Lester and Miri. Zack is dismayed when Miri shows up and insists on shooting the scene as originally planned. In the back room, an incredulous Zack asks if she is doing this as a form of retaliation, pointing out that Stacey told him that Miri did not mind her sleeping with Zack. Miri corrects him, clarifying that she did not mind that Stacey merely made the offer to sleep with him. Perceiving this to have been some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> Zack admits that during the sex scene they filmed together, they were actually making love and that there was an emotional connection between them, and that he loves Miri. When Miri does not reciprocate, Zack storms out of the coffee shop, quitting the film and his job, and moves out of the apartment.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "normative assessment" [...] {{refers to}} the process of {{comparing}} one test-taker to his or her peers. A norm-referenced test (NRT) is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> assessment, or evaluation which yields an estimate of the position of the tested individual in a predefined population. The estimate is derived from the analysis of test scores and other relevant data from a sample drawn from the population. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> identifies whether the test taker performed better or worse than other students taking this test. A criterion-referenced test (CRT) is a style of test which uses test scores to show whether or not test takers performed well on a given task, not how well they performed compared to other test takers. Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests. In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student has learned the material.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{companies}} offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. Generally {{the world is}} specified into about 20–25 regions, and the approximate percentage of DNA inherited from each is stated. This is usually done by comparing the frequency of each Autosomal DNA marker tested to many population groups. The reliability of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the SNPs tested, {{and the degree of}} admixture in the person tested. Earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but their accuracies have since improved greatly. Usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test {{may turn out to be}} incorrect. For example, Europeans often receive an exaggerated proportion of Scandinavian. [...] Testing companies will often regularly update their ethnicity estimate, changing an individual's ethnicity estimate.|$|E

2500|$|Blastocystis is a {{single-celled}} protozoan which infects {{the large}} intestine. Physicians report {{that patients with}} infection show symptoms of abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. One study found that 43% of IBS patients were infected with Blastocystis versus 7% of controls. [...] An additional study found that many IBS patients from whom Blastocystis could not be identified showed a strong antibody reaction to the organism, which is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> used to diagnose certain difficult-to-detect infections. Other researchers have also reported that special testing techniques {{may be necessary to}} identify the infection in some people. [...] While some scientists believe the finding that IBS patients carry a protozoal infection to be significant, other researchers have reported their belief that the presence of the infection is not medically significant. [...] Researchers report that the infection can be resistant to common protozoal treatments in laboratory culture study, and in experience with patients,; therefore, identifying Blastocystis infection may not be of immediate help to a patient. A 2006 study of gastrointestinal infections in the United States suggested that Blastocystis infection has become the leading cause of protozoal diarrhea in that country. Blastocystis was the most frequently identified protozoal infection found in patients in a 2006 Canadian study.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{researchers}} did {{not believe}} {{it was possible to}} distinguish between Anthrax variants. In January 2002, Ivins suggested that DNA sequencing should show differences in the genetics of anthrax mutations which would allow the source to be identified. Despite researchers advising the FBI that this may not be possible, Ivins tutored agents on how to recognise them. Considered cutting edge at the time, this technique is now commonplace. In February 2002, Ivins volunteered to provide samples from several variants of the Ames strain in order to compare their morphs. He submitted two test tube [...] "slants" [...] each from four samples of the Ames strain in his collection. Two of the slants were from flask RMR-1029. [...] Although the slants from flask RMR-1029 were later reported to be a positive match, all eight slants were reportedly in the wrong <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> tube and would therefore not be usable as evidence in court. On March 29, 2002, Ivins's boss instructed Ivins and others in Suites B3 and B4 on how to properly prepare slants for the FBI Repository. [...] The subpoena also included instructions on the proper way to prepare slants. When Ivins was told that his February samples did not meet FBIR requirements, he prepared eight new slants. [...] The two new slants prepared from flask RMR-1029 submitted in April by Ivins did not contain the mutations that were later determined to be in flask RMR-1029.|$|E
