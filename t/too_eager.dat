Environmental psychologist Michael Dudley pointed out copy-editing errors such as misspellings, and complained that Florida ignored existing literature on the topic of the connections between personalities and places.

5|$|The new Prime Minister's {{attempts}} to secure such a settlement were frustrated because Germany {{was in no}} hurry to talk to Britain. Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath was supposed to visit Britain in July 1937 but cancelled his visit. Lord Halifax, the Lord President of the Council, visited Germany privately in November and met Hitler and other German officials. Both Chamberlain and British Ambassador to Germany Nevile Henderson pronounced the visit a success. Foreign Office officials complained that the Halifax visit made it appear Britain was <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> for talks, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, felt that he had been bypassed.|$|E
5|$|After a time, Himmler {{found that}} the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and {{sometimes}} did not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered {{physical and mental health}} problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of Einsatzgruppe D, SS-Gruppenführer Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.|$|E

Visions rose before his eyes of sitting back in one of Scott's armchairs, watching a fag toasting muffins, which he would eventually dispatch with languid enjoyment. So he followed Scott to his study. The classical parallel to his situation is the well-known case of the oysters. They, <b>too,</b> were <b>eager</b> for the treat.|$|R

Finally, on 1 March, the uprising began in the southern city of Basra. With this, the tides of revolt spread throughout Iraq, from the southern marshes to the Kurdish mountains.|$|E

They <b>too</b> were <b>eager</b> for the work, for Larry had whispered among them that, if the signal was made, it would signify that a band of the enemy's marauders were at Mrs. Conyers'; and all had been so kindly treated there that they were eager to repay the treatment they had received.

And a certain remark he had hazarded to her, in rather <b>too</b> blunt and <b>eager</b> a manner, kept the young lady herself even more silent than Dick. On both sides there was an unwillingness to talk on any but the most trivial subjects, and their sentences rarely took a larger form than could be expressed {{in two or three}} words.|$|R

Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the radical left deemed him <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours—including the Nobel Peace Prize—and became the subject of a cult of personality.

50|$|Simonida {{was born}} in Constantinople ca. 1294. In 1298, {{as a result of}} a Byzantine defeat, Emperor Andronikos II promised a {{marriage}} alliance to the Serbian ruler Milutin. Initially, Andronikos II intended to wed his sister Eudokia, the empress-dowager of Trebizond, but after she refused, Simonida was proposed instead. Church circles in Constantinople opposed the marriage, but the emperor was determined to push the deal through, and in late 1298 he sent his trusted minister Theodore Metochites to Serbia to conduct the negotiations. On his part, Milutin <b>too</b> was <b>eager</b> to accept, and even divorced his third wife, Ana Terter, the daughter of the Bulgarian tsar George Terter. Simonida was five years old, and Milutin was almost 50, was married three times, with adult children. The marriage was celebrated in Thessalonica in spring 1299, and the couple departed for Serbia in April. As a wedding present, Byzantines recognized Serbian rule north of the line Ohrid—Prilep—Štip.|$|R
50|$|Seeing Kashyapa's co-wives being {{blessed with}} children, Diti <b>too</b> was <b>eager</b> {{to have a}} son, so she asked Kashyapa for company.Though Kashyapa had acceded to her request, He {{had asked her to}} wait for an hour as it was then the time when Shiva and his retinue of ghosts and spirits moved about, a time which was {{considered}} inauspicious and unsuited. However Diti, shaken by the passion of love and lust, couldn't wait and she seized Kashyapa by his garments, which was a sign of immodesty. Since Diti's mind was impure, tainted by lust, she would give birth to two unworthy sons who would violate all the ethics (Dharma) and follow the path of Adharma. When Diti felt sorry, Kashyapa consoled her by saying that they would be slain by Lord Vishnu himself and thus be blessed by the Lord's contact in the end. Also, one of her four grandsons by her first son, would be a great devotee of Vishnu and also the noblest man (He is Prahlada). In this way, Jaya and Vijaya were born on this earth to Diti as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. In Section 67, Adi Parava of Mahabharata, it is stated that king Shishupala, the powerful ruler of Chedis, was also an incarnation of Hiranyakasipu, the son of Diti.|$|R

Seeing an old friend of his, Brandeis, still with the Condotta, Marianne lures him back to their {{apartment}} where the two soldiers reunite like brothers. Brandeis <b>too</b> is <b>eager</b> to escape, so they hatch a plan. After a few months, Brandeis has escaped, and comes to live with Marianne and the Burned Man. But trouble follows as they are hunted down by the Condotta. Heavily pregnant, Marianne and the two men try to escape. Eventually they are caught. Brandeis is executed and the Burned Man is tied up and burned alive once more. In order to spare him pain, Marianne shoots an arrow through his heart, exactly through the first wound. However, the Condotta see her, and chase her over a frozen river. Falling through, Marianne encounters three ‘presences’, who claim they are now her three masters. As penance for the sins she had committed, she was told she now has a chest full of ‘hearts’, that she must give away, which she does in the form of sculpting. She will have one heart left for her lover, who must ‘accept it, and then give it back’ to set her free.|$|R

In 1485 the priory had 22 monks. When Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495–1503, visited Bath in 1499 he was shocked to find this famous church in ruins.

But as the conversation round the table, after the ladies had gone, soon drifted into politics and became general, Phineas, for a while, forgot Madame Max Goesler and the Blankenberg journey, and listened to the eager words of Cabinet Ministers, now and again uttering a word of his own, and showing that he, <b>too,</b> was as <b>eager</b> as others. But the session in Mr. Palliser's dining-room was not long, and Phineas soon found himself making his way amidst a throng of coming guests into the rooms above.

60|$|That is bright, and {{friendly}} and <b>eager</b> <b>too,</b> {{for it is}} throughout the very expression of himself. I {{think it is a}} pity if an author disappoints even the unreasonable expectation of the reader, whom his art has invited to love him; but I do not believe that Doctor Holmes could inflict this disappointment. Certainly he could disappoint no reasonable expectation, no intelligent expectation. What he wrote, that he was, and every one felt this who met him. He has therefore not died, as some men die, the remote impersonal sort, but he is yet thrillingly alive in every page of his books. The quantity of his literature is not great, but the quality is very surprising, and surprising first of all as equality. From the beginning to the end he wrote one man, of course in his successive consciousnesses. Perhaps every one does this, but his work gives the impression of an uncommon continuity, in spite of its being the effect of a later and an earlier impulse so very marked as to have made the later an astonishing revelation to those who thought they knew him.|$|R

Though there were a number older than he, they acknowledged his chieftaincy. He was a beautiful boy, a lithe young god in breathing bronze, eyes wide apart, intelligent and daring, a bubble, a mote, a beautiful flash and sparkle of life.

500|$|Others {{were less}} enamored with Ferris, many taking {{issue with the}} film's [...] "rebel without a cause" [...] hedonism. David Denby of New York Magazine, called the film [...] "a nauseating {{distillation}} of the slack, greedy side of Reaganism." [...] Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a “splendidly ridiculous exercise in unadulterated indulgence,” and the film “encapsulated the Reagan era's near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment....” Gene Siskel panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective saying “Ferris Bueller doesn't do anything much fun ... hey don't even sit in the bleachers where all the kids like to sit {{when they go to}} Cubs games.” Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen.

500|$|In one noted {{example of}} an author being <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> to assign a new name, in 1902 George Francis Atkinson {{described}} a specimen he found in Texas, otherwise similar to Simblum but with a loose net drooping from the head; he initiated the new genus Dictybole to include his [...] "new" [...] species D.texense. The species was, according to mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, merely a decomposing or insect-damaged specimen of L.periphragmoides that had been preserved in alcohol. Lloyd criticized Atkinson's poor judgment in his self-published journal Mycological Notes, and later, humiliated him under the pen name N.J.McGinty. William H. Long later (1907) transferred Atkinson's taxon to the genus Simblum, claiming that the yellow arms and longer spores were sufficiently distinct to consider it distinct from L.periphragmoides (then known as Simblum sphaerocephalum); however, according to Dring, D.texense should also be considered a synonym of L.periphragmoides. Despite Dring's renaming, and the subsequent acceptance of his subsuming of the genus Simblum into Lysurus, the species is still occasionally referred to Simblum sphaerocephalum.|$|E

According to him, though Madonna insisted that she was trying to demystify sexuality altogether, the author believed she just wanted to publish pornographic text and pictures and get away with it. [...] "She was being a brat, not a revolutionary", the author concluded. Author Lucy O'Brien declared that the book was a bold, harrowing exercise in frustration, and despite Madonna's attempt at invincibility, the book appeared as [...] "a curious act of self-destruction". [...] "The overwhelming effect of the book is numbing," [...] stated Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone. [...] "The images are derivative, and Madonna herself seems far <b>too</b> <b>eager</b> to shock; that, not even prurient arousal, seems the ideal response the book tirelessly seeks. The potency of Sexs subject matter is dissipated by Madonna and Meisel's self-congratulatory – and silly – sense of their own 'bravery,' as if their naughty games were somehow revolutionary." ...|$|E
