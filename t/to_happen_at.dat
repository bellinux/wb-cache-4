5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Among the lanthanides, {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital that is important for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> cerium. Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides. Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, it changes to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|E
25|$|The table {{shows that}} this partial {{pressure}} is not achieved until the temperature is nearly 800°C. For the outgassing of CO2 from calcium carbonate <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> an economically useful rate, the equilibrium pressure must significantly exceed the ambient pressure of CO2. And {{for it to happen}} rapidly, the equilibrium pressure must exceed total atmospheric pressure of 101 kPa, which happens at 898°C.|$|E

25|$|Excess vitamin A {{has also}} been {{suspected}} to be a contributor to osteoporosis. This seems <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> much lower doses than those required to induce acute intoxication. Only preformed vitamin A can cause these problems, because the conversion of carotenoids into vitamin A is downregulated when physiological requirements are met. An excessive uptake of carotenoids can, however, cause carotenosis.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{verification}} systems allow merchants {{to verify}} {{in a few}} seconds that the card is valid and the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> time of purchase. The verification is performed using a credit card payment terminal or point-of-sale (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a magnetic stripe or chip on the card; the latter system is called Chip and PIN in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is implemented as an EMV card.|$|E
25|$|CSP message-passing {{fundamentally}} {{involves a}} rendezvous between the {{processes involved in}} sending and receiving the message, i.e. the sender cannot transmit a message until the receiver is ready to accept it. In contrast, message-passing in actor systems is fundamentally asynchronous, i.e. message transmission and reception do not have <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> same time, and senders may transmit messages before receivers are ready to accept them. These approaches may be considered duals of each other, {{in the sense that}} rendezvous-based systems can be used to construct buffered communications that behave as asynchronous messaging systems, while asynchronous systems can be used to construct rendezvous-style communications by using a message/acknowledgement protocol to synchronize senders and receivers.|$|E

Littlewood {{suggested that}} individuals should statistically expect one-in-a-million events ("miracles") <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> them <b>at</b> {{the rate of}} about one per month. By Littlewood's definition, seemingly miraculous events are actually commonplace.|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} growing overlap between the Vocational Education and Training (VET), {{organised}} under the National Training System, and Higher Education sectors in Australia. Courses are primarily taken by those aged over 18, however in some vocational and general academic courses a minority of students enter at the minimum school-leaving age of 16, although from May 2009 Federal Government policy calls {{for young people to}} be in education, gainful employment, or training until age 17 (Year 12 qualification) with tightening of income support payments to age 20 if not undertaking further training. This tends to happen particularly at Technical and Further Education colleges (TAFE), and is less likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> a university or a private institution.|$|E
25|$|Humayun drew {{attention}} towards {{the need to}} conserve the forests and biodiversity at the Andaman and Nicobar islands, particularly Barren Island, Narcondam Island and the Battye Malve Island. The Indian Navy ceased shooting practice at the Battye Malve, a nesting place of the Nicobar Pigeon, after Humayun made a representation to the navy {{during one of the}} trips. He also highlighted the flaws and pitfalls in the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. These lacunae led to difficulties in obtaining permissions for gathering specimens at the islands for research. On the other hand, illegal killing and poaching of the animals protected by the Act continued <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago and elsewhere in the country.|$|E
25|$|Eschatology is {{concerned}} with the afterlife, beginning with death and the personal judgment which follows the death of the individual, and which is followed by the destination of heaven or hell. (In Catholic theology, heaven is sometimes preceded by purgatory.) Eschatology also concerns itself with events which are said <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> the end of this age: the return of Jesus, the resurrection of the dead, the Rapture, the Tribulation, and following these things, the Millennium, or thousand years of peace, which has been interpreted both literally and symbolically. Finally, eschatology concerns itself {{with the end of the}} world and its associated events: the Last Judgment; the banishment of Death, Hades, and Satan and his followers to the Lake of Fire; and the creation of a new heaven and earth. Millenarianists, Seventh Day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other recently founded sects have been influential in the modern development of these doctrines, though their roots are Biblical.|$|E

500|$|Hayward {{was part}} of a team of {{scientists}} sent to investigate the origins of the Shroud of Turin in Vatican City. Speaking of the venture at the Naval War College in 1982, he said that the evidence collected convinced him that the shroud was in fact used to bury Christ. However, he spoke only for himself and not the entire team. According to the majority of the team, the image on the shroud was formed by [...] "a combination of heat and light" [...] and was not painted. Hayward decided that further research into the age of the shroud via Carbon-14 dating was needed but Church authorities would not permit this <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Graham was {{originally}} scheduled {{to write a}} single episode for the previous series, but withdrew {{because he did not}} have enough time to finish the script. Showrunner Steven Moffat e-mailed him asking for him to write for the next series, and Graham agreed. When the two met, Moffat said he would like the episodes to lead into the mid-series finale and that it should deal with [...] "avatars that rebel". After Graham had finished his script Moffat had the idea of what would need <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> the end of [...] "The Almost People" [...] to lead into the next episode and gave Graham the premise for the cliffhanger, which Graham [...] "loved". With [...] "The Almost People", Graham avoided creating similar situations that had happened in [...] "The Rebel Flesh". He originally intended on setting [...] "The Almost People" [...] in a different location to [...] "throw everybody", but decided that would be unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Peter Carew's {{claim of}} insubordination {{has been given}} support by James Watt, former Medical Director-General of the Royal Navy, based on records of an {{epidemic}} of dysentery in Portsmouth which could have rendered the crew incapable of handling the ship properly, while historian Richard Barker {{has suggested that the}} crew actually knew that the ship was an accident waiting <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> <b>at</b> which they balked and refused to follow orders. Marsden has noted that the Carew biography is in some details inconsistent with the sequence of events reported by both French and English eyewitnesses. It also reports that there were 700 men on board, an unusually high number. The distance in time to the event it describes may mean that it was embellished to add a dramatic touch. The report of French galleys sinking the Mary Rose as stated by Martin du Bellay has been described as [...] "the account of a courtesan" [...] by naval historian Maurice de Brossard. Du Bellay and his two brothers were close to king FrancisI and du Bellay had much to gain from portraying the sinking as a French victory. English sources, even if biased, would have nothing to gain from portraying the sinking as the result of crew incompetence rather than conceding to a victory to the much-feared gun galleys.|$|E

2500|$|Another way {{of expressing}} a {{temporal}} clause is to use paméne [...] or m'méne [...] "when", which are followed by the relative clause intonation of the verb.

These were the [...] "Great Fires" [...] or [...] "Royal Fires" [...] of Adur Burzen-Mihr, Adur Farnbag, and Adur Gushnasp. The legends of the Great Fires are probably of antiquity (see also Denkard citation, below), for by the 3rd century CE, miracles were said <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>at</b> the sites, and the fires were popularly associated with other legends {{such as those of}} the folktale heroes Fereydun, Jamshid and Rustam.|$|E
