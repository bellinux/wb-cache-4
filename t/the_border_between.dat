He then began to survey and mark <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Colorado and Utah from this point northward. In 1901, Howard B. Carpenter surveyed and marked <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Arizona and Utah, completing the survey of borders making up the Four Corners Monument.|$|E

5|$|Upon leaving West Buffalo Township, Buffalo Creek {{flows into}} Buffalo Township. It then turns {{northeast}} and passes {{by the community}} of Cowan and under Pennsylvania Route 192. The creek then picks up its tributary Stony Run before passing the community of Cameron and picking up Spruce Run. At this point, Buffalo Creek flows along <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Buffalo Township and Kelly Township. Buffalo Creek then meanders in an eastward direction, passing near a quarry, the community of Kelly Point, and the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary. After leaving Buffalo Township, the creek flows briefly along <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Kelly Township and Lewisburg before discharging into the West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, Berlin {{had been}} {{divided into four}} sectors {{controlled}} by the Allies: the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. The sector borders inside the city could in general be used freely for passage out of the German Democratic Republic, even after <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR had been continually closed off, starting in 1952. The outer border of West Berlin, which was also <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of border protection facilities began.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Passaic River into Bergen County, {{the road is}} called Paterson Avenue and designated as County Route 120, in Wallington, in a residential and light-density commercial area. The road becomes <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Wallington {{to the north and}} East Rutherford to the south. At the end of Wallington, Paterson Avenue is <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Carlstadt and East Rutherford for a short distance but then the road dips into East Rutherford to avoid a hill (the bypass, which goes over the hill, is called Hoboken Road). The road returns to the Carlstadt/East Rutherford border at Route 17 which it crosses over via an overpass, and is then designated as Route 120 and Paterson Plank Road for a distance.|$|E

5|$|Past here, Route 70 {{loses the}} Marlton Pike name and {{continues}} east into the heavily wooded Pine Barrens. It passes {{to the south}} of the Leisuretowne retirement village before entering predominantly rural areas, with two fire lanes paralleling the road on either side. Route 70 eventually turns slightly to the northeast and forms <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Southampton Township to the north and Woodland Township to the south. Along this borderline, the route comes to the Four Mile Circle, where it intersects the western terminus of Route 72 as well as CR 644 and CR 646. Past the traffic circle, Route 70 becomes <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> Pemberton Township to the north and Woodland Township to the south. The road passes {{to the south of}} the wooded Presidential Lakes Estates residential development before turning northeast through more of the Pine Barrens entirely within Pemberton Township. The road passes near some cranberry bogs before intersecting CR 530. At this intersection, CR 530 heads east concurrent with Route 70.|$|E
5|$|The Arcturus did not {{encounter}} the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe {{was hoping to}} study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> the two. He sailed along <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>between</b> the currents for several days to document it, theorizing that it could be the cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.|$|E
