5|$|After {{emerging}} from a manhole in the showers of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> {{as he makes his}} way to the space port and his chance at escape. Realizing he requires a guard to get through the retinal scanner that locks the doors to the space port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and take his eyes. He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E
5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E

5|$|Some females {{stay and}} defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area {{completely}} to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie {{down on top of}} the nest and try <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} maskirovka (military deception) to mask defensive {{positions and}} troop dispositions and {{to conceal the}} movement of men and materiel. These included camouflaging gun emplacements, constructing dummy airfields and depots, generating false radio-traffic, and spreading rumours among the Soviet frontline troops and the civilian population in the German-held areas. Movement of forces and supplies {{to and from the}} salient took place at night only. Ammunition caches were carefully concealed <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the landscape. Radio transmission was restricted and fires were forbidden. Command posts were hidden and motor transport in and around them forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts is {{influenced}} by its parent franchise, Final Fantasy, and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, hack and slash system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their behavior to an extent through the pause menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party in most areas, but nearly every level features a character who may replace them. For instance, Jack Skellington can join Sora's party in Halloween Town, but cannot accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world or both, can fly in Neverland, acquire aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and gain Halloween costumes in Halloween Town <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the locals.|$|E
50|$|Blend {{analysis}} {{is the process}} of understanding what blending options exist within a specified schedule and how these options impact product quality, projected revenue, and scheduled mining decisions. Because mathematical optimization algorithms only solve a mathematical model of the physical blending problem, it is typically necessary to make manual adjustments <b>to</b> <b>blends</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> achieve practical/desirable business outcomes. Analytics software tools facilitate this process by enabling a mine planner to easily see what options exist and the consequences of these options.|$|R

25|$|Rules {{for the red}} Burgundy appellations, from {{regional}} to Grand Cru level, generally {{allow up}} to 15% of the white grape varieties Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris <b>to</b> be <b>blended</b> <b>in,</b> {{but this is not}} widely practiced today.|$|R
5|$|Mantises are preyed on by {{vertebrates}} such as frogs, lizards, and birds, and by invertebrates such as spiders and ants. Generally, mantises {{protect themselves}} by camouflage, most species being cryptically colored to resemble foliage or other backgrounds, both to avoid predators and to better snare their prey. Those that live on uniformly colored surfaces such as bare earth or tree bark are dorsoventrally flattened {{so as to}} eliminate shadows that might reveal their presence. The species from different families called flower mantises are aggressive mimics: they resemble flowers convincingly enough to attract prey that come to collect pollen and nectar. Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt {{towards the end of}} the dry season; at this time of year, bush fires occur and this coloration enables them <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the fire-ravaged landscape (fire melanism).|$|E
5|$|New {{memorial}} buildings {{could also}} adopt a medieval style. The Scottish National War Memorial, for example, a Scots baronial styled memorial hall complete with stained glass in Edinburgh Castle, attempts <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> {{with the surrounding}} medieval fortress. In Germany, the totenburgen usually looked to the past for their style; Tannenberg, for example, was heavily medieval in appearance, resembling a castle, albeit combined with a huge cross and mass graves. The dolmen boulders used around the outside of many German memorials reinforced the archaic feel of the monuments. In other cases Germans chose to preserve or rebuild real medieval buildings and architecture to form war memorials, such as parts of Dorsten and Dülken.|$|E
5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype prefers to feed on Adenostoma while the other ecotype prefers to feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E
50|$|Bald caps may be {{purchased}} ready-made or be constructed on-site by a make-up artist, who applies {{several layers of}} liquid plastic (such as latex) to a pattern made by covering the actor's head in clingfilm. The finished cap is glued to the actor's head with spirit gum or surgical adhesive, and {{the edges of the}} cap are blended with the actor's skin using make-up techniques. Almost any colour medium {{can be applied to the}} bald cap to give it colour and texture for creating a bald look, <b>to</b> <b>blending</b> <b>in</b> with skin tones.|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season takes place over five months from August to January {{with up to}} three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is a neat, deep cup made of soft dry grass and bark. Spider webs, feathers and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork or even a mistletoe bush. It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish and splotched with dark grey-brown are laid on consecutive days, measuring 16mm × 13mm (0.6 × 0.5in). Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood while the female is foraging, and parents will feed young and dart off quickly if there are predators in the vicinity. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, {{and there is some}} evidence that extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as <b>to</b> <b>blend</b> <b>in</b> with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E
