25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a collapsible, energy-absorbing steering column and steering wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: The speedometer and odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and engine <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> with matching warning-light pods {{on both sides of the}} speedometer.|$|E
25|$|Marine oilers {{and more}} {{experienced}} qualified {{members of the}} engine department, or QMEDs, maintain the vessel in proper running order in the engine spaces below decks, {{under the direction of}} the ship's engineering officers. These workers lubricate gears, shafts, bearings, and other moving parts of engines and motors; read pressure and <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> record data and sometimes assist with repairs and adjust machinery. Wipers are the entry-level workers in the engine room, holding a position similar to that of ordinary seamen of the deck crew. They clean and paint the engine room and its equipment and assist the others in maintenance and repair work. With more experience, they become oilers and firemen.|$|E
25|$|The 1965 Chevrolet Chevy II and Nova were {{updated with}} cleaner {{front-end}} styling {{courtesy of a}} fresh full-width grille with new integrated headlight bezels. Parking lights moved down to the deep-section bumper, and sedans gained a new roofline. Taillight and backup lights were restyled, as was the rear cove. The 1965 Chevy II came in entry-level 100 form or as the posher Nova 400, each in three body styles. The Nova Super Sport came as a Sport Coupe only, and its production dipped to just 9,100 cars. Super Sports had a new brushed-chrome console with floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission or Powerglide automatic, but a column-mounted three-speed manual remained standard. Bucket seats wore textured vinyl trim, and the dashboard held ammeter, oil pressure, and <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|E

The RC F is equipped with vertical G-sensor for VDIM, Torque Vectoring Differential (TVD) with three operating modes, Standard, Slalom, or Track, front and rear coil-spring independent suspension, monotube gas-filled shock absorbers and ball-jointed stabilizer bars, three new 19-inch diameter forged aluminum wheels, spindle grille with F-mesh pattern on the lower half, unique front hood which raises {{the peak of the}} vehicle, hood air vent from the LFA, front cooling ducts, front fender ducts in the L shape, exclusive combination meters from LFA (a large centrally mounted tachometer that alters according to drive mode, digital and analog speedometer, differential torque vectoring monitor, G-force meter, oil and water <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> mileage information and a stopwatch), elliptical cross-section thick grip steering wheel, all-new high back seats, ornamentation and pedals, Brembo four-wheel power assisted disc brakes with anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (BA), 19x9-inch front and 19x10-inch rear wheels, 255/35R19 front and 275/35R19 rear tires.|$|E
25|$|The Stingers {{competed in}} Class D Production, which was {{dominated}} by the Triumph TR4, which was very quick in racing trim; however in its first race in January 1966, the Stinger was able to come in second by only one second. By {{the end of the}} 1966 season, Jerry Thompson had won the Central Division Championship and placed fifth in the 1966 Nationals, Dick Thompson, a highly successful Corvette race driver, had won the Northeast Division Championship, and Jim Spencer had won the Central Division Championship, with Dino Milani taking second place. The next year, however, Chevrolet dropped the Corsa line, and the Monza line was not initially available stock with the four carburetor engine; the engine was eventually offered as a special performance option, however, along with the 3.89 differential. The Monza instrumentation did not have a tachometer or head <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> which had to be separately installed. The SCCA, on the other hand, had relaxed its ruling regarding color, and the cars were available in red or blue. It is believed that only fourteen 1967 Stingers were built, but Dana Chevrolet, who distributed Stingers on the U.S. West Coast, ordered an additional three similar cars to be built to Stinger specifications, but with the AIR injection system to meet California emissions laws, with Yenko's permission. A total of 185 Stingers are believed to have been built, the last being YS-9700 built for Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company as a tire test vehicle in 1969â€“1970. Comedian, television star, and car enthusiast Tim Allen owned and raced Yenko Stinger #YS-043 until he sold it around June, 2009.|$|E
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} carriage {{is built}} from bolted aluminium tubing. In flight steering is accomplished via handles that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the aircraft has foot pedal-controlled nosewheel steering. The {{main landing gear}} incorporates spring rod suspension. An instrument pod, including a tachometer, cylinder head <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> and exhaust gas <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> was a factory option.|$|R
2500|$|This is an {{electronic}} or fiberoptic sensor to provide continuous monitoring of downhole pressure and <b>temperature.</b> <b>Gauges</b> either use a 1/4" [...] control line clamped onto {{the outside of}} the tubing string to provide an electrical or fiberoptic communication to surface, or transmit measured data to surface by acoustic signal in the tubing wall.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, the {{standard}} Charger featured a simulated wood-grain steering wheel, four individual bucket seats {{with a full}} length console from front to rear. The rear seats and rear center armrest pad also folded forward while the trunk divider dropped back, which allowed for generous cargo room. Numerous interior features were exclusive to the Charger including door panels, courtesy lights, as well as premium trim and vinyl upholstery. The instrument panel did not use regular bulbs to light the gauges, but rather electroluminescence lit the four chrome-ringed circular dash pods, needles, radio, shifter-position indicator in the console, as well as clock and air conditioning controls if equipped. The dash housed a 0 to 6000 rpm tachometer, a 0 to [...] speedometer, as well as alternator, fuel, and <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges</b> as standard equipment.|$|E
2500|$|The Coast Guard {{also noted}} that the T2 tanker class had a {{characteristic}} [...] "weak back", meaning the keel would split at a point weakened by corrosion, usually around midships. Such a splitting had happened on several T2 tankers, and many were discovered during inspections to have hairline or larger fractures within the keel and on major frames. Companies who owned T2 tankers were ordered {{to pay attention to the}} keel when inspecting. Former crewmen also testified that corrosion was everywhere, mentioning inoperable <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> a ruptured steam coil, and worn packing around the screws. It was recorded that Marine Sulphur Queen was scheduled for a drydock inspection in January 1963, but it was postponed by the owners, who had complained that cargo deliveries were behind and they needed their ships to catch up. One new crewman, on reporting to the ship just before it sailed for the last time, turned to his wife and pronounced it [...] "a floating garbage can." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1975 American ECD came {{standard}} with a 170 gross hp [...] inline six engine with a single-barrel Carter carburetor, electronic ignition, 266 degree camshaft, and 7.6:1 {{compression ratio}} with regular cooling system. Included were manual front disk brakes with rear drums, power steering, {{heavy duty suspension}} with front sway bar, Chrysler TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, and 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The exterior of the model incorporated a full vinyl roof with bright moldings, regular bright molding package (wheel lip, rocker panels, drip rails, and between taillights molding), luxury wheel covers, [...] "American" [...] and [...] "AutomÃ¡tico" [...] emblems on the rear panel, [...] "258" [...] emblems on rear quarter panels, and golden [...] "ECD" [...] emblems over {{the base of the}} C-pillars. Standard equipment also consisted of front and rear bench seats, front two-point seatbelts, front and rear armrests, luxury upholstery, custom steering wheel, column-mounted shifter, color-keyed padded dashboard, gasoline and water <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges,</b> warning lights (brakes, oil and electrical system), 200km/h speedometer, vacuum gauge, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, heater with front defroster, AM monoaural radio with a single speaker and antenna, locking glove box, parcel sheft, courtesy lights, padded sun visors, day/night rearview mirror, heat and sound insulating cardboard-type headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, rear ashtray mounted on the front seat back and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included among others a passenger's side mirror, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, power brakes, bumper guards, tinted windshield, and light group.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} the new , 9.5:1 compression ratio [...] six-cylinder engine with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor. It was VAM's second self-engineered engine, taking the Javelin up to performance levels of its V8 competition. The Go Pack version of this engine took the car to its zenith in terms of performance. The new engine was announced by two [...] "4.6" [...] emblems on both front fenders. The only other technical difference of the new version was a 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for units equipped with automatic transmission. The interior saw more changes starting with all-new non-reclining high-back bucket seats with built-in [...] "J" [...] emblems on the seat backs {{as well as on}} the center of the rear seat back. The dashboard was restricted to the unit with woodgrain overlays only; the instrument cluster was once again completely different from the AMC Javelins. The right pod housed a clock and tachometer hybrid with the same design and appearance as the US Rallye Pak units, except that it was tuned for six cylinder engines. The center pod had a 240km/h speedometer, a range that put it on par as an equivalent to AMC's 140 MHP unit of the Rallye Pak; but the colors, graphics, and typography of the dial were the same as the standard gauges. This created a high contrast between the speedometer and the clock/tack hybrid. On the left pod were the fuel and water <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges</b> with no oil pressure and ammeter gauges present. Like the AMC Javelins, the car now held a single dome light at the center of the headliner and a new brake pedal design for units with automatic transmission.|$|E

50|$|The {{dashboard}} is lit using electroluminescent {{panels in}} the gauge pods {{and on a}} call-out strip across the dash. This system did not use bulbs; instead, an inverter and transformer raised the battery voltage to over 100 volts AC and passed that high voltage through special plastic layers, causing the gauges to glow with a blue-green light. Instead of a water <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> the Chrysler Turbine has a Turbine Inlet <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> with numbers 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
