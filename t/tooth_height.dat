40|$|Compared with present applied milling gear production, the {{innovative}} Gear Rolling Technology {{is characterized by}} enormous economic and technical potential. By the employment of this cold massive forming technology are beside shortened process cycles to register substantial material savings by the effect of volume constancy during the rolling process. Above all, significant improvements of work piece characteristics are feasible. In comparison to the basic material a gear dependent increase of flank hardness (60 %) results by the effect of cold working. In the tooth root area there are even 100 % after gear rolling. Extraordinarily high surface qualities (Ra= 0, 4 mm; Rz= 1, 9 mm) are to be noticed in mirror-bright surfaces visually. Outline- and load adapted orientation of the material fibre are resulting in a minimum thermal delay at thermal treatment steps {{as well as in}} improved carrying behaviour of the gear. These advantages are for the first time applicable to <b>teeth</b> <b>heights</b> of 10 mm (<b>tooth</b> <b>heights</b> coefficient y< 2, 7) and show the recent results of research and development work of Fraunhofer-Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology (IWU) Chemnitz, Germany...|$|R

Teeth with these traits are good cutting tools and are well suited for grasping powerful prey and would seldom crack even when slicing through bones.|$|R
50|$|One of two Helicoprion species {{described}} by Wheeler in 1939, H. nevadensis, {{is based on}} a single partial fossil found in 1929 by Elbert A Stuart. It was reported as having originated from the Rochester Trachyte deposits, which Wheeler considered to be of Artinksian age. However, the Rochester Trachyte is in fact Triassic, and H. nevadensis likely did not originate in the Rochester Trachyte, thus rendering its true age unknown. Wheeler differentiated H. nevadensis from H. bessonowi by its pattern of whorl expansion and <b>tooth</b> <b>height,</b> but Leif Tapanila and Jesse Pruitt showed in 2013 that these were consistent with H. bessonowi at the developmental stage that the specimen represents.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, after scrutinizing 73 {{great white}} shark specimens, Michael D. Gottfried, Leonard Compagno and S.

The biggest C. megalodon tooth in the possession of this team, one discovered by Compagno in 1993, was an upper second anterior specimen, the maximum height of which was 168 mm. It yielded an estimated total length for C. megalodon of 15.9 m. Rumors of larger C. megalodon teeth persisted at the time. The maximum <b>tooth</b> <b>height</b> for this method is measured as a vertical line from the tip of the crown {{to the bottom of the}} lobes of the root, parallel to the long axis of the tooth.

50|$|Of {{the skull}} only the {{anterior}} {{part of the}} right dentary was found. Near the area where it touches the contralateral element {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw (the symphysis) the bone is straight and only gently arched medially, as is seen in basal sauropods. More derived sauropods (eusauropods) have medially broadly arching symphyseal regione and anterior portions of the tooth row. The ventral (lower) edge of the dentary is damaged, but does not appear to be ventrally deflected at the symphysis as in some basal sauropodomorphs such as Plateosaurus. Also, a longitudinal ridge that is seen in some basal sauropodomorphs (e.g., Massospondylus, Coloradisaurus and Plateosaurus) is not preserved in Leonerasaurus. However, this may be related to the damaged state of the specimen.On the dentary, 13 teeth or tooth fragments were found. There are two empty alveoli, so that the total tooth count on one side was at least 15. Three teeth were found isolated near the dentary. The teeth and alveoli are angled forward (procumbent) by ~60°, similar to eusauropods, but also to juveniles of Mussaurus. <b>Tooth</b> <b>height</b> and width decreases from the front to the back, and neighboring teeth overlapping each other. The edges of the teeth in the front of the jaw likely were not serrated, or at least only at the crown tips. This is usually the case in eusauropods. Teeth further back in the dentary are nearly all damaged, but a not erupted tooth has large denticles similar to basal sauropodomorphs. This pattern of teeth without denticles in front, and teeth with denticles in the back of the lower jaw is also seen in juveniles of Mussaurus and Melanorosaurus. Also, in contrast to eusauropod teeth, there are no high-angle wear facets on the teeth of Leonorasaurus.|$|E

40|$|The role of tooth wear as a {{proximate}} cause of senescence in ruminants {{has recently been}} highlighted.

40|$|Phenotypic plasticity, the {{capacity}} of a single genotype to exhibit variable phenotypes in different environments, is common in many species. A sample of wild caught Archosargus probatocephalus, also known as sheepshead, from Florida was randomly divided into two treatment groups: one group was fed soft prey, Mercenaria sp. muscle tissue, and the other group was fed hard prey, Mercenaria sp. in the shell, for 365 days. It was hypothesized that the sheepshead fed hard prey would have a thicker tooth enamel layer containing more calcium, and therefore be stronger than the tooth enamel layer of those fed soft prey items. Additionally, the mean functional jaw surface area, the percentage of tooth coverage of functional jaw surface, number of teeth per jaw, correlation between standard length and mean total <b>tooth</b> <b>height,</b> and the combined surface area of the teeth, when compared between the two treatments, should be greater in the hard prey treatment. The seventeen jaws of two prey groups were acquired postmortem and each jaw was divided into four quadrants. The largest tooth in each quadrant {{was removed from the}} jaw, longitudinally sectioned, and examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to measure the enamel and dentin layers. Using the SEM backscatter electron detector the elemental composition of the different layers was determined at multiple locations. Finally, data was analyzed using analyses of variance (ANOVA’s) to compare mean <b>tooth</b> <b>height,</b> calcium content in enamel and dentin layers, mean functional jaw number of teeth per jaw, and upper to lower jaw overall enamel and dentin thickness between each treatment. Phenotypic plasticity was identified in three areas: percentage of jaw surface covered by teeth, a positive correlation between total <b>tooth</b> <b>height</b> and enamel height in hard prey treatment, and a positive correlation between total <b>tooth</b> <b>height</b> and soft prey treatment dentin height; but not in the other areas studied.

The investigation included asymptomatic subjects, 56 females and 44 males, aged 19 - 53 years. The volunteers sucked water through a straw up to the maximum tolerated oral volume, which was greater in men (71. 2 +/- A 15. 0 ml) than in women (55. 4 +/- A 13. 4 ml).

40|$|Abstract. A {{special kind}} of the basic {{involute}} profile of non-standard gearing is called high contact ratio (HCR) gearing, where the contact ratio is higher, there are always at least two pairs of teeth in contact and the unit addendum height is not equal to one like for standard gearing. Thus, the <b>tooth</b> <b>height</b> is increased. When HCR gearing is used, {{it is not necessary}} to achieve a greater gear load capacity, but nevertheless there is a greater risk of interference due to the greater <b>tooth</b> <b>height.</b> The advantages of HCR gearing is higher resistance (load is distributed on more pairs of teeth at the same time) and a lower relative noise level of gearing, which can be significantly reduced by using an integer HCR factor. HCR profiles are more complicated than standard involute profiles, they have a greater predisposition for interference, pointed tip thickness and undercut of teeth during production (primary production interference). Due to increased addendum height, there is a larger possibility of some interference or pointed tooth tip occurring. Therefore, these issues need to be prevented in the design phase, and ensured that all relevant equations and constraints are satisfied. The described method of finding optimal gear parameter values uses a Generalized Particle Swarm (GPS) optimization algorithm and MATLAB. The GPS optimization is shown to be a very fast and reliable method...|$|E

500|$|Proboscideans {{experienced}} several evolutionary trends, such as {{an increase}} in size, which led to many giant species that stood up to [...] tall. As with other megaherbivores, including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs, the large size of elephants likely developed {{to allow them to}} survive on vegetation with low nutritional value. Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader. The feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support. Early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's centre of gravity. The skull grew larger, especially the cranium, while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull. The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach. The number of premolars, incisors and canines decreased. The cheek teeth (molars and premolars) became larger and more specialized, especially after elephants started to switch from C3-plants to C4-grasses, which caused their teeth to undergo a three-fold increase in <b>teeth</b> <b>height</b> as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago. Only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of C3 trees and shrubs. The upper second incisors grew into tusks, which varied in shape from straight, to curved (either upward or downward), to spiralled, depending on the species. Some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors. Elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry, such as their middle ear anatomy and the internal testes of the males.|$|R
