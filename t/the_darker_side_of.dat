5|$|Max Beesley as Tom Price. Tom Price {{was serving}} a long prison {{sentence}} at Wandsworth prison when the virus struck. He escapes after killing the sole remaining guard {{and makes his}} way home, {{only to discover that}} his mother had also died during the pandemic. Price's remorselessness and violent streak provide an element of friction within the group, though he is often proven right about <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> human nature. Largely through his relationship with Anya, Tom becomes quite loyal to the group. At the close of the second series (and the programme), Tom has secreted himself aboard a consortium aeroplane bound for parts unknown.|$|E

25|$|In this time, Edmonton was {{established}} as a city, and in 1905 {{was selected as the}} site of the Alberta Provincial Legislature. This coincided with an economic boom that Edmonton enjoyed at the time. <b>The</b> <b>darker</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the boom was that the lack of housing available necessitated a tent city, which may be seen on 1905 Street. Another important event in Edmonton, the opening of the University of Alberta in 1908, is often referenced on this street.|$|E

25|$|The Cure, Jane's Addiction, Radiohead, Joy Division, Muse, PiL and The Smashing Pumpkins are {{considered}} to be the underlying influences of The Abyss' musical style.

Heavily influenced by visual art, the sound of The Abyss has been described to capture the dark emotional underpinnings from life in a way that transforms those emotions into something that can be felt through sound.|$|E

25|$|Hamlet {{struggles to}} turn his desire for revenge into action, and spends {{a large portion of}} the play waiting rather than doing. Scholars have {{proposed}} numerous theories as to why he waits so long to kill Claudius. Some say that Hamlet feels for his victim, fearing to strike because he believes that if he kills Claudius he will be no better than him. The story of Pyrrhus, told by one of the acting troupe, for example, shows Hamlet <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> revenge, something he does not wish for. Hamlet frequently admires those who are swift to act, such as Laertes, who comes to avenge his father's death, but at the same time fears them for their passion, intensity, and lack of logical thought.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, {{she joined}} the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych Theatre, {{and it was there}} that she gave some of her {{greatest}} performances. She was Goneril to Paul Scofield's Lear in Peter Brook's acclaimed King Lear, the first of many collaborations with Brook. She recreated her implacable Goneril in the stark, black-and-white film version of this production. She repeated her Lady Macbeth and appeared again for Brook in Friedrich Dürrenmatt's The Physicists. Playing an asylum superintendent, she showed <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> her acting. She then went to New York in 1965 for the opening of Edward Albee's enigmatic Tiny Alice, in which she co-starred with John Gielgud and which won her the first of her three Tony Awards.|$|E
25|$|Female sexuality, sexual abuse, and {{the battle}} of the sexes in general are {{prominent}} topics in her work. Texts such as Wir sind Lockvögel, Baby! (We are Decoys, Baby!), Die Liebhaberinnen (Women as Lovers) and Die Klavierspielerin (The Piano Teacher) showcase the brutality and power play inherent in human relations in a style that is, at times, ironically formal and tightly controlled. According to Jelinek, power and aggression are often the principal driving forces of relationships. Likewise Ein Sportstück (Sports Play) explores <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> competitive sports. Her provocative novel Lust contains graphic description of sexuality, aggression and abuse. It received poor reviews by many critics, some of whom likened it to pornography. But others, who noted the power of the cold descriptions of moral failures, considered it to have been misunderstood and undervalued by them.|$|E

25|$|His father, John Ernst Steinbeck (1862–1935), {{served as}} Monterey County treasurer. John's mother, Olive Hamilton (1867–1934), a former school teacher, shared Steinbeck's passion for reading and writing. The Steinbecks {{were members of}} the Episcopal Church, {{although}} Steinbeck later became agnostic. Steinbeck lived in a small rural town, no more than a frontier settlement, set in some of the world's most fertile land. He spent his summers working on nearby ranches and later with migrant workers on Spreckels sugar beet farms. There he learned of the harsher aspects of the migrant life and <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> human nature, which supplied him with material expressed in such works as Of Mice and Men. He explored his surroundings, walking across local forests, fields, and farms. While working at Spreckels Sugar Company, he sometimes worked in their laboratory, which gave him time to write. He had considerable mechanical aptitude and fondness for repairing things he owned.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Stephen Barnes, {{there exist}} four major {{ways of looking}} at the origins and functions of the Gulag. The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on <b>the</b> <b>darker</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> human nature - providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favored, among others, by historian Robert Conquest). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalized the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.|$|E
