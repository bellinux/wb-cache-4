Graphic analyses included scattergrams, Circumplex Model representation, and Hill's (1949) Roller Coaster Course of Adjustment Model representation. Findings obtained indicated that both the counseling and non-counseling groups had "moderate" levels of resources as measured by FIRM. Significant differences were found for the subscales of Financial Well-Being (FWB) and Sources of financial Support (SFS) in which the counseling group scored significantly lower than the non-counseling group. Interaction effects of sex X group were also found to be significant for the SFS subscale indicating that both sex and group representation contribute to the difference in scores.

30|$|We {{would like}} to make few {{important}} observations regarding the performance and utility of RECRA. Maintaining network state information at each node (i.e., 1 -hop, 2 -hop, etc.) dominates the accuracy of determining cut-vertices. The fact that RECRA and DARA maintain 1 -hop and 2 -hop information, respectively; therefore, the accuracy of determining cut-vertices in DARA is slightly higher and may cause RECRA to overreact in some cases. However, in dynamic networks, maintaining more network state information at each node consistently requires extra overhead. Since, the prime focus of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>resource</b> efficient recovery; therefore, RECRA strives to avoid such unnecessary overhead and prefers to engage non-critical and/or nodes with partially utilized transmission range. The experimental results presented above have confirmed the superiority of RECRA over contemporary schemes.|$|R

Forty novice and 40 experienced basketballers completed a primary free-throw shooting task and a secondary word semantics task under single-task conditions and three dual-task conditions (positive, negative, and neutral). Shooting performance and word semantics performance for both novice and experienced basketballers improved in the dual-task positive condition relative to the dual-task negative condition. In terms of shooting performance, experienced basketballers performed significantly better in the dual-task positive condition than all other experimental conditions. In addition, the discrepancy in shooting performance between positive and negative conditions was more pronounced for the experienced basketballers than the novices arguably due to greater automaticity and therefore extra attention capacity available to experienced performers to process and complete the secondary task. Consistent with recent skill acquisition research it is concluded that the distraction of the secondary task, {{and in particular the}} direction of attention toward positive emotion, provided benefit by diverting attention away from execution of the primary task. This in turn enhanced sensorimotor skill learning for novice participants, and promoted performance-relevant thoughts and automatic skill execution for experienced basketballers. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective: The study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} the prevalence {{and management of}} infectious diseases, with main focus on malaria, HIV and TB, in a rural hospital in Western Tanzania. Design: Spot prevalence study. Methods: Information gathered from staff and patient notes on ward rounds and subsequent interviews of patients. Results: Of the 102 hospitalised patients {{included in the study}} 37 / 102 (36 %) were diagnosed malaria, 15 / 102 (15 %) with HIV/AIDS and 14 / 102 (14 %) had TB. Out of the TB positive individuals, 50 % had a coexisting HIV infection. HIV was more frequent among the female patients (16 %) than the male patients (13 %) and the peak age group for HIV-infection was 50 - 59 years old. Malaria was most frequent among children aged 0 - 5 years. 52 % of hospitalised patients were treated for malaria without having the diagnosis verified by blood smear. The National first line antimalarial treatment was not used. 94 % of hospitalised patients received medication. 60 % of the patients were prescribed antibiotics, 35 % received antimalarial medication, 8 % followed the national guidelines for TB-treatment with Direct observational treatment (DOT).

The study was developed with data collected from landings in the town of Cananéia, São Paulo state, Brazil, from 1995 to 2009. Production data, fishing effort and CPUE were used to assess the evolution of captures. The gillnets were characterised by interviewing fishermen from 16 communities in Cananéia. White mullet fishery has aroused the interest of fishermen in the region since the 80 s and today it {{is one of the}} main products of artisanal estuarine fishery off the south coast of São Paulo. The major landings occur in the warmer months with fish traps and gillnets being the main fishing gear used. The largest catches occur in the spawning months of the species from October to April. The highest landings varied according to different fishing gear, showing differences primarily due to trade preferences and to the structure of the fishing gear. According to the index of abundance used in <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> the <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> overfished due to the progressive increase in fishing effort, so it is suggested that measures should be taken to control fishing effort, such as special fishing permits to catch white mullet, especially with gillnets.

Discharge and hydrochemical data along a 5 km reach of the Tordera River (NE Spain) provide evidence that groundwater fluxes, associated with a regional hydrogeological system related to the basement fracture network, contribute to alluvial recharge and to stream flow. End-member mixing analysis considering upstream discharge, groundwater flows, and human inputs to the stream as major flow sources shows that regional basement groundwater fluxes are responsible for as much as 20 % of the total discharge, which also explains unexpected rises in stream flow.

Fifty-two were found to have severe, rapid-onset disease. The 30 -day survival was determined and correlated with birth weight, gestational age, laboratory and radiological findings, and extent of disease. Seven patients did not respond to resuscitative measures and were treated by percutaneous drainage with a uniformly fatal outcome. For patients who could be made fit for surgery, the only absolute predictor of survival was extent of disease. Pannecrosis occurred in 19 patients and all of these died. Conversely, patients who had resectable disease had a 30 -day survival of 61 %. Pan-necrosis could not be determined preoperatively by radiological findings. Patients with severe, rapid-onset NEC and evidence of gangrene who respond to resuscitation should have active surgical management, as approximately one-half of them have resectable disease and a reasonable short-term outcome may be expected.

These sensitivities notwithstanding, the number and scale of such events necessitate a greater understanding of alcohol and drug use and the potential to promote normative protective behaviours in <b>this</b> context. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> examines self-reported alcohol and drug behaviours of 1589 attendees at a music festival in Scotland during the summer of 2008. Similarities between the outdoor rock music festivals and the dance club scene are considered alongside the challenges associated with risk reduction in these settings.

Similarly, the majority of samples did not use drugs. The majority also report a number of self-regulating protective behaviours suggesting that alcohol and drug use is contained within a developing social culture of ‘controlled intoxication’. Results further suggest that although music festivals are transitory events, there is a degree of consistency amongst attendees. Music festivals may therefore be atypical but potentially effective environments to increase protective behaviours using normative messaging and modern communications media. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>resourced</b> exclusively by local alcohol and drug partnerships. ...|$|R

Currently it is being harvested commercially on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand. It is largely to supply Japanese horticultural companies. Resource extraction has increased rapidly in recent years and much basic information regarding the resource, the industry and the implications of use has been entirely lacking previous to <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> <b>Resource</b> characteristics <b>are</b> described in terms of sphagnum ecology. Sphagnum is adapted to life in wet, nutrient poor, peat producing ecosystems. Five species of sphagnum are recorded from the West Coast; the harvested species, S. cristatum, is most common. Sphagnum mires do not provide habitat for many species of plant or animal but some rare and uncommon species are present. The history of sphagnum use is outlined and current use and the West Coast industry described. The industry has increased in size rapidly since late 1979; numerous individuals and several large companies are currently involved. High net revenues are available to companies and individuals in the industry which is small with few people employed full time; it is restricted in size by market constraints. Sustainable yield harvesting is achievable; yields may be increased through intensive management or cultivation. Much of the sphagnum <b>resource</b> <b>is</b> on state owned land and is managed by the Department of Lands and Surveyor New Zealand Forest Service. Various management procedures are used, some of which have not been satisfactory. Sphagnum harvesting is compared as a land use with farming and forestry on similar land. From a national economics stance it has higher net benefits per hectare than the other options. The sphagnum industry is sustainable in its present form although the market is sensitive to product quality. Sphagnum harvesting affects adversely the mire ecosystem, displacing some components and reducing the overall environmental quality; these impacts are less than those of the other land use options. It is more labour intensive than sheep and beef cattle farming; numbers employed per hectare are similar to dairy cattle farming and forestry after forest maturity. Sphagnum harvesting has potential as a long term land use and is appropriate for land supporting substantial amounts of sphagnum. Management options are discussed with reference to various objectives. It is recommended that policies enabling sphagnum harvesters to have exclusive rights over areas for extended periods be designed and that reserves are established to preserve sphagnum mires and the various component species...|$|R

In <b>this</b> <b>study,</b> <b>resource</b> selection modeling <b>was</b> used to identify factors influ-encing elk presence on cattle pasture and elk selection of foraging patches; furthermore,consequences for inter-species disease transmission were discussed. Data on pasture management practices and observations of elk were collected from 15 ranchers during interviews. Pasture use by elk was defined based on telemetry data (fromGPS collars deployed on 168 elk in 7 herds) and rancher observations. At the patch scale,foraging patches used by elk were identified by spatio-temporal cluster analysis of teleme-try data, whereas available patches were randomly generated outside the area delimitedby used patches. For pastures and patches, landscape and human-managed features werecharacterized using remote sensing data and interviews, respectively. Attributes of avail-able and used pastures (or patches) <b>were</b> compared using <b>resource</b> selection functions, onannual and seasonal (or annual and monthly) time scales.

The effects of landscape (elevation, aspect, wateraccess) and vegetation (forest cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) characteris-tics on patch selection were consistent with typical elk habitat requirements. The presenceof cattle and the traffic-weighted road density were negatively associated with patch selec-tion. The apparent avoidance of cattle by elk reduced the risk of direct transmission ofpathogens, except during winter months.

Relationships between resources and the variables of the Stress – Appraisal model were tested using regression analysis. Results revealed that overall resources made small but significant contributions to appraisal, well-being, stress and all three outcomes; job satisfaction, affective commitment and intentions to stay, but not to coping and affect. The only resource to make an impact on emotion-focused coping was decision latitude.

At the Sanger Institute a minimum information standard was reported for the manual design of primers and included in a decision making tree developed for Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCRs). This tree also illustrates problems that can be encountered when designing primers along with procedures that can be taken to address such issues.

40|$|Law {{schools are}} criticized for graduating {{students}} who lack {{the skills necessary}} to practice law. Legal research is a foundational ability necessary to support lawyering competency. The American Bar Association (ABA) establishes standards for legal education that include a requirement that each law student receive substantial instruction in legal skills, including legal research. Despite the recognized importance of legal research in legal education, there is no consensus of what to teach as part of a legal research course or even how to teach such a course. Legal educators struggle to address these issues. The practicing bar and judiciary have expressed concerns about law school graduates ability to conduct legal research. Studies have been conducted detailing the poor research ability of law students and their lack of skills. Although deficiencies in law student research skills have been identified, there is no agreement as to how to remediate these deficiencies. This dissertation suggests the legal research <b>resources</b> that should <b>be</b> taught in law schools by identifying the research resources used by practicing attorneys and comparing them to those resources currently included in legal research instruction at the 202 ABA-accredited law schools. Multiple data sources were used in <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> Practitioner <b>resource</b> information <b>was</b> based on data provided by practicing attorneys responding to the 2013 ABA Legal Technology Survey. Resources taught in ABA-accredited law schools were identified through three sources: a 2014 law school legal research survey sent to the 202 ABA-accredited law schools, a review of law school syllabi from ABA-accredited law school legal research and legal research and writing courses, and the Association of Legal Writing Directors 2013 annual survey of legal research and writing faculty. The combined data from these three sources were compared to the resources used by practicing lawyers identified in the annual national 2013 ABA Legal Technology Survey. This comparison of what is taught with what is used in practice identifies a deficiency in law school instruction in the research resources used by practicing attorneys. These survey results detail distinct areas of inadequate instruction in legal research resources and provide legal educators with detailed information necessary to develop a curriculum that will result in graduating students with practice-ready competencies...|$|R

40|$|This Outlook for the Development of European Forest Resources {{provides}} the methodologies, data, scenarios, and {{results of the}} outlook on the European forest resources from 2000 to 2040. The aim of <b>this</b> forest <b>resource</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to analyse the impacts on the European forest resources under the level of fellings needed to fulfil the derived roundwood demand according to two scenarios as provided by the market modelling project within the EFSOS framework. Thus fellings and removals presented in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> cannot be identified with a wood supply forecast in economic terms. The study includes the forest available for wood supply (FAWS) in geographical Europe, i. e. from Ireland to the Ural mountains and from {{the northern tip of}} Lapland to the southern border of Turkey. The model outcomes are based on assumptions about the increase in FAWS as well as unchanged forest management regimes (e. g. rotation period, thinning intensity, afforestation), and growth of stands ratios between felling and removals over the analysed period. Although removals are assumed to rise significantly, the results as presented sketch large and increasing forest resources in Europe. The growing stock increases under the baseline scenario from 51 billion m 3 o. b. to 63 billion m 3 o. b. in 2040, whereas the net annual increment declines only slightly from the current 1. 2 billion m 3 o. b o. b to 1. 15 billion m 3 o. b. in 2040. The FAWS area is assumed to decrease from 335 million ha to 329 million ha by the year 2040, in the base scenario. In the alternative scenario the forest area is expected to increase to 343 million ha. The market model outcomes projected a fast increase in required fellings in the current outlook <b>study.</b> <b>This</b> demand for fellings on FAWS is foreseen to increase from 643 million m 3 o. b. per year in 2000 to 847 million m 3 o. b. per year in 2020 in the baseline scenario (1014 million m 3 o. b. per year in the alternative). This, together with an approach that dynamically simulates age class development, shows that annual availability of roundwood may be hampered after 2020. In the baseline scenario the actual fellings in 2036 - 2040 were about 2 % lower than the required fellings, whereas in the alternative scenario the difference was about 11 % per year. In reality market mechanisms will take care of this difference, by adjusting prices, forestry management and especially trade, considering the legal restriction, which assure sustainable forestry management. These adjustments cannot be simulated with the current modelling system...|$|R
