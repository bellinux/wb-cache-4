50|$|The second {{generation}} of the Soyuz spacecraft, the Soyuz Ferry or Soyuz 7K-T, comprised Soyuz 12 through Soyuz 40 (1973-1981). In {{the wake of the}} Soyuz 11 tragedy, the spacecraft was redesigned to accommodate two cosmonauts who would wear pressure suits at all times during launch, docking, undocking, and reentry. The place of the third cosmonaut was taken by extra life-support systems. Finally, the 7K-T, being intended purely as a space station ferry, had no solar panels, instead sporting two large whip antennas in their place. As a result, it relied on batteries which only provided enough power for two days of standalone flight. The idea was that the Soyuz would recharge while docked with a Salyut space station, but {{in the event of a}} docking or other mission failure (which ended up happening on several occasions), the crew was forced <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>off</b> everything except communications and life support systems until they could reenter.|$|E

Mainly for cost reasons {{but also to}} appease environmental concerns, data center operators are interested to reduce their use of energy. This thesis investigates if and how hardware virtualization helps to improve the energy efficiency of modern cloud data centers. Our main motivation is <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>off</b> unused servers to save energy. The work encompasses three major parts: First, a simulation-driven analysis to quantify the benefits of known reservation times in infrastructure clouds. Virtual machines with similar expiration times are co-located to increase the probability to power down unused physical hosts. Second, we propose and prototyped a system to deliver truly on-demand cloud services. Idle virtual machines are suspended to free resources and {{as a first step}} <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>off</b> the physical server. Third, a novel block-level data synchronization tool enables fast and efficient state replication. Frequent state synchronization is necessary to prevent data unavailability: powering down a server disables access to the locally attached disks and any data stored on them. The techniques effectively reduce the overall number of required servers either through optimized scheduling or by suspending idle virtual machines. Fewer live servers translate into proportional energy savings, as the unused servers must no longer be powered...|$|E
30|$|Most {{existing}} proposals apply device-level {{power conservation}} strategy, which intends {{to switch off}} the entire device (router/switch) including fixed overheads (like fans, linecards, transceivers, etc.) only when all ports on the device are idle. This means even if only one port has data to transfer, the device (including idle ports) should be kept alive all the time. Comparatively, in our energy-aware heuristic schemes we apply the component-level strategy, which intends to power down the unused ports, and switch off the linecard if all the ports on this linecard are idle or disabled. If all linecards on a device are idle then <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>off</b> the entire device. Clearly, the component-level strategy achieves the most power savings.|$|E

While similar to the more traditional access point model, it is extended to operate across multiple hops. This is particularly useful for conference, airport, or large corporate deployments.

A novel network-level strategy {{based on a}} modification of current link-state routing protocols, such as OSPF, is proposed; according to this strategy, IP routers are able <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>off</b> some network links during low traffic periods. The proposed solution is a three-phases algorithm: {{in the first phase}} some routers are elected as exporter of their own Shortest Path Trees (SPTs); in the second one the neighbors of these routers perform a modified Dijkstra algorithm to detect links to power off; in the last one new network paths on a modified network topology are computed. Performance study shows that, in an actual IP network, even more than the 60 % of links can be switched off. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—After the big Internet growing of {{the past}} decade, in the current decade a {{considerable}} effort is spent to reduce the Internet energy consumption. Actual Internet topologies have space <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>off</b> some links and devices {{in order to reduce}} energy consumed in off-peak periods still guaranteeing connectivity among terminals. In this paper we propose a methodology to identify less used links in the network in order to have the capability to switch off these network interfaces for energy saving purposes. We describe four different algorithms able to identify this set of links and we show the tradeoff between complexity, and the consequent execution time, and efficiency in powering off a great number of links. We find that, by using our solutions, it is possible to switch off a big percentage of links still keeping the network load under suitable thresholds and still guaranteeing topological characteristics of the resulting network topology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Data center {{networks}} (DCNs) {{have been}} growing in size and their power consumption is becoming a matter of concern. Many recent papers, including ElasticTree and CARPO, propose new near-energy-proportional DCNs, aiming at reducing the power consumption by dynamically powering off idle network switches and links. In this pa-per, we examine the power optimization model for DCNs, and present a scalable heuristic algorithm that finds a near-optimal subset of net-work switches and links that satisfies a given traffic load and consumes minimal power. Furthermore, we apply merge networks to each switch in order <b>to</b> <b>power</b> <b>off</b> the idle interfaces of the active switches, thus further reducing the energy consumption of active switches and achieving greater energy savings than ElasticTree. We finish by simulating large-scale fat-tree DCNs and comparing the energy cost of our techniques versus the ElasticTree method. The results demonstrate that our solution is more energy-efficient...|$|E

In this work we leverage the algebraic connectivity of the graph modeling an ISP network in order to define the ESACON (Energy Saving based on Algebraic CONnectivity) algorithm. We then consider the network connectivity as a first target performance to be assured. To this aim we identify a metric based on the algebraic connectivity that, on one side, allows to switch off several links with the consequent significant energy saving and, on the other side, still preserves network connectivity and network performance for efficiently supporting the Internet traffic. We find that ESACON achieves better performance with respect to similar topology-aware approaches; moreover ESACON performance are comparable with ones of a complex traffic-aware solution. © 2011 IEEE...|$|E
