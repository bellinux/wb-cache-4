5|$|Henry {{maintained}} {{peace with}} Scotland during his reign, {{where he was}} the feudal lord of Alexander II. Henry assumed that he had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought up the issue of his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments, but he lacked the inclination or the resources <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more.</b> Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat. Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the Treaty of York in 1237, Henry had a secure northern frontier. Henry knighted Alexander III before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship. Henry had Alexander and Margaret rescued from Edinburgh Castle when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage Alexander's government during the rest of his minority years.|$|E

The Portland was able to free the ships and tow them to moorings before the strain broke the bridge. The Columbia River Pilots Association saw this incident as justification for having insisted that the Portland be a steam-powered sternwheeler.|$|E
25|$|Nationalists deplore {{the fact}} that so many people are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates of the society of states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of us <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than most now do.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Nomura {{was also}} {{responsible}} for the main character designs and orchestration of The World Ends with You for the Nintendo DS. In 2009, {{he was also the}} main character designer of Final Fantasy XIII. The graphics capabilities of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> work for each character or area than in previous games. Nomura did not take an involved role {{in the creation of the}} non-playable characters. In 2008, he was the character designer of Dissidia Final Fantasy. The game was originally envisioned by Nomura as a Kingdom Hearts spin-off featuring a cast of Disney characters. He later felt uncomfortable with the Disney characters fighting each other and instead opted to use Final Fantasy characters. Nomura was responsible for the character designs, which changed much of the look and style of Amano's illustrations.|$|E

500|$|Although the FVdG {{insisted that}} the [...] "goal is {{everything}} and ... must be everything" [...] (a play on Bernstein's formula that [...] "the final goal, whatever it may be, is nothing to me: the movement is everything"), it was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than keep its own structures alive during World War I. Immediately after the declaration of war, FVdG tried to continue its antiwar demonstrations to no avail. Although it constantly criticized the Burgfrieden and militarism in general, industrial action was not possible {{except for a few}} minor cases (most notably resistance by the carpenters' union to Sunday work). The FVdG also received support from abroad. The faction in the Italian USI led by Armando Borghi, an antimilitarist minority in the French CGT, the Dutch NAS, as well as Spanish, Swedish, and Danish syndicalists were all united with the FVdG in their opposition to the war.|$|E
500|$|Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a {{new type}} of female {{character}} with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series. His guideline to Nomura was to make her [...] "strong and beautiful", and she was intended to be reminiscent of Final Fantasy VIIs Cloud Strife. Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development. The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> work for each character or area than in previous games.

Reid also {{revealed that}} at least four major plots had been thwarted in the previous year and security sources confirmed that two dozen major terrorist conspiracies were under investigation. Reid issued a dire warning against losing the [...] "battle of ideas" [...] with al-Qa'eda, and called for an urgent but controversial escalation in the propaganda war, saying that the government needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> to win the battle of ideas.|$|E

Michael Saunders of The Boston Globe opined [...] "Soto never seems <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> other than look exotic in the role," [...] which Ben Steelman of Star-News described as [...] "basically Princess Leia in black leotards," [...] albeit Destructoid's Sterling included Kitana among the first film's [...] "more sensible makeovers" [...] comparing them to how X-Men comics characters were redesigned for the film adaptations. Malcolm Johnson of the Hartford Courant described Kitana in Annihilation as wearing [...] "a knockout black leather costume [...] gives her the look of the world's sweetest dominatrix."

2500|$|Philosopher RenÃ© Descartes {{expanded}} {{upon this}} idea and is most widely known by {{his work on}} the mind-body problem. Often, Descartes' ideas were looked upon as overly philosophical and lacking in sufficient scientific background. [...] Descartes focused much of his anatomical experimentation on the brain, paying specific attention to the pineal gland â which he argued was the actual [...] "seat of the soul". Still deeply rooted in a spiritual outlook towards the scientific world, the body was said to be mortal, and the soul immortal. The pineal gland was then thought to be the very place at which the mind would interact with the mortal and machine-like body. At the time, Descartes was convinced the mind had control over the behaviors of the body (controlling the man) â but also that the body could have influence over the mind, which is referred to as dualism. This idea that the mind essentially had control over the body, but man's body could resist or even influence other behaviors was a major turning point in the way many physiologists would look at the brain. The capabilities of the mind were observed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than simply react, but also to be rational and function in organized, thoughtful ways â much more complex than he thought the animal world to be. These ideas, although disregarded by many and cast aside for years led the medical community to expand their own ideas of the brain and begin to understand in new ways just how intricate the workings of the brain really were, and the complete effects it had on daily life, as well, which treatments would be the most beneficial to helping those people living with a dysfunctional mind. The mind-body problem, spurred by RenÃ© Descartes, continues to this day with many philosophical arguments both for and against his ideas. However controversial they were and remain today, the fresh and well-thought-out perspective Descartes presented has had long-lasting effects on the various disciplines of medicine, psychology and much more, especially in putting an emphasis on separating the mind from the body in order to explain observable behaviors.|$|E
