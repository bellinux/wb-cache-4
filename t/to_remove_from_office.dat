50|$|The {{election}} did {{not possess}} the sweeping change that Gargan had hoped. Only 17 incumbents were thrown out.

5000|$|As to Colonel Chivington, your {{committee}} {{can hardly}} find fitting terms {{to describe his}} conduct. Wearing the uniform of the United States, which should be the emblem of justice and humanity; holding the important position of commander of a military district, and therefore having {{the honor of the}} government to that extent in his keeping, he deliberately planned and executed a foul and dastardly massacre which would have disgraced the veriest savage among those who were the victims of his cruelty. Having full knowledge of their friendly character, having himself been instrumental to some extent in placing them in their position of fancied security, he took advantage of their in-apprehension and defenceless condition to gratify the worst passions that ever cursed the heart of man.Whatever influence this may have had upon Colonel Chivington, the truth is that he surprised and murdered, in cold blood, the unsuspecting men, women, and children on Sand creek, who had every reason to believe they were under the protection of the United States authorities, and then returned to Denver and boasted of the brave deed he and the men under his command had performed.In conclusion, your committee are of the opinion that for the purpose of vindicating the cause of justice and upholding the honor of the nation, prompt and energetic measures should be at once taken <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> those who have thus disgraced the government by whom they are employed, and to punish, as their crimes deserve, those who have been guilty of these brutal and cowardly acts.|$|E

40|$|Citizens have a {{right to}} be governed by {{officials}} with an acute awareness of the conflicts between the constitutional values of liberal democracy. Such an awareness is an integral part of a public official's integrity. That is why citizens should have a say in deciding whether <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> an official with such integrity. In this article, this type of conflict between constitutional values is translated into the terms of an individual official's decision making with the help of moral theory. This yields two paradoxes: one focusing on the decision maker and the other on the object of his or her decisions: the citizen. These paradoxes lead to the following questions: If running a liberal democratic constitution essentially involves moral complexity, should we not try to have it run by officials with a sensitivity to that complexity? And if officials with that sensitivity are bound to commit moral wrongs because of complexity, do not we owe them something like political forgiveness? The paradoxes are used to formulate conditions for political forgiveness...|$|E
40|$|This Comment {{focuses on}} the {{conflict}} between the will of the electorate and the smooth functioning of government. The Comment suggests reforms that will ease the tension between the desires of the people and the need for an effective, efficient government. The first section reviews the history of the recall. While recall certainly has not paved the way to a democratic utopia as its most ardent supporters once suggested, it has served, on some level, to create a body of elected officials who are more responsive to the concerns of the public at large. The second section analyzes state recall statutes. In so doing, this paper explores whether recall has gone beyond its effective role of permitting the electorate <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> self-serving and unfaithful public servants. Furthermore, it assesses the threat that unrestrained recall will bring effective government to a virtual standstill. The third section analyzes the recall reform bills considered by the Nebraska Legislature. The final section of the paper includes suggestions for recall reform, including a model recall statute. These proposals attempt to reinforce recall as a potent political device while limiting its susceptibility to abuse...|$|E
40|$|Presidential-plurality and parliamentary-plurality democracies are sharply {{distinguished}} {{by the fact}} that the executive in Presidential systems is elected for a fixed term and is relatively difficult <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>office</b> while the executive in parliamentary democracies is not elected for fixed terms and can be dismissed if he or she loses a relatively easily implemented vote of confidence. Consequently, executives in parliamentary systems might have greater incentive to manage continuously their level of popular support, or political approval, than their Presidential counterparts. Fiscal policy is one important tool governments use to manage political approval. Hence, fiscal policy in parliamentary systems might differ systematically from fiscal policy in Presidential systems, and this might generate systematic differences in the two systems' business cycles. This paper investigates this possibility by developing a dynamic general equilibrium model of political approval management and then using it as the foundation for a comparative empirical analysis of the way approval management affects the cyclical behaviors of the United States' (Presidential) and United Kingdom's (parliamentary) macroeconomic aggregates. Our empirical findings suggest that governments in each democracy respond to falling political approval by pursuing fiscal policies that provide incentives for contemporaneous consumption expenditures. We quantify the way that the specific policies differ between the two democracies, and show that such policies are not in an electorate's economic interest. Relative to a baseline of optimal fiscal policy, we estimate that politically motivated fiscal policy reduces aggregate output in the United Kingdom and United States by 0. 35 % and 0. 20 %, respectively...|$|E
