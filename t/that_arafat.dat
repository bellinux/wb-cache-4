5|$|In September 2005, an Israeli-declared AIDS expert claimed <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> bore all the {{symptoms}} of AIDS based on obtained medical records. But others, including Patrice Mangin of the University of Lausanne and The New York Times disagreed with this claim, insisting that Arafat's record indicated that it was highly unlikely {{that the cause of}} his death was AIDS. Arafat's personal doctor Ashraf al-Kurdi and aide Bassam Abu Sharif maintained <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> was poisoned, possibly by thallium. A senior Israeli physician concluded <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> died from food poisoning. Both those claims were rejected by Haaretz and The New York Times. Then-Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath had also ruled out poisoning after talks with Arafat's French doctors.|$|E
5|$|Fuad Shubaki, former {{financial}} aide to Arafat, {{told the}} Israeli security service Shin Bet <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> used {{several million dollars}} of aid money to buy weapons and support militant groups. During Israel's Operation Defensive Shield, the Israel army recovered counterfeit money and documents from Arafat's Ramallah headquarters. The documents showed that, in 2001, Arafat personally approved payments to Tanzim militants. The Palestinians claimed that the counterfeit money was confiscated from criminal elements.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{some circles}} within the US State Department viewed Arafat as an able diplomat and {{negotiator}} {{who could get}} support from many Arab governments at once. An example of that, we find in March 1973 <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> tried to arrange for a meeting between the President of Iraq and the Emir of Kuwait in order to resolve their disputes.|$|E
50|$|After Arafat's death, the French Ministry of Defence said <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> {{medical file}} would be {{transmitted}} to only his next of kin. It was determined <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> nephew and PNA {{envoy to the}} UN, Nasser al-Qudwa, was a close enough relative, thus working around Suha Arafat's silence on her husband's illness. Nasser al-Qudwa was given a copy of Arafat's 558-page medical file by the French Ministry of Defence.|$|R
50|$|Al-Kurdi also lamented <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> widow Suha {{had refused}} an autopsy, {{which he said}} would have {{answered}} many questions regarding cause of death.|$|R
50|$|Medical records {{released}} in 2005 showed <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> doctors {{could not agree}} on the cause of death, stating that he died from a stroke that stemmed from an unknown condition. Analysis based on those records suggested him dying from poisoning, AIDS, or an infection. In 2012, newly released medical records revealed that French doctors initially diagnosed Arafat with gastroenteritis.|$|R
5|$|In August 2002, the Israeli Military Intelligence Chief {{alleged that}} Arafat's {{personal}} wealth {{was in the}} range of US$1.3 billion. In 2003 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conducted an audit of the PNA and stated <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> diverted $900 million in public funds to a special bank account controlled by Arafat and the PNA Chief Economic Financial adviser. However, the IMF did not claim that there were any improprieties, and it specifically stated that most of the funds had been used to invest in Palestinian assets, both internally and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{military}} {{officials said the}} Palestinians intended to build a mosque on {{the ruins of the}} site. The statement came after workers repairing the tomb painted the site's dome green, the colour of Islam. A Palestinian Authority spokesman denied the allegations and said <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> had ordered the renovations and for the synagogue to be rebuilt. Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor, claimed that city officials simply wanted to return the building to the way it looked before it came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war. Under intense U.S. and international pressure the dome was repainted white.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2012, Al Jazeera {{published}} {{the results of}} a nine-month investigation, which revealed that none of the causes of Arafat’s death suggested in several rumors could be true. Tests carried out by a Swiss scientific experts found traces of polonium in quantities much higher than could occur naturally on Arafat's personal belongings. On 12 October 2013, the British medical journal The Lancet published a peer-reviewed article by the Swiss experts about the analysis of the 38 samples of Arafat's clothes and belongings and 37 reference samples which were known to be polonium-free, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> could have died of polonium poisoning.|$|E
50|$|On 31 July 2012, Suha Arafat and her {{daughter}} Zawra lodged a murder complaint in the Paris western suburb of Nanterre. On 28 August, French prosecutors opened a murder inquiry. In March 2015, a French prosecutor announced <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> death was from natural causes, {{and found that the}} polonium 210 and lead 210 discovered in Arafat's grave were of an environmental nature.|$|R
5000|$|The French tests {{found some}} {{polonium}} but stated {{it was from}} [...] "natural environmental origin". Later the Russian tests released in December 2013 found <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> death was not caused by radiation. Vladimir Uiba, {{the head of the}} Russian Federal Medical and Biological Agency, stated that Yasser had died of natural causes and they had no plans to conduct further tests.|$|R
50|$|The next day, chief surgeon Christian Estripeau of Percy {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> condition had worsened, {{and that}} he had fallen into a deeper coma. Sheikh Taissir Tamimi, the head of the Islamic court of the Palestinian territories, who held a vigil at Arafat's bedside, visited <b>Arafat,</b> and declared <b>that</b> it {{was out of the question}} to disconnect him from life support, since, according to him, such an action is prohibited in Islam.|$|R
5|$|Said {{disliked the}} Oslo Accords for not {{producing}} an independent State of Palestine, {{and because they}} were politically inferior to a plan that Yasir Arafat had rejected—a plan Said had presented to Arafat {{on behalf of the}} U.S. government in the late 1970s. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel, and <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 2013, {{a team of}} Russian {{scientists}} {{released a}} report saying they had found no trace of radioactive poisoning—a finding that comes after the French report found traces of the radioactive isotope polonium. Vladimir Uiba, {{the head of the}} Federal Medical and Biological Agency, said <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> died of natural causes (without explaining which) and the agency had no plans to conduct further tests. Unlike the Swiss report, the French and Russian reports were not made public, at the time. The Swiss experts read the French and Russian reports and explained that the radiologic data measured by the other teams support their conclusions of a probable death by polonium poisoning. In March 2015 a French prosecutor announced that his death was of natural causes, and the polonium and lead traces found were environmental.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians {{have claimed}} that Sharon's visit was the {{beginning}} of the Second Intifada, while others have claimed <b>that</b> Yasser <b>Arafat</b> had pre-planned the uprising.|$|R
5000|$|... {{this film}} {{demonstrates}} <b>that</b> Yasser <b>Arafat's</b> true intentions {{were not a}} two-state solution, but a Palestinian state on the territory of all of Israel.|$|R
50|$|New {{medical records}} that were {{released}} in July 2012 showed <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> condition was initially diagnosed as viral gastroenteritis by his Arab doctors who {{took care of}} him in the West Bank in the Mukataa before he was airlifted to France, although his condition later improved and he even joined in the fast of Ramadan. However, there was persistent vomiting and diarrhea, Arafat began feeling weaker, and his blood platelet count dropped. On 28 October, his medical team decided to send him abroad, and he was flown to France the next morning.|$|R
5|$|Arafat's {{first visit}} to Jerusalem came when his father, unable to raise seven {{children}} alone, sent him and his brother Fathi to their mother's family in the Moroccan Quarter of the Old City. They lived there with their uncle Salim Abul Saud for four years. In 1937, their father recalled them {{to be taken care}} of by their older sister, Inam. Arafat had a deteriorating relationship with his father; when he died in 1952, Arafat did not attend the funeral, nor did he visit his father's grave upon his return to Gaza. Arafat's sister Inam stated in an interview with Arafat's biographer, British historian Alan Hart, <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> was heavily beaten by his father for going to the Jewish quarter in Cairo and attending religious services. When she asked Arafat why he would not stop going, he responded by saying that he wanted to study Jewish mentality.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to persistent PLO raids against Israeli civilian targets, Israel attacked {{the town of}} Karameh, Jordan, {{the site of a}} major PLO camp. The goal of the invasion was to destroy Karameh camp and capture Yasser Arafat in reprisal for the attacks by the PLO against Israeli civilians, which culminated in an Israeli school bus hitting a mine in the Negev, killing two children. However, plans for the two operations were prepared in 1967, one year before the bus attack. When Jordan saw the size of the raiding forces entering the battle it was led to the assumption that Israel had another goal of capturing Balqa Governorate to create a Golan Heights similar situation. Israel assumed that the Jordanian Army would ignore the invasion, but the latter fought alongside the Palestinians and opened heavy fire that inflicted losses upon the Israeli forces. This engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian forces. The Israelis were repelled {{at the end of a}} day's battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 141 PLO prisoners. Both sides declared victory. On a tactical level, the battle went in Israel's favor and the destruction of the Karameh camp was achieved. However, the relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the Israel Defense Forces and was stunning to the Israelis. Although the Palestinians were not victorious on their own, King Hussein let the Palestinians take credit. Some have alleged <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> himself was on the battlefield, but the details of his involvement are unclear. However, his allies–as well as Israeli intelligence–confirm that he urged his men throughout the battle to hold their ground and continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|In November 2004, Day {{provoked}} controversy by not offering {{condolences to}} Palestinians {{after the death}} of PLO leader Yasser Arafat. The controversy was heightened when it was leaked to the media that Day had attempted to justify his actions to his party colleagues by circulating an article by David Frum which suggested <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> had died of AIDS.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, al-Zahar {{revealed}} to the press <b>that</b> Yasser <b>Arafat</b> had instructed Hamas to launch militant attacks—including suicide bombings—against Israel in 2000, due to peace talks not going anywhere.|$|R
50|$|The {{bombing of}} Beirut on 17 June lasted between 20-30 minutes, and was mostly {{centered}} on predominantly Muslim districts, such as Rue Baghdadi in the Fakehani district {{west of the}} city. Israeli warplanes demolished a seven-story apartment building and four to five others were badly damaged. Israel said that the operation targeted the headquarters of Yasser Arafat and of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), claiming that the Israeli military had managed to destroy the offices {{of some of the}} guerrilla groups that form the PLO, including one Fatah and two DFLP offices. The PLO stated <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> headquarters were unharmed and that only one DFLP office sustained some damage.|$|R
25|$|Following an Israeli {{intelligence}} report stating <b>that</b> Yasir <b>Arafat</b> had paid $20,000 to al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, the United States demanded democratic {{reforms in the}} Palestinian Authority, as well {{the appointment of a}} prime minister independent of Arafat. On 13 March 2003, following U.S. pressure, Arafat appointed Mahmoud Abbas as Palestinian prime minister.|$|R
25|$|In late 2002, Egged {{sued the}} Palestinian National Authority and its {{chairman}} Yasser Arafat for compensation of damages {{and loss of}} income due to terrorist attacks and suicide bombings on buses during the Second Intifada, claiming that the attacks had deterred passengers from taking buses. On February 3, 2003, the Tel Aviv District Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> has to pay Egged NIS 52 million in damages {{for the loss of}} one year's income and NIS 100,000 in court expenses.|$|E
25|$|On April 23, {{negotiations}} {{to end the}} siege began in the Peace Center. The negotiations were mediated by the Archbishop of Canterbury's representative in Bethlehem, Canon Andrew White. The Israeli negotiator was IDF Colonel Lior Lotan, a lawyer by profession. At first, Yasser Arafat appointed Salah Tamari to head the negotiation team. Tamari rejected Israel's demands to hand over {{a list of the}} besieged militants, but then found out <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> had given Daoud a contradicting order. Arafat also appointed another negotiation team, headed by Mohammad Rashid.|$|E
25|$|Although the PSP/PLA and LCP/Popular Guard {{joined forces}} with Amal in {{defeating}} the Al-Mourabitoun, they remained militarily neutral {{in the fight against}} the PLO. Despite prodding from Syria, these political parties and their respective militias contributed nothing more than verbally expressing support for Amal and demanding <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> step down. The PSP/PLA even allowed the PLO to station their artillery on Druze-controlled areas. This left Amal to do the work of dislodging the Arafat loyalists, with some help from Syria's anti-Arafat Palestinian allies, such as As-Sa'iqa, PFLP-GC and Fatah al-Intifada. The alliance between Amal and most of the pro-Syrian Palestinian groups eventually soured however, and clashes would later break out between them. While some dissident Palestinian commanders such as Ahmed Jibril and Abu Musa still supported Amal against the PLO, many anti-Arafat fighters battled Amal in defense of the camps.|$|E
50|$|In Ramallah {{dozens of}} Palestinians {{celebrated in the}} streets and fired in the air as a sign of celebration. The bomber, Saeed Hotari, was praised as a martyr by his father. President George W. Bush demanded <b>that</b> Yasser <b>Arafat</b> condemn the {{terrorist}} act. The next day, Israeli-Arabs barricaded themselves in the Hassan Bek Mosque opposite the Dolphinarium site and threw objects at the police.|$|R
6000|$|... [p.194] Close to {{the plain}} {{we saw the}} place where the Egyptian and Damascus Mahmils stand during the sermon; and, {{descending}} the wall <b>that</b> surrounds <b>Arafat</b> by a steep and narrow flight of coarse stone steps, we found on our right the fountain which supplies the place with water. It bubbles from the rock, and is exceedingly pure, as such water generally is in Al-Hijaz.|$|R
5000|$|Later, a French {{investigation}} by three judges unanimously concluded that [...] "it {{has not been}} demonstrated <b>that</b> Mr Yasser <b>Arafat</b> was murdered by polonium-210 poisoning" [...] and that the investigation should be dropped.|$|R
25|$|The Israeli negotiators {{proposed}} that Israel {{be allowed to}} set up radar stations inside the Palestinian state, and be allowed to use its airspace. Israel also wanted the right to deploy troops on Palestinian territory {{in the event of}} an emergency, and the stationing of an international force in the Jordan Valley. Palestinian authorities would maintain control of border crossings under temporary Israeli observation. Israel would maintain a permanent security presence along 15% of the Palestinian-Jordanian border. Israel also demanded that the Palestinian state be demilitarized with the exception of its paramilitary security forces, that it would not make alliances without Israeli approval or allow the introduction of foreign forces west of the Jordan River, and that it dismantle terrorist groups. One of Israel's strongest demands was <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> declare the conflict over, and make no further demands. Israel also wanted water resources in the West Bank to be shared by both sides and remain under Israeli management.|$|E
500|$|Israel and the US have alleged also <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> was {{involved}} in the 1973 Khartoum diplomatic assassinations, in which five diplomats and five others were killed. A 1973 United States Department of State document, declassified in 2006, concluded [...] "The Khartoum operation was planned and carried out with the full knowledge and personal approval of Yasser Arafat." [...] Arafat denied any involvement in the operation and insisted it was carried out independently by the Black September group. Israel claimed <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> was in ultimate control over these organizations and therefore had not abandoned terrorism.|$|E
500|$|Israel refused Arafat's wish to {{be buried}} near the Al-Aqsa Mosque or {{anywhere}} in Jerusalem, citing security concerns. Israel also feared that his burial would strengthen Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem. Following the Cairo procession, Arafat was [...] "temporarily" [...] buried within the Mukataa in Ramallah; {{tens of thousands of}} Palestinians attended the ceremony. Arafat was buried in a stone, rather than wooden, coffin, and Palestinian spokesman Saeb Erekat said <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> would be reburied in East Jerusalem following the establishment of a Palestinian state. After Sheikh Taissir Tamimi discovered <b>that</b> <b>Arafat</b> was buried improperly and in a coffin—which is not in accordance with Islamic law—Arafat was reburied on the morning of 13 November at around 3:00am. On 10 November 2007, prior to the third anniversary of Arafat's death, President Mahmoud Abbas unveiled a mausoleum for Arafat near his tomb in commemoration of him.|$|E
5000|$|He says <b>that</b> Yasser <b>Arafat</b> made a [...] "disastrous mistake" [...] in {{rejecting the}} peace offer, but that [...] "based on my 14 years of {{dealings}} with Arafat, I reject {{the notion that}} he was bent on Israel's destruction". Siegman is critical of Ariel Sharon, about whom he wrote: [...] "The war Sharon is waging is not aimed at the defeat of Palestinian terrorism but at the defeat of the Palestinian people and their aspirations for national self-determination".|$|R
5000|$|The Canard Enchaîné {{newspaper}} reported alleged leaks of information by unnamed medical sources at Percy hospital that {{had access to}} Arafat and his medical file. According to the newspaper, the doctors at Percy hospital suspected, from Arafat's arrival, grave lesions of the liver responsible for an alteration of {{the composition of the}} blood; Arafat was therefore placed in a hematology service. Leukemia was [...] "soundly ruled out". According to the same source, the reason why this diagnosis of cirrhosis could not be made available was that, {{in the mind of the}} general public, cirrhosis is generally associated with the consequences of alcohol abuse. Even though the diagnosis was not of alcoholic cirrhosis and Arafat was not known for consuming any alcohol, there was a likelihood of rumors. The source explained <b>that</b> <b>Arafat's</b> living conditions did little to improve the situation. Thus, according to the source, the probable causes of the disease were multiple; Arafat's coma was a consequence of the worsened cirrhosis. The French newspaper Le Monde quoted doctors as saying that he suffered from [...] "an unusual blood disease and a liver problem".|$|R
5000|$|In February 2004, it was {{reported}} that the European Union (EU) anti-fraud office (OLAF) was studying documents suggesting <b>that</b> Yasser <b>Arafat</b> and the Palestinian Authority had diverted {{tens of millions of dollars}} in EU funds to organizations involved in terrorist attacks, such as the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. However, in August 2004, a provisional assessment stated that [...] "To date, there is no evidence that funds from the non-targeted EU Direct Budget Assistance to the Palestinian Authority have been used to finance illegal activities, including terrorism." ...|$|R
