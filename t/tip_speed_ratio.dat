2500|$|In {{aeronautics}} {{and marine}} hydrodynamics, the advance ratio is {{the ratio of}} the freestream fluid speed to the propeller, rotor, or cyclorotor tip speed. When a propeller-driven vehicle is moving at high speed relative to the fluid, or the propeller is rotating slowly, the advance ratio of its propeller(s) is a high number; and when it is moving at low speed, or the propeller is rotating at high speed, the advance ratio is a low number. [...] The advance ratio is a useful non-dimensional velocity in helicopter and propeller theory, since propellers and rotors will experience the same angle of attack on every blade airfoil section at the same advance ratio regardless of actual forward speed.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{behavior of}} a {{vertical axis wind turbine}} (VAWT) is analyzed by means of 2 D particle image velocimetry (PIV), focusing on the development of dynamic stall at different <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratios.</b> The VAWT has an unsteady aerodynamic behavior due to the variation with the azimuth angle ¿ of the blade's sections' angle of attack, perceived velocity and Reynolds number. The phenomenon of dynamic stall is then an inherent effect of the operation of a VAWT at low <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratios,</b> impacting both loads and power. The present work is driven by the need to understand this phenomenon, by visualizing and quantifying it, and to create a database for model validation. The experimental method uses PIV to visualize the development of the flow over the suction side of the airfoil for two different reference Reynolds numbers and three <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratios</b> in the operational regime of a small urban wind turbine. The field-of-view of the experiment covers the entire rotation of the blade and almost the entire rotor area. The analysis describes the evolution of the flow around the airfoil and in the rotor area, with special focus on the leading edge separation vortex and trailing edge shed vorticity development. The method also allows the quantification of the flow, both the velocity field and the vorticity/circulation (only the results of the vorticity/circulation distribution are presented), in terms of the phase locked average and the random component...|$|R

50|$|The ratio {{between the}} speed of the blade tips and {{the speed of}} the wind is called <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratio.</b> High {{efficiency}} 3-blade-turbines have tip speed/wind speed ratios of 6 to 7.Modern wind turbines are designed to spin at varying speeds (a consequence of their generator design, see above).

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the investigations into the feasibility of improving {{the performance of a}} marine current turbine using a biomimetic concept inspired from the leading-edge tubercles on the ﬂippers of humpback whales. An experimental test campaign was recently conducted in the Emerson Cavitation Tunnel at Newcastle University and details of this test campaign together with the ﬁndings are summarised in the paper A set of tidal turbines with different leading-edge proﬁles was manufactured and tested to evaluate the hydrodynamic performance.

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation into the effect of changes in solidity on the performance of a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine. Two VAWT configurations are used, one of solidity s ¼ 0. 26 (chord C ¼ 0. 03 m) and the other with s ¼ 0. 34 (C ¼ 0. 04 m). The turbine performance coefficient (Cp) was measured over a range of <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratios</b> and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to determine the flow field around both turbine configurations. Performance (Cpel) curves for the two VAWTs are compared at the same Reynolds numbers to investigate the effects of solidity alone on the performance and aerodynamics of each configuration. The higher solidity (s ¼ 0. 34) VAWT attained a similar maximum Cp but with a narrower Cpel curve than the lower solidity VAWT. The performance differences between the two VAWT configurations at two <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratios</b> are explained in detail using PIV around both VAWT rotor blades. This allows the linking of detailed aerodynamics to the performance and it was shown that the generation and shedding of stall vortices started earlier on the lower solidity VAWT than the higher solidity VAWT, thus limiting the rotor efficiency...|$|R

Unsteady, Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes CFD simulations were conducted using two different rotors and two simulation methodologies. The first rotor had an aspect ratio of 1. 1 and simulations were conducted by incorporating the dynamic equations of the rigid-rotor motion using a one degree-of-freedom (1 -DOF) module to evaluate the rotor's free motion. The second rotor had an aspect ratio of 0. 7 and simulations were conducted by specifying a fixed rotational velocity. The predicted torque and power curves were validated using experimental data. The transient forces from the two rotor blades, the resultant forces, and the longitudinal drag and lateral lift coefficients were evaluated using the two complementary data sets. The lateral force coefficient had a large contribution to the rotor torque at low azimuth angles and at low <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratios</b> (λ).

5000|$|The {{wind turbine}} {{described}} by Betz does not actually exist. It {{is merely an}} idealized wind turbine described as an actuator disk. It's a disk in space where fluid energy is simply extracted from the air. In the Betz turbine the energy extraction manifests itself through thrust. The equivalent turbine described by Betz would be a horizontal propeller type operating with infinite blades at infinite tip speed ratios and no losses. The <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratio</b> is ratio {{of the speed of}} the tip relative to the free stream flow. This turbine is not too far from actual wind turbines. Actual turbines are rotating blades. They typically operate at high tip speed ratios. At high tip speed ratios three blades are sufficient to interact with all the air passing through the rotor plane. Actual turbines still produce considerable thrust forces.|$|E
50|$|Modern large wind {{turbines}} are variable-speed machines. When the wind speed is below rated, generator torque {{is used to}} control the rotor speed in order to capture as much power as possible. The most power is captured when the <b>tip</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratio</b> is held constant at its optimum value (typically 6 or 7). This means that as wind speed increases, rotor speed should increase proportionally. The difference between the aerodynamic torque captured by the blades and the applied generator torque controls the rotor speed. If the generator torque is lower, the rotor accelerates, and if the generator torque is higher, the rotor slows down. Below rated wind speed, the generator torque control is active while the blade pitch is typically held at the constant angle that captures the most power, fairly flat to the wind. Above rated wind speed, the generator torque is typically held constant while the blade pitch is active.|$|E
