50|$|Treatment of neuroferritinopathy {{is focused}} on {{managing}} symptoms associated with chorea and dystonia using standard medications for each. The disorder is progressive and symptoms become worse with age. Fewer than 100 cases of neuroferritinopathy have been reported since its identification in 2001.

50|$|Treatment with mTOR inhibitors can be {{complicated}} by adverse events. The most frequently occurring adverse events are stomatitis, rash, anemia, fatigue, hyperglycemia/hypertriglyceridemia, decreased appetite, nausea, and diarrhea. Additionally, {{interstitial lung disease}} is an adverse event of particular importance. mTORi-induced ILD often is asymptomatic (with ground glass abnormalities on chest CT) or mild symptomatic (with a non-productive cough), but can be very severe as well. Even fatalities have been described. Careful diagnosis and treatment therefore is essential. Recently, a new diagnostic and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>management</b> approach has been proposed.|$|E
50|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) {{has become}} the diagnostic modality of choice for head trauma due to its accuracy, reliability, safety, and wide availability. The changes in microcirculation, impaired auto-regulation, cerebral edema, and axonal injury start as soon as head injury occurs and manifest as clinical, biochemical, and radiological changes. Proper <b>therapeutic</b> <b>management</b> of brain injury is based on correct diagnosis and appreciation of the temporal course of the disease process. CT scan detects and precisely localizes the intracranial hematomas, brain contusions, edema and foreign bodies. Because of the widespread availability of CT, there is reduction in arteriography, surgical intervention and skull radiography.|$|E
40|$|Patient-reported outcome (PRO) is an "umbrella term" {{that covers}} {{a whole range}} of {{potential}} types of measurement but it is used specifically to refer to all measures quantifying the state of health through the evaluation of outcomes reported by the patient himself/herself. PROs are increasingly seen as complementary to biomedical measures and they are being incorporated more frequently into clinical trials and clinical practice. After considering the cultural background of PROs - that is the well known patient-centered model of medicine -, their historical profile (since 1914, the year of the first outcome measure) and typologies, the paper aims at debating their methodological complexity and implementation into practice.

50|$|HFrEF and HFpEF {{represent}} {{distinct entities}} {{in terms of}} development and effective <b>therapeutic</b> <b>management.</b> Specifically cardiac resynchronization, administration of beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are applied to good effect in HFrEF but are largely ineffective at reducing morbidity and mortality in HFpEF. Many of these therapies are effective in reducing the extent of cardiac dilation and increasing ejection fraction in HFrEF patients. It is unsurprising they fail to effect improvement in HFpEF patients, given their un-dilated phenotype and relative normal ejection fraction. Understanding and targeting mechanisms unique to HFpEF are thus essential {{to the development of}} therapeutics.|$|E
50|$|The {{augmentation}} of {{the buttocks}} is {{realized with a}} gluteal implant, which is emplaced under each gluteus maximus muscle; the insertion of the buttock prosthesis is through a midline incision (5-8-cm-wide) over the tailbone (coccyx). Augmentation with a gluteal implant is the method most effective for enlarging the buttocks of the man or of the woman whose body possesses few stores of excess adipose fat in the lower portion of the trunk, the buttocks and thighs, the anatomic regions where the human body usually stores excess body fat. Post-operatively, because of the cutting (incising) into {{the flesh of the}} tailbone muscles, the full healing of the augmented tissues can be approximately 6-8 months, in the course of which the gluteal-muscle tissues relax, and the settled buttocks prostheses are integrated to the gluteal region. The implantation procedure can be performed upon a patient who is either sedated or anaesthetized, either under general anaesthesia or under local anaesthesia. The usual operating-room time for a buttocks augmentation procedure is approximately 2 hours. The procedure can be managed either as an overnight in-patient treatment or as a hospital outpatient treatment. Given the nature of the surgical incisions to the gluteus maximus muscles, the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>management</b> of post-surgical pain (at the surgical-wound sites) and normal tissue-healing usually require a 4-6-week convalescence, after which the patient resumes his or her normal-life activities.|$|E
40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{a potentially}} lethal clinical condition that is suspected {{in patients with}} common clinical complaints, in many and varied, clinical care settings. Once VTE is diagnosed, optimal <b>therapeutic</b> <b>management</b> (thrombolysis, IVC filters, type and duration of anticoagulants) and ideal <b>therapeutic</b> <b>management</b> settings (outpatient, critical care) are also controversial. Clinical prediction tools, including clinical decision rules and D-Dimer, have been developed, and some validated, to assist clinical decision making along the diagnostic and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>management</b> paths for VTE. Despite these developments, practice variation is high and there remain many controversies {{in the use of}} the clinical prediction tools.

40|$|In {{patients}} undergoing {{high risk}} surgery, postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are frequent and {{associated with increased}} morbidity and mortality (1). Different factors may promote PPCs, including clinical characteristics of the patients, type and duration of surgery, the amount and type of fluids administered, as well as pain control. During anesthesia, we suggest the following intraoperative ventilation settings: low VT (6 – 8 mL/kg predicted body weight), low plateau pressure (< 16 cm H 2 O), low PEEP (5 cm H 2 O or lower), low ΔP (< 13 cm H 2 O), low inspiratory oxygen fractions and respiratory rate to maintain adequate gas-exchange, while recruitment manoeuvres {{should not be used}} routinely.

40|$|Diabetes is {{a common}} {{metabolic}} disease indicated by unusually high plasma glucose level {{that can lead to}} major complications such as diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular diseases. One of the effective <b>therapeutic</b> <b>managements</b> of the disease is to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia through inhibition of α-glucosidase, a carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzyme to retard overall glucose absorption. In recent years, a plenty of research works have been conducted looking for novel and effective α-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) from natural sources as alternatives for the synthetic AGI due to their unpleasant side effects. Plants and herbs are rich with secondary metabolites that have massive pharmaceutical potential. Besides, studies showed that phytochemicals such as flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, anthocyanins, glycosides, and phenolic compounds possess significant inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase enzyme. Malaysia is a tropical country that is rich with medicinal herbs. In this review, we focus on eight Malaysian plants with the potential as AGI to develop a potential functional food or lead compounds against diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Retinal angiomatous proliferation(RAP), {{also known}} as “type 3 neovascularization”, is a well-recognized {{variation}} of neovascular age-related macular degeneration(nARMD). Neovascularization is the basic pathological characteristic. Current view {{on the origin of}} the neovascularization is the deep retinal capillaries. The main clinical features include retinal pigment epithelium detachment(PED) and reticular pseudodrusen. These two features have close relation to the retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) tear and geographic atrophy(GA), respectively, which may ultimately result in severe irreversible visual impairment. The disease has a rapid natural course and the majority of patients in early stage can develop into vision loss within 6 mo. However, classical <b>therapeutic</b> <b>managements,</b> such as laser therapy, have limited efficacy and poor prognosis. Recently, RAP has been further understood with the application of OCT angiography and other new technologies in diagnosing, staging and monitoring RAP. Varieties of research on intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) treatment to RAP have also revealed its promising results and proved its safety as well as effectiveness. All these have provided new knowledge on choosing the optimal treatment regimen in clinical...|$|R
