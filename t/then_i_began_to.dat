500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{met with}} a divided {{reaction}} from fans and music critics, who {{were not used to}} the album's production and lyrical content. Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn expressed a mixed response towards the band's stylistic change from [...] "soulflavored" [...] songs such as [...] "Everyday People" [...] and [...] "Hot Fun in the Summertime", stating [...] "there is little on the album that is worth your attention". Other major music publications praised this new direction: in his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Vince Aletti wrote that [...] "At first I hated it for its weakness and its lack of energy and I still dislike these qualities. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> respect the album's honesty". Aletti cited it as [...] "one of the most important fucking albums this year" [...] and [...] "the new urban music... not about dancing to the music, in the streets. It's about disintegration, getting fucked up, nodding, maybe dying. There are flashes of euphoria, ironic laughter, even some bright stretches but mostly it's just junkie death, oddly unoppressive and almost attractive in its effortlessness". [...] A columnist for Hit Parader magazine gave Riot a favorable review, and stated that the album has [...] "a lot that makes Sly the in-person rave that he is." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "what's expressed is the bitterest ghetto pessimism", backed by [...] "subtle production techniques and jarring song compositions". He declared Riot [...] "one of those rare albums whose whole actually does exceed the sum of its parts". Greil Marcus called the record [...] "Muzak with its finger on the trigger." ...|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the case}} of Harvey Lillard, Palmer stated: [...] "I had a case of heart trouble which was not improving. I {{examined}} the spine and found a displaced vertebra pressing against the nerves which innervate the heart. I adjusted the vertebra and gave immediate relief– nothing [...] "accidental" [...] or [...] "crude" [...] about this. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> reason if two diseases, so dissimilar as deafness and heart trouble, came from impingement, a pressure on nerves, were not other disease due to a similar cause? Thus the science (knowledge) and art (adjusting) of Chiropractic were formed at that time." ...|$|E
60|$|King. What <b>then?</b> for <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> fear my firmness, And {{doubt the}} soft {{destruction}} of your tongue.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> indeed <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> understand. What a {{woman of}} resource! She watched me closely behind the {{feathers}} of her fan.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{some time}} I hesitated {{how to change}} it. <b>Then</b> one day <b>I</b> came here to see my friend Giatron--we came {{together}} from Italy. I hand him the note. I ask him please change. He give me the change and I stay {{to have a drink}} with the head waiter, who is a friend of mine. Presently Giatron comes out. He calls me into the office. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> tremble. He looks at me and I tremble more.|$|R
2500|$|... "We went to Pendlebury in 1909 from a {{residential}} side of Manchester, and we didn't like it. My father {{wanted to go}} to get near a friend for business reasons. We lived next door, {{and for a long time}} my mother never got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so I got used to it, and then I got absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The book is {{dedicated}} [...] "To the Wife of My Youth". This dedication {{appears in the}} first printing run of about 5,000 copies, all either in the 1st edition, 1st state binding or in two alternate bindings. In an 1887 printing of Ben-Hur at the Rare Books Department of the Cincinnati Public Library, Lew Wallace wrote to Alexander Hill: [...] "My Dear Friend HillWhen Ben-Hur was finished, I told my wife {{it was to be}} dedicated to her, and that she must furnish the inscription. She wrote 'To the Wife of My Youth' / The book became popular; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> receive letters of sympathy and enquiries as to when and of what poor Mrs. Wallace died. I laughed at first, but the condolences multiplied until finally I told the good woman that having got me into the trouble she must now get me out, which she did by adding the words--'Who still abides with me.' / The device was perfect." [...] Wallace apparently also received many marriage proposals due to the misunderstanding.|$|E
60|$|At {{first that}} phrase {{struck me as}} being merely queer, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> realise certain {{possibilities}} that were wrapped up in it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you would}} only take the {{ammoniated}} quinine. You men are so proud and obstinate. Good-bye, darling. Eight hours, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> live again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say yes," [...] returns Miss Smallweed, [...] "for I {{know what}} you girls are. Do it without saying it, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> may <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> believe you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{exchanged}} cards. The names Graham Bretton and Home de Bassompierre {{gave rise}} to questions and explanations. That was on the second day; but before <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> know something." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was a bit}} worried at fust--not about her--and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{think that}} p'raps {{it was the best}} thing that could have 'appened.|$|E

6000|$|... "'And he bagged one,' says John Tom, 'and 'twas {{not with}} a gun, and he never had on a {{velveteen}} suit of clothes in his life.' And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> catch his smoke.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Richmond turned about. [...] "I {{would like}} to dig up {{the bottom of this}} ditch here foot by foot--and dry the stuff and sift it--very carefully.... <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> might <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> {{remember}} things." ...|$|R
60|$|My anxiety {{to get to}} work {{is greater}} than I can express, because time seems to be making no {{movement}} towards home until I shall be reading hard. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> count and count and count the upward steps to May.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Where the {{aggravation}} of it is. Any man {{may be in}} {{good spirits}} and good temper when he's well dressed. There an't much credit in that. If I was very ragged and very jolly, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> should <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> feel <b>I</b> had gained a point, Mr Pinch.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{caught his}} hand and held on to it with all my power. The man's weight was a {{tremendous}} strain on my muscles, but fortunately they stood the test, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> drag him over the rail.|$|E
60|$|Half-crazed, I {{stood and}} gazed, and gazed, {{and gazed at}} the distant steamer. The wind died away, and I could {{perceive}} {{that she was not}} becoming more distant. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> hope. Another wind might spring up which would bring her back.|$|E
60|$|I grew {{dizzy and}} sick at the thought, but she caught me and held me to her. Presently {{we sat down}} on the door log, gazing at the corpse. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> reflect, and took out my powder gourd and loaded the pistol.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well; <b>then</b> <b>I</b> will <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> be extravagant, at once.

I shall be back in five minutes." ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{the third}} morning. I am awakened out of my sleep by a dismal shriek from my wife, who demands to know whether there's any danger. I rouse myself, and look out of bed. The water-jug is {{plunging}} and leaping like a lively dolphin; all the smaller articles are afloat, except my shoes, which are stranded on a carpet-bag, high and dry, {{like a couple of}} coal-barges. Suddenly I see them spring into the air, and behold the looking-glass, which is nailed to the wall, sticking fast upon the ceiling. At the same time the door entirely disappears, and a new one is opened in the floor. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> comprehend that the state-room is standing on its head.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} him, {{and it was}} <b>then</b> that <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> fancy him no longer in his right mind. He was peering up to me, as if for sympathy, a timid joy in his eyes. All that had passed between us was already {{forgotten}} in the prospect of this fresh disaster.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{charge the}} weapon, and while so doing glanced involuntarily across the deck, seeing {{here and there}} a tiny thread of dull red. On the instant my heart turned cold, for until then I had had no thought that any of our lads were hurt.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{fish for}} {{bonefish}} {{in front of}} my cottage. Whenever I would stick my rod in the sand and go in out of the hot sun a bonefish would take my bait and start off to sea. Before I could get back he would break something.|$|E
6000|$|The fog {{that had}} been his became mine. In an extravagance of {{attention}} to every syllable of his speech as it died away uncompleted in the little listening room I mutely surveyed him. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> understand, to realize where my poor little [...] "generosity" [...] was to come in.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1941, {{during the}} German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, HKP 562 was deployed to Vilnius (Vilna), Lithuania. Plagge soon witnessed the genocide being carried out against the Jews of the area. Plagge would later testify that [...] "I saw unbelievable things that I could not support...it was <b>then</b> that <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> work against the Nazis".|$|R
40|$|Sustainable {{transport}} is a {{key factor}} of sustainable development. In Copenhagen, it is very interesting that the urban structure and transportation network correspond to each other to obtain sustainable transport. This thesis work contains four parts. I start with an illustration of relevant theories about sustainable development and sustainable transportation, which provide guidelines and principles for my further research. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> collect official documents, information, and statistics from Internet and Greater Copenhagen Authority. In the third stage, I focus on the case study of Copenhagen’s urban structural plan and transport modes. During this period, I have visited Copenhagen and finished a lot of relevant research by myself. At last, based on the theories and analyses above, a summary of combing cycling and public transport in urban structural plan has been carried out. The main questions of my thesis research have been solved. In general, I find that combining cycling and public transport is related to urban structural plan and sustainable perspective...|$|R
60|$|At first, {{considerations}} of health did not trouble me. I {{was young and}} strong, and my constitution quickly threw off the effects of my dissipation. <b>Then,</b> gradually, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> feel worse. <b>I</b> was losing my grip. I found a difficulty in concentrating my attention on my work. I had dizzy spells. I became nervous and distrait. Eventually I went to a doctor. He examined me thoroughly, and shook his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Inez Robertson," [...] I said to myself, [...] "that's a queer combination. English {{father and}} Portuguese mother, I suppose. But what can an Englishman {{be doing in}} a place like this? If it had been a trek-Boer I should not have been surprised." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> give {{directions}} about out-spanning.|$|E
60|$|LORD LOAM. When I woke, I wept. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> feel {{extremely}} hungry. There {{was a large}} turtle on the beach.

My dears, I crawled towards him, I flung myself upon him--(here he pauses to rub his leg)--the nasty, spiteful brute.|$|E
6000|$|He {{helped me}} along by asking questions. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> {{tell him how}} the negroes had flocked into our camps, and how simply and plainly the General had talked to them, advising them against {{violence}} of any kind, and explaining to them that [...] "Freedom" [...] meant only the liberty to earn their own living in their own way, and not freedom from work.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> it was <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> cast {{about for}} some plan which would promise {{at least a}} shadow of success, and I had ample time before me for such effort, unless, perchance, some {{inquisitive}} lobster back or marine came upon our hiding place.|$|R
6000|$|And {{so he went}} on till {{his breath}} run out, {{and he had to}} stop. I couldn't think of {{anything}} to say just <b>then,</b> and so <b>I</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> look over the paper again. [...] "Ay! here's another proclamation, or something like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{next day}} his whole manner, look, {{everything}} made one sure (humanly speaking) {{that he was}} indeed truly penitent; and <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> speak words of comfort, of God's tender love and compassion, and told him how {{to think of the}} Lord's gentle pity when He appeared first to the Magdalene and Peter, and when I took his hand in the old loving way, poor fellow, he broke down more than ever, and cried like a child.|$|R
