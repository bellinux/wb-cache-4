The asymmetrically inclined valves (inlet 20 degrees and outlet 40 degrees from vertical) were a significant departure for Henry and may be attributable to Sunbeam and Coatalen whose interest in desaxé configuration dated to 1911. Another unusual detail was the engine mounted directly on the chassis frame similarly to the 1921 'invincible Talbot-Darracq'. Following tests in Brooklands and Isle of Man prior to the Grand Prix, modifications were instigated to the <b>tail</b> <b>support</b> bracket.

40|$|Experimental {{data are}} {{presented}} for the parasite drag of various helicopter fuselage components, such as skids, external fuel tanks, and tailplane. The experiments were {{conducted at the}} Kazan National Research Technical University (Kazan Aviation Institute) T- 1 K wind tunnel, investigating four versions of a fuselage similar to the Ansat helicopter. It was found that, for the range of pitch angles − 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg− 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg, the skids added 80 % to the drag of the bare fuselage, whereas the tailplane increased the drag by 20 %. At the same conditions, external fuel tanks were found to add 48 % to the clean fuselage drag. A simple rotor hub with a <b>tail</b> <b>support</b> added 74 % to the bare fuselage {{in the range of}} pitch angles − 8 ≤α≤ 6 [*][*]deg− 8 ≤α≤ 6 [*][*]deg. Streamlining the rear fuselage was found to reduce the drag by 16 % over the range of pitch angles − 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg− 10 ≤α≤ 10 [*][*]deg.

40|$|The tail {{serves a}} range of {{functions}} including balance. Intervertebral joint stiffness, a measure of spinal rigidity, is useful for understanding its capability to perform basic functions, such as support against gravity. Dolphin joints of low and high stiffness are correlated with distinct vertebral morphologies. These principles apply for qualitatively assessing dinosaurian joint stiffness, because they relate Newtonian mechanics to morphology {{but this was not}} validated in the living relative, Crocodylus. Morphometric and qualitative phylogenetic data were gathered from theropod, sauropodomorph and thyreophoran dinosaur tail specimens, and then mapped on composite phylogenetic trees to reconstruct nodal joint stiffnesses. Initially, the tails of non-avian theropods were supported against gravity via static tail joint stabilisation. However, these tails became more dominantly stabilized by dynamic properties, as dorsoventral and lateral joint stiffness decreased towards the paravian node. In birds, the tail joints became stiffer dorsoventrally and laterally between Avialae and the crown group, enabling larger muscular forces to be produced. This change potentially allowed birds to utilise larger lift forces. The evolution of quadrupedality in sauropodomorphs and thyreophorans reduced the tail’s importance for balance and manoeuvrability, allowing alternative functions to evolve. The sauropods Shunosaurus and Mamenchisaurus appear to have had unique clubbing behaviours because of differences in joint stiffness, as well as tail club and proximal caudal articular surface morphologies. Along the stegosaurian and ankylosaurine lineages, the tail joints stiffened dorsoventrally and laterally, which improved <b>tail</b> <b>support</b> against gravity, and required larger muscular forces for weapon wielding. Therefore, not all dinosaurian tail weapons evolved in the same way. This thesis makes an important step in the understanding of dinosaurian tail function. However, future validation experiments would help to improve the accuracy of joint stiffness reconstructions in fossil taxa. Greater taxon sampling would also help to test and broaden the insights of this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Forming and {{maintaining}} an intact epidermal permeability barrier (EPB) {{is necessary to}} mammalian health and dysregulation of this process can result in serious complications. Tight junctions (TJs) and their integral proteins the Claudins (Cldns) have both structural and signaling importance to the skin barrier and the latter is most likely mediated via Cldn tail interaction with cytoplasmic proteins. Given that the family member Cldn 6 {{is known to be}} important to EPB function, we set out to determine the contribution of its cytoplasmic tail domain to TJ-mediated homoeostasis. Using transgenic mouse models, we overexpressed epidermal-targeted tail truncation mutants and assessed EPB formation and maintenance. We then used yeast 2 -hybrid and quantitative proteomic approaches to identify proteins that interact with this tail region and to assess the downstream effects of overexpressing these proteins in human keratinocytes in culture. We demonstrate that a 10 amino acid region in the cytoplasmic tail is required for efficient epidermal maturation and injury repair and that our mouse models may be applicable to postnatal epidermal maturation and human skin aging studies. We show that in addition to the known interacting partner ZO 1, the C-terminal tail of Cldn 6 also binds FIZ 1 (Flt 3 interacting zinc finger protein- 1), which we characterize {{for the first time as}} a mitogenic factor for keratinocytes. FIZ 1 stimulates autocrine pathways involving secreted heparin-binding factors IGFBP 3 and DKK 1, sensitization to IGF signaling, MAP/ERK activation and increased G 1 progression. Specific transcription factors, protein kinases and signaling scaffolds that we identified as novel FIZ 1 -binding partners likely mediate this signaling. Our studies on the Cldn 6 cytoplasmic <b>tail</b> <b>support</b> the importance of this region for epidermal maturation and for maintenance of skin homeostasis throughout life. They also delineate the potential for tail interactors such as ZO 1 and FIZ 1 to act in concert with Cldns in TJ-based signaling networks to regulate the balance between proliferation and differentiation in keratinocytes. These findings provide new insight into the role of the Cldn 6 cytoplasmic tail and will ultimately aid in the development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches for the treatment of skin conditions rooted in barrier defects...|$|E

While the length distribution of actin bundles was extensively studied, almost nothing is known about the thickness distribution. Here, we use high-resolution cryo-TEM to measure the thickness distribution of actin/fascin bundles, in vitro. We find that the thickness distribution has a prominent peak, with an exponential <b>tail,</b> <b>supporting</b> a scenario of an initial fast formation of a disc-like nucleus of short actin fila-ments, which only later elongates. The bundle thicknesses at steady state are found to follow the distribution of the initial nuclei indicating that no lateral coalescence occurs.
