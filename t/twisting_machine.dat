40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a carding machine and <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> for produce eri fiber and yarn. A carding machine decomposes degumming cocoons and forms it into cohesiveness silk filament. Silk filament was then spun and twisted in <b>twisting</b> <b>machine.</b> Factors to test machine functionality were teeth of carding head which were aligned in straight and zigzag pattern. Speeds of fiber feeding were 0. 24, 0. 32, and 0. 4 meter per minute. From the experiments of carding machine, it can be found that almost cocoons were decomposed when using zigzag pattern. Speed of cocoon feeder was about 0. 24 meter per minute. From <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> testing, results pointed out different speed of fiber feeding provided different size of yarn. The properties of eri silk obtained from machine were similar with eri silk produced from traditional method. Therefore, carding machine and <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> developed in this research can help farmers to increase production and support the eri silk industry development...|$|E

50|$|By 1 December of {{the same}} year, two winding {{machines}} and a cleaning machine were in operation, {{as well as a}} twisting-machine. The firm’s modest production together with some purchased yarn was dyed at the Rau dyeing works in Berg before being taken to Bönnigheim where it was wound onto a bobbin and finished by twelve women. Two men turning a wheel provided the motive power. However, by 1855 manpower had proved insufficient and two donkeys (later two oxen) were used to drive a horse mill. In the same year, the black dyeing process was transferred in-house and additional machinery of various kinds was acquired. The following year saw the arrival of four new <b>twisting</b> <b>machines,</b> six additional winders and more washing and bobbin machines: the power source for these was a four-horsepower steam engine which replaced the oxen. In 1857, between 90 and 100 females were employed each earning 20 Gulden per year, rising to 25 Gulden after six months.|$|R

50|$|Sisal fibers are {{extracted}} from the Agave plant; {{the leaves of the}} plant are cut and then taken to a machine that splits them apart and extracts the sought after fiber (this process is called decortication).

40|$|OBJECTIVES. We {{sought to}} develop lists of jobs whose members {{reported}} {{high and low}} levels of functional disability. METHODS. Samples of women (n = 6096) and men (n = 3653) were drawn from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiological Follow-up. Disability was measured with a modified Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire. We analyzed women and men separately, and we calculated average disability indices within longest-held occupations while adjusting for age, age-squared, married spouse present, and education. We minimized attrition bias with an econometric technique. RESULTS. From highest to lowest association with disability, the female broad occupations ranking was as follows: farming, no occupation, laborers, service, technicians, operatives, crafts workers, transportation operators, professionals, sales workers, administrative support, and managers. The male broad occupations ranking was as follows: no occupation, farming, operatives, crafts workers, service, technicians, manager, administrative support, sales, and professionals. The highest levels of disability for women and men occurred among nonconstruction laborers, farm workers, <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> operators, servants, machinery maintenance workers, mining machine operators, and bus drivers.

At that moment, I felt a terrific explosion which knocked the control stick from my hand, and the whole machine quivered like a stricken animal. In a second, the cockpit was a mass of flames: instinctively, I reached up to open the hood. It would not move. I tore off my straps and managed to force it back; but this took time, and when I dropped back into the seat and reached for the stick in an effort to turn the plane on its back, the heat was so intense that I could feel myself going.
