The second block is the Georgian Supplement (U+2D00–U+2D2F), and it contains Nuskhuri.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{began his}} {{managerial}} {{career at the}} club where his professional playing career had started. Carlisle in the 1948–49 season were struggling in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Third Division North and finding it difficult to attract southern-based players because of the town's geographic remoteness in the far north of England. Shankly's work ethic transformed the team who finished 15th in 1948–49 {{after he had been}} in charge for only the last few matches. They improved to ninth in 1949–50 and then to third in 1950–51, almost gaining promotion.|$|E
5|$|This was {{repeated}} the following season, {{and so in}} 1971 Andover took another step up and joined the Southern League. Now competing against teams from an even wider area spanning almost the entire width of the country (ranging from Bideford {{in the west to}} Bury Town in the east) and in some cases with a larger budget and fanbase, competition was always tough with the club generally finishing in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table. The highest position the club reached at this level was the sixth place reached in 1987–88 and again in 1991–92.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{has participated}} in {{biathlon}} at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002; Kerryn Rim's eighth place in 1994 in the 15km individual event was their best result. Cameron Morton represented Australia in 2006 and finished in the bottom 10% {{in each of his}} two races. In 2010, Australia's sole representative Alexei Almoukov came second last in his event—one competitor did not finish. Rim's result remains the only top-20 finish by an Australian in the discipline, and more than 80% of Australian entrants have finished in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the field, including many in the bottom fifth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} season since {{the return of}} the Football League, Cardiff {{finished}} the 1946–47 season as champions of the Third Division South under new manager Billy McCandless and returned to the Second Division. McCandless left the club soon after and was replaced by Cyril Spiers who led the side to promotion in the 1951–52 season, returning to the top tier of English football {{for the first time in}} 23 years. However, despite spending five seasons in the First Division, the team continually struggled in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table and were eventually relegated in 1957. They returned to the First Division for two seasons between 1960 and 1962 before again suffering relegation.|$|E

5|$|Short track {{speed skating}} has {{provided}} the country with many firsts. Australia won its first World Championships in a winter sport when their relay team won the 5,000m race in 1991, which was hosted in Sydney. However, they crashed at the 1992 Olympics when the discipline was introduced and failed to win a medal, {{and all of the}} individual competitors finished in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the field. They recovered to post a series of strong performances in Lillehammer in 1994. The short track relay yielded Australia's first Winter Olympic medal, a bronze. The Australians also did well individually; all four representatives finished in the top 13 in at least one of their races, and in the top half in six of their eight events, including top-ten finishes for Steven Bradbury and Richard Nizielski.|$|E
5|$|The promotional cinema {{poster for}} the film {{featured}} a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is actually {{the front of the}} suit. The poster caused some furore—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee, whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.|$|E
5|$|York mostly {{occupied}} <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> {{the table}} {{before the turn of}} the year, and dropped as low as 23rd in September 2013. During February 2014 the team broke into the top half of the table and with one match left were in sixth-place. York's defensive record was the third best in League Two with 41 goals conceded, bettered only by Southend (39) and Chesterfield (40). Davies made the highest number of appearances over the season, appearing in 47 of York's 52 matches. Fletcher was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 10 league goals and 13 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Jarvis with nine goals.|$|E

50|$|The Amt Halver had a {{separate}} coat of arms, {{which was also}} designed by Otto Hupp. It combined elements from the two member municipalities Halver and Schalksmühle: in the upper part is a linden branch symbolizing Halver, in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>half</b> <b>of</b> a black mill wheel as the symbol of Schalksmühle. Separating the two is the red and white checked fess, as above. The coat of arms was granted on June 8, 1936, and expired with the dissolving of the Amt in 1969.|$|R
50|$|After a {{successful}} period, poor results ensued, {{and during the}} late 2000s the club often finished in <b>the</b> middle or <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table. The club was also in financial trouble and often couldn't pay the players their salaries.|$|R
5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos doubled in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the sixth {{to cut the}} score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose {{in the top of}} the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a line drive to center field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit. However, the umpires ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto their lead in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending their lead to 5–2. Price closed the game in the ninth, recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{had just}} 13 players when McCall took over, {{and he made}} a number of summer signings {{including}} defender Darren Williams, midfielders Kyle Nix, Alex Rhodes and Scott Phelan, and strikers Barry Conlon, Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu and Peter Thorne. McCall recorded his first win as a manager against Wrexham on 25 August 2007 after substitute Luke Medley scored a late winner, but despite his pre-season target his team spent much {{of the first half of}} the season in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table. After going unbeaten in January, the club were still 15th in League Two, and McCall told the Telegraph & Argus he did not regret his pre-season target but was carried away with the euphoria at the time. City's form continued to improve during the second half of the season, and McCall led his side to 10th place in League Two.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{opted to}} build a {{youthful}} side and made controversial decisions {{at the start of}} the season to offload 2009–10 player of the year and club captain Sean Gregan as well as top scorer Paweł Abbott amongst other first team players. The team went into the New Year in ninth position, with games in hand on the teams above them, and being unbeaten at home in the league. Results in the second half of the season were less consistent and the team finished the season in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table. On 6 May 2011 Dickov announced that he would make only his second appearance of the season for the first team in the final match of the season, and would then end his playing career to concentrate on management. He then came on as a 77th-minute substitute the following day against Milton Keynes Dons.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the large 1960 team, the teams in subsequent Olympics were scaled back and were the smallest since 1936. The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne—who crashed during a practice run—and a British luge competitor. Milne had skidded off the course and crashed into a tree. Members of the IOC asked the AOF whether Milne was negligently sent to compete {{despite a lack of}} experience, which the AOF denied. The Australian manager John Wagner blamed the accident on a large group of skiers who had congregated lower down on the course during the practice session, forcing Milne to take evasive action. The Australian delegation felt that the training arrangements had not been enacted strictly, making the course unsafe. Australia was represented by five skiers—excluding Milne. Christine Smith placed in the top 30 in two events, but the remainder placed 40th or lower, although all were in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the field. Milne's replacement Peter Wenzel placed 68th in both the downhill and giant slalom.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the inning, Yankees ace Jack McDowell, who {{had entered}} {{the game in the}} 9th inning for a rare relief appearance, faced Joey Cora, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Edgar Martínez—the second, third, and fourth batters in the Mariners' order, respectively. Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line and reached first base safely on an infield hit. Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call, believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines; however, the umpires' ruling stood. Center fielder Griffey singled to short right-center field, {{allowing}} Cora to reach third base. Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left field line, scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with the winning run. The Mariners' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey, Martinez, and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise's first ever playoff series victory.|$|E
5|$|Kit changes {{had been}} {{introduced}} in the late 1930s. The 1937 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and celebrating twenty-five years in League Football by applying for re-election for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1951, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table until the League was restructured in 1958, requiring re-election a third and final time in 1956, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City {{started the}} 1936–37 season poorly, {{and were in}} <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table until December. The club were better known for goalscoring than solid defence, but {{frequently}} both eluded City; {{at one point the}} club gained just one win in twelve matches. However, Christmas proved to be a turning point for the club. Swift conceded five goals in consecutive matches on 19 and 25 December, but a Boxing Day win against Middlesbrough was the start of a long unbeaten run. By April City were second in the table, and faced a fixture against Arsenal, league leaders and the dominant club of the period. Peter Doherty inspired the team to a 2–0 win, and City {{reached the top of the}} table. The unbeaten run continued until the end of the season, and City secured their first league championship with a 4–1 win over Sheffield Wednesday. City's third goal in this match came as the result of a long clearance by Swift, who was noted for the distance he could propel the ball.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart {{also has}} three {{multiplayer}} modes; Mario Kart GP, Match Race and Battle Mode. The multiplayer modes support two {{players and the}} second player uses <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the screen which {{is used as a}} map in the single player modes. Mario Kart GP is the same as in single player, the only difference being that there are now two human controlled and six computer-controlled drivers. Match Race involves the two players going head to head on a track of their choice without any opponents. In Battle Mode, the two players again go head to head, but this time in one of four dedicated Battle Mode courses. Each player starts with three balloons around their kart which can be popped by power-ups fired by the other player. The first player to have all three of their balloons popped loses.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce was {{appointed}} manager of Bolton Wanderers following Colin Todd's departure, who had resigned in protest at {{the sale of}} Per Frandsen as the club attempted {{to raise funds for}} the new Reebok Stadium. He inherited a talented squad, which included Eiður Guðjohnsen, Jussi Jääskeläinen, Mark Fish, Claus Jensen, Dean Holdsworth, Bo Hansen, Michael Johansen, and Ricardo Gardner. However he was forced to sell Andy Todd, son of Colin Todd, after he broke assistant manager Phil Brown's jaw in a team bonding session. Despite being in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the table when he took over, Bolton reached the 1999–2000 Division One play-offs, losing to Ipswich Town, and had an eventful run to the League Cup and FA Cup semi-finals, only missing out on the 2000 FA Cup Final after a penalty shoot-out defeat to Aston Villa. He blamed referee Barry Knight for the play-off defeat, who he accused of being biased against Bolton. Allardyce was rewarded for turning the club around with a ten-year contract, though the terms of the contract only entitled him to a one year's compensation pay if he was sacked.|$|E
