5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe. The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> <b>and</b> can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E

5|$|During filming, <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> several {{cast members}} objected to cinematographer Michael Seresin and camera {{operator}} John Stanier's European style of single-source lighting, which involved {{the use of}} incense burners. In response, representatives of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) halted the production, and forbade Parker from using smoke on the set due to the noxious atmosphere it created.|$|E

5|$|During the Voskhod 2 {{mission in}} March 1965, cosmonauts Pavel Belyayev and Alexey Leonov could not {{completely}} seal the spacecraft hatch after Leonov's historic first walk in space.

5|$|Although Stowe {{describes}} Minnah and Judy {{with some}} tempered exasperation, she praises a riverboat stewardess named Commodore Rose. Once a slave {{owned by the}} captain, Rose had since been freed for saving his life during a boating accident and continues {{to work for him}} following emancipation. She is as forthright as Minnah and Judy, but Rose knows every portion of the river as well as the houses and sites along the banks, and their histories.

5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|Crimewave is a 1986 American comedy film {{directed}} by Sam Raimi, written {{by him and}} the Coen brothers, and starring Louise Lasser, Paul L. Smith, Brion James, Sheree J. Wilson, Edward R.

Following the commercial success of The Evil Dead (1981), Raimi and Campbell decided to collaborate on another project. Joel Coen of the Coen brothers served {{as one of the}} editors on The Evil Dead, and worked with Raimi on the screenplay. Production was difficult for several members of <b>the</b> <b>crew,</b> <b>and</b> the production studio, Embassy Pictures, refused to allow Raimi to edit the film. Several arguments broke out during the shoot for the film, because of continued interference by the studio.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> <b>and</b> made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as Van Gogh was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster.|$|E
