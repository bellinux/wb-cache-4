5|$|The victorious allies regrouped, {{although}} <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> {{to intercept}} Rupert {{as he left}} York. Once the allied army had reformed (and had been joined by Meldrum's and Denbigh's forces) they resumed the siege of York. Without hope of relief, and under the agreement that no Scottish soldiers were to be quartered in the city, the garrison surrendered on honourable terms on 16 July.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E

60|$|And {{in the end}} he smiled, {{perhaps only}} because I looked so frightened, but the reason {{scarcely}} mattered to me, I felt myself a fine fellow at once. It was a long smile, <b>too,</b> opening <b>slowly</b> to its fullest extent (as if to let me in), and then as slowly shutting.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.|$|E
5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened. At {{its peak}} of {{operations}} in 1944, {{a staff of}} 636 guards oversaw 25,000 permanent inmates, and an additional 150,000 people passed through the camp in {{its role as a}} transit camp. Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, were trained to tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be moving <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot. He brutally mistreated his two maids, Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, who were in constant fear for their lives, as were all the inmates.|$|E
5|$|The {{war effort}} {{was the source}} of {{continued}} disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions {{on both sides of the}} aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of the closing of the door, Fanny looks up. She goes to the door through which Vernon has just passed, listens a moment, then returns. Bennet calmly {{finishes}} the drawing of the curtains. Then he, <b>too,</b> crosses <b>slowly</b> till he and Fanny are facing one another across the centre of the room.|$|R
60|$|All rose except Presbyter Grimshaw. For {{a moment}} there was some hesitation, {{for the rule of}} the Church in favour of {{unanimity}} was absolute; but the Apostle fixed his piercing eyes on Job Grimshaw, and after a minute or so Job Grimshaw <b>too</b> rose <b>slowly,</b> like one compelled by an unseen power, and cast in his vote grudgingly with the rest. There was nothing more said about signing an agreement.|$|R
3000|$|..., {{the faster}} the model is [...] "adapted" [...] to signal changes. In other words, for a low {{learning}} rate, MoG produces a wide model that has difficulty in detecting a sudden change to the background (so, it is prone to the light switch problem, global and local). If the model adapts <b>too</b> quickly, <b>slowly</b> moving foreground pixels will be absorbed into the background model, resulting in a high false negative rate (the problem of the foreground aperture).|$|R
5|$|Dumouriez was a monarchist {{at heart}} and he despaired when King Louis XVI {{went to the}} {{guillotine}} on 21 January 1793. He found the political situation in Paris to be chaotic. He was appalled at the tendency of radicals to interfere with army commanders. Having already negotiated with the enemy, Dumouriez offered to treat and the Austrians sent Mack on 25 March. The French commander proposed to take the army and march on Paris. He would overthrow the National Convention, crush the Jacobins and restore the Constitution of 1791. For their part, the Austrians pledged to halt their advance while he carried out his coup. But Dumouriez moved <b>too</b> <b>slowly.</b> On 1 April, four commissioners and the War Minister Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville arrived at his headquarters to demand that the commander explain himself in Paris. They were seized and {{handed over to the}} Austrians.|$|E
5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard {{in the first half of}} the race before slowing down. However, he swam <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical error was mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a lot from it.|$|E
5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E
6000|$|The child, after nodding {{her head}} and smiling as she read each fresh invitation, turned the slate over, and, with some little triumph at showing that she could write <b>too,</b> began <b>slowly</b> to trace some large text letters in {{extremely}} crooked lines. It took her a long time--especially as Mr. Blyth was breathlessly {{looking over her shoulder}} all the while--to get through these words: [...] "Thank you for being so kind to me. I will go with you anywhere you like." ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{they looked}} at each other. She {{suddenly}} sprang up, turned her back to him, and walked away. He <b>too</b> rose <b>slowly</b> and went to the water's edge, where, crouching, he began to amuse himself unconsciously. Picking a daisy he dropped it on the pond, so that the stem was a keel, the flower floated like a little water lily, staring with its open face up to the sky. It turned slowly round, in a slow, slow Dervish dance, as it veered away.|$|R
30|$|Very {{dense and}} intense {{high-rise}} cities {{tend to be}} overcrowded and are not the best option. While the Walled City was a functioning tight-knit urban community (and a hotbed for crime), it was not sustainable and the negative impacts of <b>too</b> much density <b>slowly</b> made its residents sick.|$|R
25|$|Rüedi’s {{expectations}} {{regarding the}} New World, however, did not materialize. (Perhaps the medical infrastructure developed <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> in his eyes.) For that reason Rüedi returned to Switzerland after {{only five years}} (1896).|$|E
25|$|Mahela Jayawardene {{said after}} the match that he felt England’s {{approach}} had been too negative, and they had eliminated their chances of winning by scoring <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> in the first innings. He {{would go on to}} make similar comments {{at the end of the}} series.|$|E
25|$|West {{suffered}} from failing eyesight {{and high blood}} pressure in the late 1970s, and she became increasingly frail. Her last months were mostly spent in bed, sometimes delirious, sometimes lucid, and she complained that she was dying <b>too</b> <b>slowly.</b> She died on 15 March 1983 and is buried at Brookwood Cemetery, Woking.|$|E
60|$|She was {{speaking}} with apparent calm now, in a dull and monotonous voice, her eyes fixed upon the distant {{line of the}} horizon, where the glowing sun had at last sunk to rest.

60|$|The first intimation {{of danger}} {{that came to}} Tarzan was the impact of three bodies as the three apes leaped upon him and hurled him to the ground, where he alighted half stunned beneath their {{combined}} weight and was immediately set upon by the fifty hairy men or {{as many of them}} as could swarm upon his person. Instantly the ape-man became the center of a whirling, striking, biting maelstrom of horror. He fought nobly but the odds against him were <b>too</b> great. <b>Slowly</b> they overcame him though there was scarce one of them that did not feel the weight of his mighty fist or the rending of his fangs.|$|R

25|$|When cornering, {{the inner}} wheel travels a shorter {{distance}} than the outer wheel, so without a differential either the inner wheel rotates too quickly or the outer wheel rotates <b>too</b> <b>slowly,</b> {{which results in}} difficult and unpredictable handling, damage to tires and roads, and strain on (or possible failure of) the drivetrain.|$|E
25|$|According to the British National Formulary, it {{is better}} to {{withdraw}} <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> rather than too quickly from benzodiazepines. The rate of dosage reduction is best carried out so as to minimize the symptoms' intensity and severity. Anecdotally, a slow rate of reduction may reduce the risk of developing a severe protracted syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Stellar {{evolution}} is not studied by observing {{the life of}} a single star, as most stellar changes occur <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> to be detected, even over many centuries. Instead, astrophysicists come to understand how stars evolve by observing numerous stars at various points in their lifetime, and by simulating stellar structure using computer models.|$|E
60|$|Numa halted {{as he saw}} the man {{standing}} at the very spot where the king would drink. His jaws were parted, and his cruel eyes gleamed. He growled and advanced slowly. The man growled, <b>too,</b> backing <b>slowly</b> to one side, and watching, not the lion's face, but its tail. Should that commence to move {{from side to side}} in quick, nervous jerks, it would be well to be upon the alert, and should it rise suddenly erect, straight and stiff, then one might prepare to fight or flee; but it did neither, so Tarzan merely backed away and the lion came down and drank scarce fifty feet from where the man stood.|$|R
5000|$|Sumika's {{best friend}} and classmate who lives alone with her brother, Ushio is a naive girl {{madly in love with}} cute girls. She often gets crushes but they are all one-sided. She {{considers}} Sumika to be a very precious friend and often says that she is [...] "cool", [...] "not cute" [...] and [...] "not her type". She is completely unaware of Sumika's feelings and her inner reaction to these words. She herself develops feelings for Sumika, but is afraid to act on them based on a bad experience with one of her old friends. She later learns from Tomoe that Sumika is in love with her <b>too,</b> and <b>slowly</b> starts to give Sumika hints.|$|R
50|$|In the 2012 Tour of Britain, de Maar {{took the}} victory {{on the fifth}} stage. With 9 km left, he hit the tarmac with two other riders after taking a corner <b>too</b> wide.

25|$|The early Russian origins {{theory was}} {{rejected}} by Swedish, British, and U.S. military investigators because no recognizable rocket fragments were ever found, and according to some sightings the objects usually left no exhaust trail, some moved <b>too</b> <b>slowly</b> and usually flew horizontally, they sometimes traveled and maneuvered in formation, and they were usually silent.|$|E
25|$|This Test {{was similar}} to the {{previous}} one in many respects. Again Cowdrey top-scored in England's first innings and Hall was the most successful bowler.

When she reluctantly shows the Five the note, they are astonished to read: “I’m kidnapped in my own house. Please call the police”. Aily refuses to take them to Old Towers. On seeking Morgan's help, he snatches the note from them and tells them not to interfere with this. Thus, Aily agrees to take them to Old Towers.|$|R
6000|$|Running to the wardrobe, he {{discovered}} that the king's uniform was gone. That, with the witness of the empty bed, told him the whole story. The American smiled.
