5|$|<b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pleiades {{can be used}} as an {{important}} first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert. It is thought that Sir John was a {{descendant}} of either Matthew or Hildebert. Perhaps because of <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} surrounding the telescope's tracking of space probes, this only {{took up a}} fraction of its observing time, with the remainder used for scientific observations. These include using radar to measure <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon and to Venus; observations of astrophysical masers around star-forming regions and giant stars; observations of pulsars (including the discovery of millisecond pulsars and the first pulsar in a globular cluster); observations of quasars and gravitational lenses (including the detection of the first gravitational lens and the first Einstein ring). The telescope has also been used for SETI observations.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E

40|$|Consider the {{following}} problem: find the "best" approximating hyperplane {{for a family}} of points. The optimality of a solution may be determined according to different criteria. We present how to use computational geometry techniques to find a hyperplane minimizing <b>the</b> maximum <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> points, a hyperplane minimizing <b>the</b> sum of <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> points or a hyperplane containing the maximum number of the points. Another important aspect of the data approximation problems is considered. In many applications, the data are not points but are represented by simple objects. For families of convex polygons, we present how to compute a line minimizing <b>the</b> maximum <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> polygons and a line minimizing <b>the</b> sum of <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> polygons. Finally, we present new bounds on the number of geometric orderings induced by the line transversals of families of translates. These bounds allow a characterization of classes of families for which line transversals can be found in linear time...|$|R
5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination {{that supported the}} theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object. Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nebulae: they were far too distant {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E
5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to}} the border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|Saien {{was pressed}} {{immediately}} into Japanese service. During the Japanese invasion of Taiwan later in 1895, she was assigned together with six other ships to bombard the coastal defences of Takow (Kaohsiung). The fleet arrived {{off the coast}} on 12 October, warning foreign vessels that the attack would begin at 7am the following morning. The Japanese ships attacked on schedule, firing on the defenses until they stopped returning fire after half an hour. At 2pm, the ships closed <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach and began launching boats into the water with troops. Their forces had successfully captured the coastal fort by 2:35pm.|$|E

5|$|The Mirabello group {{engaged the}} Austro-Hungarian cruisers at 07:00, but were heavily outgunned, and instead {{attempted}} to shadow the fleeing cruisers. At 07:45, Rear Admiral Acton's ships encountered the destroyers Csepel and Balaton. After 20 minutes, the Italian destroyers {{were able to}} close <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Austro-Hungarian ships; the two groups engaged in a short artillery duel before a shot from Csepel struck Aquila and disabled the ship's boilers. By this time, the Austro-Hungarian destroyers were {{under the cover of}} the coastal batteries at Durazzo, and were able to make good their escape.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IK Pegasi {{system can}} be {{measured}} directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background) as the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the Hipparcos spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 light years (with an accuracy of ±5 light years). The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system. This is the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space.|$|E
5|$|The employees, however, did {{not like}} living so close to their employers. They complained about <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city and the {{transportation}} problems, and they criticised the rental rates and the reserves they had to make. After the deaths of Matthes and van Marken, however, the park gradually evolved into a desirable residential area. In 1931 the villa, Rust Roest, which had long been empty, was converted into a school. It was demolished in 1981. Since 1989, the park has been listed as Cultural heritage.|$|E

5|$|The first {{professional}} astronomer {{to support the}} concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. <b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Andromeda Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states {{that there were}} hundreds of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud.|$|E

50|$|Another {{approach}} {{to find a}} point within the triangle, from where sum of <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vertices of triangle is minimum, is {{to use one of}} the optimization (mathematics) methods.

5|$|The plateau {{camp was}} {{permanently}} manned by the US Marines during 1967, when they established an outpost {{next to the}} airstrip.

The Marines' defensive system stretched below the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from the coast, along Route 9, to Khe Sanh. During 1966 the regular Special Forces troops had moved off the plateau and built a smaller camp down Route 9 at Lang Vei, about half <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Laotian border.|$|E
5|$|The tidal {{acceleration}} of the Moon slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the Earth-Moon distance. Friction effects—between the core and mantle and between the atmosphere and surface—can dissipate the Earth's rotational energy. These combined effects are expected to increase {{the length of the}} day by more than 1.5hours over the next 250 million years, and to increase the obliquity by about a half degree. <b>The</b> <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon will increase by about 1.5 Earth radii during the same period.|$|E
5|$|While Voyager 1 is {{commonly}} spoken of as having left the Solar System simultaneously with having left the heliosphere, {{the two are}} not the same.
