5|$|In the {{preparation}} for possible entry into World War II, the Turkish government introduced a tax, the Varlık Vergisi, which disproportionately targeted Turkey's non-Muslim residents.

In addition, the law allowed authorities to confiscate the property of any relative of a taxed person in order to pay the tax. From this tax, the Turkish government collected 314,900,000 liras or about US$270 million (80% of the state budget) from the confiscation of non-Muslim assets.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} revenue and base effects of local {{property}} and business <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> using a natural {{experiment in the}} German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). Due to a reform of the local equalization scheme in 2003, a set of municipalities in NRW increased their local tax rates by one to two percentage points while the remaining municipalities kept their rates constant. Using this variation across municipalities and over time to implement a difference-in-differences design covering the period 1995 - 2010, I find that property <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> have a revenue elasticity of unity and no adverse base effects. Business <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> have no discernible base effects but also no statistically significant effect on revenues. Furthermore, {{the results suggest that}} the <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> have no effect on broader economic outcomes such as local employment, firms 4 wage bill, and property prices. Overall, increasing local tax rates by one to two percentage points does not seem to affect the local economy adversely...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{economic}} malaise, {{state and local}} gov-ernments in the Seventh Dis-trict largely avoided drastic <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> and spending cuts. Instead, governments have drawn down their reserves, trimmed spending, and deferred pay-ment of bills {{in the hopes that}} robust economic recovery will make <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> unnecessary. The same strategy was attempted during the re-gion's economic troubles of the early 1980 s, and it is a common strategy for state and local governments during a contractionary period. Nevertheless, this strategy failed District gov-ernments in the early 1980 s when major <b>tax</b> rate <b>hikes</b> ultimately became necessary and were subsequently implemented after the U.

This time around, owing to the extended economic weakness, the history of the early 1980 s may repeat itself in the form of severe belt tightening and significant <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> during fiscal years 1992 and 1993. In this article we examine the behavior of the state and local sector during the business cycle, paying particular attention to those dis-cretionary actions such as <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> and spend-ing cuts that are typically taken by state and local government to maintain fiscal balance in response to business contractions.

After cross-examining and talking to village representatives, emphasising the potential hardship and need for non-violence and cohesion, Patel initiated the struggle with a complete denial of taxes. Patel organised volunteers, camps, and an information network across affected areas. The revenue refusal was stronger than in Kheda, and many sympathy satyagrahas were undertaken across Gujarat. Despite arrests and seizures of property and land, the struggle intensified. The situation came to a head in August, when, through sympathetic intermediaries, he negotiated a settlement that included repealing the <b>tax</b> <b>hike,</b> reinstating village officials who had resigned in protest, and returning seized property and land. It was during the struggle and after the victory in Bardoli that Patel was increasingly addressed by his colleagues and followers as Sardar.|$|E

Results demonstrate that a one-cent <b>hike</b> in <b>taxes</b> increases retail prices of name-brand and generic cigarettes by exactly one cent.

Inflation decreased significantly, falling from 13.6% in 1980 to 4.1% by 1988, and 16 million new jobs were created. The net effect of all Reagan-era tax bills resulted in a 1% decrease of government revenues (as a percentage of GDP), with the revenue-shrinking effects of the 1981 tax cut (-3% of GDP) and the revenue-gaining effects of the 1982 <b>tax</b> <b>hike</b> (~+1% of GDP), while subsequent bills were more revenue-neutral.

40|$|What are the {{macroeconomic}} {{effects of}} tax adjustments {{in response to}} large public debt shocks in highly integrated economies? The answer from standard closed-economy models is deceptive, because they underestimate the elasticity of capital tax revenues and ignore crosscountry spillovers of tax changes. Instead, we examine this issue using a two-country model that matches the observed elasticity of the capital tax base by introducing endogenous capacity utilization and a partial depreciation allowance. <b>Tax</b> <b>hikes</b> have adverse effects on macro aggregates and welfare, and trigger strong cross-country externalities. Quantitative analysis calibrated to European data shows that unilateral capital tax increases cannot restore fiscal solvency, because the dynamic Laffer curve peaks below the required revenue increase. Unilateral labor <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> can do it, but have negative output and welfare effects at home and raise welfare and output abroad. Large spillovers also imply that unilateral capital <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> are much less costly under autarky than under free trade. Allowing for one-shot Nash tax competition, the model predicts a "race to the bottom" in capital taxes and higher labor taxes. The cooperative equilibrium is preferable, but capital (labor) taxes are still lower (higher) than initially. Moreover, autarky can produce higher welfare than both Nash and Cooperative equilibria...|$|R

40|$|Cross-country {{evidence}} {{highlights the}} importance of tax evasion and corruption in determining the size of fiscal multipliers. We introduce these two features in a New Keynesian model and revisit the effects of fiscal consolidations. VAR evidence for Italy suggests that spending cuts reduce tax evasion, while <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> increase it. In the model, spending cuts induce a reallocation of production towards the formal sector, thus reducing <b>tax</b> evasion. <b>Tax</b> <b>hikes</b> increase the incentives to produce in the less productive shadow sector, implying higher output and unemployment losses. Corruption further amplifies these losses by requiring larger <b>hikes</b> in <b>taxes</b> to reduce debt. We use the model to assess the recent fiscal consolidation plans in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Our results corroborate the evidence of increasing levels of tax evasion during these consolidations and point to significant output and welfare losses, which could be reduced substantially by combating tax evasion and corruption. •We show that tax evasion and corruption matter for the size of fiscal multipliers. •Evidence suggests that spending cuts reduce tax evasion, and <b>tax</b> <b>hikes</b> increase it. •We replicate these findings in a DSGE model with tax evasion and corruption. •We assess the recent fiscal consolidation plans in Southern European countries. •Our simulations show a rise in tax evasion, and large output and welfare losses...|$|R
