The objectives were to construct a <b>Taiwan</b> Frailty <b>Index</b> to predict mortality risk, and to explore the structure of its factors. Analytic data on 1, 284 participants aged 53 and older were excerpted from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (2006), in Taiwan. A consensus workgroup of geriatricians selected 159 items according to the standard procedure for creating a Frailty Index. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to explore the association between the <b>Taiwan</b> Frailty <b>Index</b> and mortality. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify structure factors and produce a shorter version-the <b>Taiwan</b> Frailty <b>Index</b> Short-Form. During an average follow-up of 4. 3 ± 0. 8 years, 140 (11 %) subjects died.

This research tries to find the preferences of individual investors in choosing investing targets, and examines if <b>Taiwan</b> Stock <b>Index</b> Futures which individual investors prefer to trade could be the indicator which forecasts the trend of <b>Taiwan</b> Stock <b>Index.</b> Finally, this research examines how successive trading behavior of foreign investors affects trading strategies of individual investors.

40|$|On 18 April 2011, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) {{introduced}} co-location {{services to}} its equities and derivatives markets. This infrastructural improvement {{was part of}} a 250 million initiative aimed at improving the speed of market access and promoting high frequency trading (HFT). Using intraday data, the impact that this microstructure change has on the market quality and the level of high frequency trading of SGX’s equity-index futures exchange are assessed. This thesis also examines whether structural improvements on offshore markets are beneficial or detrimental to home markets. Increases in the pervasiveness of high frequency trading (HFT) are observed for the Nikkei 225 and MSCI <b>Taiwan</b> <b>index</b> futures contracts. HFT levels in the CNX Nifty and the FTSE China A 50 index futures contracts, however, decline following the infrastructural change. The results suggest that co-location services attract more trading interest from high frequency traders on dual-listed stock index futures exchanges if there are cross-border profit opportunities. This conjecture is supported by the empirical evidence that suggests that HFT trading takes place across borders. An increase in high frequency trading activity on the alternative venue is shown to increase high frequency trading on Singapore’s equity-index futures exchange. The impacts co-location services have on the qualities of the Nikkei 225 and the MSCI <b>Taiwan</b> <b>index</b> futures markedly differ. Co-location services generate more trading activity, improve the liquidity and ease the volatility of the Nikkei 225 index futures market. The quality of the MSCI <b>Taiwan</b> <b>index</b> futures market, however, deteriorates as evident by the decrease in trading activity, decline in liquidity and increase in price volatility. The results suggest that the Nikkei 225 index futures market is characterised by liquidity-supplying passive HFTs while the MSCI <b>Taiwan</b> <b>index</b> futures market is characterised by liquidity-demanding active HFTs...|$|E

The empirical results show that, after the removal of this price restriction, no significant cumulative abnormal return has been found, while the volatilities of those component stocks have increased significantly. Moreover, stocks with a lower percentage of margin transactions experience higher volatility. To reduce the possible impact on volatility, the authorities may take the activity of margin transactions into account when considering whether to apply this policy to more stocks in the future.

First, we fit the annual maximum daily {{rainfall}} data for 6 rainfall stations, both with stationary and non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) distributions for the periods 1911 - 2010 and 1960 - 2010 in Taiwan, and detect changes {{between the two}} phases for extreme rainfall. The non-stationary model means that the location parameter in the GEV distribution is a linear function of time to detect temporal trends in maximum rainfall. Second, we compute the future behavior of stationary models for the return levels of 10, 20, 50 and 100 -years based on the period 1960 - 2010.
