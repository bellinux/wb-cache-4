50|$|In Hindi, nouns have gender—they {{are either}} {{masculine}} or feminine. Both {{masculine and feminine}} nouns are divided further into two categories. For masculine nouns, there are nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -a and nouns <b>that</b> don't <b>end</b> in -a. Those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -a are considered marked, while those that don't are unmarked. Similarly, for feminine nouns there are those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -i {{and those that do}} not. All feminine nouns <b>that</b> don't <b>end</b> in the vowel -i are unmarked. These all have different declension (or inflectional morphology based on their gender, plurality, and case).|$|R
50|$|Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -ius, {{instead of}} the {{expected}} -ie end with -ī. Thus, Julius becomes Julī and filius becomes filī. The shortening does not shift the accent so the vocative of Vergilius is Vergilī, with accent on the second syllable {{even though it is}} short. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -aius and -eius have vocatives <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -aī or -eī even though the i in the nominative is consonantal.|$|R
5|$|After {{a pair of}} Tiger {{possessions}} <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> with punts and an Alabama possession <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> with a lost fumble by McCarron, the Crimson Tide {{started their}} fourth scoring drive of the afternoon. The drive began with a 22-yard McCarron pass to Christion Jones and finished with a 15-yard Yeldon touchdown run. Immediately after Yeldon scored, the referees stopped the game temporarily and cleared the field due to lightning strikes {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the stadium. After a 40-minute stoppage, the game resumed with a Jeremy Shelley extra point and a Crimson Tide lead of 28–0. Missouri responded on the kickoff that ensued with their only touchdown of the afternoon on a 98-yard Marcus Murphy return that made the halftime score 28–7.|$|E

5|$|Realizing Calgary's {{path to the}} Stanley Cup {{would go}} through Edmonton, coach Bob Johnson devised a seven-point plan for beating the Oilers that focused on {{limiting}} Wayne Gretzky, Paul Coffey and Jari Kurri's creativity, limiting access {{to the left side}} of the ice where the Oilers' top stars liked to skate, leaving their physical players on the ice by not engaging them and utilizing Neil Sheehy and Colin Patterson in roles designed to frustrate the Oiler players. Johnson first utilized the strategy in a late season game <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> in a 4–4 tie. The Flames then defeated the Oilers 9–3 in their final regular season meeting, a game <b>that</b> <b>ended</b> with another brawl and accusations by both teams that the other was sending their goons out after talented players.|$|E

5000|$|In modern Bulgarian, definiteness is {{expressed}} by a definite article which is postfixed to the noun, much {{like in the}} Scandinavian languages or Romanian (indefinite: човек, person; definite: човекът, [...] "the person") or to the first nominal constituent of definite noun phrases (indefinite: добър човек, a good person; definite: добрият човек, [...] "the good person"). There are four singular definite articles. Again, the choice between them is largely determined by the nouns ending in the singular. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in a consonant and are masculine use -ът/-ят, when they are grammatical subjects, and -а/-я elsewhere. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in a consonant and are feminine, as well as nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -а/-я (most of which are feminine, too) use -та. Nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -е/-о use -то.|$|R

50|$|Most {{feminine}} nouns end in -η -i, -α -a and -ος -os. Those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -i {{and many}} <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -a {{stem from the}} ancient first declension and have the accent on the ultimate syllable in genitive plural. The rest of those <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -a originate from the ancient third declension and have formed their nominative singular from the ancient accusative singular; those nouns keep the accent unchanged in genitive plural. The nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -os are identical to the respective masculine nouns. Finally, many feminine nouns <b>that</b> <b>end</b> in -η (-i) correspond to Ancient Greek nouns in -ις (-is), which are still used as learned forms in formal contexts. Their singular forms have been adapted {{to the rest of}} the feminine nouns, while their plural forms have retained the ancient pattern in -εις (-eis). The forms of the genitive singular -εως (-eos) are also found as a stylistic variant and they are fully acceptable, and in fact are more commonly used than the old-style nominative singular form.|$|R

Arkansas responded with their longest drive of the game; however, it ended when Deion Belue forced a Knile Davis fumble that was recovered by Nick Perry at the Alabama 20-yard line.
