25|$|Holders of Travelcards can add pay {{as you go}} credit {{on their}} Oyster cards. This credit is used as '{{extension}} fare' when the Oyster user travels beyond the zones in which their Travelcard is valid. This extension fare equals the regular Oyster fare for a journey from/to the respective station outside of the validity area of the Travelcard to/from the closest zone still covered by the Travelcard. To distinguish between Peak and Off-Peak fares, however, {{the start of the}} journey is taken into account. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> traveller might be charged the (more expensive) peak fare as extension fare even if they had not yet left the area of validity of their Travelcard by the end of peak time. Conversely, however, a journey starting in the covered zones shortly {{before the start of the}} peak time will be charged as off-peak.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the {{proliferation}} of freesheet newspapers continues to escalate, {{the impact on the}} environment is fast becoming a major concern to many environmentalists. Over 44 million editions are being produced every day worldwide; it takes 12 established trees to make one tonne of newsprint, which is enough to print 14,000 editions of an average-size tabloid. <b>That</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> daily usage of newsprint of a little over 3,142 tonnes. Which, in turn, means the felling of 37,714 trees. On average around 70% of paper used by the newspaper industry is claimed to be recycled. So after recycled paper usage, over 11,314 trees are being felled daily to feed the freesheet print presses in over 58 countries. Also, whilst the increased use of recycled paper is welcomed by many, the extensive bleaching (especially use of chlorine) and other chemical processes to make reclaimed paper blank again for reuse are not lessening the concerns of environmentalists.|$|E

Tagg Romney, eldest son of 2012 Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, tweeted disgust for the mention, calling Mad Men the [...] "lib media", and accused the series of mocking his grandfather. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the dig at Romney was based in historical fact, with the Francis character working for John Lindsay, who had actual disdain for Romney. The Reporter also noted that, [...] "Mad Mens formula for success comes from its careful duality: it revels in pinpoint accurate details from its 1960s setting, while playing with themes that are timeless.

500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} supervisor, Andrew Orloff of Zoic Studios {{tried to make}} the {{parasitic}} worms look as real as possible. He explained, [...] "...we just don't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect. One of the big effects, like the parasite that crawls out of the guy's mouth, are interacting with actor's performances and they're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest." [...] Orloff continued, [...] "And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points, and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry. So we're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible, so <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>a</b> lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible." ...|$|E
