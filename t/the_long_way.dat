5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Round team reunited in 2007 {{for another}} {{motorcycle}} trip from John o' Groats in Scotland to Cape Town in South Africa. The journey, entitled Long Way Down, lasted from 12 May until 5 August 2007. McGregor's brother Colin joined the motorcycle team {{during the early}} stages of <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Down journey, and his father Jim also rode on sections of both Long Way Round and Long Way Down.|$|E
5|$|McGregor is {{involved}} in charity work, including UNICEF UK since 2004 and GO Campaign. During <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Round journey in 2004, McGregor and his travelling companions saw some of UNICEF's work in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, and during <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> Down trip in 2007, he and Charley Boorman did some work for UNICEF in Africa. McGregor hosted the annual Hollywood gala for the GO Campaign in 2009 and 2010. He {{has worked with the}} Children's Hospice Association Scotland, as featured in Long Way Down. In 2012, he travelled with UNICEF immunization workers to remote parts of India, Nepal and the Republic of Congo for a BBC2 documentary entitled Ewan McGregor: Cold Chain Mission.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, Arnold {{asked for}} Kenney to return Wilson {{to work on}} his own staff. Wilson took <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> back, visiting the other war theatres in India, China, the Middle East, Italy and England. Wilson found the Army Air Forces Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Barney Giles anxious for Wilson's return so Giles could pay a visit to the war theatres. Wilson {{therefore}} found himself acting chief of staff. On Giles' return, Wilson became Assistant Chief of Staff, Organization, Commitments and Requirements. In February 1945, Wilson was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an official Army Air Forces observer. He was promoted to major general on 17 March 1945.|$|E

In the next match, a 2–1 loss to Germany, he hopped over the advertising boards and walked <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> round after being subbed off for Dirk Kuyt because he thought he could have inspired the Netherlands to a win. After a 2–1 loss to Portugal, the Netherlands were knocked out with three straight defeats.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{iron ore}} {{is high in}} {{phosphorus}} {{and needs to be}} mixed with purer ores, such as those on the west coast in Cumberland and Lancashire. In the early 1850s this ore was travelling <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> round over the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway to the Barrow-in-Furness area, and Durham coke was returning. Both the South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway (SD) and the Eden Valley Railway (EVR) companies were formed on 20 September 1856. Taking advantage of the new railway at Barnard Castle, the SD crossed the Pennines via Kirkby Stephen to meet the West Coast Main Line (WCML) at Tebay, on the section then controlled by the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway, and also linked Barnard Castle with West Auckland. The EVR was a branch from Kirkby Stephen to the WCML near Penrith via Appleby. The routes were surveyed by Thomas Bouch and SD received permission on 13 July 1857. The EVR route followed the east bank of the River Eden, a mile longer than a more expensive route on the west bank, and its Act received royal assent on 21 May 1858.|$|E

25|$|Saving Hope was {{published}} by Masaa Publishing & Distribution in Bahrain and Kuwait in 2013, with the subtitle, <b>The</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> to the Arab Spring.

The cover of the 314 pages book showed a Tunisian woman waving the V sign. The book has received favorable reviews in various media outlets.|$|E

25|$|Female {{artists such}} as Reba McEntire, Patty Loveless, Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Deana Carter, LeAnn Rimes, Mindy McCready, Lorrie Morgan, Shania Twain, and Mary Chapin Carpenter all {{released}} platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. The Dixie Chicks {{became one of the}} most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album Wide Open Spaces went on to become certified 12x platinum while their 1999 album Fly went on to become 10x platinum. After their third album, Home, was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer Natalie Maines's comments disparaging then-President George W. Bush while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the Iraq War a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's Taking <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way,</b> took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall but largely ignored among country audiences. After Taking <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way,</b> the band broke up for a decade (with two of its members continuing as the Court Yard Hounds) before embarking on a reunion tour in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The Shanyang Canal {{originally}} {{opened onto}} the Yangtze {{a short distance}} south of Yangzhou. As {{the north shore of}} the Yangtze gradually silted up to create the sandbank island of Guazhou, it became necessary for boats crossing to and from the Jiangnan Canal to sail <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> around the eastern edge of that island. After a particularly rough crossing of the Yangtze from Zhenjiang, the local prefect realised that a canal dug directly across Guazhou would slash the journey time and so make the crossing safer. The Yilou Canal was opened in 738 AD and still exists, though not as part of the modern Grand Canal route.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{problems}} with this system, relating {{to the fact that}} {{a large proportion of the}} seamen did not live anywhere near the largest naval ports of Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Karlskrona. Many seamen had their crofts along the coast of Norrland and Finland, and thus had several hundred kilometres to travel when called into service. Originally, the seamen had to walk <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to the nearest port; later, they were transported by horse and carriage. Even the latter method of transport, however, took a long time, and soon the state began to provide tools and materials, excepting the actual timber, to the rote so that the farmers could build a large rowing/sailing boat called a lodja. These boats could transport up to 25 men, and could ease the transport to the naval ports.|$|E

500|$|Douglas Jackson Brooks (born June 19, 1956), known professionally as Doug Stone, is an American {{country music}} singer. He debuted in 1990 {{with the single}} [...] "I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box)", the first release from his 1990 self-titled debut album for Epic Records. Both this album and its successor, 1991's I Thought It Was You, earned a {{platinum}} certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Two more albums for Epic, 1992's From the Heart and 1994's More Love, are each certified gold. Stone moved to Columbia Records to record Faith in Me, Faith in You, which did not produce a Top Ten among its three singles. After suffering {{a heart attack and}} stroke in the late 1990s, he exited the label and did not release another album until Make Up in Love in 1999 on Atlantic Records. <b>The</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Way</b> was released in 2002 on the Audium label (now part of E1 Music), followed by two albums on the independent Lofton Creek Records.|$|E

500|$|In contrast, {{historian}} Toh Boon Kwan argues {{at length}} {{the cause of}} the Indonesians, asserting that their claim to victory is equally as valid, if not more than that of the British. He states that British policy makers, in their relief at being let out of the spiral towards war, had forgotten that the Lombok Strait was militarily advantageous to Indonesia, as Indonesian warships could screen the task force easily from a nearby naval base. Symbolically, too, the forcing of ships of the vaunted Royal Navy to take <b>the</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> around their territory can be regarded as a major diplomatic success. Indonesian politicians gained strength from the Crisis, now believing that they could go toe-to-toe with 'Imperialists' and survive [...] "brushes with danger." [...] This, acknowledged Boon Kwan, oddly contrasts with the defeatist views of the army, who were irritated at how close they had come to war, and who in any case carried out the policies of the Confrontation with little relish. It was the army, he asserts, that sent the peace initiatives to the Tunku in September.|$|E
