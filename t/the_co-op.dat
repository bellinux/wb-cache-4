5|$|Reviewers praised <b>the</b> <b>co-op</b> mode highly {{but many}} disliked the single-player mode. Danielle Riendeau (Polygon) liked Monacos {{gameplay}} stating {{that it was}} fun with other people, but {{it seemed that the}} single-player mode needed work. James Murff (GameFront) said <b>the</b> <b>co-op</b> was ridiculously fun and has good replayability. Marty Sliva (IGN) said that Monaco provided one of the best co-op experiences he'd had in a while. He stated that due to the gameplay and mechanics, {{it was one of the}} most unique and addictive games released in 2013. Scott Nichols (Digital Spy) said that the game contains lots to discover, but is best done cooperatively. Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat) praised the fact that the game works as both an arcade and a strategic game but said to skip it if the user wasn't planning on playing it cooperatively. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) liked the multiplayer mode more, but also praised the single-player mode calling it surprisingly compelling.|$|E

5|$|On leaving {{school in}} 1934, the 14-year-old Ramsey {{tried to get}} a job at the Ford plant, then told his family he {{intended}} to become a greengrocer. To that end he became an apprentice at a local branch of <b>the</b> <b>Co-op,</b> delivering groceries on a bicycle. The manual work helped to bulk up Ramsey's physique, but he found himself unable to play organised football because he had to work on Saturday afternoons. After a two-year hiatus, he returned to the game when he joined Five Elms, a newly formed amateur club whose matches on Thursdays fitted with his work schedule. About a year later, during the 1937–38 season, Ramsey was spotted by Ned Liddell, a scout from Portsmouth, then a well-established top-flight club. Liddell offered a contract as an amateur. Rather than signing on the spot, Ramsey asked to take the forms home to examine first; he signed them that night and sent them to Portsmouth by post. Much to Ramsey's disappointment, Portsmouth did not contact him again. He spent the next two years working at <b>the</b> <b>Co-op</b> while playing cricket in the summer and football in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The River Street Bakery, {{also in the}} Mill Works Building and {{now owned}} by <b>the</b> <b>Co-op,</b> claims to have the only {{wood-fired}} brick oven in commercial use in Washtenaw County.

To stretch the limited funds, the brick oven was built by hand in 1989. From the beginning, the Ypsilanti Food Co-op retailed the bread.|$|E

Davis reveals Maurice Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which would jeopardize the entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield's release {{on the condition that}} he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to <b>the</b> <b>Co-Op</b> and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable or unwilling to stay off the corner.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} stage of development, the game had no {{co-operative}} multiplayer mode; it focused on the story instead of the cyberpunk element. A year after development began, the game was sent for reworking because the studio thought they had not captured the essence of the Syndicate series. The team had little experience in making a co-operative games due to technological restraints, but decided to experiment with it. The internal reception of <b>the</b> <b>co-op</b> prototype was positive; testers said it fit with the canonical fiction of the franchise. The team had once worked on a competitive multiplayer mode for the game, but thought it was not original enough for inclusion. As the game lacked a cooperative multiplayer element, the developers abandoned the use of an online pass, unlike most EA games at that time.|$|E
5|$|EA debuted {{the game}} at the 2003 E3 event in May, announcing that {{compared}} to Two Towers, Return of the King had more playable characters, larger and less linear levels, multiple narrative paths, bigger and more intelligent bosses, interactive environments, and a co-op mode. Footage from the films and parts of Howard Shore's score would feature, {{and members of the}} film's cast would lend their voices and likenesses to the game. On 15 May, a playable demo was made available for the PS2, featuring the first Minas Tirith level along with a non-playable demo of <b>the</b> <b>co-op</b> gameplay in a customized level specifically designed for E3. EA also revealed they were working on having Gollum as a playable character, although this ultimately did not happen, except in the GBA version.|$|E
40|$|The Rwandan {{countryside}} {{is currently}} undergoing {{a process of}} rapid reform under ambitious government programs to modernize agriculture for participation in national and international markets. While the government asserts that it is pursuing pro-poor growth, many critics present significant evidence to the contrary. This thesis examines the use of farmers cooperatives within the ongoing government campaign of agricultural modernization, and it asks whether <b>the</b> <b>co-ops</b> themselves are sources of personal empowerment and material gain for the small producers. Adopting the “sceptical” post-development position advanced by Aram Ziai, the present research attempts to take a pragmatic look at {{the ways in which}} <b>the</b> <b>co-ops</b> meet or fail to meet the material and non-material needs of their members while appreciating that cultural preferences are heterogeneous and dynamic. While the use of farmers cooperatives appears appropriate for the Rwandan marshland, <b>the</b> <b>co-ops</b> examined very much fall short of the post-development social movement model...|$|R

After the PC issue was rectified, a further statement was published to alert customers that they could now use this type of gameplay. A day after <b>the</b> <b>co-op</b> issues with Star Trek were resolved, the Dead Island: Riptide problems were also corrected, with speculation by reviewers presuming that it was the same error in both games.|$|E
5|$|Journalists {{noted that}} many of the user reviews for Portal 2 on Metacritic evoked {{negative}} opinion of the game, believed to be tied to the minimal impact on Portal 2s release time. These users cited complaints about the game being too short (with some saying it is only four hours long), the existence of paid downloadable content at launch for some versions, and supposed evidence that the game on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X were ports of the console version. Journalists have defended Valve in these claims, countering that the game's length depends on the amount of immersion the player puts into the game, that the downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for <b>the</b> <b>co-op</b> mode, and that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac version do not suggest a simple console port.|$|E
