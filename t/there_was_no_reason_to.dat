5|$|In an {{interview}} Lidle gave {{about a month}} earlier, he stated {{he had been a}} pilot for seven months and had flown about 95 solo hours. The crash garnered extra attention because of superficial similarities to the September 11 attacks in New York City, which had occurred five years and one month earlier. U.S. officials said that NORAD scrambled fighter aircraft over numerous American and Canadian cities for Combat Air Patrol, and that U.S. President George W. Bush was informed about the situation, but that these were precautionary measures only. The FBI quickly announced <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suspect that the crash was an act of terrorism.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, David E. Hone and Thomas R. Holtz {{pointed out}} that (like other theropods) <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that the forelimbs of Baryonyx were able to pronate, and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for {{locomotion}} may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but {{if this was the}} norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to reach some kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.|$|E

5|$|In {{sentencing}} Lawrence, {{the judges}} {{found no evidence}} to support her claim that her life was threatened and although the prosecutors requested a lighter 20-year sentence due to her early cooperation with police, the judges sentenced her to life imprisonment. On the next day, the remaining three defendants, Chen, Nguyen and Norman, were sentenced to life imprisonment as well. On 24 January 2006, the prosecutors demanded the death penalty for Sukumaran, this being {{the first time that a}} demand of death was put forward for any of the Bali Nine. They told the Bali court that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> show any leniency to the 24-year-old, because he helped organize the heroin smuggling operation. The prosecutors also claim that it was Sukumaran who strapped heroin to the bodies of his fellow accused. Indonesian police identified Sukumaran as one of the main players, in what they said to be a major smuggling ring. On 26 January, it was also recommended that Andrew Chan receive the death penalty.|$|E
5|$|Much of Sibelius's reputation, {{during his}} {{lifetime}} and subsequently, derived from {{his work as a}} symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1903–1905 that the Barringer Crater was {{correctly}} identified as an impact crater, and it {{was not until}} as recently as 1963 that research by Eugene Merle Shoemaker conclusively proved this hypothesis. The findings of late 20th-century space exploration and the work of scientists such as Shoemaker demonstrated that impact cratering was by far the most widespread geological process at work on the Solar System's solid bodies. Every surveyed solid body in the Solar System was found to be cratered, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that the Earth had somehow escaped bombardment from space. In the last few decades of the 20th century, a large number of highly modified impact craters began to be identified. The first direct observation of a major impact event occurred in 1994: the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter.|$|E
25|$|The RUC {{was renamed}} and {{reformed}} as the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2001 under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. The RUC {{has been accused}} by republicans and Irish nationalists of one-sided policing and discrimination, as well as collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. Conversely, it was praised {{as one of the}} most professional policing operations in the world by British security forces. The allegations regarding collusion prompted several inquiries, the most recent of which was published by Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan. The report identified police, CID and Special Branch collusion with loyalist terrorists under 31 separate headings, in her report on the murder of Raymond McCord and other matters, but no member of the RUC has been charged or convicted of any criminal acts as a result of these inquiries. Ombudsman Dame Nuala O'Loan stated in her conclusions that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe the findings of the investigation were isolated incidents.|$|E
