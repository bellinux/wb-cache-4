They visited Moscow, Kiev, Tbilisi, Batumi and Stalingrad, some of the first Americans to visit many parts of the USSR since the communist revolution. Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, A Russian Journal, was illustrated with Capa's photos. In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.|$|E
25|$|Now {{with seven}} minutes {{left in the}} game, Elway led the Broncos 71 yards in nine plays, {{including}} a 36-yard completion to Jackson and a 15-yarder to Ricky Nattiel. Bratton finished the drive with his second 1-yard touchdown of the game, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> 2:27 left. This time, the Steelers had no ability to respond. On first down of their ensuring possession, Brister fired a pass to a wide open Stock, but he tried to turn upfield before securing the catch and it fell to the turf incomplete. Then after another incompletion, Brister fumbled a low snap from backup center Chuck Lanza (filling in for injured All-Pro center Dermontti Dawson) in shotgun formation, and Broncos safety Randy Robbins recovered the ball to secure the win.|$|E

But the most meritorious distinguishing feature of the Manual is the large collection of illustrative games by various first-class masters, and in that respect Mr Gossip's work stands second only to Signor Salvioli's Teoria e Pratica among the analytical works in any language." [...] The following year, Steinitz cited it in The Modern Chess Instructor {{as one of the}} 12 principal authorities he had relied on in writing that treatise.|$|E
500|$|In February–early March 1945, Massachusetts {{provided}} anti-aircraft {{cover for}} airborne raids on Honshū, Iwo Jima and Kyushu. On 24 March, the ship bombarded Okinawa; {{for the remainder}} of that month and a majority of April, Massachusetts once again provided anti-aircraft defense, this time for Allied ships massed near Okinawa. On 5 June, she suffered through another typhoon, Louise, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> [...] winds. Five days later, she bombarded Minamidaitō. 1 July saw the Third Fleet and Massachusetts set course for Japan; the battleship protected carriers while they launched raids on Tokyo, then moved closer to land to hit targets with gunfire. Massachusetts attacked Japan's second largest iron and steel center, Kamaishi on Honshū, on 14 July; Hamamatsu on 28 July; and Kamaishi on 9 August. The latter bombardment was probably the last 16-inch shell fired during World War II.|$|E

500|$|In July 1993, the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff-bound Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and José Herrera. He {{performed}} disappointingly for the Jays, hitting only [...]215 in 44 games, {{which was}} {{probably due to the}} fact that he fractured a bone on his hand early on with the team, after being hit by a pitch, although he still contributed 22 stolen bases and 37 runs scored. [...] However, his hitting woes continued in the post-season, batting [...]120 in the American League Championship Series and [...]227 in the World Series. [...] Nevertheless, Henderson was involved in the final play of the World Series that year in one fashion for which he was most known, as he and Paul Molitor scored on Joe Carter's Series-ending home run. After winning his second World Series ring, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> Toronto, he re-signed as a free agent with Oakland in December 1993.|$|E
500|$|The {{libretto}} {{was written}} by Christian Friedrich Henrici, better known as Picander, Bach began {{to work with him}} in 1725, and they collaborated notably on the major St Matthew Passion. Picander wrote his cantata texts, including <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>with</b> Bach as the composer in mind. The poet included as the first movement two verses from a psalm (...) and as the closing chorale the third stanza of Martin Schalling's hymn [...] "". The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that battle scenes were often depicted in art and music. In the opening lines taken from a psalm, the battle of Michael against Satan is already won. Satan is mentioned only in the first movement. A focus of the later sequence of alternating arias and recitatives is on guardian angels seen as [...] "holy watchmen". The libretto was published in the 1728/29 year of his collection [...] They appeared in quarterly volumes to help the congregation following the text.|$|E

Cena eventually won {{the championship}} back in a match and arena of Edge's choice: a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match at Unforgiven at the Air Canada Centre in Edge's hometown of Toronto, Ontario, Canada after performing the FU on Edge through two tables off a ladder. The match had a stipulation that, had Cena lost, he would have left the Raw brand for SmackDown!. Cena returned his version of the spinner title belt on the next night's Raw.|$|E

In an expanded two-part structure, the organ is both an instrumental soloist in the two sinfonias and a partner for the singer in all three arias. The musicologist Laurence Dreyfus distinguished Bach's use of the organ as [...] "sacred icon" [...] versus [...] "galant conversationalist", writing on Bach's [...] "assimilation of the secular solo concerto into his church cantatas and his adjustment of the normal concerto principle, that of soloist-versus-orchestra, through subtle shifts in role playing, the instrument now posing as a soloist, now retreating into the background." ...|$|E

The original song would later {{appear on the}} Number Ones DVD, which contained previously unreleased [...] scenes. Furthermore, Paterson recorded an unreleased, alternate version of the music video, shot with an 8 mm camera. Writer David Noh, described it as, [...] "grainy, overexposed, and sexy as shit". According to Paterson, [...] "Michael loved it, but Sony hated it and refused to release it". The New York Times described the United States promotional effort for the Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix campaign as [...] "subdued", creating [...] "hardly a sound" [...] and [...] "perplexing to {{many people in the}} industry". Jackson's label Epic Records, refuted allegations they were not promoting the album sufficiently, saying, [...] "We are completely behind the album... Michael is certainly one of our superstars and is treated as such... We just went into <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> our global hats on". The New York Times acknowledged that promotion was stronger internationally, where Jackson had more commercial force and popularity.|$|E
500|$|Julia Ward AOL's TV Squad {{said that}} while the episode [...] "delivered plenty of funny" [...] it [...] "seemed a bit off-kilter. It had fewer laughs-per-minute than the past few episodes, and structurally, I think the writers couldn't decide which story to foreground." [...] She complimented the series for having [...] "an {{interesting}} take" [...] on the hip-hop satire that was featured in [...] "The Source Awards". [...] "From where I sit, it's got to be in the top five, if not three", said TV Guides Matt Mitovich in regards to this episode. Mitovich noted, [...] "...I can only bow with great reverence to the effort that goes into 30 Rock, where in an episode like this week's, every other line is funny and/or fantastically absurd." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning opined than an episode like <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>with</b> its guest stars and taking on the issue of race, got [...] "some decent laughs", though it [...] "failed to produce a solid half hour." [...] Canning disliked LL Cool J's guest spot, observing that it was [...] "nothing more than a generic caricature put in the role of a sub-par straight man", but enjoyed Wayne Brady's, as he was [...] "a successful part of the episode's best storyline." [...] Canning said that Tracy as Oprah was [...] "more weird than funny, unfortunately", but liked that Jason Sudeikis made a brief appearance as [...] "Flower Guy" [...] in the episode. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. Mekeisha Madden Toby for The Detroit News found the episode a [...] "side-splitter".|$|E

Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson, called it {{one of her favorite}} The Simpsons episodes, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute". The Toronto Suns Bruce Kirkland wrote that [...] "Bart the Mother" [...] was one of the [...] "classic episodes" [...] of the series' tenth season. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood wrote, [...] "We particularly like the moral dilemma at the end, as underlined by Lisa, regarding the eventual culling of the lizards that will need to take place. A good romp, <b>this</b> <b>one,</b> <b>with</b> some nice laughs at Homer's expense." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said, [...] "The show generates decent heart as it shows Bart’s attempts to make up for his misbehavior. The show becomes reasonably enjoyable if not especially memorable." [...] Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters named the tenth season of The Simpsons the series' [...] "first significant dip in quality, a step away from its golden era [...] with broader gags and more outlandish plots". However, Hassenger enjoyed [...] "Bart the Mother", and wrote, [...] " [...] explores the show’s sweet and dark sides simultaneously as Bart, remorseful after killing a bird, tries to care for orphaned eggs that turn out to hold ravenous lizards." [...] DVD Town's James Plath described [...] "Bart the Mother" [...] as an episode that viewers would either love or hate, because of Bart's rare moments of soul searching, and he found the episode to be a memorable one.|$|E

The exterior of the cave scene was filmed at the Cliffs of Moher in the west of Ireland, the only location to be filmed outside of the United Kingdom throughout the film series. The interior of the cave is made up of geometric crystal formations. Craig noted [...] "Apart from the point at which Harry and Dumbledore first arrive and the island formation on which everything inside the cave happens, the set is entirely virtual, designed in the computer.
