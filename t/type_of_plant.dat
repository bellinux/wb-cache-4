5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|The {{river is}} nutrient-poor and acidic (pH 4.33) which determines the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> life found there. Mosses and liverworts {{are the most}} common. Near the source {{compressed}} flapwort (Nardia compressa) and green algae are the most dominant species. Closer to the mouth water earwort (Scapania undulata), feather moss and bulbous rush (Juncus bulbosus) are also found. Holt's mouse-tail moss (Isothecium holtii) is very common on the banks; the Shimna River {{is one of only}} three known sites for this species in Northern Ireland. It is also the only known location in Northern Ireland where Portuguese feather-moss (Platyhypnidium alopecuroides) is found.|$|E
5|$|The process {{involves}} procedurally-generated {{basic elements}} like elevation, rainfall, mineral distribution, drainage and temperature. For example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area {{would make a}} swamp. Areas are thus categorized into biomes, which have two variables: savagery and alignment. They have their own specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> and animal populations. The next phase is erosion—which the drainage simulates. Rivers are created by tracing their paths from the mountains (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an ocean; some form into lakes. The salinity field defines oceans, mangroves or alluvial plains. Names are generated for the biomes and rivers. The names depend on the area's good/evil variable (the alignment) and though in English, they are originally {{in one of the}} four in-game languages of dwarves, elves, humans and goblins; these are the four main races in any generated world.|$|E

25|$|One {{way that}} OTEC systems can avoid {{some of the}} {{problems}} and expenses of operating in a surf zone is by building them just offshore in waters ranging from 10 to 30 meters deep (Ocean Thermal Corporation 1984). This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> would use shorter (and therefore less costly) intake and discharge pipes, which would avoid the dangers of turbulent surf. The plant itself, however, would require protection from the marine environment, such as breakwaters and erosion-resistant foundations, and the plant output would need to be transmitted to shore.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of pottery {{allowed for the}} creation of fireproof cooking vessels in a variety of shapes and sizes.

The earthenware cookware could then be suspended over a fire through use of a tripod or other apparatus, or even be placed directly into a low fire or coal bed {{as in the case of}} the pipkin. Ceramics conduct heat poorly, however, so ceramic pots must cook over relatively low heats and over long periods of time. However, most ceramic pots will crack if used on the stovetop, and are only intended for the oven.|$|E

500|$|Trace {{elements}} {{involved in}} GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, vanadium, magnesium, copper, and zinc, {{may have been}} lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas. Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their selenoproteomes, whereas the selenoproteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that, {{with the exception of}} vertebrates, aquatic life supports selenium use, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element. Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 million years ago, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of [...] "new" [...] endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), polyphenols (including flavonoids), tocopherols, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in the last 50–200 million years, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants.

2500|$|Urticating hairs or urticating bristles, i.e. irritating hairs, {{are one of}} {{the primary}} defense {{mechanisms}} used by numerous plants, almost all New World tarantulas, and various lepidopteran caterpillars.

[...] This term also refers to certain types of barbed hairs that cover the dorsal and posterior surface of a tarantula's or caterpillar's abdomen. [...] Many tarantula species eject hairs from their abdomens, directing them toward potential attackers. [...] These hairs can embed themselves in the other animal's skin or eyes, causing physical irritation, usually to great discomfort.|$|E
2500|$|Waley {{suggests}} that Theravadins would take suukaramaddava (the {{contents of the}} Buddha's last meal), which can translate literally as pig-soft, to mean [...] "soft flesh of a pig" [...] or [...] "pig's soft-food", that is, after Neumann, a soft food favoured by pigs, {{assumed to be a}} truffle. He argues (also after Neumann) that as [...] "(p)lant names tend to be local and dialectical", as there are several plants known to have suukara- (pig) as part of their names, and as Pali Buddhism developed in an area remote from the Buddha's death, suukaramaddava could easily have been a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> whose local name was unknown to those in Pali regions. Specifically, local writers writing soon after the Buddha's death knew more about their flora than Theravadin commentator Buddhaghosa who lived hundreds of years and hundreds of kilometres remote in time and space from the events described. Unaware that {{it may have been a}} local plant name and with no Theravadin prohibition against eating animal flesh, Theravadins would not have questioned the Buddha eating meat and interpreted the term accordingly.|$|E
