2500|$|The plane, piloted by 65-year-old Luigi Fasulo, {{took off}} from Magadino Airport in Switzerland {{eighteen}} minutes before the crash. Later as the plane flew over Milan, Italy the pilot radioed to the control tower at Linate Airport {{that there was a}} problem with the retractable landing gear. The tower began arranging an emergency landing. Suddenly the pilot left, leaving another aircraft saying, [...] "No, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> to land, not me!". Minutes later, at 17:48 local time, the small plane crashed into the Pirelli Tower. The vibration of the crash caused shop windows to break and littered the surroundings with debris and glass. The pilot and two lawyers present inside the building died.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why {{they know}} all about this thing. Haven't <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain?" ...|$|E
60|$|Pala. But, who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> I was here? <b>they,</b> that <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that, {{may tell}} you more, for aught I know.|$|R
6000|$|... "You white-livered card-sharp! I've {{a notion}} to bore <b>you....</b> <b>They</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> {{had a deal}} of your own, an' now I believe it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{came last}} night and called this {{afternoon}} at your hotel. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> had come here, and I looked about for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It matters not," [...] {{returned}} Matcham. [...] "Since we be met, {{it matters}} not. But, Dick, are your eyes open? Have <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of to-morrow's doings?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I lay <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> a sight o' lies, then. I've been into England fur as Wiltsheer once. I was cheated proper over {{a pair of}} hedgin'-gloves,' said Hobden.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he sighed, [...] "that terrible Press of ours! <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> I suppose, that I was hard, unscrupulous, unforgiving, a money-making machine, and all {{the rest}} of it. Do you think that I look like that, Virginia?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You told me, Mysa," [...] Chebron began, [...] "that <b>they</b> had <b>told</b> <b>you</b> tales {{that our}} father was dead, {{and that it}} was I who killed Paucis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neale, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> gave up your work--were {{going to}} the bad," [...] she said, with an eloquence of {{distress}} changing her voice and expression.|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> {{had been}} to her, [...] And {{mentioned}} me to him: [...] She gave me a good character, [...] But said I could not swim.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{was very}} curious. I don't know what made me say it. Some whim, I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am sorry <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> about the man. It is a hideous subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Truly, I {{might be}} glad 'twas no court madam that stood by me when Berry was {{called back to}} the fight: and for the little one, 'tis the loveliest and bravest little maid I ever saw. Have <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of the marigolds, father?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is where}} I want to go." [...] Isaac Pludding {{glared at the}} students. [...] "I don't like to ride with those boys, but I suppose I can stand it. Got room for another passenger? I suppose <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how the train broke down." ...|$|E
60|$|Lau. <b>They,</b> who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so, were horribly mistaken. You {{shall be}} judge yourself, Violetta; for, to confess frankly to you, I {{have made him}} {{a kind of an}} appointment.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is always}} the same, sir," [...] was the quiet response. [...] "I suppose <b>they</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that {{grandfather}} is a madman? Our great trouble {{is well known in}} this neighborhood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>they</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that I am a mauvais sujet." [...] Gyp {{inclined}} her head. He {{looked at}} her steadily, and said: [...] "It is true. But I could be better--much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> true," [...] John Thornton answered. [...] "The bottom's {{likely to}} drop out at any moment. Only fools, with the blind luck of fools, could have made it. I tell you straight, I wouldn't risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in Alaska." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was unfortunate. I hope {{those who}} spoke to you of it, deceived you with no false hopes, for {{that would have been}} mere cruelty. Give me your hand, my love; I hope <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the truth. You know, dearest, do you not, that--that--that my wound is mortal?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Welcome, good Dromas, to our board. I was too sleepy to {{see much}} of you after your arrival last night. Mine eyes blinked like those of an owl. Kiss me, wife and daughter," [...] he added, giving the ladies a salute that resounded through the room. [...] "Have <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> yet about our poor son Bladud?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Julien, by all that's lucky!" [...] {{he called}} out. [...] "And I haven't been in Paris four hours! I called at your hotel and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> were out. Sit down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> {{had ordered}} your supper at six, so I told them I would take mine {{at the same}} time; and, indeed, I {{can tell you that}} I am ready for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> {{had even}} <b>told</b> me," [...] he said. [...] "You said I {{was never to}} try to look on your face again--and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> had gone away. You sent me back my ring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{seem to see}} a trick. Cousin Margaret, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> he was dead, {{did they}} not? And then that news came to {{us that he was}} not dead, only sick, and here. So the lie failed. Now they tell you, and seem to show you, that he is faithless. May not all this have been some part played for a purpose by the woman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{good news}} indeed," [...] Myra said. [...] "Valerie is a great friend of mine. Of course Louise is younger, but I was very fond of her too. The year before last I {{spent a couple of}} months with them at their plantation; and, as I daresay <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> they are always here for three or four months in the winter season." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't {{told me a}} {{word about}} Sis, nor any of them. Now I'll rest my works a little, and you start up yourn; just tell me EVERYTHING--tell me all about 'm all every one of 'm; and how they are, and what they're doing, and what <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> to tell me; and every last thing you can think of." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dor. My love, I'll try. [...] [She {{draws the}} chair nearer to the audience. [...] I thought you {{never would have}} walked again; [...] <b>They</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> were gone to heaven; [...] Have you been there? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've come {{straight}} here,' he said, in a dull, bewildered fashion. 'I went to your hotel, Susie, {{in the hope}} of finding you; but when <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> were out, I felt certain you would be here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly Gaspard cried out: 'My uncle!' And {{there was}} indeed my brother. 'Good heavens!' he cried, 'you there, sister! <b>They</b> <b>told</b> me <b>you</b> were gone to church, but I {{could hardly believe}} it! Come home before the mob comes back.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No; <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> other things,' she continued, still {{standing}} over him. 'They told you of quarrels with my husband. I know the lies, and who made them, and why. Did I conceal from you {{the character of}} my former husband? Did I not {{tell you that he}} was a drunkard and a scoundrel? How should I not quarrel with such a one? Ah, Paul; you can hardly know what my life has been.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{not enough}} of a coward. There is nothing cowardly about him. If Phineas Finn could have struck an enemy with a club, in a dark passage, behind his back, I will never care to speak to any man again. Nothing shall make me believe it. If I did, I could never again believe in any one. If <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that your husband had murdered a man, what would you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{point that}} has been much debated. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so in the Plains, did they not? Also the Tribes think it on the Mountain. Indeed, the thing seems reasonable, seeing {{that all of us}} who live are flesh and spirit. But you will form your own {{judgment}} and then we can discuss the matter. There, your arm is finished. Be careful now not to strike it or to fall, and look, your companion awakes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank you, Moses, I'm a prisoner. These are my guards. I {{wonder they}} have allowed me even to {{exchange}} {{a word with}} you. Must be quick. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> us <b>you</b> had been half-hanged till you were frightened to death." ...|$|R
