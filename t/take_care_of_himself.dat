25|$|In 1925 Astor Piazzolla {{moved with}} his family to Greenwich Village in New York City, which in those days was a violent {{neighbourhood}} inhabited by a volatile mixture of gangsters and hard-working immigrants. His parents worked long hours and Piazzolla soon learned to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> on the streets despite having a limp. At home he would listen to his father's records of the tango orchestras of Carlos Gardel and Julio de Caro, and was exposed to jazz and classical music, including Bach, from an early age. He began to play the bandoneon after his father spotted one in a New York pawn shop in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Steinbeck's {{characters}} are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish {{a sense of}} respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established {{as many of the}} ranch hands are victims of the Great Depression. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action- oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to generate enough money. Lennie {{is the only one who}} is basically unable to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> but the other characters would do this in the improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, the real danger of Lennie's mental handicap comes to the fore.|$|E

25|$|In 1712 Berkeley Codd, Esq. of Sussex County, Delaware disputed some of {{the rights}} of Penn's grant from the Duke of York. Some of William Penn's agents hired lawyer Andrew Hamilton to {{represent}} the Penn family in this replevin case. Hamilton's success led to an established relationship of good will between the Penn family and Andrew Hamilton. Penn had grown weary of the politicking back in Pennsylvania and the restlessness with his governance, but Logan implored him not to forsake his colony, for fear that Pennsylvania might {{fall into the hands of}} an opportunist who would undo all the good that had been accomplished. During his second attempt to sell Pennsylvania back to the Crown in 1712, Penn suffered a stroke. A second stroke several months later left him unable to speak or <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself.</b> He slowly lost his memory.|$|E
500|$|When Steven S. DeKnight {{was writing}} the episode [...] "Run" [...] {{for the first}} {{official}} appearance of Bart Allen, {{he knew he had}} to give the character certain characteristics that embodied his comic book counterpart. DeKnight knew Bart had faster than Clark, because in the comic, that is one advantage Flash has over Superman. DeKnight also featured Bart as a [...] "smart-ass", after being inspired by the sarcastic Flash that appears in the animated television series, Justice League. DeKnight's belief is that Bart enjoys his powers, and would not exhibit the more [...] "somber or serious" [...] characteristics of other character. As Gallner pointed out, Bart accepts who he is, and what he can do, and he even abuses his gifts somewhat. The difference between him and Clark is that Bart is not afraid to show the world what he can do. Gallner also suggested that in his character's initial appearance, Bart is living in a [...] "confused" [...] state, because he has developed these extraordinary powers, his parents do not accept him, and he ends up turning to thievery just to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Paltrow starred with Joaquin Phoenix in {{the romantic}} drama Two Lovers (2008), playing the {{beautiful}} but volatile new neighbor of a depressed bachelor. Two Lovers premiered in {{competition at the}} 2008 Cannes Film Festival in May, receiving largely positive reviews, especially for Phoenix and Paltrow's performances; Los Angeles Times felt that [...] "Phoenix is at his best with Paltrow's bruised sparrow of a girl; he's desperate {{to take care of}} her when he can't even <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself.</b> She is one of those actresses who understands the power of a look, and the one of regret and then resignation that overtakes her when Leonard professes his love is steeped in sadness". The film was an arthouse success, grossing US$16 million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} band began its first tour {{in support of}} the album, Smith wrote an open letter to fans {{regarding}} his abuse of alcohol and prescription medications since the recording of Pretty. Odd. Although Smith joined the band for the first handful of dates, he left the tour to [...] "continue fighting addiction". Urie posted on the band's official website on August 7, 2013, that [...] "It's become evident that Spencer still needs more time to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself.</b> I can't expect him to be fighting addiction one minute and be fully immersed in a national tour the next. With that said, the tour will continue without Spencer while he is away getting the help he needs." [...] Since Spencer's leave of absence, Dan Pawlovich of the band Valencia has filled in on tour.|$|E
2500|$|Gonzales {{was badly}} beaten {{in his first}} year on the {{professional}} tour, 96 matches to 27, by the reigning king of professional tennis, Jack Kramer. During this time, Gonzales's personality apparently changed from that of a friendly, happy-go-lucky youngster to the hard-bitten loner he became known as {{for the rest of his}} life. According to Kramer in his 1979 autobiography, [...] "The worst thing that ever happened to Gonzales was winning Forest Hills in 1949... At a time when Gorgo wasn't mature as a player he was pitted against Kramer, an established pro at his peak." [...] Moreover, says Kramer, [...] "Pancho had no idea how to live or <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself.</b> He was a hamburger-and-hot-dog guy to start with and had no concept of diet in training... On the court Gorgo would swig Cokes through a match... Also Gorgo was a pretty heavy cigarette smoker. He had terrible sleeping habits made even worse by the reality of a tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Caton {{awaited the}} arrival of the German Army, {{confident}} that the Germans were chivalrous enemies. He fled again, just before the area was engulfed. By November 1916 he was in Iași, Western Moldavia; a month later, he began a long journey to Paris, arriving there in 1917. In the French capital, he reunited with his writer friend Eftimiu, as another member of the isolated Romanian cell. In his 1965 recollections, Eftimiu claims that, while he had trouble making ends meet, Theodorian [...] "knew how to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> though not by hard work, nor by mental concentration." [...] According to Theodorian, however, his was [...] "no easy life". By 1918, living in the Latin Quarter with his family, he was working as a typist for the agency recording prisoners of war, and also making shells in a factory. Other sources indicate that he was also the press agent for the Romanian military attaché in France. He proposed to Eftimiu that they work together on a screenplay about the legendary Romanian ancestors of Pierre de Ronsard. The project was aborted when Eftimiu discovered that the necessitous Gaumont would not even hire him as an extra.|$|E
60|$|A {{stranger}} {{coming in}} one day at the dinner-hour, he ate up what was provided for both; saying afterwards, when told of it, that the gentleman should have <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself.</b> This does not look very polite; {{but of course it}} was said in jest. His son attributed this carelessness at table to absorption in his studies.|$|R
6000|$|What Mrs. Holiday {{was really}} {{laughing}} at was to hear Rollo talk about [...] "when {{he was a}} boy." [...] But the fact was, that Rollo had now travelled about so much, and <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> in so many exigencies, {{that he began to}} feel quite like a man. And indeed I do not think it at all surprising that he felt so.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Ferguson and {{the clerks}} had all come off with Gregory to the Simoon, on board {{which there was}} plenty of {{accommodation}} for them, as it was not one of the ships that had been taken up for the accommodation of the fugitives. Among the party who came on board was a doctor, who had taken part in the defence of the bank, and had attended to the wounded as the fight went on. He did so again that evening, and told Gregory that in a month he would, if he <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself,</b> be able to use his arm again.|$|R

50|$|The plot {{concerns}} twelve lazy servants who don't {{feel like}} working and instead boast about how lazy they are. Each one tells his story.

The second {{goes so far}} that he {{ignores the fact that}} he has to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> his master's horse, by simply claiming the animal has already eaten. The third servant once went to sleep in the sun and kept dreaming despite the fact that heavy rain suddenly came down and made a hole in his skull. The fourth servant claims he never starts quickly and always asks others to help him out. The fifth one only works one cart load a day.|$|R

In the offseason, Norris lives by choice in a 1978 Volkswagen Westfalia van, nicknamed [...] "Shaggy".

Prior to the 2015 season, Tony LaCava, Toronto's assistant general manager, said of Norris [...] "He <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>himself</b> as well as anybody we've got. He's in great shape. He competes on the mound. If that wasn't the case, maybe we'd be more worried {{about some of the other}} stuff. But right now, the van and all that is secondary.
