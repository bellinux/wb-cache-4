25|$|Birmingham Town Hall is the {{traditional}} home of the City Organist, and it was {{under one of the}} earliest City Organists, James Stimpson, that the popular weekly recitals began. So popular were <b>the</b> <b>recitals</b> that audiences of around 1,500 packed in every Monday evening in the 1840s.|$|E
25|$|Local kings often invited temple dancers {{to dance}} in their courts, the {{occurrence}} of which created a new category of dancers, rajadasis, and modified the technique and themes of <b>the</b> <b>recitals.</b> A devadasi had to satisfy her own soul while she danced unwatched and offered herself to the god, but the rajadasi's dance {{was meant to be}} an entertainment.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after her}} return to Britain early in June 1949, Ferrier left for Amsterdam where, on 14 July, she sang in {{the world premiere of}} Britten's Spring Symphony, with Eduard van Beinum and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Britten had written this work {{specifically}} for her. At the Edinburgh Festival in September she gave two recitals in which Bruno Walter acted as her piano accompanist. Ferrier felt that these recitals represented [...] "a peak to which I had been groping for the last three years". A broadcast of one of <b>the</b> <b>recitals</b> was issued on record many years later; of this, the critic Alan Blyth wrote: [...] "Walter's very personal and positive support obviously pushes Ferrier to give of her very best".|$|E

500|$|The ratio decidendi, {{or legal}} {{point in the}} case which {{determined}} the judgment, was a narrow one. The appeals were allowed {{on the ground that}} the Minister had not discharged the burden of proving the validity of the detention orders. Under section 8(1) of the ISA, the President's satisfaction that a person poses a national security risk is a condition precedent to the Minister's power to make a detention order. The Minister attempted to demonstrate that the President had been so satisfied before the detention order was made by pointing to the fact that <b>the</b> <b>recitals</b> in the detention orders stated that the President [...] "is satisfied", and by filing an affidavit by the Permanent Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs which asserted that the [...] "government" [...] was satisfied that the appellants were a danger to national security. However, the Court of Appeal found that this was inadmissible evidence as it amounted to hearsay. Furthermore, as regards the affidavit, the satisfaction of the Government was {{not the same as the}} President's satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|For {{the course}} of the war Myra Hess, and other musicians, such as Moura Lympany, gave daily lunch-time {{recitals}} in the empty building, to raise public morale at a time when every concert hall in London was closed. A number of art exhibitions were held at the Gallery as a complement to <b>the</b> <b>recitals.</b> The first of these was British Painting since Whistler in 1940, organised by Lillian Browse, who also mounted the major joint retrospective Exhibition of Paintings by Sir William Nicholson and Jack B. Yeats held from 1 January – 15 March 1942, which was seen by 10,518 visitors. Exhibitions of work by war artists, including Paul Nash, Henry Moore and Stanley Spencer, were also held; the War Artists' Advisory Committee had been set up by Clark in order [...] "to keep artists at work on any pretext". In 1941 a request from an artist to see Rembrandt's Portrait of Margaretha de Geer (a new acquisition) resulted in the [...] "Picture of the Month" [...] scheme, in which a single painting was removed from Manod and exhibited to the general public in the National Gallery each month. The art critic Herbert Read, writing that year, called the National Gallery [...] "a defiant outpost of culture right in the middle of a bombed and shattered metropolis". The paintings returned to Trafalgar Square in 1945.|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of Ragas musical soundtrack was recorded between April and July 1968. Aside from <b>the</b> <b>recitals</b> {{featured in the}} film, Shankar provided incidental music, the co-ordination of which was credited to his sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar (for pieces classed as [...] "East") and American musician Collin Walcott ("West"). Among the notable Indian musicians contributing to the soundtrack were Bismillah Khan (shehnai), Shivkumar Sharma (santoor), Hariprasad Chaurasia (bansuri), Aashish Khan (sarod), Shankar Ghosh and Zakir Hussain (both tabla), and singer Jitendra Abhisheki. For a scene that Shankar describes in Raga Mala as [...] "reflect all the distortions in that period – Indian music mixed up with rock, hippies and drugs", Walcott created a piece titled [...] "Frenzy and Distortion", using [...] "a profusion of electronic sounds".|$|E
2500|$|February {{continued}} the pace. She {{began a series}} before the new Chicago Culture Club at the Church of the Epiphany (Chicago), and {{less than a week}} later gave a talk on Hamlet, and then another for a benefit dinner. Just a few days later she gave a talk for the Menoken Club. She ended the Arché club series with a talk on [...] "Degas, Raffaelli, and their theories". There was an individual talk on March 10 on The Tempest, followed by a [...] "salon day" [...] for the Arché club. Then she announced another series of lectures and {{continued the}} individual talks. The first series of talks during some recitals at individual's homes on Bethoven, Wagner, and Schumann each a week apart in what is now the Prairie Avenue District. Meanwhile, she gave a talk on [...] "Shakespeare's women" [...] at the new YWCA in what is now the Historic Michigan Boulevard District, Then she lectured on the subject of [...] "American Colonists". A week later she was talking for the Arché club. The last few days of March she addressed and reviewed Chicago artists, in which she was quoted extensively for in a column in The Inter Ocean newspaper of Chicago. Papers also noted that by April the talks had outgrown the space of rooms in churches. Nevertheless, benefits were still held in churches, such as for the YWCA with a talk about John Ruskin, also a Spiritualist. Another publicized talk at a home was on [...] "French Women of the Salon". She made a trip outside Chicago to Sterling, IL for a talk the next day. But she was back in time to give a talk in a week, and in a few days was giving a new talk entitled [...] "Nibelungen Lied(sic)". In May she gave two lectures. A repeat of one of <b>the</b> <b>recitals</b> comes in early June, held at the Hotel Windermere (Chicago). In a new turn of events, Ford challenged the Inter Ocean art critic on the virtues of impressionism - the critic opens with a line from Ford's letter to her [...] "After having told the world what you see in Manet's pictures, don't you think you should do the graceful thing and tell what the artist sees?". Together they reviewed an exhibition, out of which the critic concedes [...] "… and truth to tell (Manet's defender) took home the palm." ...|$|E

60|$|This hypothesis, {{now more}} than a century old, would, if it rested on good evidence, explain how a single version of the various lays came to be {{accepted}} and received as authorised.

There was, by the theory, no reading public for the Homeric poetry. But, by the time of Pisistratus, a reading public was coming into existence. The tyrant had the poems collected, edited, arranged into a continuous narrative, primarily for the purpose of regulating <b>the</b> <b>recitals</b> at the Panathenaic festival.

60|$|The famous {{voyage of}} Hanno, the Carthaginian, is {{supposed}} to have taken place about a thousand years before the Christian era. The Periplus Hannonis remains, a brief and obscure record of this expedition, and a subject of great comment and controversy. By some it has been pronounced a fictitious work, fabricated among the Greeks, but its authenticity has been ably vindicated. It appears to be satisfactorily proved, however, that the voyage of this navigator has been greatly exaggerated, and that he never circumnavigated the extreme end of Africa. Mons. de Bougainville [328] traces his route to a promontory which he named the West Horn, supposed to be Cape Palmas, about five or six degrees north of the equinoctial line, whence he proceeded to another promontory, under the same parallel, which he called the South Horn, supposed to be Cape de Tres Puntas. Mons. Gosselin, however, in his Researches into the Geography of the Ancients (Tome 1, p. 162, etc.), after a rigid examination of the Periplus of Hanno, determines that he had not sailed farther south than Cape Non. Pliny, who makes Hanno range the whole coast of Africa, from the straits to the confines of Arabia, had never seen his Periplus, but took his idea from the works of Xenophon of Lampsaco. The Greeks surcharged the narration of the voyager with all kinds of fables, and on their unfaithful copies Strabo founded many of his assertions. According to M. Gosselin, the itineraries of Hanno, of Scylax, Polybius, Statius, Sebosus, and Juba; <b>the</b> <b>recitals</b> of Plato, of Aristotle, of Pliny, of Plutarch, and the tables of Ptolemy, all bring us to the same results, and, notwithstanding their apparent contradictions, fix the limit of southern navigation about the neighborhood of Cape Non, or Cape Bojador.|$|E
