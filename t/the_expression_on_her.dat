25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
500|$|MOBA's {{statement}} about Lucy reads: [...] "The motion, the chair, {{the sway of}} her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face—every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out 'masterpiece'." [...] The Times recounted comments left by a museum visitor regarding the [...] "endless layers of mysteries" [...] the image offers: [...] "What is Norman Mailer's head doing on an innocent grandma's body, and are those crows or F-16s skimming the hills?" ...|$|E
60|$|Again James {{looked at}} her; {{he could not}} make out <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. She looked almost as if she were going to cry, and yet....|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes flashed}} {{as on the}} day before, and he saw again <b>the</b> {{imperative}} <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Her {{voice rising}} angrily.] Say, what're {{you trying to}} do--make things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I {{certainly}} appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. [Then, seeing <b>the</b> hurt <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> father's face, she forces a smile.] Let's talk of something else. Come. Sit down here. [She points to the coil of rope.] ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the child}} grew silent and {{thoughtful}} again. Mary Louise, watching <b>the</b> changing <b>expressions</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, was convinced she knew {{more of the}} mystery than she dared confide to her new friend. There was no use trying to force her confidence, however; in her childish way she was both shrewd and stubborn and any such attempt would be doomed to failure. But after quite a period of silence Mary Louise asked gently: ...|$|R
6000|$|Reinhart saw <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. His hand flew to {{his gun and}} {{he backed}} quickly toward the door. Dixon leaped up and joined him. [...] "Get back!" [...] Reinhart shouted.|$|E
60|$|Escorted {{throughout}} the journey home by His Eminence, Ursula had not uttered one word. She {{sat in the}} barge, gazing out along the river, her veil closely drawn over her head, lest prying eyes noted <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|E
6000|$|Soames hooked. Glancing once {{over her}} {{shoulder}} into the glass, he saw <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, faintly amused, faintly contemptuous, as much as to say: 'Thanks! You will never learn!' No, thank God, he wasn't a Frenchman! He finished with a jerk, and the words: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{girl who}} always wears <b>the</b> same blank <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. Even though Chidori appears to lack empathy for others Junpei finds {{her as a}} curious {{acquaintance}} whilst unaware {{that she is the}} third member of the malicious group, Strega. She can summon a Persona without an Evoker which causes her intense physical pain. Her Persona is Medea.|$|R
60|$|Eliphalet had ambition, {{which is}} not a wholly {{undesirable}} quality. He began to wonder how it would feel to own a few of these valuable fellow-creatures. He reached out and touched lightly a young mulatto woman who sat beside him with an infant in her arms. <b>The</b> peculiar dumb <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face was lost on Eliphalet. The overseer had laughed coarsely.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> anxious <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face deepened as {{she listened}} to one of anguish and despair; and then, almost before I concluded, she {{suddenly}} lifted her hands to her head, uttering a low, sobbing cry, and would have fallen on the rock had I not caught her quickly in my arms. Once more in my arms--against my breast, her proper place! But now all that bright life seemed gone out of her; <b>her</b> head fell <b>on</b> my shoulder, and there was no motion in her except at intervals a slight shudder in her frame accompanied by a low, gasping sob. In a little while the sobs ceased, the eyes were closed, the face still and deathly white, and with a terrible anxiety in my heart I carried her down to the cave.|$|R
60|$|It was Claire. She stood there, holding {{something}} towards him, {{something that}} glittered in the moonlight. Her voice was hard, and <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face suggested {{that in her}} estimation he was a particularly low-grade worm, one of the submerged tenth of the worm world.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Dorcas {{had made}} no remark, when she came down-stairs and found Joe {{performing}} such of the household duties as he was familiar with; but he knew, by <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, that she was pleased, and this was sufficient reward for having left the rest-inviting bed at such an early hour.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, {{more than}} {{anything}} she had said, convinced him that she knew all. He stammered under the new alarm that her despairing tone suggested. [...] "Yes!--I was owing some bills--the collector was waiting here for the money, and I took something from the packet. But I {{was going to make}} it up by next mail--I swear it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{explained}} to her {{the object of a}} marriage-settlement, and then told her exactly what her prospects were--in the first place, <b>on</b> <b>her</b> coming of age, and in the second place, on the decease of her uncle--marking the distinction between the property in which she had a life-interest only, and the property which was left at her own control. She listened attentively, with <b>the</b> constrained <b>expression</b> still <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, and her hands still nervously clasped together in her lap.|$|R
60|$|As I {{descended the}} steps, I glanced by {{accident}} at the dining-room window. Clara was looking after me from it. There was <b>the</b> same anxious <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face {{which it had}} worn when she left me the evening before. She smiled as our eyes met--a sad, faint smile that made her look unlike herself. But it produced no impression on me then: I had no attention for anything but my approaching interview with Margaret. My life throbbed and burned within me, in that direction: it was all coldness, torpor, insensibility, in every other.|$|R
50|$|After {{walking out}} the back of {{the first part of the}} temple, in the left side, you will enter to another smaller temple.This is the temple of Guan-Yin, {{although}} Guan-Yin is a Buddhist goddess, her association with fertility with Taoists, and her image can be found in nearly every Taoist temple.This particular statue is famous because of <b>the</b> smiling, benevolent <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face.Her eyes are slightly downcast, and appear to be looking at the visitors.On either side of the Guan Yin Temple there is a row of 9 Buddhist monks, called “18 arhats” (Luo-han/ 羅漢), who are the protectors of Buddhist gods.|$|R
6000|$|Soames hooked. Glancing once {{over her}} {{shoulder}} into the glass, he saw <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, faintly amused, faintly contemptuous, as much as to say: [...] "Thanks! You will never learn!" [...] No, thank God, he wasn't a Frenchman! He finished with a jerk, and the words: [...] "It's too low here." [...] And {{he went to the}} door, with the wish to get away from her and go down to Fleur again.|$|E
6000|$|... "An end of it!" [...] said Gwendolen, aloud, {{starting}} {{from her seat}} as she heard the steps and voices of her mamma and sisters coming in from church. She hurried to the piano and began gathering together her pieces of music with assumed diligence, while <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> pale face and in her burning eyes was what would have suited a woman enduring a wrong which she might not resent, but would probably revenge.|$|E
60|$|Seth gave no heed just at {{that moment}} to the wondrous beauties of nature to be seen on every hand, when even the rough barn was gilded and perfumed, for {{standing}} in the doorway, as if literally petrified with astonishment, was a motherly looking little woman whose upraised hands told of bewilderment and surprise, while from <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face one could almost have believed that she was really afraid of the tiny Snip.|$|E
50|$|Nripati Laha, {{the founder}} {{member of the}} group, and Deepa’s brother Vijay look forward eagerly to the wedding as they both have much to gain from this alliance. Nripati hopes to get a solid {{sponsorship}} for the Swapnochari through Debashis’s ‘Bhatta Group of Industries’.However, there are several others who are not so happy. Prabal Gupta, {{the director of the}} group theater is not only unhappy, but angry in the bargain. He considers Deepa to be his creation as {{he is the one who}} had trained her painstakingly into becoming an actress she is today. Deepa leaving the group means that the lead actress would be gone!Deepa’s wedding takes place right on schedule the week after the show. All the members of the group attend and all put up a joyous front. Debashis is already enchanted by his beautiful bride; the only thing that bothers him is <b>the</b> sullen <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|I {{smiled in}} {{superior}} fashion, and, slacking off {{on one of}} the boom-guys and taking in on the other, swung the mast perfectly in the centre of the deck. Still it was not over the hole. Again <b>the</b> rueful <b>expression</b> came <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, and again I smiled in a superior way. Slacking away on the boom-tackle and hoisting an equivalent amount on the shears-tackle, I brought the butt of the mast into position directly over the hole in the deck. Then I gave Maud careful instructions for lowering away and went into the hold to the step on the schooner’s bottom.|$|R
6000|$|Philammon's {{eyes were}} {{bursting}} {{from his head}} with shame and horror: and yet he could not hate her; not even despise her. He would have done so, had there been the faintest trace of human feeling in her countenance to prove that some germ of moral sense lingered within: but even the faint blush and the downcast eye with which she had entered the theatre were gone; and <b>the</b> only <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face was that of intense enjoyment of her own activity and skill, and satisfied vanity, as of a petted child.... Was she accountable? A reasonable soul, capable of right or wrong at all? He hoped not .... He would trust not.... And still Pelagia danced on; and for a whole age of agony, he could see nothing in heaven or earth but the bewildering maze of those white feet, as they twinkled over their white image in the marble mirror.... At last it was over. Every limb suddenly collapsed, and she stood drooping in soft self-satisfied fatigue, awaiting the burst of applause which rang through Philammon's ears, proclaiming to heaven and earth, as with a mighty trumpet-blast, his sister's shame.|$|R
60|$|She shut it and {{sat down}} again. She had {{developed}} power, this woman--this--wife of his! He felt it issuing from her as she sat there, {{in a sort of}} armour. And almost unconsciously he rose and moved nearer; he wanted to see <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. Her eyes met his unflinching. Heavens! how clear they were, and what a dark brown against that white skin, and that burnt-amber hair! And how white her shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Presently, a man, in evening dress, with {{overcoat}} thrown open, gazed pointblank {{into her}} face, and, raising his hat, ranged up beside her. She walked straight on, still with that half-smile, knowing him puzzled and fearfully attracted. Then an insensate wish to stab {{him to the}} heart made her turn her head and look at him. At <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, he wilted away from her, and again she felt that wicked glee at having hurt him.|$|E
60|$|But Pan got no farther. The {{girl had}} reason to be scared, but should her hands fly to her bosom like that, and press there {{as if she had}} been hurt. He must have frightened her. And he was about to stammer his apologies and make himself known, when <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face struck him mute. Her healthy golden skin turned white. Her lips quivered, opened. Then her eyes--their color was violet and {{something}} about them seemed to stab Pan. His mind went into a deadlock--seemed to whirl--and to flash again into magnified thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|Idiotic pose! Idiotic! But {{there was}} <b>the</b> old <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, limpid, dovelike. And that {{something}} of the divine about her dancing smote Fiorsen through all the sheer imbecility of her posturings. Across and across she flitted, pirouetting, caught up at intervals by a Pierrot in black tights with a face as whitened as her own, held upside down, or right end up with one knee bent sideways, and the toe of a foot pressed against the ankle of the other, and arms arched above her. Then, with Pierrot's hands grasping her waist, she would stand upon one toe and slowly twiddle, lifting her other leg toward the roof, while the trembling of her form manifested cunningly to all how hard it was; then, off the toe, she capered out to the wings, and capered back, wearing <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face that divine, lost, dovelike look, while her perfect legs gleamed white up to the very thigh-joint. Yes; on the stage she was adorable! And raising his hands high, Fiorsen clapped and called out: [...] "Brava!" [...] He marked the sudden roundness of her eyes, a tiny start--no more. She had seen him. 'Ah! Some don't forget me!' he thought.|$|R
60|$|Soames {{continued}} to stand, listening. 'By this time to-morrow,' he thought, 'I may have <b>her</b> death <b>on</b> my hands.' No! it was unfair--monstrous, {{to put it}} that way! Sullenness dropped on him again, and {{he went up to}} the gallery. He stood at the window. The wind was in the north; it was cold, clear; very blue sky, heavy ragged white clouds chasing across; the river blue, too, through the screen of goldening trees; the woods all rich with colour, glowing, burnished-an early autumn. If it were his own life, would he be taking that risk? 'But she'd take the risk of losing me,' he thought, 'sooner than lose her child! She doesn't really love me!' What could one expect--a girl and French? The one thing really vital to them both, vital to their marriage and their futures, was a child! 'I've been through a lot for this,' he thought, 'I'll hold on--hold on. There's a chance of keeping both--a chance!' One kept till things were taken--one naturally kept! He began walking round the gallery. He had made one purchase lately which he knew was a fortune in itself, and he halted before it--a girl with dull gold hair which looked like filaments of metal gazing at a little golden monster she was holding in her hand. Even at this tortured moment he could just feel the extraordinary nature of the bargain he had made--admire the quality of the table, the floor, the chair, the girl's figure, <b>the</b> absorbed <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, <b>the</b> dull gold filaments of her hair, the bright gold of the little monster. Collecting pictures; growing richer, richer! What use, if...! He turned his back abruptly on the picture, and went to the window. Some of his doves had flown up from their perches round the dovecot, and were stretching their wings in the wind. In the clear sharp sunlight their whiteness almost flashed. They flew far, making a flung-up hieroglyphic against the sky. Annette fed the doves; it was pretty to see her. They took it out of her hand; they knew she was matter-of-fact. A choking sensation came into his throat. She would not--could not die! She was too--too sensible; and she was strong, really strong, like her mother, in spite of her fair prettiness.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a new}} <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, and <b>the</b> {{light of}} a supreme effort in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. I {{inspired}} her with the strongest emotions of abhorrence and disgust. Let me not be vain {{enough to say that}} no woman had ever looked at me in this manner before. I will only venture on the more modest assertion that no woman had ever let me perceive it yet. There is a limit to the length of the inspection which a man can endure, under certain circumstances. I attempted to direct Limping Lucy's attention to some less revolting object than my face.|$|E
60|$|Susan {{glanced at}} her, but Honora did not remark <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> friend's face, so intent was she on the {{reflections}} which Susan's words had aroused. They {{had reached the}} far end of the Silverdale domain, and were driving along the shore of the lake that lay like a sapphire set amongst the green hills. It was here that the new house of the Robert Holts was building. Presently they came to Joshua's dairy farm, and Joshua himself was standing in the doorway of one of his immaculate barn Honora put her hand on Susan's arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will," [...] cried Noel. [...] "You're too gentle, and you're too good. You're charitable, and you're simple, and {{you believe}} in another world; that's what's the matter with you, Daddy. Do you think they do, those {{people who want to}} chase us out? They don't even begin to believe, {{whatever}} they say or think. I hate them, and sometimes I hate the Church; either it's hard and narrow, or else it's worldly." [...] She stopped at <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> father's face, the most strange look of pain, and horror, as if an unspoken treachery of his own had been dragged forth for his inspection.|$|E
60|$|At this, Poopy {{manufactured}} an <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> sable countenance, {{which was}} meant to be intensely knowing and suggestive.|$|R
60|$|Again {{he did not}} answer; and {{the woman}} drew nearer to him, with a curiously intense <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|She was {{standing}} in thought, a doubtful <b>expression</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face. But as I looked at her she shook her head.|$|R
