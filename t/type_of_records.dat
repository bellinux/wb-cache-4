50|$|In such settings, a {{specific}} record type implies that {{a specific}} set of fields are present, but values of that type may contain additional fields. A record with fields x, y, and z would thus belong to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> with fields x and y, as would a record with fields x, y, and r. The rationale is that passing an (x,y,z) record to a function that expects an (x,y) record as argument should work, since that function will find all the fields it requires within the record. Many ways of practically implementing records in programming languages would have trouble with allowing such variability, but the matter is a central characteristic of record types in more theoretical contexts.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} by Tucker et al.

Later {{research by}} Tucker, Meekins, and Biemer (2008) extend this latent class model to include indicators of response behavior across multiple interviews in a panel.

The usability of an EHR is crucial to achieve success, as well as guaranteeing a high level of safe and effective level of patient care system. Therefore, it is important for care providers to take steps to ensure that their EHR will be usable. Aiming to assess the usability of the EHR, a usability evaluation was performed. This paper describes how two usability evaluation methods (heuristic walkthrough and surveys) were used to evaluate its usability. With those evaluations, it was able to recognize the level of usability present in the EHR, along with the usability issues that can be disposed...|$|E

Marginal {{analysis was used to}} identify the most prominent fishing-revenue determinants along with assessing the allocative (price) efficiency of inputs used. A log-log total value product (TVP) function was estimated for a representative cross-section random sample of 131 Abu-Dhabi fishermen. This revealed that (1) labor, fishing effort, boat capacity, boat boarding expenses, and expenditures on oil and lubricants are the five main determinants of total revenue for the individual fishermen in Abu Dhabi; (2) boat-purchase price constituted a huge investment cost to fishermen distributed over the lifetime of the boat; although only one-third of fishermen acquire loans for this purpose; (3) the only <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> fishermen keep were those pertinent to monthly revenues; and (4) price efficiency is found not to be achieved for any of the five prominent inputs that have great impact on total fishermen’s revenues, as three inputs were found to be under-utilized in varying degrees, whereas two were found to be significantly over-utilized...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{classification}} problem in data mining using decision trees. Simply stated,data mining refers to extracting or “mining” knowledge from large amounts of data. Data mining known by different names as – knowledge mining, knowledge extraction, data/pattern analysis, data archaeology, data dredging, knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). Data Mining, or Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) as it is also known, is the nontrivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown, and potentially usefulinformation from data. Classification is an important problem in data mining. Given a database D= {t 1,t 2,. …, tn} and a set of classes C= {Cl, [...] …, Cm}, the Classification Problem is to define a mapping f: D –→ C where each it is assigned to one class. It means that given a database of records, each with a class label, a classifier generates a concise and meaningful description for each class that can be used to classify subsequent records. Actually classifier divides the database into equivalence classes that is each class contains same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>records...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 278 {{hypertensive}} patients in three clinics were randomly allocated {{to have their}} medical records held in a computer system (136) or on standard hospital notes (142). For the computer system the doctor completed a structured input form, and the information on symptoms, physical findings, and diagnoses was more complete than that in the standard notes. This resulted in certain symptoms and risk factors being recognised more often when the computer system was used. The hypertension clinics' routines were not disrupted {{by the introduction of}} a computer-held system, and follow-up consultation times were not affected by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> kept, although the first consultation took eight minutes longer when computer documents were completed. The patients remained in the trial for one year and clinical management was assessed from blood pressure control, drop-out rates, and the frequency of performing investigations. These estimates of management showed {{no significant difference between the}} two groups, but the attempt to tailor the computer system to help management made the system acceptable to the doctors using it.

40|$|Online games offer {{multiple}} {{ways for}} players to interact. Recordings of these interactions {{are used for}} a variety of purposes. Such recordings raise ownership issues similar to those arising from the use of other online media. This paper presents an analysis of the attitudes and practices of 241 online gamers, 36 % of whom reported recording gameplay and 29 % of whom reported watching or accessing records of gameplay. We use a series of scenarios and hypothetical statements to elicit reactions to varying features of the production and use of these records; the parties involved, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>records,</b> and how they are used may all influence perceived ownership rights. Players are more sensitive to the recording and reuse of in-game textual communication than they are to recordings of avatar activity in the virtual world. Particularly negative reactions were elicited by scenarios that proposed a search capability over players’ textual communication or the reuse of such in-game communication in the software publisher’s advertisements. Additionally, players are skeptical of institutional archiving of such game content, although 50 year embargos on access brought attitudes in line with those for other media...|$|E
