5|$|The Joint Chiefs of Staff {{issued a}} {{directive}} in January 1948 for the modification of 225 B-29, B-50, and B-36 bombers <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> nuclear weapons, along with eight C-97 Stratofreighter aircraft <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> bomb assembly teams. There were already 32 Silverplate B-29s in service with the Strategic Air Command, so the Air Materiel Command was directed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out Saddletree modifications on a further 80 B-29s, 36 B-50As, 23 B-50Bs and 18 B-36Bs. The B-36A could not carry nuclear weapons without major modifications.|$|E
5|$|Those B-52Gs not {{converted}} as {{cruise missile}} carriers underwent {{a series of}} modifications to improve conventional bombing. They were fitted with a new Integrated Conventional Stores Management System (ICSMS) and new underwing pylons that could hold larger bombs or other stores than could the external pylons. Thirty B-52Gs were further modified <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> up to 12 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles each, while 12 B-52Gs were fitted <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> the AGM-142 Have Nap stand-off air-to-ground missile. When the B-52G was retired in 1994, an urgent scheme was launched to restore an interim Harpoon and Have Nap capability, the four aircraft being modified <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> Harpoon and four <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> Have Nap under the Rapid Eight program.|$|E

5|$|After the 1948 election, {{the state}} turned firmly Republican. Although {{registered}} Republicans were {{a minority in}} the state until 2015, starting in 1952, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates {{in all but one}} election (1964). This is not to say every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively. Al Gore in 2000, though, was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was one of three states, the others being Utah and West Virginia, where Barack Obama failed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> any of its counties in 2012, and it was the only state where Barack Obama failed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> any county in 2008. In 2016, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, again won every county, being one of only two states, the other being West Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton failed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> a single county.|$|E

All the ships had to have gun platforms installed, before each ship docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard to have the guns themselves installed. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators.

5|$|By 1975, {{plans were}} laid {{to replace the}} Hunter in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. The Hunter {{remained}} in a key role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> Oerlikon 80mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs and the ability <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> AGM-65 Maverick missiles.|$|E
