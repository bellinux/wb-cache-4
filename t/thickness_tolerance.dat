5000|$|Fixed {{occlusion}} - In {{this kind}} of pump, the rollers have a fixed locus as it turns, keeping the occlusion constant as it squeezes the tube. This is a simple, yet effective design. The only downside to this design is that the occlusion as a percent on the tube varies with the variation of the tube wall thickness. Typically the wall thickness of the extruded tubes vary enough that the % occlusion can vary with the wall thickness (see above). Therefore, a section of tube with greater wall thickness, but within the accepted tolerance, will have higher percent occlusion, which increases the wear on the tubing, thereby decreasing the tube life.

Hydraulic servo control system is not always optimal and stable due to highly nonlinear and parameter uncertainties. In this paper, the most important nonlinear relating flow and pressure is analyzed. A nonlinear self-adaptive compensation method is designed. Modeling and simulating the hydraulic servo control system of SDS using this method, the numerical simulation results show that the maximum overshoot and static error of the compensated system are more less than that of without nonlinear compensation. The overshoot of the compensated system is less than 10 % when the cold strip is rolling. So the <b>thickness</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the cold strip can be guaranteed easily.

However, applications currently exist that incorporate three dimensional tape springs folds.

These moments are primarily a function of curvature. This publication uses a photographic method to analyse the curvature assumptions of two dimensional tape spring folds and to define the curvature trends for three dimensional tape spring folds as a basis for calculating the opening moment. It is found that although a variation in the curvature can be seen for three dimensional tape spring folds, its effect is secondary to the tape <b>thickness</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Therefore constant curvature models are concluded to be accurate enough for general tape fold applications...|$|E

Using an assumed pure lead density of 0. 40974 lb/in{sup 3 }, an average sheet thickness was calculated and compared to the perimeter thickness measurements. In every case, the calculated average thickness was a few mils thinner than the perimeter measurements. The ratio was constant, 0. 98. This discrepancy is likely due to the assumed pure lead density.

40|$|For {{large area}} {{architectural}} coatings such as Low-E or solar control systems strong demands on color uniformity {{are to be}} fulfilled. Typically, a precision of delta a*, delta b* < +- 1 is required. For single-Ag based Low-E coatings this implies a film <b>thickness</b> <b>tolerance</b> of about +- 2 %, while for double or multi-AG low-E coatings the thickness variation should be less than +- 1 %. A common problem of in-line sputter coaters is a certain film thickness deviation of about 2 % along the glass transport direction. It is caused by varying flow conditions due to the glass substrate movement within the compartments. In order to solve this problem, we performed a three dimensional Monate Carlo gas flow simulation of a jumbo sized sputter compartment together with adjacent pumping compartments and glass transport slots. The sputter compartment comprises two 3. 83 m sized twin rotatable magnetrons equipped with Zn-targets. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation, a heuristic model of the reactive ZnO sputtering process has been implemented. Experimental verification shows that this model properly describes (i) the pressure with respect to substrate position, (ii) the ZnO target voltage vs. oxygen flow charcteristics at different conditions as well as (iii) the film thickness profile on a substrate after dynamic deposition. This model is a starting point towards novel controlling algorithms which allow for film thickness homogeneity better than 1 % within jumbo sized in-line sputtering coaters...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that sample resistivity is the controlling factor in electrokinetic impregnation was substantiated. Experiments show that dense clay- bonded silicon carbide can be impregnated {{beneath the surface}} pores whereas only surface pore impregnation is achieved with both dense and porous graphite. The resistivity of the materials differ {{by a factor of}} about 1 O/sup 10 /. Although deep penetration of the substrate by the particles of the coating system is not achieved during deposition, there is evidence of considerable diffusion of the binder-carbide solid solution into the pores of the graphite after sintering. A number of sintered, crack-free, and adherent TaC coatings on ATJ graphite panels were prepared which showed evidence of surface pore penetration. The attainment of satisfactory reproducibility was difficult because of preferential deposition of the binder metal and contamination from erosion of the chrome-manganese steel ball mill. Efforts to prevent contamination by lining the mill with rubber were unsatisfactory. A silicon carbide liner for the mill was ordered and will be received in December. To prevent preferential deposition, precoating of the tantalum carbide particles with nickel by chemical precipitation and electroless nickel plating was investigated. Nickel coatings were obtained by both techniques; however, the chemically precipitated nickel was not adherent when the coated particles were placed in the electrophoretic bath. Good adherence was obtained by electroless plating; but this material, when sintered, cracked during the cooling cycle. Further investigation established that both iron and nickel are required as binders to obtain well-sintered Tar. Work was begun on the preparation of coated rocket nozzle liners for testing at NOL. Graphite nozzles were machined to the WM-D- 800 - 2 configuration, and a cell was designed for obtaiining a uniform electrophoretic deposit. Test coatings were within the required <b>thickness</b> <b>tolerance</b> of plus or minus 0. 002 in. The coatings, thus far, have cracked {{at the edge of the}} nozzle throat during the heat-up cycle. This is believed to result from a temperature differential in the furnace and from improper control of the binder composition. The furnace is being modified to minimize the temperature gradient, and variability in the binder composition will be eliminated when the carbide liner is installed in the ball mill. Thermal shock tests were performed on coated graphite panels. The specimens were plunged into a 2500 deg C zone, held at temperature for 2 min, and then removed from the hot zone. Microscopic examination of the coating after testing indicated no ill effects. (auth...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells is profoundly {{influenced by the}} spatial arrangements of microstructure at various length scales in its photo-active layer, referred to as morphology. Due to their complex chemical structures, polymers usually exhibits low crystallinity and carrier mobility, leading to a limited thickness ~ 100 nm of the active layer for a typical polymer solar cell. Such thin films are incompatible with the prevailing large-area coating techniques, thus increasing the difficulty to realize the high-throughput production of polymer-based photovoltaics in industry. On the other hand, for most high-performance low-band-gap polymers, during their film-casting process, processing solvent additives are usually essential for morphology optimization, which help boost device efficiency. However, most commonly-used solvent additives such as 1, 8 -Diiodooctane (DIO), are disturbingly reactive to oxygen or water in air, leading to deteriorated {{performance of}} devices made under the ambient environment. Therefore, fabrication processes involving DIO have {{to be limited to}} an air-free environment, which is quite unfavorable for large-area fabrication techniques, as majority of them are carried on under the ambient environment. Therefore, an efficient air-stable solvent additive would be greatly appreciated in terms of OPV industrialization. As a result, in order to achieve thick active layers as well as to find an air-stable alternative additive for industrial applications, a thorough and systematic study on morphology is necessitated. First, via rational modification of polymer chemical structure(fine-tuning on side chains), new polymers with enhanced structure order (e. g., crystallite size increases from 35 ï¿½ to 53 ï¿½) and higher hole mobility (from ~ 10 - 5 to ~ 10 - 4 cm 2 /(V*s)) are obtained, enabling thicker optimum active layers ~ 200 nm with a larger <b>thickness</b> <b>tolerance</b> up to ~ 350 nm for the corresponding bulk heterojunction devices. This result is of great potential for relaxing the required level of precision in active layer thickness, which has important industrial implications for large-area film deposition. Second, through examining those solvents with a great potential to satisfy the criteria for efficient additives, a new efficient air-stable solvent additive - 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene (DCB) was successfully found for the Diketopyrrolopyrrole-based narrow bandgap polymer under investigation in this work, with a much larger working operation window (up to 80 %) and higher device efficiency than DIO. The reason for improved performance lies in higher hole mobility due to polymer crystallinity enhancement in films cast from solution processed by both additives, as demonstrated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) and Grazing Incident Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) results. Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy were also conducted on polymer structures in solution, and their results revealed a novel working mechanism of DCB for morphology control, which involves the modified solution-stage polymer conformations due to the polymer-additive interaction. Upon incorporating DCB into blend solution, the resultant polymer configurations in solution would have a high tendency to preserve into crystalline regions in the as-cast films and this unique way of tuning thin-film morphology via altering polymer conformations in solution has established a new guide for future additive selection in other polymer systems. Results of this manuscript will resolve the current obstacle for high-throughput process in industry and should be of great potential to contribute to practical OPV applications in the near future...|$|E

In {{response}} to this vision, NASA started the Constellation Program, which is a new exploration launch vehicle program. The primary mission for the Constellation Program is to carry out a series of human expeditions ranging from Low Earth Orbit to the surface of Mars and beyond for the purposes of conducting human exploration of space, as specified by the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE). The intent is that the information and technology developed by this program will provide the foundation for broader exploration activities as our operational experience grows. The ARES I Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) has been designated as the launch vehicle that will be developed as a "first step" to facilitate the aforementioned human expeditions. The CLV Project is broken into four major elements: First Stage, Upper Stage Engine, Upper Stage (US), and the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is responsible for the design of the CLV and has the prime responsibility to design the upper stage of the vehicle. The US is the second propulsive stage of the CLV and provides CEV insertion into low Earth orbit (LEO) after separation from the First Stage of the Crew Launch Vehicle. The fully integrated Upper Stage is a mix of modified existing heritage hardware (J- 2 X Engine) and new development (primary structure, subsystems, and avionics). The Upper Stage assembly is a structurally stabilized cylindrical structure, which is powered by a single J- 2 X engine which is developed as a separate Element of the CLV. The primary structure includes the load bearing liquid hydrogen (LH 2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) propellant tanks, a Forward Skirt, the Intertank structure, the Aft Skirt and the Thrust Structure. A Systems Tunnel, which carries fluid and electrical power functions to other Elements of the CLV, is included as secondary structure. The MSFC has an overall responsibility for the integrated US element as well as structural design an thermal control of the fuel tanks, intertank, interstage, avionics, main propulsion system, Reaction Control System (RCS) for both the Upper Stage and the First Stage. MSFC's Spacecraft and Vehicle Department, Structural and Analysis Design Division is developing a set of predicted mass of these elements. This paper details the methodology, criterion and tools used for the preliminary mass predictions of the upper stage structural assembly components. In general, weight of the cylindrical barrel sections are estimated using the commercial code Hypersizer, whereas, weight of the domes are developed using classical solutions. HyperSizer is software that performs automated structural analysis and sizing optimization based on aerospace methods for strength, stability, and stiffness. Analysis methods range from closed form, traditional hand calculations repeated every day in industry to more advanced panel buckling algorithms. Margin-of-safety reporting for every potential failure provides the engineer with a powerful insight into the structural problem. Optimization capabilities include finding minimum weight panel or beam concepts, material selections, cross sectional dimensions, thicknesses, and lay-ups from a library of 40 different stiffened and sandwich designs and a database of composite, metallic, honeycomb, and foam materials. Multiple different concepts (orthogrid, isogrid, and skin stiffener) were run for multiple loading combinations of ascent design load with and with out tank pressure as well as proof pressure condition. Subsequently, selected optimized concept obtained from Hypersizer runs was translated into a computer aid design (CAD) model to account for the wall <b>thickness</b> <b>tolerance,</b> weld land etc for developing the most probable weight of the components. The flow diram summarizes the analysis steps used in developing these predicted mass...|$|E
40|$|Large Area Processing for {{thin film}} {{substrates}} {{can be used}} to reduce the cost per layer per area significantly. Various process setups exist to achieve this goal, and they vary in terms of process tolerances and cost. As different process tolerances result in different performance tolerance bands of the produced structures, customers may want to choose the right process to obtain sufficient quality. This paper presents the cross links between the two aspects performance and cost. Taking two process setups with diverse interconnect metallization width and dielectric <b>thickness</b> uniformity <b>tolerances,</b> the authors demonstrate the impact on integrated RF elements as microstrips, inductors, and antennas...|$|R
40|$|Hormonal, metabolic, hemodynamic, {{vascular}} and immunological {{changes that}} occur during pregnancy can affect {{the function of the}} eye. These changes are commonly transient, but in some cases they may be permanent and have consequences even after childbirth. The ocular effects of pregnancy may be physiological or pathological and can be associated with the development of new ocular pathology or may be modifications of pre-existing conditions. The most common physiological changes are alterations of corneal sensitivity and <b>thickness,</b> decreased <b>tolerance</b> to contact lenses, decreased intraocular pressure, hemeralopia and refractive errors. Possible posterior segment changes include worsening of diabetic retinopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, increased risk of peripheral vitreochorioretinal dystrophies and retinal detachment. Thus, it should be kept in mind that the presence of any ocular symptoms in a pregnant woman requires ophthalmologic examination and further management...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle crash-can {{transfers}} the {{kinetic energy}} into strain energy {{stored in the}} structure via a sequential deformation wall crushing process. The performance of the crash can FEA model and its ability of predicting mechanical behaviours in a crash event is assessed and verified via the FEA analysis and corresponding experiment data. Compression tests are performed to validate the FEA simulation results. Wall tolerance sensitivity is also investigated via FEA simulation {{in order to examine}} if and how the manufacturing defect could impose impact on crash can energy absorption capability. It is found that the performance of crash-can with manufacturing tolerances can be predicted by the FEA model derived in this paper. Internal energy analysis indicates the wall <b>thickness</b> is <b>tolerance</b> insensitive and manufacturing defect can be disregarded under the manufacturing tolerance standards...|$|R
