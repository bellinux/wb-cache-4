Playing on his past as a former exile, and through the network of Bwiti followers, M'ba managed to rally support from the Fang and Myènè peoples.

As, in 1985 the Greek company PYRKAL provided Iraq with $77 million worth of munitions and in 1987 the Greek company EBO provided approximately $83 millions worth of munitions. After Gulf War I, UN sanctions were imposed on Iraq. Greece supported the oil for food programme as it was interested in the future of the Iraqi people.

Despite Iraq’s international isolation both countries continued their co-operation. Specifically, in 1998 Greece and Iraq signed a scientific and cultural co-operation agreement which included co-operation between Iraqi and Greek universities regarding degree recognition, the granting of scholarships and the teaching of ancient and Modern Greek in Iraq. In addition, in June 1999 the President of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Iraqi Parliament visited Athens, as did the General Director of the Iraqi News Agency, who signed a co-operation agreement with the Athens News Agency.

40|$|Abstract: According to {{the concept}} of {{distributed}} cognition or distributed intelligence (Pea, 1993; Wertsch, 1995), which is popular in current theories on learning, intelligence is not a property of individual minds. Instead it is achieved through the resources distributed in soci-ety: between people, and also between people, physical tools, and symbolic systems. Build-ing on this perspective, people can achieve very complex goals through distributed cogni-tion. When schools engage in joint projects with members of the community, many examples of socially distributed intelligence emerge; moreover, when people interact in more egali-tarian ways, using this kind of collective intelligence, both the processes and the results are much more effective. This article describes various ways that distributed cognition functions in four schools in Spain that are being studied within the INCLUD-ED integrated research project. This type of organisation in these schools is reflected in two key practices: <b>mixed</b> <b>committees</b> and interactive groups in the classroom. Evidence of the pedagogical benefits of this approach is also provided. Key words: Distributed cognition in community-based education, Interactive Groups, <b>mixed</b> <b>committees...</b>|$|R

40|$|Although {{most of the}} {{legislative}} tasks of the European Parliament(EP) are performed in its committees, it is controversial how representative they are of the overall plenary. Distributive, informational and partisan theories suggest respectively that the committee assignments system is designed to (1) serve special interests outside the EP, (2) bring informational benefits to the plenary or (3) promote partisan interests. These propositions are examined via {{a representative sample of}} committees using an original data set of MEPs' profiles in the 6 th European Parliament.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the three {{issues that are}} important to macroeconomic policymakers. First, I examine the role of inventories over the business cycle. Despite accounting for less that 1 % of the level of GDP, inventory changes have made up almost 50 % of the post-war volatility of US GDP growth, and yet most models of the business cycle exclude inventories. I develop a dynamic business cycle model that incorporates distribution inventories as well as simple storage inventories. I find that the behaviour of inventories in this model matches the aggregate data well. However, {{there is little evidence that}} improved inventory management contributed to the decline in macroeconomic volatility over the last quarter of a century. Second, the optimal design of a monetary policy committee (MPC) is examined as to whether such committees should include a mix of members from outside (external) as well as inside central banks (internal). Using a new theoretical model of voting behaviour on a <b>mixed</b> <b>committee,</b> it is shown that, under certain circumstance and behaviour, the presence of external committee members may be beneficial. However, using the voting record of the Bank of England's MPC, reveals a problem; there is evidence of an agency problem which may eliminate any benefit to the appointment of external members. These results undermine the current intuition as to why such <b>mixed</b> <b>committees</b> should be employed by policymaking institutions. Finally, I investigate the effect of policy uncertainty on household saving using a quasi-natural experiment from Germany in the late 1990 s. Around the 1998 election, there was a marked increase in uncertainty; using the fact that civil servants were largely unaffected by this policy uncertainty, we show that households reacted to the increase in uncertainty by saving more and, where possible, by working more via the margin offered by part-time employment...|$|R
