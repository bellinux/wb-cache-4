40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} Refractor Importance Sampling (RIS), an improvement to reduce error variance in Bayesian network importance sampling propagation under evidential reasoning. We prove {{the existence of}} a collection of importance functions that are close to <b>the</b> optimal <b>importance</b> function under evidential reasoning. Based on this theoretic result we derive the RIS algorithm. RIS approaches <b>the</b> optimal <b>importance</b> function by applying localized arc changes to minimize the divergence between <b>the</b> evidence-adjusted <b>importance</b> function and <b>the</b> optimal <b>importance</b> function. <b>The</b> validity and performance of RIS is empirically tested with a large set of synthetic Bayesian networks and two realworld networks. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore <b>the</b> {{relative}} <b>importance</b> of strategic thinking dimensions in prediction of counter-productive behavior. The research method is based on a descriptive- Survey research. After collecting the questionnaires from 73 top managers and 110 staffs, the correlations between strategic thinking dimensions and counterproductive behavior were calculated. <b>The</b> relative <b>importance</b> method was used to calculate the relative weight of each dimension of strategic thinking in prediction of counterproductive behaviors. The results show that the strategic thinking of top managers is associated with their counterproductive behavior (correlation coefficient - 0. 38). Furthermore, The results of <b>the</b> Relative <b>Importance</b> Method indicate that <b>the</b> relative <b>importance</b> of each dimension of strategic thinking in prediction of counterproductive behavior is not the same.
