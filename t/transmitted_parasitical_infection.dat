40|$|Trichomonas vaginalis is {{the most}} common sexually <b>transmitted</b> <b>parasitical</b> <b>infection</b> worldwide. T. vaginalis can carry a virus: Trichomonas vaginalis virus (TVV). To date, four TVV species have been described. Few studies have {{investigated}} TVV prevalence and its clinical importance. We have developed a nested reverse-transcriptase PCR, with novel, type specific primers to directly detect TVV RNA in T. vaginalis positive clinical samples. A total of 119 T. vaginalis positive clinical samples were collected in Amsterdam and "s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, from 2012 to 2016. For all samples T. vaginalis was genotyped using multi-locus sequence typing. The T. vaginalis positive samples segregated into a two-genotype population: type I (n = 64) and type II (n = 55). All were tested for TVV with the new TVV PCR. We detected 3 of the 4 TVV species. Sequencing of the amplified products showed high homology with published TVV genomes (82 - 100 %). Half of the T. vaginalis clinical samples (n = 60, 50. 4 %) were infected with one or more TVV species, with a preponderance for TVV infections in T. vaginalis type I (n = 44, 73. 3 %). Clinical data was available for a subset of samples (n = 34) and we observed an association between testing positive for (any) TVV and reporting urogenital symptoms (p = 0. 023). The nested RT-PCR allowed for direct detection of TVV in T. vaginalis positive clinical samples. This may be helpful in studies and clinical settings, since T. vaginalis disease and/or treatment outcome may be influenced by the protozoa"s viru...|$|E

40|$|Background: Diarrhea {{is one of}} {{the main}} public health {{problems}} occurring in West Java. One of the affected areas is Subdistrict Jatinangor. Inappropriate management of sanitation facilities around Jatinangor area causes contamination of water. Cikeruh River {{is one of the}} water sources in Jatinangor Area, from which people obtain water for daily activities. Water borne illness due to poor sanitation condition can lead to parasitic infection such as Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium parvum which can cause a prolonged diarrhea. There has not been any study done regarding the presence of <b>parasitical</b> <b>infection</b> causing diarrhea around Jatinangor. Methods: In order to identify the parasitic infection, a descriptive study was carried out on 16 fecal samples collected from diarrheal patient who visited Puskesmas Jatinangor from September–November 2012. The parasites were checked by using wet mount method Results: The parasites found were Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium parvum, but none of Giardia lamblia. There were also other findings such as Iodamoeba butschlii and Entamoeba coli.

40|$|Bioluminescence {{has been}} studied for many years by scientists. There are {{numerous}} mechanisms of that phenomenon; among them bacterial bioluminescence is the most frequently found in nature. This type of bioluminescence {{is determined by the}} appearance of lux operon, which encodes all elements necessary to produce light emission and it does not require any additional substrates supply. Another commonly found example of bioluminescence mechanism is performed by Photinus pyralis. Luciferase of P. pyralis named FLuc requires D-luciferin as a substrate. Bioluminescence is also characteristic for many deep-sea organisms. Most of them are based on oxidation reaction of coelenterazine to coelenteramide mediated by RLuc or GLuc luciferases. Due to the variety of bioluminescence mechanisms in nature, it has become possible to apply them in many sensitive methods {{that can be used in}} molecular biology and medicine. The most significant application of bioluminescence is BLI (bioluminescence imaging). This method is cheap and nontoxic which allows both in vitro and in vivo imaging.

40|$|Patient and graft {{survival}} following renal transplanta-tion {{have improved}} markedly {{over the past}} decade, meaning that physician attention has turned more towards minimizing short- and long-term toxicities associated with immunosuppressive regimens. Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events are common following renal transplantation and all immunosup-pressive regimens {{have been associated with}} such events. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) are potential components of immunosuppression regimens, and are associated with the most successful outcomes in kidney transplantation. The effects of MMF and EC-MPS are likely mediated via the active metabolite mycophenolic acid (MPA). The GI events caused by both MMF and EC-MPS may, in part, be related to MPA, independent of the formulation or route of administration. MPA may produce GI events either through direct action or through the action of it metabolites. However, many other factors may cause GI events observed following renal transplantation. These include the surgery itself and concurrent diseases such as diabetes, and bacterial, viral, fungal and <b>parasitical</b> <b>infections.</b> Additionally, numerous concomitant non-immunosuppressive agents, including antibiotics hypoglycaemic and proton-pump inhibitors, can be associated with GI events. In a recent trial in renal transplant patients with severe diarrhoea, approximately 50 % of patients achieved resolution of diarrhoea through methods other than altering their immunosuppressive regimens. Indeed altering of the immunosuppressive regimen may lead to the risk of acute rejection. Thus, {{in order to reduce the}} risk of rejection and subsequent damage to the graft, it is important to consider other causes of GI events in renal transplant patients before altering immunosuppressive regimen...|$|R
40|$|Time {{and time}} again, {{corporate}} scandals (lately {{in the banking}} sector) {{remind us of the}} frailty of human standards and values: ethical conduct is unreliable. The authors have personal experience, drawn from consultancy and research, of the troubling ease with which groups of employees can subvert and expose to existential risk otherwise sound organisations. Daily, occasional and actions under stress may each and all demonstrate forms of behaviour at substantial odds from what individuals would tolerate, enable or support. These individuals are not necessarily behaving irrationally, nor motivated solely by personal gain: and yet their actions are greedy. They put at risk the stability of the overall organisation for the promise of an easier (but unregulated, unsafe or unpalatable) workload, reward or task list. In this sense, then, a biological analogy would be of a <b>parasitical</b> <b>infection</b> that drains energy from a host, reducing its ability to remain healthy or, as some real-world parasites do, changing the behaviour of the host such that it is persuaded that unconventional actions are natural, intuitive. The very conditions of work may have a profound influence here: “This dysfunctional perspective is reinforced by contemporary corporate monoculture where employees live in a bubble, log obscene hours, and vacation with their co-workers. As a consequence giant corporations are dogmatically insular with their own warped code of ethics and worldview” (Burnett 2011). This paper will seek to shed light on the mechanisms by which teams in organisations come to undertake behaviours which out at risk the sustainability and security of the whole. Here, then, for example, the socially-responsible aspirations and benchmarks of financial institutions are compromised. Supposed to build long-term shareholder value by taking into strategic account the need for engagement and transparency about the company, how it creates value for its stakeholders, how it manages risk and contributes to society – all of these can be undermined by rogue traders (Cf. Nick Leeson, Enron, Parmalat,NorthernRock, Madoff, LIBOR, the London Whale, RBS, Co-op, RBS GRG).

40|$|In the {{biosynthesis}} of fatty acids, the beta-Ketoacyl Acyl Carrier Protein Synthases (Kas) catalyse chain elongation by {{the addition}} of two-carbon units derived from malonyl-ACP, to an acyl group bound to CoA or the small protein ACP. These enzymes are potential targets for antibiotics against bacterial or <b>parasitical</b> <b>infections</b> and their mammalian counterparts could hopefully be used as drug targets against certain cancers and obesity. The crystal structure of the Kas II isoform from E. coli in complex with the well known natural inhibitor cerulenin has been determined to define the active site pocket and enable rational drug design with this target. Kas belongs to a family known as condensing enzymes for their ability to catalyse the Claisen condensation reaction. Different condensing enzymes have different substrate specificities and reaction mechanisms that somehow must be reflected in their 3 D structure. The crystal structure of Kas II from Synechocystis was determined and compared to other condensing enzymes, to elucidate structural determinants for substrate specificity and reaction mechanism in condensing enzymes. Stearoyl Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase is a soluble enzyme that catalyses the formation of a cis-double bond between carbon- 9 and carbon- 10 in stearic acid. Desaturase is known to contain a bent hydrophobic cavity, where the fatty acid substrate binds in the vicinity of a di-iron centre that is used for activation of molecular oxygen. Following reduction by ferredoxin, the di-iron centre activate molecular oxygen and reactive oxygen intermediates are formed that abstract hydrogen atoms from the bound fatty acid. The crystal structures of the molecular oxygen analogues, azide and acetate, in complex with desaturase have been determined in order to elucidate how the di-iron centre activates molecular oxygen and further controls the reactive oxygen intermediates to catalyse fatty acid desaturation. Crystal structures of iron depleted desaturase species have also been determined. Soluble desaturases act as the primary determinant for the composition of unsaturated fatty acids in plant membranes and seed storage oils, and variation in regio-specificity (double bond insertion position) among desaturase isozymes in certain plants is associated with the presence of unusual fatty acids in the seeds of these plants. The crystal structure of the protein complex between desaturase from Ricinus Communis and stearoyl-ACP from spinach, provides a basis for rational design of regio-specificity in soluble desaturases...|$|R
40|$|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Different {{parts of}} Ocimum gratissimum Linn are largely used in folk {{medicine}} {{for the treatment}} of many diseases, some of which related to <b>parasitical</b> <b>infections</b> as fevers and headaches. In order to validate their use and to clarify the plant part which possesses the best antiparasitic properties, we decided to evaluate the in vitro antiplasmodial and antitrypanosomal activities of essential oils and crude extracts from leaves, stems and seeds of Ocimum gratissimum as well as their cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oils and ethanol crude extracts of leaves and stems of Ocimum gratissimum from Benin, were obtained in pre and full flowering stages. Seeds obtained only in full flowering stage, were also extracted. The oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC/MS and GC/FID. Extracts and essential oils were tested in vitro against Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Plasmodium falciparum. Cytotoxicity was evaluated in vitro against Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and the human non cancer fibroblast cell line (WI 38) through MTT assay to evaluate the selectivity and toxicity was assessed against Artemia salina Leach. RESULTS: The essential oils and non-volatile crude extracts of Ocimum gratissimum were more active on Trypanosoma brucei brucei than on Plasmodium falciparum (3 D 7). This activity varies according to the vegetative stage (pre and full flowering) and the plant part (seeds, stems and leaves) extracted. The best growth inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei brucei was observed with ethanol crude extracts of leaves (IC 50 = 1. 66 +/- 0. 48 mug/mL) and seeds (IC 50 = 1. 29 +/- 0. 42 mug/mL) in full flowering stage with good selectivity (SI> 10). The chemical composition of the essential oil from aerial parts (47 compounds), characterized by the presence as main constituents of p-cymene, thymol, gamma-terpinene, beta-myrcene and alpha-thujene, depends on the vegetative stage. The oil contained some minor compounds such as myrcene (IC 50 = 2. 24 +/- 0. 27 mug/mL), citronellal (IC 50 = 2. 76 +/- 1. 55 mug/mL), limonene (IC 50 = 4. 24 +/- 2. 27 mug/mL), with good antitrypanosomal activities. These oils and crude extracts were not toxic against Artemia salina Leach and had a low cytotoxicity except leaves and seeds ethanol extracts obtained in full flowering which showed toxicity against CHO and WI 38 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ethanol crude extracts of leaves and seeds of Ocimum gratissimum in full flowering stage can be a good source of antitrypanosomal agents. This is the first report about the relation between the plant part extracted, the vegetative stage of the plant, the antitrypanosomal and antiplasmodial activities and the cytotoxicity of essential oils and non-volatile extracts of Ocimum gratissimum from Benin.

40|$|Carbohydrates play vital {{roles in}} all forms of life. Attached to {{proteins}} and lipids they serve as recognition elements in several biological interaction processes, such as intercellular communication, immune response, viral and <b>parasitical</b> <b>infections,</b> signal transduction, and development. Synthetic mimics of natural oligosaccharides have contributed {{to a better understanding}} of these complex recognition events. In addition, these mimics can be used to modulate, or intervene in undesired (pathological) interaction processes. Glycopeptides have been demonstrated to be efficient oligosaccharide mimics. Moreover, they are readily prepared in a library format, which provides rapid access to a variety of potential high-affinity ligands for carbohydrate-binding proteins. This thesis describes the preparation of combinatorial solid-phase glycopeptide libraries, and their use for the identification of glycopeptides that mimic oligosaccharides in binding to a receptor. Several glycosylated amino acid building blocks having a nonnatural S- or N-glycosidic linkage were synthesized. These building blocks were used to prepare S-,N-glycopeptides that may have an enhanced stability towards acidic conditions and enzymatic degradation. Two combinatorial solid-phase glycopeptide libraries containing Gal(b 1 -O) Thr, and Gal(b 1 -S) Cys and Gal(b 1 -N) Asn, respectively, were prepared according to the split-and-mix method, combined with the ladder synthesis strategy. Their screening with Ricinus communis agglutinin indicated that O-, S-, and S-,N-glycopeptides were recognized by the lectin with similar recognition patterns, and with a similar affinity. In addition, the S-,N-glycopeptides were completely stable towards enzymatic degradation by a b-galactosidase, whereas O-glycopeptides were not completely stable. The two galactosylated glycopeptide libraries, and a library containing Lac(b 1 -O) Thr were screened with galectin- 1 and galectin- 3 to identify ligands that may have the potential to inhibit malignant galectin-carbohydrate interactions. The screening of the galactosylated glycopeptide libraries primarily yielded peptide hits, whereas the lactosylated glycopeptide library predominantly yielded glycopeptide hits. Subsequent SPR-based inhibition assays indicated that the lactosylated glycopeptides were more potent galectin inhibitors than lactose. The (galactosylated glyco) peptides were able to inhibit the binding of h-Gal- 3, but displayed a different effect on the binding of h-Gal- 1, which may be attributed to aggregation of h-Gal- 1. Subsequent solid-phase inhibition assays indicated that some (glyco) peptides were more efficient galectin inhibitors than lactose, and intrafamily cross-reactivity was observed. Additionally performed cell assays with cells of human tumour lines indicated that some lead compounds could effectively inhibit the cell surface binding of the galectins. A glycopeptide library containing Fuc(b 1 -S) Cys and Fuc(b 1 -N) Asn was prepared and screened with a-L-fucose-specific Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I to study the effect of the configuration of the S- or N-glycosidic linkage on the strength and specificity of carbohydrate-protein interactions. The results indicated that the lectin was able to recognize nonnatural b-linked S-,N-fucosylated glycopeptides. Some RCA 120 - and h-Gal- 1 -specific glycopeptides were used to develop SPR-based biosensors for the sensitive detection of carbohydrate-binding proteins in solution. The best sensitivity was obtained on glycopeptide-derivatized self-assembled monolayers consisting of a 9 : 1 ratio of 3 -mercapto- 1 -propanol/ 11 -mercaptoundecanoic acid. Detection limits of 0. 13 and 0. 9 nM were obtained for RCA 120 and h-Gal- 1, respectively. Additionally, the effect of interfering compounds on the sensitivity of the optimized biosensor was investigated, demonstrating remarkably different behavior of the respective analytes in the presence of a model protein mixture...|$|R

The postmortem examinations were performed by the Institut für Lebensmittel, Arzneimittel und Tierseuchen (ILAT) Berlin during the period 1985 to 2007. The investigation gives an overview on the occurrence and incidence of both infectious and non-infectious diseases as well as causes of death of the respective birds. With a total share of 61. 8 % birds of the orders Passeriformes (23. 3 %), Anseriformes (18. 8 %), Ciconiiformes (9. 9 %) and Galliformes (9. 8 %) are the most frequent animals in the investigation material. The post-mortem findings’ evaluation includes {{a division of the}} diseases into eight different categories as well as into clinically relevant and incidental findings. They were weighted according to their frequency of occurrence. Different incidences of these diseases in the various orders are illustrated and partially shown in tables. Furthermore the sex- and agepredispositions, seasonal incidences as well as the occurrence development of the losses are discussed and possible causes are mentioned. The results are compared to other investigations. The analysis is executed to see possible changes in the causes of death of the birds in the Zoological Garden Berlin for example the affected orders, the frequency of occurrence of some diseases, the appearance of zoonosis or emerging diseases. In the early 1990 s an increase in the annual mortality rate up to 15. 0 % was seen if one regards all the birds lived in the zoo. But thereafter a decrease to 1. 9 % {{at the end of the}} period of examination could register. On the one hand it is due to the enhancement in birds-keeping and to the further development in diagnostics and therapy. On the other hand post-mortem findings of individual animals are an important element in connection with the maintenance of the livestock’s health. Therefore a good cooperation between the Zoological Garden and the ILAT of Berlin is of a great usefulness. With 34. 9 % infectious diseases, mainly due to bacteria, are the most significant causes of death. In this connection tuberculosis and salmonellosis with 6. 5 % and 3. 6 % respectively were prime causes of mortality. <b>Parasitical</b> <b>infections</b> were lethal in 7. 3 % of all birds. More than 50. 0 % of them regard the order of Passeriformes. Most frequently Filaria and Syngamus trachea were found out with a percentage of 2. 0 % and 1. 5 %. The aspergillosis as the dominant mycosis accounted for 4. 1 % out of the 5097 birds examined. In 24. 9 % of the cases an organic disease led to death, especially pathological alteration of the digestive tract with 6. 7 % and the cardiovascular system with 4. 7 %. In 17. 8 % the dissolutions were elicited by traumatic and other physical causes of death. Metabolic disorders as diagnoses, ostensibly gout with 4. 6 %, were reported in 10. 5 % of the autopsies. Neoplasms, deformities and intoxications were less in frequency. 847 cases of illness, 16. 6 % of all birds examined, had potential for zoonotic importance. 460 birds were infected with Mycobacterium avium, 279 with Salmonella spp., 100 with Chlamydophila psittaci and eight with Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. The frequency of occurrence of the infections with Mycobacterium avium is nearly constant over the 22 years. In contrast the salmonellosis was more often seen in the first part of the period of examination, infections with Chlamydophila psittaci in the second part. 309 birds were euthanized mainly due to traumatic injuries or bacterial infections. All in all the findings are similar to other examinations but show in several diseases some differences. The results may help the veterinarian during the clinical diagnostics and so contribute to reduce the avian losses by taking prophylactic and therapeutic measures...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we decided}} to throw light on some aspects of donkeys’ helminths {{infestation}} and treatment, and to provide baseline data pertaining to some blood constituents of normal healthy donkeys which is, according to our knowledge, non existent or too meagre. In a field survey 1200 donkeys from Khartoum State were examined parasitically {{for the presence of}} helminth parasites by assessment of faecal eggs for a complete year (one hundred animals per month). Generally, 70. 1 % of the examined animals harboured a <b>parasitical</b> <b>infection.</b> Six nematodes genera were encountered in donkeys, among them Dictyocaulus arnfieldi (70. 5 %) reported {{for the first time in}} Sudanese donkeys. Strongylus spp. (35. 8 %), Cyathostomes (36. 7 %), Parascris equorum (10. 7 %), Trichostrongylus axei (12 %), and Strongyloides westeri (3. 4 %). The incidence of infection with single species (53. 2 %) was found higher than that of mixed infection (46. 7 %). The order of degree of infection was, 58. 6 % animals showed mild infection, while 21. 9 % and 19. 5 % of them showed moderate and severe infection, respectively. In the current study, cold season encouraged higher incidence of gastrointestinal nematodes (34. 48 %), more so than hot (32. 94 %) and rainy (32. 58 %) seasons. Other results obtained, showed that hot season revealed higher mean EPG count (1198. 7 ± 558. 3) ranging from (100 to 17700), followed by the rainy season with mean EPG (961. 2 ± 120. 3) ranging from (100 to 13500), and cold season with mean EPG (888. 6 ± 297. 5) ranging from (100 to 13300). Twenty donkeys (10 male and 10 female) were used to study the seasonal variation in blood biochemical constituents and to obtain normal values and reference range of the donkey’s blood. They were kept for a whole year in the premises of the Department of Radioisotopes, Soba. Blood samples were collected bimonthly from the donkeys. Haematological parameters studied include packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin concentration (Hb), total white blood cell count (WBC), and Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Serum biochemical constituents measured include: total serum protein, albumin, total globulin, total bilirubin, urea, creatinine, uric acid, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, sphingolipids, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), inorganic phosphorus, calcium, copper, zinc, sodium and potassium. Hormonal parameters studied were: thyroxine (T 4), triiodothyronine (T 3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In this study for the first time we did the fractionation of the phospholipids using high performance liquid chromatography technique. Serum thyroxine (T 4), triiodothyronine (T 3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were assayed in normal male and female donkeys by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunoradiometric assay (IRMA), respectively. Male donkeys had low serum concentrations of T 3 (0. 50 ± 0. 21 ng/ml) as compared with the values in female donkeys (0. 53 ± 0. 21 ng/ml). Females had lower T 4 values (6. 28 ± 5. 21 ng/ml) as compared with the values in male donkeys (11. 01 ± 7. 94 ng/ml). There is no difference in TSH concentration in male and female donkeys (0. 86 ± 0. 14 and 0. 86 ± 0. 14 mIU/ml respectively). A total of 50 male and female donkeys, 4 - 10 years of age and naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes were utilized in a controlled experiment to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Doramectin 1 % Injectable formulation at the dosage rate of 200 μg Doramectin per kg of live body weight applied intramuscularly and subcutaneously, and Ivermectin 1 % commercial Injectable formulation at 200 μg Ivermectin per kg body weight applied intramuscularly. Animals were allocated to three treatment groups each of 16 donkeys based on pre-treatment eggs per gram (EPG) counts and treatments were randomized among the groups. Faecal egg counts were performed for the first week after treatment and then every week for 4 consecutive weeks. Doramectin administered subcutaneously reduced (EPG) count from 1839. 3 ± 1209. 9 on day zero (before treatment) to 57. 1 ± 150. 5 on day 7. Both Doramectin and Ivermectin preparations administered intramuscularly reduced initial EPG from a mean of 1553. 6 ± 968. 2 and 1545. 0 ± 1589. 6 to 0 on Days 6 and 7 and at the end of the trial on Day 28, respectively. Efficacy percentages of Doramectin and Ivermectin against immature and adult nematodes were as follows: Trichostrongylus axei, Parascaris equorum, Strongylus spp., Triodontophorus spp., Cyathostomes spp., Oxyuris equi, and Strongyloides westeri 100 % for both products. Gasterophilus spp. was not found in donkeys from either treated group, while two of control donkeys had infections with this parasite. Doramectin when injected subcutaneously showed greater efficacy (96. 5 %) than Ivermectin (69. 2 %) against Strongylus vulgaris larvae found in the mesenteric artery aneurisms. No significant differences were noted between Doramectin and Ivermectin. Efficacy against the gastrointestinal nematode species found in this study was very evident for the efficacy of both products. No adverse reactions were observed during the experimental period. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of medication with Doramectin Injectable formulation in donkeys naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes. Twenty male and female donkeys naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes received single injection of Doramectin either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Before treatment at day zero and then every four days post treatment for 28 days, blood samples were collected from the animals and subjected to serumbiochemical analysis. Results obtained although showed some significant changes in some parameters, but they were within the normal range suggested by other researchers. At the end of the experiment all the parameters measured were at the normal level. Another study was conducted to evaluate the sub acute toxicity of Doramectin Injectable formulation in healthy donkeys. This experiment involved four groups of animals, each of five. Three treatment groups received Doramectin injection intramuscularly at 100, 200 and 300 μg/kg body weight for seven continuous days, and blood samples were collected daily for the first week and then every week for 4 additional weeks. Results obtained from the treatment groups were compared with those of the control group. Only urea level showed significant increase (P 0. 05) from that of the control animals, so it is concluded that Doramectin Injectable formulation injected at a dose rate of 100, 200 and 300 μg/kg body weight in donkeys for a whole week did not have any toxic or adverse effects...|$|R
30|$|Mild {{steel is}} a {{familiar}} material employed widely {{in a variety of}} industries. But the main problem of using mild steel is its dissolution in acidic solutions. In various industrial processes, acid solutions are commonly used for removal of rust and scale. Use of inhibitors in these processes to prevent metal dissolution is very common [1, 2, 3]. Most of the well-known acid inhibitors are organic compounds containing nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen, heterocyclic compounds with a polar functional group and conjugated double bond [4, 5, 6, 7]. These compounds are adsorbed on the metallic surface and block the active corrosion sites [8]. Most of the synthetic chemicals are costly, toxic to both human being and the environment. To solve the above defects, it is necessary to develop cheap, non-toxic and environmentally friendly natural products as corrosion inhibitors. These natural organic compounds are either synthesized or extracted from aromatic herbs, spices and medicinal plants. Plant extracts are an incredibly rich source of naturally synthesized chemical compounds that can be extracted by simple procedures with low cost and are biodegradable in nature. The use of these natural compounds extracted from leaves or seeds as corrosion inhibitors have been reported by several authors [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Subramania et al. [17] studied the corrosion inhibition of leaf extracts of curry leaves, henna leaves as well as extracts from seeds of Jack fruit and tamarind on mild steel corrosion in acidic solutions. Other than the plant extracts, pure organic compounds extracted from natural products such as piperine [18], Ellagic acid, tannic acid [19], tryptamine [20], caffeine [21], Pennyroyal oil [22], amino acids [23] and caffeic acid [24] have also been used for inhibition of corrosion. Hyptis suaveolens is easily available in India. It is a medium-sized forest tree which has 2  m height and belongs to Lamiaceae family. It is commonly known as Wilayati tulasi. It is also used for <b>parasitical</b> cutaneous diseases, <b>infection</b> of uterus, and as sudorific in catarrhal condition, skin disease, headache, stomachache and snuff to stop bleeding of the nose. The extract of this plant contains numerous naturally environmental organic compounds. The genus of H. suaveolens is known to contain significant amount of volatile oils, starch, protein, tannins, saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids and glycosides [25, 26]. The leaf of the plant is biodegradable and a renewable material.|$|R
40|$|Background. Early {{recognition}} of bacterial infection and antibiotic treatment {{are very important}} in critically ill patients. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a marker of bacterial infections accompanied by systemic inflammatory response. Higher values were also noticed with <b>parasitical</b> and fungal <b>infections,</b> but PCT is normal in viral and systemic diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether PCT is better marker for bacterial infections than C-reactive protein (CRP) and if they have a prognostic value. Methods. 34 patients were included into our retrospective study. All of them had clinical or laboratory signs of infection at the first PCT determination. We measured PCT, CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SR) and leukocyte count. On the base of microbiological results we divided patients into three groups. Group A had patients with sterile cultures, group B included the ones with negative blood cultures, but from other cultures causative agents were identified. The patients in group C had positive blood cultures. Retrospectively we studied PCT and CRP values among groups and among survivors and non survivors. Results. An average median value of PCT in group A was 8. 9 ± 13. 3 ng/ml, in group B 5. 3 ± 9. 3 ng/ml and in group C 21. 0 ± 25. 0 ng/ml. In group B, the average median value of PCT was significantly higher than in group C (p = 0. 019), but that was not the case in group A (p = 0. 23). The average median values of CRP were 129. 9 ± 67. 4 mg/l in group A, 104. 3 ± 60. 1 mg/l in group B and 117. 4 ± 46. 1 mg/l in group C. Between groups, differences of CRP values were not statistically significant. The average initial value of PCT in group of non survivors (8. 9 ± 49) was not significantly higher then in group of survivors (3. 14 ± 55. 4) (p = 0. 48). The average final value was significantly higher (p = 0. 0013) in group of non survivors (13. 1 ± 23. 9 ng/l) than in group of survivors (0. 55 ± 7. 3 ng/ml). In both groups the average initial values of CRP did not differ significantly (95. 1 ± 116. 4 mg/l; 144. 5 ± 91. 4 mg/l; p = 0. 26), but the average final value of CRP was significantly higher in the non survivors group (115. 5 ± 77. 1 mg/l; 64. 5 ± 48. 2 mg/l; p = 0. 026). </p...|$|R
