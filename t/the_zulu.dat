5|$|The Anglo-Zulu War (also {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> War) was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> Kingdom (Zululand; part of modern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa). Although British and colonial forces under General Lord Chelmsford entered Zululand unopposed, on 11 January 1879, <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> army soon inflicted a heavy defeat on {{them at the}} Battle of Isandlwana, {{in which more than}} 1,300 British and colonial forces were killed. Immediately after the battle, Zulu troops moved onto the small {{garrison}} at Rorke's Drift. Here, just over 150 British and colonial soldiers defended the outpost against 4,000 Zulu warriors. The action was later made famous by the film Zulu. The defence of Rorke's Drift is considered by historians as a masterly defensive action and an example of heroism against overwhelming numbers. Eleven VC recipients received their awards for deeds performed during the defence of the small garrison — one of the largest number awarded for a single action, and the largest number (7) awarded to a single unit (the 2nd/24th Foot) for a single action. The severe losses at Isandlwana resulted in Lord Chelmsford having to abandon his initial invasion plan and to request significant reinforcements before another could be attempted. After these reinforcements arrived, a second invasion was launched in May. The second invasion culminated in the defeat of <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> army at the Battle of Ulundi, on 4 July 1879. The war saw the end of <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> nation's independence as it became a protectorate of the British.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879 had resulted in the imprisonment of <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> king Cetshwayo on Robben Island and the division of <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> Kingdom into 13 chiefdoms. In 1883, after John Colenso, Bishop of Natal, appealed on his behalf, Cetshwayo was released and restored to power. Zibhebhu kaMaphitha, one of the 13 Zulu chiefs, led a force against Cetshwayo and on 22 July 1883 defeated him in Ulundi. Cetshwayo escaped injured but died in February 1884, leaving his son Dinuzulu to inherit the throne. He ultimately succeeded in driving out Zibhebhu {{with the help of}} Transvaal Boers.|$|E
5|$|The war in Zululand {{effectively}} {{ended on}} 4 July 1879 with Chelmsford's decisive victory at <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> capital Ulundi. Around {{the same time}} the British appointed a new Governor and High Commissioner for the Transvaal and Natal, Sir Garnet Wolseley, who introduced a new Transvaal constitution giving the Boers a limited degree of self-government. Wolseley blunted <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> military threat by splitting the kingdom into 13 chiefdoms, and crushed Sekhukhune and the Bapedi during late 1879. He had little success in winning the Boers over to the idea of federation; his defeat of the Zulus and the Bapedi had the opposite effect, as with these two long-standing threats to security removed the Transvaalers could focus all their efforts against the British. Most Boers refused to co-operate with Wolseley's new order; Kruger declined a seat in the new executive council.|$|E

5|$|Around 1821, <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan {{successfully}} {{rebelled against}} King Shaka and created his own clan, the Ndebele. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal, {{leaving a trail}} of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane. When Dutch trekboers converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward. By 1838, the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to vassaldom.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{when the}} British {{declared}} war against <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> Kingdom in Natal, Gandhi at age 36, sympathised with the Zulus, and encouraged the Indian volunteers to help as an ambulance unit. He argued that Indians should {{participate in the}} war efforts to change attitudes and perceptions of the British people against the coloured people. Gandhi, a group of 20 Indians and black people of South Africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers and {{the opposite side of}} the war: Zulu victims.|$|E

Three of Haggard's books are dedicated to Burnham's daughter, Nada: The Wizard (1896), Elissa: The Doom of Zimbabwe (1899), and Black Heart and White Heart: A Zulu Idyll (1900).|$|E

He gave himself up in November 1888, {{and he and his}} uncles Ndabuko and Tshingana were found guilty of high treason in April 1889 and exiled to St Helena. Bishop Colenso's daughter, Harriette, intervened on their behalf in London. On her return to Zululand in August 1893, Clarke invited her to his residence in Etshowe. While there, she was visited by Zulu from across the land. <b>The</b> <b>Zulu</b> people had great affection for Bishop Colenso and his daughter. She persuaded them that Clarke's appointment was beneficial to them and they gave Clarke the nickname 'uKwezi', meaning 'Keeper' or 'Protector'. A sign of this was the release of a number of Dinzulu's followers from prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, General Edmund Allenby was {{commander}} of the Cavalry Division and later the Cavalry Corps in the BEF. His leadership was noted during the retreat from Mons and the first battle of Ypres. After commanding an infantry corps, he was appointed to command the Third Army on the western front. He had previously served in <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> War, the Sudan campaign, and the Second Boer war. In 1917, he was given command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, where he oversaw the conquest of Palestine and Syria in 1917 and 1918. Allenby replaced Archibald Murray, {{who had been the}} Chief of Staff of the British Expeditionary Force in France in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Victoria Cross {{has been}} awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 {{individual}} recipients. The largest number of recipients for one campaign is the First World War, for which 628 medals were awarded to 627 recipients. The largest number awarded for actions on a single day was 24 on 16 November 1857, at the Second Relief of Lucknow, during the Indian Mutiny. The largest number awarded for a single action was 18, for the assault on Sikandar Bagh, during the Second Relief of Lucknow. The largest number awarded to one unit during a single action was 7, to the 2nd/24th Foot, for the defence of Rorke's Drift (22–23 January 1879), during <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> War.|$|E

5|$|The Voortrekkers faced {{competition}} for the area they were entering from Mzilikazi and his Ndebele (or Matabele) people, a recent offshoot from <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> Kingdom to the south-east. On 16 October 1836 the 11-year-old Kruger {{took part in the}} Battle of Vegkop, where Potgieter's laager, a circle of wagons chained together, was unsuccessfully attacked by Mzilikazi and around 4,000–6,000 Matabele warriors. Kruger and the other small children assisted in tasks such as bullet-casting while the women and larger boys helped the fighting men, of whom there were about 40. Kruger could recall the battle in great detail and give a vivid account well into old age.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 1,358 Victoria Crosses have been awarded since 1856 to 1,355 men. There are several {{statistics}} {{related to the}} greatest number of VCs awarded in individual battles or wars. The greatest number of Victoria Crosses won on a single day is 24, for deeds performed on 16 November 1857 in Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny. The greatest number won by a single unit during a single action is seven, to the 2nd/24th Foot, for the defence of Rorke's Drift, 22–23 January 1879, during <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> War. The greatest number won in a single conflict is 628, being for the First World War. There are only six living holders of the VC—four British, one Australian, one Gurkha—one award for the Second World War and four awards since; in addition one New Zealander holds the Victoria Cross for New Zealand and four Australians hold the Victoria Cross for Australia. Eight of the then-twelve surviving holders of the Victoria Cross attended the 150th Anniversary service of remembrance at Westminster Abbey on 26 June 2006.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} year in office, Clarke {{established}} good order in the colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as an affront, Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble so long as the policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna. He began the process for the return of Dinuzulu and sought to harness the authority of <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> leader to the administration. In January 1895, the exiles received notice of their return to Zululand with an official position for Dinuzulu. Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|E
50|$|For centuries, the Nguni peoples {{are thought}} to have lived in {{scattered}} patrilineal chiefdoms, cultivating cereal crops such as millet and raising cattle. The current geographic distribution of Nguni peoples largely reflects the turbulent political developments and population movements of the 19th century. In the 1820s <b>the</b> cattle-herding <b>Zulu,</b> led by their king Shaka, embarked on an aggressive campaign of conquest and expansion known as the mfecane. Shaka's large and well-armed armies conquered a number of neighboring peoples, and sent others fleeing. Some Nguni groups adopted <b>the</b> <b>Zulu's</b> methods of warfare and used them to subjugate the peoples in whose territory they ultimately settled.|$|R

5|$|The Dutch East India Company {{had founded}} the Cape Colony on the {{southern}} tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the East Indies. Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large Afrikaner (or Boer) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the Flanders Campaign. British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s. In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the Sotho and <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> nations. Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic (1852–77; 1881–1902) and the Orange Free State (1854–1902). In 1902 Britain occupied both republics, concluding a treaty with the two Boer Republics following the Second Boer War (1899–1902).|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the British I Corps in 1914 was Douglas Haig. French had remarked in 1912 that Haig would be better suited to {{a position on the}} staff than a field command. Like French, Haig was a cavalryman. His last active command had been during the Second Boer War, first as a senior staff officer in the cavalry division, then commanding a brigade-sized group of columns. The first {{commander of}} the British II Corps was Lieutenant General James Grierson, a noted tactician who {{died of a heart attack}} soon after arriving in France. French wished to appoint Lieutenant General Herbert Plumer in his place, but against French's wishes, Kitchener instead appointed Lieutenant General Horace Smith-Dorrien, who had begun his military career in <b>the</b> <b>Zulu</b> War in 1879 and was one of only five officers to survive the battle of Isandlwana. He had built a formidable reputation as an infantry commander during the Sudan Campaign and the Second Boer War. After the Second Boer War, he was responsible for a number of reforms, notably forcing an increase in dismounted training for the cavalry. This was met with hostility by French (as a cavalryman). By 1914, French's dislike for Smith-Dorrien was well known within the army.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{express services}} were often given nicknames by railwaymen but these names later appeared officially in timetables, on headboards {{carried on the}} locomotive, and on roofboards above {{the windows of the}} carriages. For instance, the late-morning Flying Dutchman express between London and Exeter was named after the winning horse of the Derby and St Ledger races in 1849. Although withdrawn at the end of 1867, the name was revived in 1869– following a request from the Bristol and Exeter Railway– and the train ran through to Plymouth. An afternoon express was instigated on the same route in June 1879 and became known as <b>The</b> <b>Zulu.</b> A third West Country express was introduced in 1890, running to and from Penzance as The Cornishman. A new service, the Cornish Riviera Express ran between London and Penzance– non-stop to Plymouth– from 1 July 1904, although it ran only in the summer during 1904 and 1905 before becoming a permanent feature of the timetable in 1906.|$|E
