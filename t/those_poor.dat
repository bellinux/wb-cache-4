25|$|Of the 110,000 Japanese Americans {{detained}} by the United States government during World War II, 30,000 were children. Most were school-age children, so educational facilities {{were set up}} in the camps. Allowing them to continue their education, however, did not erase the potential for traumatic experiences during their overall time in the camps. The government had not adequately planned for the camps, and no real budget or plan was set aside for the new camp educational facilities. Camp schoolhouses were crowded and had insufficient materials, books, notebooks, and desks for students. Not only that the education/instruction was all in English, the schools in Japanese Internment Camps also didn't have any books or supplies to go on as they opened. The state decided to issue a few books only a month after the opening. Wood stoves were used to heat the buildings, and instead of using separate rooms for different kinds of activities only partitions were used to accomplish that. Japanese Internment Camps also did not have any libraries (and consequently no library books), writing arm chairs or desks, and no science equipment. These ‘schoolhouses’ were essentially prison blocks that contained few windows. In the Southwest, when temperatures rose and the schoolhouse filled, the rooms would be sweltering and unbearable. Class sizes were immense. At the height of it attendance, the Rohwer Camp of Arkansas reached 2,339, with only 45 certified teachers. The student to teacher ratio in the camps was 48:1 in elementary schools and 35:1 for secondary schools, compared to the national average of 28:1. This was due to a few things. One of them was that there was a general teacher shortage in the US at the moment, {{and the fact that the}} teachers were required to live in <b>those</b> <b>poor</b> conditions in the camps themselves. “There was persistent mud or dust, heat, mosquitoes, poor food and living conditions, inadequate instructional supplies, and a half mile or more walk each day just to and from the school block”. Despite the triple salary increase in the internment camps, they were still unable to fill in all the needed teacher positions with certified personnel, and so in the end they had to hire non-certified teacher detainees to help out the teachers as assistants.|$|E

[...] Increasing industrialization caused the population of mill towns to grow exponentially in the mid-19th century {{at the expense of}} rural towns, many of which were left all but abandoned, especially in western Massachusetts. [...] Adding to the crisis was the phenomenon of westward movement and the lure of cheap land in the Midwest. The agricultural education movement in Massachusetts, in reaction to this crisis, had highly moralistic tones. [...] Clark criticized those who left New England, writing, [...] "Will a wise man exchange the beautiful and diversified scenery of New England... Will he forsake the school and churches and the social privileges of prosperous communities for the semi-barbarous condition of newly and sparsely settled districts?"

He viewed slavery as an institution recognized in the Constitution, and entitled to federal protection wherever it existed (Lincoln held the same public position until August 1862). McClellan's writings after the war were typical of many Northerners: [...] "I confess to a prejudice in favor of my own race, & can't learn to like the odor of either Billy goats or niggers." [...] But in November 1861, {{he wrote to his}} wife, [...] "I will, if successful, throw my sword onto the scale to force an improvement in the condition of <b>those</b> <b>poor</b> blacks." [...] He later wrote that had it been his place to arrange the terms of peace, he would have insisted on gradual emancipation, guarding the rights of both slaves and masters, as part of any settlement. But he made no secret of his opposition to the radical Republicans. He told Ellen, [...] "I will not fight for the abolitionists." [...] This put him in opposition with officials of the administration who believed he was attempting to implement the policies of the opposition party.|$|E
