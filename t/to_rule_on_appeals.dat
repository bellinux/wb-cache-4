The cabinet also set a 60-day limit for the Supreme Court's Appellate Division <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> <b>appeals,</b> to keep the cases moving. This means that those who have been convicted and sentenced to death could be executed this year if their verdicts survive appeal.

Chatigny dismissed the federal fourth amendment claims in March 2004, but left alone the state claims relating to the ruination of Van de Velde's career.

50|$|Advertising, sale, and lending of AnyDVD is outlawed in Germany (but {{possession}} is not), as it removes copy prevention from DVDs. The Heise news portal was sued by {{the record}} industry for linking to SlySoft's website in a news report. The publisher subsequently counter sued with claims of violation of their constitutionally guaranteed {{freedom of the press}} and has, as of April 2007, lost two appeal proceedings. The German Federal Constitutional Court decided not <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> Heise's <b>appeal</b> for the time being because remedies in the ordinary courts had not been exhausted. In October 2010, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany decided in favor of Heise. This verdict is now legally binding. The legal status of AnyDVD in other countries is unclear.|$|R

50|$|Hsu {{was first}} elected to the Legislative Yuan in 1998. During his 2001 reelection campaign, Hsu was indicted for electoral fraud on 22 November, {{becoming}} the first-ever legislative candidate in Taiwanese history {{to be charged with}} electoral fraud before the election had passed. By 2 December, just a day after polls closed, Hsu was one of four candidates to be charged with buying votes. In June 2002, Taiwan Solidarity Union lawmaker Su Ying-kwei accused Democratic Progressive Party legislators Hsu, Cheng Tsao-min, and Liang Mu-yang of interference in construction bids at the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant. A legislative committee was specially convened to investigate the charges. In May 2003, the Taiwan High Court found Hsu guilty of accepting NT$3.95 million in kickbacks in a separate case dating back to 1994, when he was mayor of Daliao. The Supreme Court refused <b>to</b> <b>rule</b> <b>on</b> Hsu's <b>appeal</b> of the 1994 case in 2005. As a result, Hsu was expelled from the legislature, and his Democratic Progressive Party membership suspended.|$|R
