5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they are}} fished for {{wherever}} they are found, slipper lobsters have not {{been the subject of}} such intense fishery as spiny lobsters or true lobsters. <b>The</b> <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> catching slipper lobsters varies depending on the species' ecology. Those that prefer soft substrates, such as Thenus and Ibacus, are often caught by trawling, while those that prefer crevices, caves and reefs (including Scyllarides, Arctides and Parribacus species) are usually caught by scuba divers.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, the UNDP {{reacted to}} the {{criticism}} and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to The Economist in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded to a 6 January 2011 article in the magazine which discusses the Wolff et al. paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the calculation of the HDI and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff et al. in that it generates a system for continuously updating the human development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2010, BLM issued a set of draft {{strategy}} documents for operating its wild horse programs, and solicited public comment on the plans. After receiving numerous comments, BLM said in February 2011 it would quicken the pace at which it made revisions to its roundup procedures, use of fertility control drugs, and wild horse and burro range land management. The agency also commissioned a study from the National Academies of Science (NAS) on wild-horse management. In September 2011, BLM announced it would begin working with the Humane Society of the United States to develop new practices in herd management and roundup, and increase its emphasis on adoptions {{and the use of}} drugs as fertility control to help better manage its wild horse herds. The results of the study by the NAS were released in June 2013, and covered a wide variety of issues, including the carrying capacity of wild horse and burro ranges, wild horse and burro population growth, and best practices in fertility control. Overall, the NAS was critical of the BLM, saying that herd populations were increasing at an [...] "unsustainable rate" [...] and that the [...] "BLM fails to effectively use contraception tools", criticizing <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> estimating populations and available forage, and stating that the agency has failed to communicate appropriately with the public. This report applied to all BLM-managed equine populations, and was not specific to the PMWHR.|$|E

2500|$|Concerns {{were raised}} that the 1957 {{regulations}} were too lax. At the FIDE Congress in 1961, GM Milan Vidmar {{said that the}} regulations [...] "made it possible to award international titles to players without sufficient merit". At the 1964 Congress in Tel Aviv, a subcommittee was formed to propose changes to the regulations. The subcommittee recommended that the automatic award of titles be abolished, criticized <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> awarding titles based on qualifying performances, {{and called for a}} change in the makeup of the Qualification Committee. Several delegates supported the subcommittee recommendations, including GM Miguel Najdorf who felt that existing regulations were leading to an inflation of international titles. At the 1965 Congress in Wiesbaden FIDE raised the standards required for international titles. The International Grandmaster title regulations were: ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{representations}} of peasant port {{date from the}} fourteenth century. In Codex Latinus Parisinus, written during 1395–1396 by Paulus Sanctinus Ducensis, military engineer of King Sigismund of Luxembourg, besides portraits of knights and footmen appear described ancillaries of the army: craftsmen, cartmen, fishermen. In Chronicon Pictum Vindobonense are portrayed men in white shirts and trousers (...) [...] Over they wore shaggy sarici with long sleeves and left on back. They wore simple leather shoes (...) [...] In a simple comparative analysis it can be grasped that these elements are always present in the port of remote shepherds. Diaries of foreign travelers, particularly those of Antonio Maria Del Chiaro Fiorentino (secretary of Italian language of Constantin Brâncoveanu) and officer Friedrich Schwanz von Springfels contain rich information about the garments of Romanians: ladies, patronesses and peasant women wore identically tailored shirts, distinct being only <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> decoration.|$|E

2500|$|Proponents for the {{authenticity}} of the Shroud of Turin argue that empirical analysis and scientific methods are insufficient for understanding <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> image formation on the shroud, believing that the image was miraculously produced at the moment of Resurrection. Some proponents have argued that the image on the shroud can be explained with scientific evidence that supports the Gospel narrative. John Jackson (a member of STURP) proposed that the image was formed by radiation methods beyond the understanding of current science, in particular via the [...] "collapsing cloth" [...] onto a body that was radiating energy at the moment of resurrection. However, STURP member Alan Adler has stated that Jackson's theory is not generally accepted as scientific, given that it runs counter to the laws of physics. In 1989 physicist Thomas Phillips speculated that the Shroud image was formed by neutron radiation due to a miraculous bodily resurrection.|$|E
