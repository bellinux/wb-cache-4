5000|$|Of course <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> [...] "productive for what?".

POP creates specific goals in tackling tangible problems. Productivity is determined by resolving problems. If tickets and arrests help do that, they are employed. If they don't help that, then other more creative strategies are employed. Consequently, the actual reason tension and resentment arises is because officers are ill-trained in creative problem-solving and feel they do not get adequate supervision or time to do POP.|$|R
