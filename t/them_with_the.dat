5|$|Players {{control a}} monocle- and pith helmet–wearing Velociraptor driving a jeep. The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> jeep or crushing <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> spiked ball which is dragged behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be dragged to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E

During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip {{commanded}} {{the right wing}} and Alexander the left, accompanied {{by a group of}} Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed <b>them.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.|$|E

But with Tamura's battalion shattered after losing three-quarters of its officers and men, and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well, Kawaguchi's assault on the ridge had effectively ended. About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80, perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123. At first light, three U.S. Army P-400 Airacobra fighters from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field, acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey, strafed the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of <b>them,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> few survivors retreating back into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|At night, Evelyn {{takes the}} Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally {{awakening}} Imhotep. The expeditions return to Cairo, but Imhotep follows <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of Beni. Imhotep returns to full strength by killing the Americans one by one, and brings the ten plagues back to Egypt. Seeking {{a way to}} stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. Ardeth hypothesizes that Imhotep wants to resurrect Anck-su-Namun again and plans to do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn believes that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of the Living can kill him again, and deduces the book's whereabouts. Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the rest of the group.|$|E
5|$|At present, some 192 spells are known, {{though no}} single {{manuscript}} contains them all. They served {{a range of}} purposes. Some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify <b>them</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum. Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the deceased control over the world around him. Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E
