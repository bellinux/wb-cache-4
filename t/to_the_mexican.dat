50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> raised <b>the</b> {{white flag}} a ceasefire began, and Lieutenant Maus {{approached}} <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> line with Tom Horn. The two talked with <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> {{for a while}} and concluded that <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> were after scalps for the high bounty established by <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> government. One scalp of an Apache warrior was worth 200 silver pesos while a woman or a child's scalp was worth 100. Eventually Tom Horn went back to his side of the lines, leaving Lieutenant Maus alone with <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans.</b> As <b>the</b> lieutenant attempted <b>to</b> leave, <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> demanded that they be given some mules to transport their wounded. Maus agreed, so six mules were given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> made a gesture as though they would not let Maus go, so the scouts let out a loud war cry, which frightened <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> into freeing <b>the</b> lieutenant.|$|R

5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was issued for the coastal locations north of Belize City with the forecast of 150mph (240km/h) winds. The government instituted a dusk-to-dawn curfew from Belize City <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> border. On August 16and17, Prime Minister Said Musa chaired two meetings of Belize's National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO). He instructed {{the newly created}} Coastguard to evacuate popular tourist sites Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye by boat and plane. Authorities also evacuated Belize City's three hospitals, moving high-risk patients inland to the capital Belmopan. The mayor urged residents to leave Belize City and {{to make use of}} shelters in the capital.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} Letcher signed the treaty, Clayton was {{replaced}} as Secretary of State by Daniel Webster. In response to concerns raised {{by one of}} the Americans hoping to construct the line of transit, Webster asked that Letcher attempt to obtain certain modifications to the treaty. Letcher brought these modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> diplomats, but they steadfastly refused to accept them. Letcher, speaking with the blessing of the administration, intimated that the United States would take the region by force if the requested concessions were not made. The Mexican government conceded {{that they would not be}} able to resist such action, but still refused to accept the modifications to the treaty.|$|E

5|$|After the Taft-Díaz summit, Burnham led {{a team of}} 500 men in {{guarding}} mining properties {{owned by}} Hammond, J. P. Morgan, and the Guggenheims in the Mexican state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, {{a long series of}} Mexican revolutions began. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> government.|$|E
5|$|After {{the floods}} receded, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo ordered the Department of National Defense to utilize all {{resources}} {{to assist the}} people affected by the floods. More than 94,000people stayed at 896shelters after being evacuated due to the floods. The federal government allocated $234million (2.34 billion pesos) in relief, which was smaller than the damage total. Widespread medical teams assisted {{tens of thousands of}} homes, and due to prevention measures, there were no outbreaks of diseases. Roads and electrical systems were gradually restored, and students returned to school after repairs were made. Residents throughout Mexico sent supplies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Red Cross, including 500tons of food and water, and international agencies sent money and supplies to the flood victims.|$|E

Following his departure from the Negro leagues in 1950, Day spent a season with the semi-professional Winnipeg Buffalos of the Mandak League. Finally, in 1951 Day made his debut in organized baseball, albeit in the minors, with the Toronto Maple Leafs, a Triple-A club that Day tallied a 1–1 record with in 14 games. Day also played for two other teams in the farm system, the Scranton Miners and the Edmonton Eskimos, before retiring from professional baseball in 1955.|$|E

She was modernized in 1910, but did not operate again until 1915, when she sailed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> coast, where she stayed until 1916.

5|$|On August 20, a {{tropical}} wave became discernible about 800miles (1300km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico, which in the next day developed a large area of convection, or thunderstorms. Initially, conditions were unfavorable for development, due to strong upper-level wind shear. Tracking northwestward parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> coast, the system became better organized on August 22, though later that day its structure deteriorated. On August 23, a strong area of convection developed and persisted near a circulation center, despite strong wind shear. With banding features becoming more prominent, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression Eleven-E about 345miles (555km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|On September29, {{shortly after}} Keith formed, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the Yucatán peninsula from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche in Quintana Roo. The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a warning, and {{a tropical storm}} warning and hurricane watch was issued for the Belize coastline from Belize City <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest, and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the Belize coast with only about 24hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the Yucatán peninsula were dropped as Keith weakened.|$|E

5|$|Q'anjob'al {{is spoken}} by 77,700 in Guatemala's Huehuetenango department, with small populations elsewhere. The region of Q'anjobalan {{speakers}} in Guatemala, due to genocidal policies during the Civil War and its close proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> border, {{was the source}} of a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek, and Awakatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as Tuscarawas County, Ohio and Los Angeles, California), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala. Jakaltek (also known as Popti') is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities of Huehuetenango. Another member of this branch is Akatek, with over 50,000 speakers in San Miguel Acatán and San Rafael La Independencia.|$|E
5|$|Storms that {{approach}} the southwestern United States, {{and by extension}} Arizona, generally form closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve northwards {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during {{the latter part of the}} Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. These pronounced troughs thus produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the southwestern United States.|$|E
