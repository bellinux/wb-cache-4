5|$|Representations of lions {{date back}} to the early Upper Paleolithic. The lioness-headed ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany, dubbed Löwenmensch (lion-human) in German. The {{sculpture}} has been determined to be at least 32,000years old from the Aurignacian culture, but it may date to as early as 40,000 years ago. The sculpture has been interpreted as anthropomorphic, giving human characteristics to an animal, however, it also may represent a deity. Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000-year-old Paleolithic cave paintings in the Lascaux caves. Cave lions also are depicted in the Chauvet Cave, discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000years of age, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> of similar or younger age to Lascaux.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the slender}} smooth-hound is diverse, but {{dominated}} by small, benthic bony fishes and decapod crustaceans. It exhibits a specialized form of aplacental viviparity with oophagy: the females produce a single capsule in each uterus that contains 30–80 ova, of which one ovum develops into an embryo that consumes {{the rest of}} the ova and stores the yolk material in its external yolk sac. The growing embryo is mainly sustained by this yolk sac during gestation, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> additionally supplied with histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The typical litter size is two pups, one per uterus. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the slender smooth-hound as Least Concern; it is taken as fishery bycatch but not in great numbers, and furthermore large portions of its range see minimal fishing activity.|$|E

Installation of composite liners with flexible membrane and soil barrier is enforced by the EPA to ensure that leachate is withheld.|$|E

25|$|The {{subject has}} {{attracted}} the attention of various scholars and critics, who have analysed why this form of low art has reached iconic status. <b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> considered frivolous, cat-related internet content contributes to how people interact with media and culture. Some argue that there is a depth and complexity to this seemingly simple content, with a suggestion that the positive psychological effects that pet animals have on their owners also holds true for cat images viewed online.|$|E
25|$|According {{to the law}} of {{conservation}} of energy, no energy is destroyed due to friction, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> lost to the system of concern. Energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including Aristotle, wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force.|$|E
25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church the {{offering}} of first fruits {{takes the form}} of a thanksgiving and blessing. The produce is then consumed by the faithful rather than being given to the Church (<b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> donated as a free-will offering). The liturgical concept behind the blessing is the faithful offering back to God a token of that which he in his lovingkindness has provided, God blessing these firstfruits and returning them to the faithful for their benefit and blessing.|$|E
