For example, during the Medieval Age, according to Benedictus Levita, Thomas Aquinas, and the Malleus Maleficarum, same-sex activities were abhorred as the most deadliest sin of all, which was superbia, i. e. the very pride <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>oneself</b> above God and disobey His will as manifested in His most sacred commandments such as that sodomia (see sodomy), the common Medieval term for these activities, was <b>considered</b> identical <b>to</b> satanism and evil witchcraft, whereas when with the scientific revolution of Early Modernity the responsibility of priests towards sinners increasingly transformed into one of doctors and judges toward those now considered criminally insane, the rationale to keep the ban upon the very same activities along with the ostracization of those who committed such unspeakable [...] "abominations" [...] changed to emphasizing the alleged counter-naturality or perversion of their acts and pathologizing those who desired such.|$|R
5000|$|The novella is {{frequently}} {{interpreted as an}} examination of the duality of human nature, usually expressed as an inner struggle between good and evil, with variations such as human versus animal, civilization versus barbarism sometimes substituted, the main thrust being that of an essential inner struggle between the one and other, and that the failure to accept this tension results in evil, or barbarity, or animal violence, being projected onto others. [...] In Freudian theory, the thoughts and desires banished to the unconscious mind motivate the behaviour of the conscious mind. If someone banishes all evil to the unconscious mind in an attempt to be wholly and completely good, it can result {{in the development of a}} Mr Hyde-type aspect to that person's character. This failure to accept the tension of duality is related to Christian theology, where Satan's fall from Heaven is due to his refusal to accept that he is a created being (that he has a dual nature) and is not God. This idea is suggested when Hyde says to Lanyon, shortly before drinking the famous potion - [...] "...and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan." [...] This is because in Christianity, pride (<b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>oneself</b> as without sin or without evil) is the greatest sin, as it is the precursor to evil itself.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to develop understanding of what underpins the engagement of students in online learning environments. This article reports on a multiple case study that explored student engagement {{in a set of}} postgraduate degrees offered on a fully online basis. The study was based on a theorization of student engagement as the exercise of intentional human action,. or agency. It identified ways in which tasks and social relations in the online learning environments triggered reflexivity on the part of students, with ‘reflexivity’ understood to mean the ordinary mental capacity <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>oneself</b> in relation <b>to</b> one’s social setting. A different relationship between reflexivity and student engagement was in view than that identified by Margaret Archer with regard to reflexivity and social mobility. Rather than displaying one dominant mode of reflexivity, the students considered in the study were seen to draw on a range of modes. The engagement of these students in their learning was also seen to depend on {{the manner in which they}} engaged in reflexivity centred on the pursuit of shared goals, that is in collective reflexivity. Specific practices were seen to trigger constructive forms of collective reflexivity, while fractured and restricted forms of collective reflexivity were linked to student disengagement in relation to joint tasks. As well as adverting to the importance of collective reflexivity to learning, the study highlights scope for dissonance between the modes of reflexivity and practices favoured by an online learning environment and the reflexive profile of the student...|$|R

Consequently, the latter are confronted with an increase of requirements to fulfil, of obstacles to overcome, and, in this context, it seems that <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>oneself</b> capable <b>to</b> respond to such demands is as important as one’s objectively possessed abilities. Numerous research has shown the beneficial aspects of a high perceived self-efficacy. These beneficial aspects and the variable distribution of the level of this feeling among populations led us to hypothesize the normative nature of this perceived self-efficacy. Three populations (line managers, non-managerial employees and students) have responded to a questionnaire on perceived self-efficacy. The executives were asked to indicate, for each item, whether they would appreciate (or not) an employee adopting the behaviour listed in the item; the non-executives were required to indicate the degree to which each proposal corresponded to their usual behaviour, and the students were asked to select the items that an employee should tick off in order to be well seen (vs. badly seen) by their supervisor. Our results confirm our hypothesis: managers significantly appreciate employees who show a high level of perceived self-efficacy (SEP). We also note that adopting such behaviours is effective among non-executives, meaning that, if we take into consideration the fact that self-presentation with neutral instructions often produces socially desirable responses, the employees are aware of this valorisation. Finally, we see that such awareness is directly confirmed by our third population, i. e., {{by the fact that the}} future employees, in this case the students, are indeed aware of this valorisation...|$|R
5000|$|Prelest (from прелесть, from лесть - cajolery; (charm, seduction), πλάνη - plani), {{also known}} as: spiritual delusion, spiritual deception, delusion, illusion, - {{according}} to Holy Fathers of Orthodox Church, a false spiritual state, a spiritual illness, [...] "a wounding {{of human nature}} by falsehood" [...] (St. Ignatius Brianchaninov). The concept of prelest {{should not be confused}} with somatic mental illness of any kind; prelest is rather a spiritual illness, an illness of the soul in its personal relation to God, an illness that originates from vainglory, pride and demonic suggestion and that is to be cured by humility and Holy Sacraments and under the guidance of the spiritual father. In the broadest sense, everyone is in prelest: everyone has some wrong thoughts and views, everyone does not fully understand the meaning of life, the degree of own sinfulness etc. When the word [...] "prelest" [...] is used in the narrow sense, i.e. that some particular person is in the state of prelest, that usually means that this person, initially being on the path of pious Christian life, became possessed with the strongest pride and self-conceit right up to the thought about personal sanctity. <b>To</b> <b>consider</b> <b>oneself</b> a saint - that is a clear prelest because the closer a man is to God, the more he sees his imperfection, and all true saints considered themselves in the feeling of the heart the greatest sinners.

40|$|Prosocial {{behavior}} {{is at the}} heart of functioning societies. In order to investigate the structure of human prosociality, approaches from different research traditions were integrated, ranging from self-reports to economic games and computer-based psychological experiments. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in 187 participants (mean age 41, age range 20 to 55, 61 % female) we identified four reliable and independent factors of human social behavior: prosocial motivation, norm driven behavior, strategizing and self-reported prosociality. After having identified these four subcomponents, we investigated how these changed as a function of subjects practicing different types of mental training techniques throughout three different 3 -month long training modules focusing on a) attention and interoceptive awareness (Presence), b) loving kindness and prosocial motivation (Affective), and c) metacognitive skills as well as perspective taking on self and others (Perspective). Results revealed that prosocial motivation was enhanced by all three modules, but most efficiently after the affect-based training. Norm-driven behavior in contrast was reduced by all practices, but mostly so by the metacognition and perspective taking based training. Interestingly, changes in self-reported prosociality did not correlate with changes in actually observed prosocial or norm-driven behavior. Thus, the present results provide evidence that the tendency <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>oneself</b> as prosocial does not necessarily relate to one’s actual prosocial behavior neither before nor after training. Moreover, we show that prosocial preferences and behavior are not stable, but can be differentially altered by engaging some months in specific mental training practices. This has theoretical and practical implications for economical and psychological research as well as for large-scale trainings that aim for societal changes and caring economics...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the term}} "Art Lover" is {{something}} that our society uses in everyday language, {{little is known about}} what this term means. How do museum visitors characterize the Art Lover? How does an Art Lover's experience of art differ from that of a Non-Art Lover? In answering these two questions, this study seeks to understand a museum visitor's self-identification as an Art Lover and the role that this identification plays in the quality of their museum experience. Using a framework of Ethnomethodology and Marketing Research techniques, a written questionnaire consisting of thirty-five questions was administered. In April 2003, over one-hundred visitors to the Montreal Museum of Fine Art completed the questionnaire. Seven visitors participated in follow-up interviews. It was found that 22 % of museum attendees in this study do not consider themselves Art Lovers. Analysis of both questionnaire and interview results revealed that all participants [...] regardless of their love for art [...] shared many of the same responses, emotions, and behaviours. However, in comparing the experiences of Art Lovers to Non-Art Lovers, a marked difference was found in the relative intensities and values associated with these motives, emotions, and behaviours. Art Lovers expressed a high level of intensity in their desire to seek out museum experiences and subsequently reported an elevated level of satisfaction with their experience of the exhibition. The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>oneself</b> an Art Lover is directly and positively related to the quality of an individual's museum experience.

When we don’t relate ourselves to the life-cycle of birth and death; realizing everything belongs to the universe and not <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> <b>oneself</b> the owner of any earthly objects or relations makes one detached from the self.

When we deny the self, along we deny any belongings and possessions of the particular self, making ourselves out of the daily worldly life. Hence we realize true nature of the self, the Soul. State of Being Conscious, Sub-Conscious and Un-Conscious When we are aware of the self and in the present, it is in the conscious state.

Women and older people more often reported to diet, as did people with higher weights. In line with our hypothesis, food concerns (weight concerns and concerns about the diet–health link) were most strongly associated with dieting. <b>Considering</b> <b>oneself</b> as a dieter was weakly related to actual snack consumption whereas food concerns were unrelated to the consumption of snacks. <b>Considering</b> <b>oneself</b> as a dieter in terms of endorsing items on a restraint scale is an expression of food concerns that is virtually unaccompanied by changes in food intake.
