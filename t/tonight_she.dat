Power's mother, Margaret Power, was interviewed on 13 February 2007 edition of Today <b>Tonight.</b> <b>She</b> said that her daughter {{was telling the truth}} and then suggested that Mercedes Corby also take a polygraph test, expressing her belief that she would fail it.|$|E
500|$|In a November 18, 2014 {{interview}} with Dickinson on Entertainment <b>Tonight,</b> <b>she</b> stated the initial version of No Lifeguard on Duty {{was different from}} what became the final published product. Dickinson said she wrote about a traumatic experience where she said Bill Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982 {{at a hotel in}} Lake Tahoe, California. [...] She stated that Cosby supplied her with red wine and then medicated her with drugs and subsequently raped her at the hotel. According to Dickinson, both Cosby himself and his attorneys persuaded the author and her publisher HarperCollins to delete mention of the incident from her book prior to publication. A few hours after the interview was publicized on Entertainment Tonight, Netflix made the decision to postpone its Cosby comedy film special Bill Cosby 77 from its lineup.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{made several}} {{appearances}} {{on television and}} in live shows to promote 4. She performed [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] {{for the first time on}} May 17, 2011, on Surprise Oprah! A Farewell Spectacular at the United Center in Chicago. She also performed the song at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards. On May 25, [...] "1+1" [...] was made available for download through the iTunes Store in the United States. The same day, [...] "1+1" [...] was performed at the American Idol final; she introduced it as her favorite song. In June, she performed at the Palais Nikaia in Nice, Zénith de Lille, and the Galaxie in Amnéville. On June 26, Beyoncé was the closing act at the Glastonbury Festival 2011 in the United Kingdom. She was the first solo female artist to headline the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival in more than twenty years. A pre-taped performance of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] "End of Time" [...] at the Glastonbury Festival was broadcast during the 2011 BET Awards. The following day, Beyoncé's exclusive hour-long interview with Piers Morgan in London was broadcast on Piers Morgan <b>Tonight.</b> <b>She</b> also appeared on the finale of France's X Factor to perform [...] "Run the World" [...] and [...] "Best Thing I Never Had". An MTV television special, Beyoncé: Year of 4, premiered on June 30, documenting Beyoncé's life during 4s production.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} the song is yet another Ric Ocasek double-entendre, although, as Elliot Easton said, [...] "It doesn't {{actually}} say that she reaches orgasm. It could mean that <b>tonight</b> <b>she's</b> coming over to make popcorn." ...|$|R

500|$|Later in the series, Ellen Pompeo {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} with numerous critics lauding her {{portrayal of the}} character. Reviewing the episode She's Leaving Home CarterMatt called her the [...] "anchor" [...] for Grey's saying, [...] "Throughout, this was an episode completely anchored by Ellen Pompeo, who has done some of her best work ever on the show {{the past couple of}} weeks. <b>Tonight,</b> <b>she</b> cried, she fought, and she learned that she was carrying his child." [...] and added that Pompeo is often [...] "ovelooked" [...] saying, [...] "Her subtlety is probably why she is often overlooked." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it reviewing [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] wrote, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen {{for more than half of}} it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] USA Today also lauded Pompeo saying, [...] " [...] In some ways, the episode (How to Save a Life) was even more of a showcase for Pompeo. She had some of the more memorable and well-played scenes, from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Palopoli of Metro Silicon Valley said, [...] "Musically, {{the show}} is heavy on the hits, {{although}} considering Britney as a musical phenomenon is like asking which of Madonna's albums is best. She's a cultural phenomenon, obviously, and the only edicts {{that seem to have}} been handed down in regards to the music is 'no lip-synching' (she definitely doesn't) and 'bigger and louder whenever possible.'" [...] Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter stated it was [...] "entertaining", but Spears [...] "doesn’t quite have that spring in her dance step anymore and who requires a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits". Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune deemed the show as [...] "a mess pretty much from start to finish. The theatrics are awkward and confusing, the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat, the song selection is weak and misguided, and Britney's star power, so blinding on tours past, is remarkably dim." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the show two stars out of five, saying that [...] "there's a suspicion that {{the kind of person who}} goes to see Britney Spears live isn't really there for the music or her sparkling personality: <b>tonight</b> <b>she</b> seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever. What they're interested in is proximity to a global celebrity." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave the show one star out of five, and called it [...] "the saddest, laziest, dullest and most tawdry pop concert I have ever witnessed." [...] He added that [...] "the most amazing thing about the whole second-rate spectacle was that thousands of people, having forked out around £50 a head for tickets, practically raised the roof, cheering every dismal dance move, roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pete Townshend, who {{performed}} with The Who {{later in the}} same morning after Joplin finished, witnessed her performance and said the following in his 2012 memoir: [...] "She had been amazing at Monterey, but <b>tonight</b> <b>she</b> wasn't at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, {{to the amount of}} booze and heroin she'd consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible." ...|$|E

60|$|Thomasin sat in {{an inner}} room and heard Venn's voice. When {{customers}} were present she seldom showed herself, owing to her inherent dislike for the business; but perceiving {{that no one}} else was there <b>tonight</b> <b>she</b> came out.|$|E
60|$|CAPT. M. Are you sure? Looking at {{the matter}} in a cold-blooded light, the Wife is {{provided}} for {{even if you were}} wiped out <b>tonight.</b> <b>She</b> has an ancestral home to go to, money and the Brigadier to carry on the illustrious name.|$|E
50|$|She {{hosted the}} {{television}} show Good Take, which aired on IBC-13. From November 2, 2009, she replaced Thea Gavino as the news anchor of IBC News <b>Tonight</b> until <b>she</b> was replaced by Joee Guilas in 2010.|$|R
6000|$|... "The case of {{the woman}} I will attend to later," [...] replied Obergatz. [...] "I will talk with her <b>tonight</b> after <b>she</b> has {{had a chance to}} meditate upon the {{consequences}} of arousing the wrath of Jad-ben-Otho." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To unroll {{the mummy}} of the cat! Queen Tera will not need her Familiar <b>tonight.</b> If <b>she</b> should want him, {{it might be}} {{dangerous}} to us; so we shall make him safe. You are not alarmed, dear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{made him}} {{long to be}} part of that again, {{therefore}} he valued Rose more at that moment than ever before. [...] "The girl has imagination, she has variety. She is not a simple personality. At the concert she was exalted, rapt, her eyes deep. <b>Tonight</b> <b>she</b> is a school-girl. Then it was Wagner--now it is college horse-play." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{night she}} walked to prayer meeting in the schoolhouse a mile away. She always went, and Spencer was {{generally}} on hand to see her home. He was not there <b>tonight.</b> <b>She</b> wished she had not come. It was dreadful to have to sit still and think. She did not hear a word the minister said.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} one of their quiet evenings. Of late they had fallen into the habit of sitting for long periods {{together}} without speaking. But it had differed from other quiet evenings through the fact that Elizabeth's silence hid a slight but well-defined feeling of injury. Usually she sat happy with her thoughts, but <b>tonight</b> <b>she</b> was ruffled. She had a grievance.|$|E
50|$|Three {{weeks after}} being made {{redundant}} from Sky, STV bosses offered Rona {{a job as}} a co-anchor on the soon-to-be launched Scotland <b>Tonight,</b> after <b>she</b> spotted a post on the Facebook page of STV News anchor, John MacKay.|$|R
60|$|The {{next evening}} Eustacia stood punctually at the fuel-house door, {{waiting for the}} dusk which was to bring Charley with the trappings. Her {{grandfather}} was at home <b>tonight,</b> and <b>she</b> {{would be unable to}} ask her confederate indoors.|$|R
60|$|Huddled in {{the stern}} of the boat she sat with her baby {{strained}} close to her bosom, and because of that little tender, helpless thing <b>she</b> was happier <b>tonight</b> than <b>she</b> had been for many a sorrow-ridden day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, there's {{nothing to}} worry about, dear," [...] she said. [...] "Beatrice {{can take care of}} herself. Perhaps she thought it more tactful to hurry on home <b>tonight.</b> <b>She</b> is really just as kind-hearted as she can be, you know, Philip, {{underneath}} all that pent-up, passionate desire for just a small share of the good things of life. She has wasted so much of herself in longings. Poor child! I sometimes wonder that she is as level-headed as she seems to be. Now I am ready." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Tonight</b> <b>she</b> {{was almost}} girlish. Her {{complexion}} was delicate and perfectly natural, the graceful lines of her figure suggested more the immaturity of youth than any undue slimness. She wore a wonderful collar of pearls around her long, shapely neck, but very little other jewelry. The touch {{of her fingers}} upon Wingrave's coat sleeve was a carefully calculated thing. If he had thought of it, he could have felt the slight appealing pressure with which she led him towards {{one of the smaller}} rooms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the only}} thing {{for us to do}} is to get away from here, as soon as we can. If she finds we don't attack her, <b>tonight,</b> <b>she</b> is sure to send a boat to us, in the morning; and then, if we have an engagement, we could hardly hope to get off without losing some of our spars--even if we were not sunk--with such heavy metal as she carries. We should have the other two craft down on us, too, and our chances of getting away would be worth nothing.|$|E
60|$|Ah, no, {{that was}} for yesterday; {{it is too late}} now. He wanders the streets {{thinking}} of her <b>tonight,</b> but <b>she</b> has forgotten him. In her great hour the man is nothing to the woman; their love is trivial now.|$|R
40|$|Hi Light of My Life – You {{know how}} {{you get the feeling}} of how high you really are when you fly over certain things—like a radio tower or something. Well I got a feeling the other night—sort of a {{realization}} that it had actually been ten months practically since I had seen you—and it didn’t feel a bit good, in fact I felt rather panicky. Usually it just doesn’t seem that long, which is a blessing I guess. Got a letter from Mom <b>tonight,</b> <b>she’s</b> fine, and said she had read in the paper that they were giving leave 2 ̆ 6 would you get any.

60|$|I {{can see her}} {{shining in}} the sky through the little window by my desk, and <b>tonight</b> <b>she</b> seems calling to me again as she has not called before since that long dead night, and I think I can see, across that awful abyss of space, a {{beautiful}} black-haired woman standing {{in the garden of}} a palace, and at her side is a little boy who puts his arm around her as she points into the sky toward the planet Earth, while at their feet is a huge and hideous creature with a heart of gold.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lizzie Paxton and her {{daughter}} are going to clean the school tomorrow, and I heard Lizzie say <b>tonight</b> <b>she</b> meant to be at it by five o'clock to get through before {{the heat of the}} day.

Besides, if I wait till the morning, Aunt Janet may find out that I left it there and she'd never let me wear it again. No, I'm going for it now. If you're afraid," [...] added the Story Girl with delicate scorn, [...] "of course you needn't come." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{evening at}} dinner they met Uncle John again, seated {{opposite}} Aunt Jane {{in the great}} dining hall. The mistress of Elmhurst always dressed for this meal and <b>tonight</b> <b>she</b> wore a rich black silk and had her invalid chair wheeled to her place {{at the head of}} the table. Uncle John had simply changed his old black necktie for a soiled white one. Otherwise his apparel was the same as before, and his stubby gray hair was in a sad state of disarray. But his round face wore a cheerful smile, nevertheless, and Aunt Jane seemed not to observe anything outre in her brother's appearance. And so the meal passed pleasantly enough.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Hawkesby joined Eric Young {{as host of}} {{the late}} news show <b>Tonight,</b> which <b>she</b> fronted on her own for two years after Young left. She left on {{maternity}} leave in late 2006 and has since announced she will not return.|$|R
