5|$|Schubert's piano sonatas seem to {{have been}} mostly {{neglected}} during the entire nineteenth century, often dismissed for being too long, lacking in formal coherence, being un-pianistic, etc. However, references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> sonatas can be found among two nineteenth-century Romantic composers who took serious interest in Schubert's music and were influenced by it: Schumann and Brahms.|$|E

5|$|Another {{composition}} {{from the}} song genre, also mentioned by Fisk and others, as intimately related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> sonatas, and also depicting {{a feeling of}} wandering and homelessness, is the Winterreise (A Winter's Journey) song cycle. Numerous connections between different songs from the cycle and the sonatas, especially the C minor Sonata, have been mentioned. For example: in the C minor Sonata, the first movement's development section recalls the songs Erstarrung and Der Lindenbaum; the second movement and the finale recall the songs Das Wirtshaus, Gefrorne Tranen, Gute Nacht, Auf dem Flusse, Der Wegweiser, and Einsamkeit. These allusions to Winterreise retain the alienated, lonely atmosphere of its songs.|$|E

5|$|As Q3 started, Lewis Hamilton {{stopped in}} the pit lane {{with a loss of}} power and was pushed back into the garage.

He was however beaten to pole position by Ricciardo, who was almost three-tenths of a second faster than second placed Rosberg, with Vettel following in fourth almost a second slower. Nico Hülkenberg managed fifth ahead of Kimi Räikkönen, who was to serve a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, leaving him eleventh on the grid. Carlos Sainz Jr., Sergio Pérez, Daniil Kvyat and Fernando Alonso rounded up the top ten. Ricciardo's pole position was the first for a Renault-powered turbocharged car since Ayrton Senna's front-of-the-grid start at the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix for Lotus.|$|E

Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E
