40|$|Along with {{a number}} of other central banks around the world the Reserve Bank of Australia has quite {{explicitly}} adopted an inflation target. Both the Bank and the Australian Government’s statistical agency (the Australian Bureau of Statistics) report various measures of the underlying rate of inflation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} formulate criteria which an acceptable underlying rate must satisfy and then test to see whether either individually or in combination any of the current (CPI Excluding volatile items; CPI Market prices excluding volatile items; Weighted median and; Trimmed mean) or recently discarded (the <b>Treasury</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>rate)</b> measures of underlying inflation satisfy these criteria. We find that for the period since inflation targeting began (in 1993) none of these underlying series satisfy all of the criteria we propose but that one series (the RBA’s Trimmed mean series) does satisfy the sub-set which we refer to as our ‘necessary criteria’. We then examine the results of an ‘Unobserved Components’ decomposition and argue that it provides useful information on underlying inflation in Australia.

40|$|Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) {{are popular}} tool to {{estimate}} the instantaneous rate of neuronal spike discharges. The problem to choose the histogram bin size, on which {{the shape of the}} histogram significantly depends, was solved by the authors elsewhere [1, 2]. It was proved that the goodness of the fit of a histogram to the unknown <b>underlying</b> <b>rate</b> can be estimated from the data by using the formula (2 k − v) / ∆ 2, where k and v are the mean and variance of the number of spikes in the bins. The bin size that minimizes this formula is optimal. In this contribution, we extend this method developed for the regular histogram to a method for constructing a histogram whose bin sizes vary over time because the goodness of the fit of a variable-bin-size histogram to the <b>underlying</b> <b>rate</b> can be superior to that of the regular histogram. In many PSTHs of neurophysiological experiments, a significantly fluctuating rate are followed or preceded by a period of relative stasis. An example is tonic spontaneous neuronal firing, followed by phasic discharges of a neuron responding to a stimulus. The optimal bin sizes of regular histograms for the <b>underlying</b> <b>rate</b> processes with different characteristics are different: The optimal bin size is small if the <b>underlying</b> <b>rate</b> significantly fluctuates, and large if the <b>underlying</b> <b>rate</b> modestly fluctuates. Therefore if the <b>underlying</b> <b>rates</b> are composed of the processes with different characteristics, a PSTH whose bin sizes vary over time may better represent the unknown <b>underlying</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R

Statistically large clusters of objections were considered {{to be the result of}} health care worker behaviour, and were disregarded. <b>Underlying</b> objection <b>rates</b> were estimated from remaining data and compared to seroprevalence. Overall objection rates approached or exceeded seroprevalence in many participating centres. However, <b>underlying</b> objection <b>rates</b> declined with time while prevalences were generally unchanging. Also, <b>underlying</b> <b>rates</b> correlated poorly with observed seroprevalences. Findings were therefore consistent with processes producing the clusters of objections and <b>underlying</b> objection <b>rates</b> independently of serostatus of individuals.

40|$|The time-histogram {{method is}} a handy tool for {{capturing}} the instantaneous rate of spike occurrence. In {{most of the}} neurophysiological literature, the bin size that critically determines the goodness of the fit of the time-histogram to the <b>underlying</b> <b>rate</b> has been selected by individual researchers in an unsystematic manner. We propose an objective method for selecting the bin size of a time-histogram from the spike data, so that the time-histogram best approximates the unknown <b>underlying</b> <b>rate.</b> The resolution of the histogram increases, or the optimal bin size decreases, {{with the number of}} spike sequences sampled. It is notable that the optimal bin size diverges if {{only a small number of}} experimental trials are available from a moderately fluctuating rate process. In this case, any attempt to characterize the <b>underlying</b> spike <b>rate</b> will lead to spurious results. Given a paucity of data, our method can also suggest how many more trials are needed until the set of data can be analyzed with the required resolution. ...|$|R

Potential real GDP {{is represented by the}} level of the trend component of real GDP. The potential rate of growth of real GDP is represented by the stochastic drift element of the trend component. Cuevas finds that there is a strong association at the trend and cycle frequencies between real GDP and the real price of oil. This association is also robust in the presence of key economic policy variables. From 1970 - 80, when the <b>underlying</b> annual <b>rate</b> of increase of the real price of oil was 12 percent, the <b>underlying</b> annual <b>rate</b> of increase of potential GDP in Venezuela was 2. 6 percent. By contrast, from 1981 - 2000 when the <b>underlying</b> <b>rate</b> of increase of the real price of oil was - 5 percent, the <b>underlying</b> growth <b>rate</b> of potential GDP fell 1. 5 percent.

40|$|We {{provide the}} first formal {{investigation}} {{of the consequences of}} negative interest rates in the Eurozone on the pricing of interest rate options. Since the money market rates settled in negative territory and other market segments experienced negative yields, the broader financial community has had to face an unknown environment. The well-known Black–Scholes (BS) framework has become unfeasible for interest rate option valuation. First of all, no-arbitrage properties are breached, allowing arbitrage opportunities. More, the BS framework’s assumption of a log-normal distribution of the <b>underlying</b> <b>rates</b> does not stand with negative interest rates. We argue that the most notable approach which allows interest rate option pricing is [Bachelier, L (1900). Théorie de la speculation, 3 rd Annales scientifiques de l’École Normale Supérieure 17, 21 – 86. ], which assumes a normal distribution of the <b>underlying</b> <b>rates.</b> We demonstrate that the Bachelier model represents an answer to the critical issues that are raised in our study.

40|$|The paper {{attempts}} {{a critical}} assessment {{of both the}} theory and the empirical evidence {{on the role of}} appropriability and in particular of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) as incentives for technological innovation. We start with a critical discussion of the standard justification of the attribution of IPR in terms of "market failures" in knowledge generation. Such an approach we argue misses important features of technological knowledge and also neglects the importance of non-market institutions in the innovation process. Next, we examine the recent changes in the IPR regimes and their influence upon both rates of patenting and <b>underlying</b> <b>rates</b> of innovation. The evidence broadly suggests that, first, IPRs are not the most important device apt to "profit from innovation"; and second, they have at best no impact, or possibly even a negative impact on the <b>underlying</b> <b>rates</b> of innovation. Rather, we argued, technology- and industry-specific patterns of innovation are primarily driven by the opportunities associated with each technological paradigm. Conversely, firm-specific abilities to seize them and "profit from innovation" depend partly on adequacy of the strategic combinations identified by the taxonomy of Teece (1986) and partly on idiosyncratic capabilities embodied in the various firms.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} general framework modeling common rating processes {{in order to}} aggregate rating information stemming {{from a variety of}} raters or rating sources. Ratings play an increasingly important role in our life. They are used to evaluate a variety of objects and activities all over the world. Here we apply our model framework to two different ratings, the credit ratings and the bookmakers odds. Whereas credit ratings represent the evaluation of credit customers or firms by banks or external rating agencies, bookmakers odds are prospective ratings of the performance of the participating players or teams in a sports competition. Despite the fact that these ratings are used in different kind of areas, both rating systems have a very similar <b>underlying</b> <b>rating</b> process. In both rating processes each rater estimates an underlying numerical variable which represent a probability or is directly related to a probability. In the case of credit ratings this probability is the probability of default (PD) of a credit customer or a firm {{and in the case of}} bookmakers odds this probability is the probability of winning a specifc sports competition. The proposed model framework is then used to solve the aggregation problem of the two rating processes for different applications yielding different model specifcations. Finally, the model results are used to validate the different <b>underlying</b> <b>rating</b> systems as well as for forecasting. (author's abstract...|$|R
