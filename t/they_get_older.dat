5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to close the gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora canthelias), younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the rachis as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> and boring into follicles and eating seeds. This tunneling itself damages {{the architecture of}} the spike and prevents seed development. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genus Cryptophasa, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa, Brachmia trinervis, Carposina hyperlopha and an unidentified weevil species.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b>|$|E
50|$|Emilia sonchifolia is a branching, {{perennial}} herb up to 40 cm tall. Leaves are lyrate-pinnatilobed, up to 10 cm long, sometimes becoming purplish as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old.</b> One {{plant can}} produce several pink or purplish flower heads.|$|R
50|$|Ericameria watsonii is a {{branching}} shrub up to 40 cm (16 inches) tall, {{the stems}} green when young but become reddish-brown as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old.</b> Flower heads are yellow, with both ray florets and disc florets. It grows in desert scrublands, rocky slopes, and open pine woodlands.|$|R

The parent's fear is if <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old,</b> the kids aren't able to help them. This becomes a {{challenge}} and the kids switch roles, with them taking care of the parents.|$|R
5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older,</b> they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E
5|$|Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and {{relatively}} underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, {{eyes open and}} fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest {{a few days after}} they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned.|$|E
5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E

50|$|Chaptalia texana is a {{perennial}} plant growing {{from a large}} root. Leaves are in a basal rosette close to the ground, with dense woolly hairs on the underside but not on top. There is generally only one flower head, held on an unbranched stalk; head is nodding (hanging) at fruiting time but not at flowering time. Flowers are cream-colored, turning reddish as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{surface of}} the earth is uninhabitable, and the player uses several {{characters}} to manage resources such as air, food, water, and minerals in an underground bunker to ensure survival until life outdoors can resume. The bunker has four levels so that the player can expand the size of the bunker. The layout is different every time you play. Events such as disease and mechanical failures occur to challenge the player. Characters can specialize in different skills, and need to be replaced by the younger generation when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old</b> and leave the workforce.|$|R
5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E

50|$|Squump - A dumb, lazy cow-like creature. It gives both {{eggs and}} milk {{which are used}} for certain food {{products}} such as wriggly pies. When <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old,</b> <b>they</b> leave to go spend their golden years in retirement. When that happens Slaphappies show up and cause trouble. The {{only way to get}} rid of Slaphappies is to get a new herd of squumps. To get a new herd you have to wrangle the herd leader which is usually the biggest and meanest Bull Squump. Bull Squumps have bull horns.|$|R

5000|$|However, it also {{includes}} sections for the ascetic monk giving him reasons to never desire women or children. Women, states the text, are like [...] "a brilliant splendor of a pearl necklace" [...] but {{are a source of}} sin, both lovely and cruel, they ensnare men into evil tendencies, and <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old,</b> die and their bodies becomes food for other creatures. Women are chains of suffering and hold gems of sins, asserts the text. This characterization in this text, states Olivelle, is an attempt to create revulsion for a woman's body in the mind of an ascetic who has sworn to a celibate lifestyle, and similar characterization is also found in Buddhism and Jainism texts.|$|R

25|$|The common {{misconception}} is {{that all}} types of pu'er tea will improve in taste—and therefore gain in value—as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> There are many requisite variables for a pu'er tea to age beautifully. Further, the ripe (shou) pu'er will not evolve as dramatically as the raw (sheng) type will over time due to secondary oxidation and fermentation.|$|E
25|$|Feeding and {{swallowing}} {{can become}} {{difficult for people}} with A-T as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> Feeding refers to all aspects of eating and drinking, including getting food and liquids to the mouth; swallowing refers to ingestion or what happens after food or liquids enter the mouth. Primary goals for feeding and swallowing are safe, adequate, and enjoyable mealtimes.|$|E

6000|$|Marriage {{is a very}} {{prudential}} affair, {{especially among}} the peasants who have the largest share of property. Politic marriages are as common among them as among princes; and when a peasant-heiress in Westphalia marries, her husband adopts her name, and places his own after it with the prefix geborner (née). The girls marry young, and the rapidity with which <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old</b> and ugly is one among the many proofs that {{the early years of}} marriage are fuller of hardships than of conjugal tenderness. “When our writers of village stories,” says Riehl, “transferred their own emotional life to the peasant, they obliterated what is precisely his most predominant characteristic, namely, that with him general custom holds the place of individual feeling.” ...|$|R
25|$|Prey {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of small to medium-sized mammals and birds.

25|$|Collecting is {{for some}} people a {{childhood}} hobby, but for others a lifelong pursuit or one that begins in adulthood. Collectors who begin early in life often modify their aims when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> Some novice collectors start purchasing items that appeal to them then slowly work at learning {{how to build a}} collection, while others prefer to develop some background in the field before starting to buy items. The emergence of the internet as a global forum for different collectors has resulted in many isolated enthusiasts finding each other.|$|E
25|$|People make {{exceptions}} to and modify their space requirements. A number of relationships may allow for personal space to be modified, including familial ties, romantic partners, friendships and close acquaintances, {{where there is}} a greater degree of trust and personal knowledge. Personal space is affected by a person's position in society, with more affluent individuals expecting a larger personal space. Personal space also varies by gender and age. Males typically use more personal space than females, and personal space has a positive relation to age (people use more as <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>older).</b> Most people have a fully developed (adult) sense of personal space by age twelve.|$|E

I learnt that their world revolves only around this 'market', they do not have any other identity.

5000|$|In [...] "An Essay on Woman," [...] Leapor {{describes}} the certain downfall women face when <b>they</b> <b>get</b> <b>old.</b> She is {{highly critical of}} women being judged solely on their appearance, and deplores the limited choices open to them. Like Alexander Pope, Leapor saw “the general condition of women {{as a series of}} contradictions”; though unlike Pope or Jonathan Swift, they weren't “follies to be satirized,” but rather “injustices to be protested against”. Both of the poets deeply influenced Leapor's work; however, she counters their interpretations and understanding of women's general unhappiness. Drawing from her personal experience as a woman, she saw injustice in the social order rather than in women themselves. This is reflected in the representation of her views on beauty, the female body, marriage, family and female friendship in her work.|$|R
