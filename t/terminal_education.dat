50|$|For {{students}} who had completed eight years of schooling, there were two types of career-oriented institutions: vocational schools (sometimes called vocational/technical schools in Mongolian publications) and specialized secondary schools. The {{distinction between the two}} was not clear. Vocational schools appeared to train more highly skilled workers, such as machinists, heavy-equipment operators, and construction workers, providing a <b>terminal</b> <b>education</b> to {{students who}} did not excel in the classroom. The specialized secondary schools, which corresponded to the Soviet technicum provided two- or three-year courses at the junior college level. They trained paraprofessionals and technicians, such as primary school teachers, medical technicians, or bookkeepers. Students with diplomas from specialized secondary schools could apply for admission to higher education. As more funds and more technically trained teachers became available, the number of vocational schools increased. In 1988 there were 43 vocational schools, which enrolled 30,000 students in 110 fields. Specialized secondary schools offered two-year or three-year courses, and students received room and board and a monthly stipend. During their stints of practical work in factories or other enterprises, they received the normal salary for their work. The reform of secondary education under way in the 1988-89 school year called for three-year vocational courses for students with eight years of general education. Students who graduated from complete ten-year courses could spend one year in vocational schools. The ninth- and tenth-year classes in general education schools prepared students for college admission or for generalized white-collar work.|$|E
5000|$|Baltimore’s Manual Training High School {{opened in}} 1884, {{was the first}} {{separate}} secondary school for education that was specifically work orientated. [...] The Maryland institution was unique as a stand-alone campus. Other examples of sub-baccalaureate programs were the University Preparatory School and Junior College of Tonkawa. The result of the two- year schools founded in Oklahoma Public School Secondary System in 1902, both institutions later merged in 1914 and became the Oklahoma Institute of Technology. Dean Schneider of the University of Cincinnati developed an alternative high school with a cooperative plan where students spent one week in an occupation {{and the other in}} school. Industry provided the shop experiences and the classroom facilitated the academic. [...] There were also non-cooperative high schools; two examples were the Girl’s Vocational High School in Kansas City, Missouri and the Delgado Trade School in New Orleans. A two-year, <b>terminal</b> <b>education,</b> was seen as more socially efficient for students who could advance past high school but not continue to attain bachelor's degrees. This national vocational movement gave junior colleges a target population, but numerous students wanted more than a semiprofessional education; many maintained a desire to transfer. Throughout this time period, there was a move for more public two-year institutions along with a trend to separate from high schools and affiliate with higher education. With the change in affiliation came a new status which encouraged junior colleges to develop additional credibility through the creation of professional criteria and use of scientific methods.|$|E

5000|$|After the Second World War, a small {{technical}} elite {{arose in}} developing countries such as India, Pakistan, Brazil, and Iraq who had been educated as scientists in the industrialized world. They spearheaded the development of science in these countries, presuming that by pushing for Manhattan project-type enterprises in nuclear power, electronics, pharmaceuticals, or space exploration they could leapfrog the dismally low level of development of science establishments in their countries. India, for example, started a nuclear energy program that mobilized thousands of technicians and cost {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars but had limited success. Though China, North Korea, India and Pakistan have been successful in deploying nuclear weapons and some of them e.g. China and India have launched fairly successful space programs, (for example, Chandrayaan I (Sanskrit चंद्रयान-1), which literally means [...] "Moon Craft," [...] is an unmanned lunar mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation and it hopes to land a motorised rover on the moon in 2010 or 2011 as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission; Chang'e I, China's moon probing project is proceeding in full swing in a well-organized way), the fact remains that most of the scientists responsible for these deeds had received their <b>terminal</b> <b>education</b> from some institution or university in US or Europe.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Eduactional Reform of {{secondary}} education after World War II was {{to introduce a}} new high school system offering <b>terminal</b> <b>education</b> equally open to all the citizens. One {{of the goals of}} this Reform was to reduce difference in quality among high schools to relieve educational credentialism. However as industrialization has proceeded, educational credentials have become more important as a main occupational selection criterion. As a result, the purpose of this Reform to equalize quality in education among different high schools faced difficulties to attain. By the time around 1960, a clear hierarchy among high schools and courses of study emerged. That means that inequality among high schools came out. The aim {{of this paper is to}} clarify the process how this Reform ended in failure by focusing on two day-time high schools: one is a comprehensive high school, and the other is a vocational (agriculture) high school; and seven part-time high schools in a region called "Tanba Sasayama".

To describe and analyse geographical and social aspects of marital choice in modern Britain and to investigate their likely genetical import. Marital choice is important biologically because partners with remote origins tend to be genetically more different than those with close origins. Proximity of partners may thus affect genetical variance, the size and ease of definition of breeding populations and ultimately evolution. This research aimed to fulfil {{the need for a}} study of modern urban marriage in a way which facilitated analysis of social factors affecting choice and genetical inference from the demographic data. Main Topics : Variables A random sample of marriages was taken from all the marriages recorded in Reading, Berkshire from September 1972 to August 1973, and attempts were made to interview all the couples concerned. Questions were asked to determine their occupational history, the history of their geographical migration at eleven points in their life, from their parents' birthplace to their own marital home. Routine personal attributes such as age, religious affiliation and <b>terminal</b> age of <b>education</b> were also determined. The eleven grid reference points generated distances which were the main dependent variables for analysis. An attempt was made to place socio-economic analysis of marital mobility into the social setting of marital choice - asking questions on the place and occasions of the couples meeting, the role of kin and friends and neighbourhood knowledge in bringing them together, and obstacles they had experienced in keeping in touch...|$|R
40|$|The data {{presented}} in this paper indicates that the present Spanish language program at Mesa College serves only one quarter of the student body and probably even a smaller fraction of the community. This situation exists because the recommended curriculums for 52 of Mesa College's 66 lower-division majors, largely nongeneral liberal arts and one- and two-year <b>terminal</b> <b>education</b> majors, do not make available a sufficient number of elective hours for students to take the standard 15 -hour beginning comprehensive (all four skills) Spanish course. Evidence is presented to show {{that there is a need}} for foreign language skills among the three quarters of the student body now being neglected. Interviews with instructors, departient heads, and division chairmen suggest that the interests of one-fifth of these students can be served best by a foreign language other than Spanish. The needs of approximately one-third, however, can be served best by a new, innovative, three-hour, one- to three-quarter, limited-objective (understanding and speaking skills only), career-oriented Spanish program. It is estimated that within a few years following adoption of such a program, foreign language enrollment should be at least two to three times larger than it is at present. (Author/KM) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} higher {{education}} offers a wealth of literature concerning part-time, adjunct faculty. While the decision to employ this category of labor {{is crucial to the}} financial exigency of many institutions this study adopts the perspective of the individual employee and to investigate the motivations and strategies that adjuncts employ in order to teach in the field {{of higher education}}. To date, the majority of the literature concerning adjuncts has been written {{from the perspective of the}} full-time, tenure track academician. This paper investigates the perspective of adjunct faculty in higher education; specifically the personal branding efforts carried out in the execution of an adjunct's day-to-day job requirements. Additionally the study examines the economic situation - what I am calling "the new economy" - in which an adjunct must function and how this has impacted their career. And finally, the study looks at how adjunct faculty fit in and transition among the multiple taxonomies in which they have been cast by researchers. The study was a qualitative analysis of twelve adjuncts who possessed varying levels of <b>terminal</b> <b>education</b> achievement. Some temporary laborers are clearly valued by the institutions that hire them because of the skill and expertise they bring to the schools, while others rely on relationships with the decision makers to formulate a career in their chosen field.

Future directions include the opportunity for longitudinally investigating the impact that personal branding plays in educational career as well as the impact adjuncts have on students' educational experience...|$|E

A three part study by the National Institute of Adult Education to enquire into the adequacy of provision in selected areas by the various agencies for adult education. It included surveys of the general adult population, students in adult education and tutors, between April 1966 and June 1968. Seven areas were selected for the survey, based on four factors for which statistical information could be obtained: <b>terminal</b> <b>education</b> age; occupational composition (social class); proportion of domestic rateable value from property of high rateable value; and inter-censal population movement between 1951 and 1961. The survey of adults (SN: 66040) collected data by means of interviews with {{a random sample of}} the adult population of each area, and covered attitudes to, knowledge of, and participation in adult educational activities. The survey of students (SN: 66041) collected data by means of questionnaires completed by a random sample of students currently enrolled in Local Education Authority, extra-mural and Workers' Educational Association classes, covering the same points with additional data on circumstances relating to aspects of the class attended. A third survey (SN: 66042) collected data by means of enquiries addressed to part-time tutors in adult education to provide information on staffs' own motives and attitudes, recruitment, future teaching intentions and also their views as to students' motivations and satisfactions. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions The questionnaire administered here is substantially the same as that used for the Adult sample, with the following additions. Students enrolled in adult education (Local Education Authority, extra-mural and Workers' Educational Association classes) at the time were asked a series of questions concerning the class in which they were enrolled, including: subjects studied; main reasons for joining current class; distance travelled to class and transport used; sources of knowledge of general facilities and of current class, and respondent's opinion on various aspects of the course itself (accommodation and facilities provided, supply of equipment, time of classes, length of course and of individual class, standard and content of course, level of teaching, amount of work assigned for completion at home, and amount of work expected, character of class work).

The Database of Selected British Gallup Opinion Polls is a sample product, developed at The Data Archive by the Opinion Polls Unit, which illustrates how the texts and data might be used. The aim was to produce an information system {{which could be used}} by non-specialists in the field of data analysis - practitioners like journalists, teachers or legislators who could use a CD-ROM publication to find out what attitudinal changes had occurred over time or how people had indicated they would vote in the recent or distant past. It was also intended as a tool to show funders the potential of the material. The CD-ROM contains a 'Microsoft (MS) Access' database, which combines survey text and matching SPSS output in the form of calculated frequencies, some of which are depicted in graphical form, and a text search facility. There are three versions of the database to suit different users' needs; version 2 for MS Access 2. 0, version 7 for MS Access 95 / 7. 0 and version 8 for MS Access 97. Potential users are advised to request the database version that is specific to their own version of MS Access. The hierarchical pathway system is a series of forms navigated by using buttons and includes a description of the surveys as well as additional information on the changes made to the text for inputting purposes. A text only version of the original question text and calculated frequencies, together with the accompanying data and documentation files is also available on request. SPSS portable files are also provided on the CD in order that the user has the option of carrying out further data manipulation. A further directory consisting of 27 SPSS portable files containing coded parliamentary constituency information is also provided, along with a key to the codes. Users should note that constituency information for years 1958 - 1964 is currently unavailable. Main Topics : The database consists of one survey from January of each year (except for 1979, which uses February). A wide variety of political, social and economic subjects are covered including, among others, satisfaction with the government's performance; opposition policies; the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Also covered are attitudes towards specific political and economic issues and current problems, both domestic and international; recall of past vote and voting intention; social concerns, such as law and crime, nationalisation, immigration, public services etc. Throughout most of the surveys respondents are classified by age, gender, marital status, socio-economic group, employment status and occupation, self-assessed social class, trade union membership, size of household, number of children, <b>terminal</b> <b>education</b> age and car ownership...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. A three part study by the National Institute of Adult Education to enquire into the adequacy of provision in selected areas by the various agencies for adult education. It included surveys of the general adult population, students in adult education and tutors, between April 1966 and June 1968. Seven areas were selected for the survey, based on four factors for which statistical information could be obtained: <b>terminal</b> <b>education</b> age; occupational composition (social class); proportion of domestic rateable value from property of high rateable value; and inter-censal population movement between 1951 and 1961. The survey of adults (SN: 66040) collected data by means of interviews with {{a random sample of}} the adult population of each area, and covered attitudes to, knowledge of, and participation in adult educational activities. The survey of students (SN: 66041) collected data by means of questionnaires completed by a random sample of students currently enrolled in Local Education Authority, extra-mural and Workers' Educational Association classes, covering the same points with additional data on circumstances relating to aspects of the class attended. A third survey (SN: 66042) collected data by means of enquiries addressed to part-time tutors in adult education to provide information on staffs' own motives and attitudes, recruitment, future teaching intentions and also their views as to students' motivations and satisfactions. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions In this survey of leisure time and educational facilities, a random sample of the adult population in each of the 7 areas was asked for information on the amount of personal leisure time available and activities undertaken in it, respondent's membership of local groups or clubs, knowledge of facilities for adult education locally and opinion on advertising of such facilities, details of any participation in adult education with reasons for enrolling and degree of satisfaction obtained, reasons for not enrolling in any such classes and future joining intentions, respondent's interests and things about which he would like to know more, preferences for class times, opinions on classes currently offered in area and on the provision of adult education generally (e. g. how much money should be spent on it, amount of general interest in area in such classes, etc.) From a list of 24 given reasons for adults going to classes, respondent was asked to indicate whether each reason was, or would be, important to him personally, and to people generally. A similar list of 18 reasons for not going to classes required the same response. Respondent was asked for his opinion on the sort of people who usually attend such classes (sex, age, marital status, type of personality), on the instructors, accommodation (comfortable or uncomfortable, modern or old-fashioned, specially designed for adults or for children) and atmosphere (pleasant or unpleasant). Respondent was further asked to list four radio or television series from which he had gained some educational stimulus and actual knowledge and, finally, for his opinion on his own level of performance at school. Background Variables Sex, marital status, age cohort, number of people in household, present occupation, type of industry, business or service, (if housewife, or retired person, last full-time occupation and type of business) head of household's present occupation, length of tenure of house or residence, schools (type of school last attended, later education and age when finished full-time education), and participation of other members of household in adult education...|$|E
