Arsenal scored in all 55 league matches from between 19 May 2001 to 30 November 2002 and also hold the longest unbeaten away sequence in league football with 27, from 5 April 2003 to 25 September 2004.|$|E

5|$|Celtic {{reached the}} semi-final of the European Cup in 1972, with Inter Milan their opponents. The tie {{remained}} goal-less {{after the end}} of both games and 30 minutes of extra time in the second leg in Glasgow. As such, the tie went to penalty kicks to find a winner, the first time a European Cup tie was decided in this manner. Inter Milan's Sandro Mazzola took the first penalty kick and scored. Dixie Deans took the next penalty, Celtic's first, but fired his shot over the crossbar. The Italians scored all of <b>their</b> <b>remaining</b> penalties to eliminate Celtic.|$|E

5|$|During their {{fighting}} retreat up the Rhône, the Germans also withdrew <b>their</b> <b>remaining</b> {{forces from}} their garrisons in south-western France.

While {{they did not have to}} fight the Western Allies as much as the Germans had done at the Rhône, they still had to advance through French partisan-dominated terrain. About 88,000 men moved north, leaving 20,000 in south-western France behind. During the retreat, about 19,000 men were captured by the Allies and 60,000 men reached Army GroupG's line, where they were integrated into the defense of the Vosges mountains.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon out with the score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost <b>their</b> <b>remaining</b> wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E

He took only eight catches, but kept tidily to retain his place in the team. His performances for Queensland were hardly more productive; he scored 161 runs at 16.10 and aside from a rain-affected draw, his state lost <b>their</b> <b>remaining</b> six matches.|$|E
