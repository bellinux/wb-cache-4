5|$|Driving {{through the}} pass is challenging. Both {{approaches}} require 6% grades {{due to the}} height of the pass, and require navigating hairpin <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> advisory speeds of 10mph (15km/h). Rockfalls, particularly on the approach from Aspen, have narrowed some sections to a single lane 12 feet (4 m) wide with temporary traffic lights. On the Twin Lakes approach, they have resulted in temporary closures. Other vehicles frequently enter the road unexpectedly at the many parking areas for campgrounds and other recreational attractions, and bicyclists make frequent use of Highway 82 as well. Lastly, the weather at the pass can be unpredictable and vary considerably from conditions in either Aspen or Twin Lakes. There may be thunderstorms on otherwise clear days, and snow can occur at any time of the year. CDOT advises anyone coming to the pass for outdoor recreation to take precautions against the effects of the high altitude and the changeable weather.|$|E
5|$|Due to its sharp <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> {{restricted}} headroom, high-sided vehicles {{can only}} use the left-hand lane {{of the western}} tunnel, {{so it was not}} possible to reverse the tidal flow in the evening. On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during counterflow operations. The decision to end the counterflow was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the counterflow system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.|$|E

This marked the start of a series of endurance based works: ...|$|R
50|$|If a {{pendulum}} bob is hanging vertically at the Equator {{and held in}} place, the bob is stationary relative to the Earth and is rotating (<b>turning)</b> <b>with</b> the Earth. Once the bob is released (but not swinging) it continues to rotate (<b>turn)</b> <b>with</b> the Earth.|$|R
2500|$|Contrary to {{conventional}} wisdom, with sufficient altitude, the P-40 could <b>turn</b> <b>with</b> the A6M and other Japanese fighters, {{using a combination}} of a nose-down vertical <b>turn</b> <b>with</b> a bank <b>turn,</b> a technique known as a low yo-yo. Robert DeHaven describes how this tactic was used in the 49th Fighter group: ...|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next ten days the {{battalion}} was involved in a series of engagements as they fought to defend the island, with the most notable probably being the bayonet charge that they undertook with the Australian 2/7th Battalion at 42nd Street on 27 May in which 280 Germans were killed, with the MƒÅori accounting for 100. However, it soon became clear that the garrison on Crete would need to be evacuated and on 28 May the bulk of Creforce began to disengage the Germans and begin the retreat towards Sfakia. The 5th Infantry Brigade took <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> two Australian battalions and the commandos of Layforce to carry out a rearguard action to guard the pass through which the troops had to traverse in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E
25|$|Children's {{television}} network Nickelodeon once featured {{a series of}} shorts entitled As Our School Bus <b>Turns,</b> <b>with</b> the (actually unconnected) episodes taking place aboard a school bus. Each episode would end with a stereotypical soap opera cliffhanger.|$|E

25|$|On December 8, 2009, CBS {{announced}} that it was canceling As the World Turns due to low ratings. The show taped its final Procter and Gamble scenes for CBS on June 23, 2010, and with a dramatic storyline finale, its final episode on the network aired on September 17, 2010. On October 18, 2010, CBS replaced As the World <b>Turns</b> <b>with</b> a newly debuted talk show The Talk.|$|E
25|$|The board {{consists}} of 61 circular spaces {{arranged in a}} hexagon, five on a side. Each player has 14 marbles that rest in the spaces and are initially arranged as shown below, on the left image. The players take <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> the black marbles moving first. For each move, a player moves a straight line of one, two or three marbles of one color one space in one of six directions. The move can be either broadside / arrow-like (parallel {{to the line of}} marbles) or in-line / in a line (serial in respect to the line of marbles), as illustrated below.|$|E
25|$|And so it {{was with}} As the World <b>Turns,</b> <b>with</b> its slow-moving {{psychological}} character studies of families headed by legal and medical professionals. The personal and professional lives of doctors and lawyers remained central to As the World Turns throughout its run, and eventually became standard fare on many soap operas. Whereas the 15-minute radio soaps often focused on one central, heroic character (for example, Dr. Jim Brent in Phillips' Road of Life), the expanded 30-minute format of As the World Turns enabled Phillips to introduce a handful of professionals within the framework of a family saga.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the first two series, it slides across four boxes with each character's face in them. The first box stands alone with Ben and Susan in it. The other three are lapped over each other with a photo of Michael, Janey and Nick from left to right in them. While it slides across at the start, each character's face <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> Janey and Nick smiling and the others being fairly plain faced. Once the boxes are placed, the boxes with youngsters in them drop {{to the bottom of the}} screen and are {{replaced}} with the show's logo.|$|E
25|$|Friedman {{realized}} that the new rotor machines would be important, and devoted some time to analysing Hebern's design. Over a period of years, he developed principles of analysis and discovered several problems common to most rotor-machine designs. Examples of some dangerous features included having rotors step one position with each keypress, and putting the fastest rotor (the one that <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> every keypress) {{at either end of}} the rotor series. In this case, by collecting enough ciphertext and applying a standard statistical method known as the kappa test, he showed that he could, albeit with great difficulty, crack any cipher generated by such a machine.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Atkins, Booker's band leader, had {{arranged}} with the girl's parents {{to take her}} to and from the dances, taking <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> bandmate Ernie Holcomb. It was Holcomb's turn that night, but he said Booker told him that she had a ride with an old friend. Atkins was awakened the next morning at 6:00 with a telephone call. It was a female asking if he knew where Booker was. He had no knowledge of Booker's change of plans and told the caller that Holcomb took her home, but he was informed she had been expected at a party but never came. Atkins received a similar call around 8:00 from another girl, and he asked if she had checked with Booker's parents. This girl told him that Booker had gone with a friend named Paul but neither had attended the party.|$|E

25|$|In {{an episode}} of Speed TV's Wind Tunnel program {{broadcast}} on August 22, 2010, Tavo Hellmund revealed that the circuit would be 3.4 miles (5.5km) long and would {{be made up of}} twenty <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> an elevation change of 133 feet (41 m). The final plan of the circuit was released on September 1, 2010, showing a design inspired by the European tradition of sculpting the circuit to the contours of the land. The design draws from several European Formula One circuits, including a recreation of Silverstone's Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel sequence, Hockenheim's arena bends, and a replica of Istanbul's Turn Eight. Other corners were loosely inspired by the Senna 'S' at Interlagos and the √ñsterreichring's Sebring-Auspuffkurve. A feature of the circuit is a deliberate widening of corners, to encourage drivers to follow multiple racing lines. A similar feature was used at the Buddh International Circuit in India, where the circuit widens on the approach to certain corners.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 18th century, the French and the British East India company {{initiated}} a protracted struggle for military control of South India. The period was marked by shifting alliances between the two East India companies and the local powers, mercenary armies employed by all sides, and general anarchy in South India. Cities and forts changed hands many times, and soldiers were primarily remunerated through loot. The four Anglo-Mysore Wars and the three Anglo-Maratha Wars saw Mysore, the Marathas and Hyderabad aligning themselves in <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> either the British or the French. Eventually, British power in alliance with Hyderabad prevailed and Mysore was absorbed as a princely state within British India. The Nizam of Hyderabad sought to retain his autonomy through diplomacy rather than open war with the British. The Maratha Empire that stretched across large swathes of central and northern India was broken up, with most of it annexed by the British.|$|E
25|$|In Galactic Conquest, {{the player}} uses {{strategy}} {{to take control}} of planets and dominate an area of the galaxy. First the player chooses a map configuration based on conflicts from both eras of Star Wars history. Some maps start both sides evenly while others favor one faction. Next, the player chooses which faction to play as. The game is played in <b>turns,</b> <b>with</b> the player starting first. The player can select an enemy-controlled or neutral planet to attack. After selecting what planet to attack, the player is able to activate a bonus from one of his already owned planets (if any). Each planet provides its own unique bonus, but must be captured before the player can use it. Bonuses help the player in battle by impeding the enemy or assisting the player's team. If one side manages to win four battles (not necessarily in a row), they gain access to their faction's Secret Base bonus. Secret Base bonuses are very powerful and can change the course of a game. They can be used on any enemy planet, except for the enemy's Secret Base. The game is completed when one faction controls all planets on the map.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his tenure, Gude had private {{pupils in}} {{addition}} to his normal classes. As a professor Gude taught six hours of class, held two hours of office hours, took <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> other professors supervising the nude drawing class and attended staff meetings. In 1857 Gude handed in his resignation, officially citing family considerations and failing health as his reasons for resigning, although in his memoirs he blamed opposition and backbiting from two of his pupils. The landscape painting professorship was the bottom of the pay scale at the Academy, and Gude {{was one of the few}} professors to be refused a raise when others received them in 1855. Others have suggested that Gude wished to leave the Academy for fear for becoming stuck in a rut artistically. Gude received better treatment from the Academy after he turned in his resignation, and it would take him a full five years to finally leave D√ºsseldorf. Although professors at the Academy complained that their teaching prevented them from undertaking more lucrative endeavors, Gude was able to sell enough works to afford a modest house in D√ºsseldorf which stood in what is now Hofgarten.|$|E
25|$|The Rumlu, Afshar, and the Qajar clan favored Ismail Mirza Safavi, who {{was jailed}} in the Qahqaheh Castle. Pari Khan Khanum also favored Ismail Mirza, {{and she had}} the support of the Circassians. While Tahmasp was still ill, those who {{supported}} Haydar Mirza, sent a message to the castellan of Qahqaheh Castle, named Khalifa Ansar Qaradghlu. They requested him to have Ismail Mirza killed. However, Pari Khan Khanum managed to find out about it and told Tahmasp about the plot. Tahmasp, who still had some feelings for Ismail Mirza due to the courage he used to have in the encounters with the Ottoman Empire, sent a group of Afshar musketeers to the Qahqaheh Castle to safeguard him. Two months later, Tahmasp healed from the life-threatening illness he had. Two years later, on 14 May 1576, he died in Qazvin. Haydar Mirza was the only son who was with him when he died, and thus the following day, he announced himself as the new shah. Normally, some Qizilbash tribes would guard the royal palace and take <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> other others‚Äîunfortunately for Haydar Mirza, on that day all the Qizilbash guards were either from the Rumlu, Afshar, Qajar, Bayat, or the Dorsaq tribe‚Äîall loyal supporters of Ismail Mirza.|$|E
500|$|He was {{a member}} of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce from October 1888. [...] His first two books {{promoted}} California. In California of the South (1888), described by David Fine as [...] "one of the earliest booster tracts" [...] Widney and Walter Lindley wrote: [...] "The health-seeker who, after suffering in both mind and body, after vainly trying the cold climate of Minnesota and the warm climate of Florida, after visiting Mentone, Cannes, and Nice, after traveling to Cuba and Algiers, and noticing that he is losing ounce upon ounce of flesh, and his cheeks have grown more sunken, his appetite more capricious, his breath more hurried, that his temperature is no longer normal,... <b>turns</b> <b>with</b> a gleam of hope toward the Occident"‚Äîby which they meant Southern California. Many people followed that gleam and found it something more than hope".|$|E
