25|$|At least 2.5 {{million people}} were without power. The {{blackout}} was initially caused by an overheated voltage switch that soon caught fire in a power substation in Miami, 23 {{miles away from the}} plant. The fire occurred at 1:08 PM and caused an automatic shutdown of the power plant. This led to a domino effect that caused outages as far north as Daytona Beach and Tampa. Power was restored by 4:30 PM. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>this</b> malfunction caused such widespread outages is still under investigation.|$|E

25|$|The Twelve Warlords War was {{a period}} ranging from 966–68 {{characterized}} by chaos and civil war. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>this</b> period received the title of Twelve Warlords War, or Anarchy of the 12 Warlords, {{is because of the}} struggle for power after the illegitimate succession to the throne by Dương Tam Kha after the death of Ngô Quyền. The ensuing two years were marked by local warlords rebelling to seize power within their local governments and challenging the Dương court. As a result, the country fractured into 12 regions, each led by a warlord. This resulted in conflicts and war among the regional warlords, who all sought to expand their territory and enhance their power.|$|E
25|$|In {{line with}} Gramsci's {{theories}} of hegemonic power, {{he argued that}} capitalist power needed to be challenged by building a counter-hegemony. By this he meant that, {{as part of the}} war of position, the organic intellectuals and others within the working-class, need to develop alternative values and an alternative ideology in contrast to bourgeois ideology. He argued that <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>this</b> had not needed to happen in Russia was because the Russian ruling-class did not have genuine hegemonic power. So the Bolsheviks were able to see through a war of manoeuvre (the 1917 revolution), relatively easily, because ruling-class hegemony had never been fully achieved. He believed that a final war of manoeuvre was only possible, in the developed and advanced capitalist societies, when the war of position had been won by the organic intellectuals and the working-class building a counter-hegemony.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the newer}} {{programs}} initiated by the University of Ottawa is the Free Store. The Free Store is a location in which students can drop off items they no longer want and pick up items they do want for free. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>this</b> was created was to reduce consumption by offering free items to students who no longer want items {{that may be used}} by someone else. Items that are dropped off include clothing, textbooks, electronics, and office supplies. The Free Store is located at 647 King Edward. In 2007, the Office of Campus Sustainability coined the term “Gratuiterie” as the French translation to their Free Store. Since then, the concept of la Gratuiterie has gained widespread popularity in France, namely in Grenoble where the first Gratuiterie appeared. Since then France has seen a boom of “Gratuiteries” around the country.|$|E

25|$|Traffic on the Kaimai Deviation {{has been}} {{dominated}} by freight trains for its entire working life. Regular passenger trains to the Bay of Plenty had ceased in 1967 with the final running of a post-Taneatua Express 88 seater railcar service; the lengthy and time-consuming route that the tunnel replaced was part of <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>this</b> railcar service had ceased to be viable. It was not until 9 December 1991 that a regular service to the Bay of Plenty was re-introduced. Named the Kaimai Express after the tunnel, it ran between Auckland and Tauranga until its cancellation on 7 October 2001. For its entire existence, it was operated with Silver Fern railcars. Since the Railways Corporation relaxed its policy on private use of the national rail network in the 1980s, there have been occasional passenger excursions run on the deviation by organisations such as Mainline Steam and the Railway Enthusiasts Society.|$|E
25|$|But {{these two}} forces, the {{me and the}} not-me, are {{reciprocally}} limitative. As reason has apprehended these two simultaneous phenomena, attention and sensation, and led us immediately to conceive the two sorts of distinct absolute, causes, correlative and reciprocally finite, {{to which they are}} related, so, from the notion of this limitation, we find it impossible under the same guide not to conceive a supreme cause, absolute and infinite, itself the first and last cause of all. This is relatively to self and not-self what these are to their proper effects. This cause is self-sufficient, and is sufficient for <b>the</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>This</b> is God; he must be conceived under the notion of cause, related to humanity and the world. He is absolute substance only insofar as he is absolute cause, of philosophy and his essence lies precisely in his creative power. He thus creates, and he creates necessarily.|$|E
25|$|Another {{report was}} that Sam Sneed was beaten {{in one of}} the label's {{meetings}} by a group of Death Row affiliates, led by Suge Knight and 2Pac. According to Daz Dillinger, <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>this</b> happened was that Sam Sneed had too many East Coast rappers in his Lady Heroin music video. Disillusioned with the direction of Death Row, artists RBX and The D.O.C. chose to leave, after which Suge Knight exercised tighter control over the rest of the roster. Dogg Food was not produced by Dr. Dre but was mixed by Dr. Dre, a further testament to Dre's dwindling involvement with his own record label. Dr. Dre also grew tired of Knight's violence within the label, although he contributed toward two tracks on 2Pac's All Eyez on Me. The rest of the tracks on the album, however, were mostly produced by Daz Dillinger and Johnny J, despite Dr. Dre being nominally titled as Executive Producer. Shakur's behavior reportedly became erratic as he continued his verbal wars with The Notorious B.I.G., Bad Boy Records, Puff Daddy, Mobb Deep, and Prodigy, including many violent confrontations with many of those rappers at some points. In 1996, due to the infighting, Dr. Dre left Death Row Records to found Aftermath; which provoked 2Pac to turn against Dr. Dre.|$|E

500|$|Critic Roger Ebert {{included}} {{the film in}} his review collection The Great Movies, rating it four stars out of four.

He praised the cinematography, capturing the [...] "punishing heat" [...] of the location, and stated that [...] "the physical presence of Paul Newman is <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>this</b> movie works: The smile, the innocent blue eyes, the lack of strutting," [...] which no other actor could have produced as effectively.|$|E
500|$|NSB {{stated that}} they would demand a {{discount}} from Adtranz. Following the incident, the trains {{would have to be}} in for maintenance examinations every , rather than every [...] With each exam costing NOK50,000, NSB stated that this represented an extra cost of NOK20 million per year. The contract between Adtranz and NSB states how often trains are to be maintained, and Adtranz holds a financial responsibility if the trains systematically need more maintenance than that. By 24 June, cracks had been found in two additional units. Similar cracks had occurred in the X2 trains, but after many years of operations. The same manufacturer had been used for the axles on both trains. In Sweden impurities in the steel, combined with undersized axles, were thought to be a cause, but replacements had caused the same issues. On 26 June, NSB stated that [...] in April they had discovered that not checking the whole axle was a weakness in the maintenance procedures, but that despite this, no new examinations had been done. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>this</b> was ignored, was that there was nothing that indicated that this part of the axle represented a weak point.|$|E
