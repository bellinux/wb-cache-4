5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, <b>the</b> <b>smoker</b> has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Smoker</b> is a boil-covered {{creature}} with six long tongues that it uses to ensnare and drag a survivor back to himself. It may then either attack the survivor directly, allow the horde to attack him, {{or leave the}} survivor suspended over a cliff or roof-edge. <b>The</b> <b>Smoker</b> only releases its victim if a teammate shoves the ensnared survivor, if the tongue is shot, the survivor is killed, or upon the Smoker's death, which results in an explosion that leaves a vision-obscuring cloud. Smokers have raspy voices and frequently wheeze and cough, presuming {{that they may have}} been an avid smoker before becoming an Infected. A 2-note low piano cue signals <b>the</b> <b>Smoker.</b>|$|E

25|$|One of {{his more}} famous adult stories, <b>The</b> <b>Smoker,</b> also known as Man from the South, was filmed twice as both 1960 and 1985 episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and also adapted into Quentin Tarantino's segment of the 1995 film Four Rooms. This oft-anthologised classic {{concerns}} a man in Jamaica who wagers with visitors {{in an attempt to}} claim the fingers from their hands. The 1960 Hitchcock version stars Steve McQueen and Peter Lorre.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 McKay {{introduced}} Bill C-260, {{an amendment}} to the already existing Hazardous Products Act, which forces tobacco manufacturers to produce fire safe cigarettes in response to the threat of fire posed by cigarettes left unattended. The Bill requires that cigarettes meet regulated ignition propensity standards (RIPs) by law and provide evidence to the Minister of Health of compliance with the regulation. As of October 1, 2005, all cigarettes in Canada are manufactured to self-extinguish before burning to the filter, thus reducing the risk that it will start a fire when forgotten or when <b>the</b> <b>smoker</b> falls asleep.|$|E
25|$|Le Fumeur (en. <b>The</b> <b>Smoker),</b> or Man with Pipe, is a Cubist {{painting}} by the French artist Jean Metzinger. It {{has been suggested}} that the sitter depicted in the painting represents either Guillaume Apollinaire or Max Jacob. The work was exhibited in the spring of 1914 at the Salon des Indépendants, Paris, Champ-de-Mars, March 1–April 30, 1914, no. 2289, Room 11. A photograph of Le Fumeur was published in Le Petit Comtois (Au Salon des Indépendants, Les chefs-d'œuvre modernes), 13 March 1914, for the occasion of the exhibition. In July 1914 the painting was exhibited in Berlin at Herwarth Walden’s Galerie Der Sturm, with works by Albert Gleizes, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Jacques Villon.|$|E

500|$|The cap is then {{packed with}} a smokable substance, and screwed onto the bottle {{once it is}} {{immersed}} to its neck in liquid. While lighting the bowl with (preferably) a lighter or match, the bottle is gradually lifted until it is about {{to come out of}} the water or when the substance discontinues burning. While the bottle is held in place, the lid is removed, the user's mouth is placed on the bottle opening, and the user inhales as the bottle is pushed back down into the water. The cause of the smoke being expelled by the bottle's movement is the rise in internal pressure, created when the water volume increases; the smoke enters the lungs in a [...] "smoother" [...] manner than inhaling from a joint, blunt, or bowl by itself. This will give <b>the</b> <b>smoker</b> a sudden dose with hardly any smoke lost, rather than the amount of smoke lost with joints and blunts.|$|E
500|$|After {{producing}} the James Gang's first three albums, he followed singer-guitarist Joe Walsh {{when he left}} the band, first as a solo artist with the Szymczyk-produced albums Barnstorm (the first recorded at the Caribou Ranch studio) and <b>The</b> <b>Smoker</b> You Drink, the Player You Get and later with the Eagles. His most prolific collaborations have been with Walsh; the two have made over 15 albums together in many settings. Walsh himself moved to Boulder, Colorado in 1971 in order to work with Szymczyk and the location would inspire one of Walsh's biggest solo hits, 1973's [...] "Rocky Mountain Way". Besides work with Walsh in his band The James Gang and as a solo artist, he also brought Walsh in to work on several albums he was doing with other musicians, using him as a session player for the B. B. King album Indianola Mississippi Seeds and the Michael Stanley album Friends and Legends. It was at Szymczyk's suggestion that the Eagles bring in Walsh to give them a [...] "rock" [...] edge; Walsh remained a core member of the band until Frey's death in 2016 effectively finished the band.|$|E

2500|$|Rastas {{argue that}} the use of ganja is {{promoted}} in the Bible, specifically in Genesis 1: 29, Psalms 18:8, and Revelations 22:2. Rastas portray cannabis as the supreme herb, and regard it as having healing properties. They also eulogise it for inducing feelings of [...] "peace and love" [...] in those taking it, and claim that it cultivates a form of personal introspection that allows <b>the</b> <b>smoker</b> to discover their inner divinity, or [...] "InI consciousness". Some Rastas express the view that cannabis smoke serves as an incense that counteracts perceived immoral practices, such as same-sex sexual relations, in society.|$|E

50|$|The holder {{was also}} used as a {{practical}} accessory, as {{before the advent of}} filtered cigarettes in the 1960s, the holder served several purposes. A holder kept tobacco flakes out of <b>the</b> <b>smoker's</b> mouth, kept <b>the</b> thin cigarette paper from sticking and tearing on <b>the</b> <b>smoker's</b> lips, prevented nicotine stains on fingers, cooled and mellowed the smoke and kept side-stream smoke from stinging <b>the</b> <b>smoker's</b> eyes. Occasionally <b>the</b> holder would be built to encase a filter for taste and, later, for health reasons. Though modern cigarettes are generally manufactured with an existing filter, filtered cigarette holders are occasionally used as a secondary filtration system, and to prevent nicotine staining of the fingers.|$|R

2500|$|The smoking {{of opium}} {{does not involve}} the burning of the {{material}} as might be imagined. Rather, the prepared opium is indirectly heated to temperatures at which the active alkaloids, chiefly morphine, are vaporized. In the past, smokers would use a specially designed opium pipe which had a removable knob-like pipe-bowl of fired earthenware attached by a metal fitting to a long, cylindrical stem. A small [...] "pill" [...] of opium {{about the size of}} a pea would be placed on the pipe-bowl, which was then heated by holding it over an opium lamp, a special oil lamp with a distinct funnel-like chimney to channel heat into a small area. <b>The</b> <b>smoker</b> would lie on his or her side in order to guide the pipe-bowl and the tiny pill of opium over the stream of heat rising from the chimney of the oil lamp and inhale the vaporized opium fumes as needed. Several pills of opium were smoked at a single session depending on the smoker's tolerance to the drug. The effects could last up to twelve hours.|$|E
2500|$|Smoking, {{primarily}} of tobacco, is {{an activity that}} is practiced by some 1.1billion people, and up to 1/3 of the adult population. The image of <b>the</b> <b>smoker</b> can vary considerably, but is very often associated, especially in fiction, with individuality and aloofness. Even so, smoking of both tobacco and cannabis can be a social activity {{which serves as a}} reinforcement of social structures and is part of the cultural rituals of many and diverse social and ethnic groups. Many smokers begin smoking in social settings and the offering and sharing of a cigarette is often an important rite of initiation or simply a good excuse to start a conversation with strangers in many settings; in bars, night clubs, at work or on the street. Lighting a cigarette is often seen as an effective way of avoiding the appearance of idleness or mere loitering. For adolescents, it can function as a first step out of childhood or as an act of rebellion against the adult world. Also, smoking {{can be seen as a}} sort of camaraderie. It has been shown that even opening a packet of cigarettes, or offering a cigarette to other people, can increase the level of dopamine (the [...] "happy feeling") in the brain, and it is doubtless that people who smoke form relationships with fellow smokers, in a way that only proliferates the habit, particularly in countries where smoking inside public places has been made illegal. Other than recreational drug use, it can be used to construct identity and a development of self-image by associating it with personal experiences connected with smoking. The rise of the modern anti-smoking movement in the late 19th century did more than create awareness of the hazards of smoking; it provoked reactions of smokers against what was, and often still is, perceived as an assault on personal freedom and has created an identity among smokers as rebels or outcasts, apart from non-smokers: ...|$|E
