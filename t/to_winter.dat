5|$|After subduing {{the cities}} around the capital, Thomas {{resolved}} to attack Constantinople from three sides, perhaps hoping his assault would impress its inhabitants or lead to defections. His deputies Anastasius and Gregory Pterotos would attack the Theodosian land and sea walls, respectively, while he would lead the main attack against the less formidable defenses protecting Blachernae. All of Thomas's forces were amply supplied with siege engines and catapults, and his fleet fielded quantities of Greek fire in addition to large shipborne catapults. Each of Thomas's attacks failed: the defenders' artillery proved superior and kept Thomas's engines away from the land walls, while adverse winds hindered the fleet from taking any meaningful action. Deciding that operations {{in the midst of}} winter were hazardous and unlikely to succeed, Thomas suspended all further attacks until spring and withdrew his army <b>to</b> <b>winter</b> quarters.|$|E
5|$|After this success, which {{secured the}} Balkans, Maurice {{intended}} to consolidate Roman control {{by bringing in}} Armenian settlers who would be given land in exchange for military service. To this end, Priscus was sent to Armenia to recruit men and their families. His mission there, however, {{was interrupted by a}} large-scale military revolt that brought about the downfall of Maurice. In 602, Maurice again ordered his troops on the Danube frontier <b>to</b> <b>winter</b> north of the river. Again, this provoked widespread discontent, and when Peter, who had replaced Priscus, refused to bow down and rescind the order, an outright mutiny broke out. The army chose the officer Phocas as its new leader and marched down to Constantinople. Without any credible military forces of his own, Maurice had to flee, but was captured with his family and executed by Phocas, who now became emperor.|$|E

Whilst attempting to seize Argos by night, Pyrrhus was set upon by his Argive opponents as well as the Spartans and Antigonus' Macedonians. In the ensuing mêlée, Pyrrhus was slain. His death prompted the capitulation of his army and the reestablishment of a Macedonian hegemony over Greece.|$|E

5|$|In spring 593, Priscus was re-appointed {{in command}} as {{commander}} of the cavalry in Thrace, with Gentzon leading the infantry. Priscus, as the more senior of the two, also held overall command. Both generals marched to Dorostolon on the Danube, and campaigned with success against the Slavic tribes preparing to cross the river under their leaders Ardagastus and Musocius. Crossing the river, both Slavic hosts were annihilated in surprise night attacks. At the same time, however, Priscus reportedly quarrelled with his men over {{the distribution of the}} booty captured, and especially the considerable portion Priscus allocated to the imperial family. The soldiers were eventually placated, and the booty sent back to the capital with an escort. Maurice also sent orders for the army <b>to</b> <b>winter</b> north of the river, but this caused great resentment and unrest amongst the soldiers. Priscus chose to disobey the emperor's order and crossed again with his army <b>to</b> <b>winter</b> in the southern bank. In the autumn of 593, he was replaced by Maurice with his own brother Peter. Before the latter could assume command, however, Priscus arranged for a truce with the khagan, to whom he returned all Avar captives, some 5,000 in number, a fact for which he was criticized by Maurice.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOsmia cornuta adults require {{exposure}} <b>to</b> <b>wintering</b> temperatures {{followed by}} incubation {{in the spring}} to emerge. We studied winter survival, weight loss, emergence time, and post-emergence longevity in O. cornuta exposed {{to a variety of}} pre-wintering and wintering treatments. Few bees emerged after exposure <b>to</b> <b>wintering</b> durations < 30 days. Maximum survival and longevity were obtained with wintering durations of 90 - 150 days. Time to emergence following incubation declined with increasing wintering duration and increasing wintering temperature. Pre-wintering treatment had a dramatic effect on bee fitness. Bees pre-wintered for 15 days lost less weight, had higher survival and lived longer than bees pre-wintered for 45 or 75 days. In general, larger bees were more likely <b>to</b> survive the <b>winter</b> and lived longer than smaller bees. We discuss the relevance of these results to survival in wild O. cornuta populations and the management of populations used in orchard pollination...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 223 BC, Antigonus {{advanced}} upon Tegea. He was joined there by the Achaeans and together they laid siege to it. The Tegeans held {{out for a few}} days before being forced to surrender by the Macedonians' siege weapons. After the capture of Tegea, Antigonus advanced to Laconia, where he found Cleomenes' army waiting for him. When his scouts brought news that the garrison of Orchomenus was marching to meet Cleomenes, however, Antigonus broke camp and ordered a forced march; this caught the city by surprise and forced it to surrender. Antigonus proceeded to capture Mantinea, Heraea and Telphusa, which confined Cleomenes to Laconia. Antigonus then returned to Aegium, where he gave another report about his operations before dismissing the Macedonian troops <b>to</b> <b>winter</b> at home.|$|E

5|$|Mdina was not {{attacked}} directly {{during the}} Great Siege of Malta, but it nonetheless {{played a crucial}} role in the siege. Ottoman general Lala Mustafa Pasha wanted to take over the poorly-defended city first, but was overruled by Piali Pasha who wanted to attack Fort Saint Elmo. The fort was taken over after a month of heavy fighting, but the Ottomans had lost crucial time in doing so. On 7 August 1565, the Order's cavalry in Mdina attacked the unprotected Ottoman field hospital, which led in the invaders abandoning a major assault on the main fortifications in Birgu and Senglea. The Ottomans tried to take over the city in September so as <b>to</b> <b>winter</b> there, but abandoned their plans when Mdina fired its cannon, leading them to believe that the city had ammunition to spare.|$|E
