5|$|While Silva had an {{impending}} fight with Franklin, {{he was still}} asked about his future with Jackson. Indeed, {{in an interview with}} Fighters Only Magazine, Silva reiterated his desire to fight Jackson for a fourth time, and added that he wants it to be the final fight of his career. He also said that he no longer has problems with Jackson outside of the cage. Silva ended by saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with Jackson at UFC 95 in London, England, and the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|Le souper de Beaucaire was a {{political}} pamphlet written by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1793. With the French Revolution into its fourth year, civil war had spread across France between various rival political factions. Napoleon was involved in military action, on the government's side, against some rebellious cities of southern France. It was during these events, in 1793, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with four merchants from the Midi and heard their views. As a loyal soldier of the Republic he responded in turn, set on dispelling the fears of the merchants and discouraging their beliefs. He later wrote about his conversation {{in the form of}} a pamphlet, calling for an end to the civil war.|$|E
25|$|The main {{character}} of the cartoon strip Krazy Kat spoke in a slightly exaggerated phonetically-rendered version of early-20th century Yat; friends of the New Orleans-born cartoonist George Herriman recalled <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{with many of the}} same distinctive pronunciations.|$|E
60|$|Owen's first hearty laugh {{since his}} return {{was at her}} tidings. <b>That</b> over, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with brotherly kindness.|$|R
60|$|Turning {{back into}} the room, he laid the folded sheet of paper on the table. <b>That</b> done, <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to me.|$|R
60|$|In {{the silence}} <b>that</b> {{followed}} <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> {{in a heavy}} voice, letting his eyes rest upon {{the man who had}} struck him down.|$|R
25|$|Poplawski {{moved to}} Florida in 2006, and rented {{a room in}} a woman's house. However, she later evicted him after her German Shepherd {{disappeared}} while under Poplawski's care. He later moved in with the woman's neighbor, who said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> lovingly about his grandmother but seemed disappointed in his mother.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 2008, Canadian MP Navdeep Bains {{called on}} Canadian Ambassador to the United States Michael Wilson {{to step down}} as Canada's {{ambassador}} to Washington while the leaks were investigated. Wilson publicly acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to CTV reporter Tom Clark, who first reported the leaks before the story aired, but refused to discuss what was said.|$|E
25|$|Torrey was {{for many}} years an active advisor for the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Parents felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> up for them when much of the medical {{establishment}} had previously held that parenting was responsible for schizophrenia. Torrey helped build NAMI into a powerful political force through campaigning and donating the hardcover royalties {{from the sale of}} his book Surviving Schizophrenia.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{peculiarity}} of {{this man}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> always <b>spoke,</b> like royalty, {{in the first person}} plural.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, you shet up!' says Hokum, says he. 'You never hasted to any thing,' says he. Ye see, <b>he</b> was riled, <b>that's</b> why <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> so." ...|$|R
60|$|Things <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had long}} wished to believe, <b>he</b> found <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> gustily, in broken {{incomplete}} sentences, {{but with all}} his heart and strength, of this new faith within him. <b>He</b> <b>spoke</b> of the greatness of self-abnegation, of his belief in an immortal life of Humanity {{in which we live}} and move and have our being. His voice rose and fell, and the recording appliances hummed as <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> dim attendants watched him out of the shadow....|$|R
25|$|Buckley {{was well}} known for his command of language. He came late to formal {{instruction}} in English, not learning it until he {{was seven years old}} and having earlier learned Spanish and French. Michelle Tsai in Slate says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> English with an idiosyncratic accent: something between an old-fashioned, upper class Mid-Atlantic accent, and British Received Pronunciation, with a Southern drawl.|$|E
25|$|The fraud <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> of {{regarding}} Fabre {{had been}} carried out in early October, when the French East India Company had been liquidated {{in accordance with the}} anti-capitalist legislation of the summer. The decree had apparently been falsified so that the directors were blackmailed into turning over the half-million-livre profits of this exercise to the cabal of the Convention members responsible. In 1794, Robespierre had evidence of Fabre’s criminality and he denounced Fabre for what he viewed as a particular heinous crime, criminality disguised by patriotism.|$|E
25|$|We {{really hit}} it off and we would go fishing every day. I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke.</b> His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E
50|$|Rivers spoke {{highly of}} Carson {{the night he}} died on January 23, 2005, but {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never <b>spoke</b> to her again.|$|R
6000|$|... "He must {{be putting}} in a full day sizing up <b>that</b> lumber <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> about," [...] {{observed}} Jack, as he gazed at his watch. [...] "It's nearly six o'clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{asked him}} no {{positive}} question. It would be indelicate even in {{me to have}} done <b>that.</b> But <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> as though <b>he</b> thought very highly of you." ...|$|R
25|$|When Falcone's {{record of}} success and {{high-profile}} led to resentment from some quarters, he was not given the job he coveted as chief prosecutor in Palermo. The new incumbent did not accept that the hierarchical Mafia structure revealed by the Maxi Trial actually existed, and he attempted to force Falcone to work on cases of wife beating and car theft. Falcone became so frustrated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> of resigning. During 1988 Falcone collaborated with Rudolph Giuliani, at the time U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in operations against the Gambino and Inzerillo families. Rumours impugning his integrity deeply troubled Falcone during this period.|$|E
25|$|Mavrogenes {{was born}} on Paros island to a family {{claiming}} noble origins, and spoke natively {{one of the many}} Greek dialects of the Cyclades (Ienăchiţă Văcărescu later attested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> Greek and Turkish poorly, and that {{he was not able to}} learn any Romanian). He lived among the sailors (for the rest of his life, he preferred to wear sailor's clothes in private), and was chosen dragoman of Hasan Pasha, the commander of the Ottoman fleet. Hasan, together with his friend, Grand Vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, both important figures in the politics of the Ottoman Empire, convinced the Sultan Abdul Hamid I to name Mavrogenes prince of Wallachia on 6 April 1786. He left the Ottoman capital accompanied by a huge and ostentatious retinue.|$|E
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The man said he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fire," [...] said Wingenund, and {{it seemed}} <b>that</b> as <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> a sterner shadow flitted across his bronzed face. [...] "The sun sets to-night over {{the ashes of the}} Village of Peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou camest {{through the}} snows--over the snows--to nurse me, Gudruda? Thou must love me much then," [...] {{and he was}} so weak <b>that,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>spoke,</b> the tears rolled down Eric's cheeks.|$|R
60|$|Hip. How {{much more}} gladly could I hear those words, If <b>he,</b> <b>that</b> <b>spoke</b> them, knew <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to me! [Aside.|$|R
500|$|Works by the Syriac writer Ephraim were {{translated}} into Greek. The satirist and rhetorician Lucian came from Samosata {{in the province}} of Syria; although he wrote in Greek, he calls himself a Syrian, and a reference to himself as a [...] "barbarian" [...] suggests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> Syriac.|$|E
500|$|MTV Scene writer Craig Tangsley also {{commented on}} {{fears about the}} [...] "death" [...] of the band, stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> to Bernard Fanning about the band's death as [...] "it's {{inevitable}} to talk when someone releases a best of album". Fanning denied that the band was finished, instead claiming that Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000 was spawned due to {{a deal with the}} band's record label. He also assured readers that the band had another album planned.|$|E
500|$|Gröning {{does not}} {{consider}} himself guilty of any crime, {{because he was in}} no way directly involved in the killing. He describes his part in the extermination machine as an involuntary [...] "small cog in the gears", which gave him involuntary guilt in turn. Citing his summons to testify against a member of the SS accused of murdering prisoners at Auschwitz, he also says he is innocent {{in the eyes of the}} law, pointing to the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> as a witness and not as a defendant.|$|E
60|$|Winston {{stared at}} the man, and his astonishment was evident, but the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> still <b>spoke</b> with an English accentuation, as Courthorne did, was against him.|$|R
60|$|There {{followed}} then {{a silence}} which seemed interminable. It {{was not until}} they were nearing the theatre <b>that</b> <b>he</b> suddenly <b>spoke</b> with a passion which startled her.|$|R
60|$|As they bore {{him on his}} bed {{across the}} hall of the hotel, his {{wandering}} eyes encountered {{the face of his}} wife. They rested on her for a moment, and in <b>that</b> moment <b>he</b> <b>spoke.</b>|$|R
500|$|In early 1961, {{direct ascent}} was {{generally}} the mission mode in favor at NASA. Many engineers feared that a rendezvous—let alone a docking—neither {{of which had}} been attempted even in Earth orbit, would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit. Dissenters including John Houbolt at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach. Throughout 1960 and 1961, Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option. Bypassing the NASA hierarchy, he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans; while acknowledging <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> [...] "somewhat as a voice in the wilderness," [...] Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.|$|E
500|$|On 10 June as {{a member}} of the Politburo of the Polish United Workers' Party, Jagielski offered to other members of that group to {{terminate}} his position within the Politburo, and his position as Deputy Prime Minister, stating [...] "I submit my resignation {{as a member}} of the PB (Politburo), especially since I had a certain incident in my life. I also submit my resignation as vice premier (Deputy Prime Minister)." [...] It seems his offer was rebuffed, and the incident in his life <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> of may have been a heart attack he had recently suffered. On 31 July 1981, Jagielski was fired from his position as Deputy Prime Minister, reportedly because he failed to produce a recovery program for the economic crisis Poland was experiencing at the time.|$|E
500|$|Maynard {{found the}} pirates {{anchored}} {{on the inner}} side of Ocracoke Island, on the evening of 21November. [...] He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack. [...] He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet—preventing any warning of his presence—and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that Teach could not escape to sea. [...] On {{the other side of the}} island, Teach was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout. [...] With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about24 of Adventures sailors, he also had a much-reduced crew. [...] Johnson (1724) reported that the pirate had [...] "no more than twenty-five men on board" [...] and that he [...] "gave out to all the vessels <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> with that he had forty". [...] "Thirteen white and six Negroes", was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you knew}} my mother?" [...] she said. [...] "My father never told us <b>that,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> of your {{being such a}} very old friend of his. Strange, {{to say the least}} of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Good-evening,' said he, {{looking through}} the window. 'I {{wanted to have a}} word with you.' The girl has sworn <b>that</b> as <b>he</b> <b>spoke</b> she noticed the corner of the little paper packet {{protruding}} from his closed hand.|$|R
60|$|He {{sat there}} pulling a long face {{and staring at}} the floor, but all Mrs. Cook and Emma could do 'e wouldn't tell them wot was the matter with 'im. He said 'e didn't want to worry other people with 'is troubles; let {{everybody}} bear their own, that was 'is motto. Even when George Smith offered {{to go to the}} theayter with Emma instead of 'im he didn't fire up, and, if it 'adn't ha' been for Mrs. Cook, George wouldn't ha' been sorry <b>that</b> <b>'e</b> <b>spoke.</b>|$|R
