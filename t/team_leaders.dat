The <b>team</b> <b>leaders</b> arrive at the IMO {{a few days in}} advance of the contestants and form the IMO Jury which is responsible for all the formal decisions relating to the contest, starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlist. The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6. As the leaders know the problems in advance of the contestants, they are kept strictly separated and observed.|$|E

Students are active in local and national politics, and members of the Patrick Henry College Republicans chapter often work with local political action groups to lobby for conservative issues at the federal and state levels. Classes are canceled the day of the national elections and the day before, so that students may volunteer on political campaigns; and many students act as Student Action <b>Team</b> <b>leaders</b> for Generation Joshua, leading groups of usually homeschooled high school students volunteering on campaigns across the United States.|$|E
5|$|The race {{organizers}} performed anti-doping controls {{throughout the}} race. Riders would be selected after a stage and have thirty {{minutes to get}} tested. The results generally would be returned between thirty and sixty minutes later. No rider tested positive in this edition of the Giro, but had this happened, the following penalties would have been applied: the rider would be demoted to last place of the stage, given a ten-minute penalty in the general classification, a lengthy suspension, and a fine of one thousand francs. Although no riders tested positive, Roberto Visentini, Flavio Giuppioni and Urs Zimmermann – who placed second, third and fourth, respectively, in the eighteenth stage – showed up too late for their control tests and were given the penalties corresponding to riders testing positive; after complaints and threats to leave the race from their <b>team</b> <b>leaders,</b> the jury later reverted their decision, and no penalty was given.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} of IDB projects between 1996 and 2011 disbursements. We present evidence on the evolution of disbursements with respect to the available funds and the evolution of disbursements with respect to the historic disbursement curve of IDB projects. We also identify the main factors driving disbursements. Our findings show that disbursements improved in the last 10 years; in particular, they improved after the organizational changes instituted after 2006. With respect to the factors driving disbursements, we find that: (i) Country is more important than sector in understanding performance. (ii) Most of the remaining variance in project performance can be explained by variance within each country. (iii) The <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> {{plays an important role in}} understanding project performance. (iv) The effect of <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> location on disbursement performance has not been constant over time. The effect is negative for projects approved after 1996. However, if we focus on projects approved after 2009 the effect is positive. This result also provides evidence on the success of the organizational changes undertaken after 2006. (v) Projects that underwent a change in <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> show an improvement in performance after one year of the change. (vi) <b>Team</b> <b>leader</b> characteristics related to the experience or seniority of the <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> are non-significant, though in the expected direction. <b>Team</b> <b>leader</b> may be pointing to other non-observable characteristics of the individual or characteristics of the larger team that supports that <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> in execution and supervision of the project.

40|$|One of the {{important}} elements in building effective teamwork is <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> selection. In a team, leadership {{is the most significant}} role which contributes to the success of a software project. During <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> selection, there are several criteria that should be considered for decision makers. With regard to this problem, selecting <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> can be considered as Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. One of the most popular techniques of MCDM that can be employed in selecting the suitable <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> is Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP techniques consists of three key principles which are hierarchy framework, priority analysis and consistency verification. Thus, this paper presents AHP steps to select suitable <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> based on four criteria which are personality type, academic achievement, teamwork experience, and previous programming grade. Result illustrates that AHP technique can assist decision maker to effectively evaluate the alternatives in order to select suitable <b>team</b> <b>leader,</b> particularly for Software Engineering (SE) education community...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>team</b> <b>leader</b> {{is someone}} who {{provides}} guidance, instruction, direction and leadership {{to a group of}} other individuals (the team) for the purpose of achieving a key result or group of aligned results.
