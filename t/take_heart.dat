25|$|God {{told the}} prophet to comfort God's people and bid Jerusalem to <b>take</b> <b>heart,</b> as the city's guilt {{had been paid}} off.

A voice proclaimed that all flesh is grass, its goodness like a flower of the field, which withers and fades; but God's word will stand forever. The herald of good tidings should go to the mountain and announce to the cities of Judah that God will come as a Mighty One to rule, as a shepherd that feeds the flock, gathers the lambs, carries them, and gently leads them.|$|E
