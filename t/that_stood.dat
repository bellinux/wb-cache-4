5|$|In the 6th {{or early}} 7th century a natural {{disaster}} caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried {{the surface of the}} site under a deep layer of silt, completely changing the landscape. Only those buildings <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on the valley floor also continued in use, at least those parts of it <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> above the silt, {{and it was one of}} the site's smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quiriguá, as represented by the monuments visible to this day.|$|E

5|$|Centre Philippe Sella (born 1962), who {{was also}} in the 1987 team, played 111 times for France between 1982 and 1995, setting an {{appearances}} record <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> until Fabien Pelous broke it during the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In 1986, he achieved the rare feat of scoring a try in each of France's Five Nations matches. Sella entered the International Hall in 1999 and the IRB Hall in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland again {{reached the}} {{championship}} game in 1951, but lost this time in a rematch against the Rams. Groza had a 52-yard field goal in the game, a record for a championship or Super Bowl <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> for 42 years. He was again named to the Pro Bowl after the season. The same scenario was repeated in 1952 and 1953: the Browns reached the championship both years, but lost both times to the Detroit Lions. Groza was playing with cracked ribs in the 1952 championship loss, and he missed three field goals. Groza set a record in 1953 when he made 23 field goals and had an 88.5% success rate, a single-season mark <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> for 28 years. He made the Pro Bowl again in 1952 and 1953, and was a first-team All-Pro selection both years.|$|E

'Living With Tourists' {{explored}} the impact tourism {{has had in}} the three places he grew up (the Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago and Cornwall).'Sharing It All' examined why people are so willing to share very personal experiences online and also on programmes such as World Have Your Say. 'All <b>That</b> <b>Stands</b> in the Way' looked at {{the root causes of}} gender inequality through the lives of four teenage girls from Iceland, Jordan, the UK and Lesotho. It was a TV documentary, and a separate radio documentary. Three follow-up programmes were made - 'All <b>That</b> <b>Stands</b> in the Way: The Girl', 'All <b>That</b> <b>Stands</b> in the Way: The Parents' and 'All <b>That</b> <b>Stands</b> in the Way: The Debate', which were made when the girls and their parents were brought together in New York.|$|R

5|$|Moonraker {{was noted}} for its high {{production}} cost of $34million, almost twice {{as much money as}} predecessor The Spy Who Loved Me, and it received mixed reviews. However, the film's visuals were praised with Derek Meddings being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and it eventually became the highest-grossing film of the series with $210,300,000 worldwide, a record <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> until 1995's GoldenEye.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E

5|$|As Kinkladze was {{not playing}} regular {{international}} football {{when he signed}} for Derby, he was not automatically entitled to a work permit, but a review panel gave him special dispensation, due to his previous contribution to English football. He made his debut on 28 November 1999, coming on {{as a substitute for}} Avi Nimni in a 1–2 loss against Arsenal, the first of 14 loan appearances. He scored his first Derby goal on 4 March 2000 in a 4–0 win against Wimbledon. At the end of the season, the loan move was made permanent. The transfer fee of £3 million set a club record <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> until 2007.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} phases of registration, 150 parties were {{registered}} with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. However, this number was reduced to 50 and then 24 after scrutiny from the newly created General Election Commission. This reduction from the 48 parties <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> in the 1999 legislative election was largely attributed to new an election law that allowed only parties that had won two percent of seats in the DPR, or three percent of seats in provincial and regental legislatures in half of the provinces {{to stand in the}} 2004 election. Only six parties met this requirement, and the remaining parties were required to merge or reorganize into a new party.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit.

Scully examines Dara's body with a pathologist Vicki Belon (Lorraine Landry), who notes her surgically removed extra fingers.

5|$|In {{order for}} these {{developments}} to occur, Playford personally had {{to attend to}} the bureaucracy <b>that</b> <b>stood</b> in the way. He confronted public service workers, and successfully negotiated with the heads of private companies. But it was negotiations with the Federal Government that were to prove the hardest. In his time as Premier, Playford was to confront seven different Prime Ministers: Lyons, Page, Menzies, Fadden, Curtin, Forde and Chifley. Strangely, he enjoyed best relations with the Laborite Chifley, and had a poor rapport with his fellow conservative, Menzies. During the wartime years, Menzies' reluctance to meet with Playford initially hampered industrial efforts, but Playford's other federal colleagues made sure that deals could be made.|$|E

Other prospectors attempted an alternative route across the Malaspina Glacier just to the east, suffering even greater hardships. Those who did manage to cross it found themselves having to negotiate miles of wilderness before they could reach Dawson. Their expedition was forced {{to turn back the}} same way they had come with only four men surviving.|$|E
