For understanding the threat to security and privacy {{it is important for}} security researchers to analyze malicious software written for these systems. The exploding number of Android malware calls for automation in the analysis. In this paper, we present Mobile-Sandbox, a system designed to automatically analyze Android applications in two novel ways: (1) it combines static and dynamic analysis, i. e., results of static analysis are used to guide dynamic analysis and extend coverage of executed code, and (2) it uses specific techniques <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>calls</b> to native (i. e., “non-Java”) APIs. We evaluated the system on more than 36, 000 applications from Asian thirdparty mobile markets and found that 24 % of all applications actually use native calls in their code...|$|E

Typically, a call center {{has the capacity to}} handle a considerable volume of calls at the same time, to screen calls, forward calls to qualified person to handle them, and <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>calls.</b> In this article we proposed an architecture and showed how the system works. Carolina Call Center used to manually keep track of its call information through different programs. Data would be entered on Microsoft Excel and results were displayed on Microsoft Word. This made it hard {{to keep track of the}} data in an organized matter. Since many Call Centers may encounter these problems, we found a solution by creating a database. We used Navicat as a database client, and Dreamweaver as a web-interface design. Every agent now had an employee account with a password. Each account gave the agents access to the different campaigns they were working on. The accounts also had a timer as well as a break button that automatically kept track of login, logout and breaks. Not only did the database automate work to the employees, but it was beneficial to be business as well. The decreased number of errors combined with the reduced need for employees helped the call center save money. Since the database is an efficient timesaver, it decreased the number of working hours for both management and employees. The database greatly improved the overall quality of the Carolina Call Center...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{patterns}} of paging medical interns during night calls. DESIGN: Descriptive study; diaries were used <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>calls</b> between 7 pm and 7 am for 1 week in February 1991. SETTING: Two teaching hospitals in Halifax. PARTICIPANTS: All 10 interns assigned to the 15 medical units and nurses from 3 representative medical units. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and nature of calls. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 90 %. A total of 309 calls were logged by the interns and 107 by the nurses. Each intern had 17 calls on average (range 6 to 33) per 12 -hour period. Of the calls 27 % occurred after midnight, 25 % disrupted sleeping, and 19 % interrupted direct patient contact. Overall, the most common reasons for paging interns were related to prescribing of medications (42 % of the calls), direct patient assessment (25 %) and reporting of laboratory results (18 %). According to the nurses, there were no delays in the interns' responding to the pages, and 61 % of the calls led to a new physician order. CONCLUSIONS: Paging frequently interrupts interns during work and rest on night calls. Assessment of paging patterns {{may be useful in}} identifying specific interventions {{to reduce the number of}} calls so that interns will have fewer interruptions during patient encounters and more rest. The collection of data from nurses in a routine nursing audit may be useful for evaluating the communication between interns and nurses and, indirectly, for assessing interns' workload...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} identifies different technologies used {{to assist}} with the management of help desks, including Call Management Software, Problem Resolution Systems and Computer Telephony Integration, showing how they can improve efficiency. The requirements of the help desk at Cheshire County Council are identified by analysing the current system and by sending a survey to the customers. The survey also attempts to establish whether the use of new technology would be acceptable to the customers. A pilot study, giving staff in Social Services access to a list of FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) was set up to gauge the effectiveness of a simple problem resolution system, however because of the pressures of other work on support staff this has not yet been completed. The research showed that the new technologies would not be beneficial unless the information held (particularly the contact database) is accurate. The failure to implement the FAQ in Social Services highlighted the problems of allocating the resources needed to achieve this in an organisation where staff are under pressure solving current problems. Providing the contact database is maintained and a knowledge base set up, with procedures in place to ensure the information is correct and relevant, then replacing the problem management system and introducing a problem resolution system could potentially improve the efficiency of the help desk. This would be achieved by giving management access to the relevant information to enable them to make decisions, increasing the spot rate (calls answered on first call) and by reducing the time <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>calls.</b> Recommendations are made for introducing changes and for further research...|$|E
30|$|To {{test for}} this possibility, we {{generate}} synthetic grid squares at larger levels of aggregation. The nonoverlapping tiles begin with edge length of 1 {{which is the}} original 235  m aggregation, edge length of 2 is twice that at 470  m, and doubling accordingly up to 64 by 64 grid squares. Figure  6 (b) shows the change in <b>log</b> population relative <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>call</b> volume with points colored by their level of aggregation and a LOESS curve with 95 % confidence intervals. If the relationship were only scale driven, larger aggregations with population above 351 persons should be distributed around the 45 degree line of proportionality one. Instead, each level of aggregation shows a hook pattern, shifting to a proportionality of 1 above some population size except for very large aggregations which lie almost entirely on the 45 degree line. This relationship supports the view that, regardless of aggregation, there is something different about measurements from sparse areas. It also demonstrates why other studies depending on larger levels of aggregations would show near proportionality averaging over the difference between kinds of areas.|$|R

40|$|If {{programs}} access {{types and}} members through reflection, refactoring tools cannot guarantee that refactorings on those programs are behavior preserving. Refactoring approaches for highly reflective languages like Smalltalk therefore check behavior preservation using regression testing. In this {{paper we propose}} RefaFlex, a novel and more defensive approach towards the refactoring of reflective (Java) programs. RefaFlex uses a dynamic program analysis <b>to</b> <b>log</b> reflective <b>calls</b> during test runs and then uses this information to proactively prevent the programmer from executing refactorings that could otherwise alter the program’s behavior. This makes re-running test cases obsolete: when a refactoring is permitted, tests passing originally are guaranteed to pass for the refactored program as well. In some cases, we further re-write reflective calls, permitting refactorings that would otherwise have to be rejected. We have implemented RefaFlex as an open source Eclipse plugin and offer extensions for six Eclipse refactoring tools addressing naming, typing, and accessibility issues. Our evaluation with 21, 524 refactoring runs on three open source programs shows that our tool successfully prevents 1, 358 non-behaviour-preserving refactorings which the plain Eclipse refactorings would have incorrectly permitted...|$|R

40|$|MBA - WBSContext This {{research}} {{is a study}} of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) in a South African public hospital using the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban as a case study. An investigation of the challenges facing the PPP {{as well as the}} key success factors for this PPP, as expressed by interview respondents, will be determined. Based on findings made in these investigations, a proposal for key success factors for PPPs in South African public hospitals will be made. A brief statement of the problem The researcher has investigated what the challenges are for PPPs in South African public hospitals. Thereafter key success factors for PPPs are determined. The method of data collection In-depth interviews were conducted to elicit responses to the research problems. A set of interview questions were prepared prior to the interviews and were posed to the respondents. This ensured that the interviewer got responses to similar questions so as {{to be able to get}} information on the research problems. The key findings Several challenges are facing the PPP being studied. These are a perceived high cost of the PPP as well as doubts about value for money in the partnership. The other challenges are dissatisfaction by some of the managers, on the client’s side, about the functioning of the help desk, response <b>to</b> <b>logged</b> <b>calls</b> and application of the penalty clause. ii Failure by the state to appoint a dedicated, full time, appropriately qualified and skilled contract manager was cited as the main weakness in the management of the PPP. Key success factors of the PPP were that the service provider was in a position to provide the state with a high quality package in all the areas under the PPP; these are Facilities Management, Information Technology and Medical equipment. There had been adequate stakeholder participation during the planning phase of the partnership and even now there are various forums at which the service provider meets with the client at various areas of management and at operational level. The key message PPPs in the South African public sector are a fairly new concept that is providing some lessons to be learnt. Although PPPs provide required capital to enable the state to venture into high value massive public health sector projects, there are challenges facing PPPs and every effort needs to be made to ensure that the challenges and risks are avoided or, at least, mitigated against. Key success factors have been identified in this case study and, ensuring that these are factored into future PPPs in the health sector will definitely assist government in planning and implementing successful partnerships...|$|R

The exponential growth rate h (with respect to the natural logarithm) of the number of configurations on a multi-dimensional grid arises in the theory of various physical phenomena [22, 9, 6]. In physics e h is viewed as the entropy (per atom) of the corresponding hard model, in mathematics h is called the topological entropy [10], and in information theory h (with respect <b>to</b> <b>log</b> 2) is <b>called</b> the multi-dimensional capacity [24]. The one-dimensional case is easy, namely e h is the spectral radius ρ(A) of the corresponding transfer matrix. There are very few 2 -dimensional models where the value of h is known in closed form [7, 18, 19, 1]. In all other cases there are estimates based on (a) asymptotic expansions, e. g., [20, 12]; (b) Monte-Carlo methods, e. g., [15, 2]; (c) bounds, e. g., [14, 5, 4, 8, 21]. In what follows we give the complete up-to-date theory for computing h by lower and upper bounds. It refines the techniques described in [11] by using an automorphism subgroup of a certain graph. As a demonstration of these techniques, we compute the topological entropy of the monomerdimer system in a plane grid with 8 -digit precision. We compare our results to the known results...|$|R
