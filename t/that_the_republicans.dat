5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of absentee ballots and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting results. The 2010 election race was widely followed in the mainstream press as a race <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were targeting.|$|E
5|$|As the 46th Congress {{convened in}} 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, {{but they still}} held a {{plurality}} of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, {{most of whom were}} affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.|$|E
5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, {{the book}} talks about <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Revolution spearheaded by Newt Gingrich. Sanders adds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Revolution works {{hand in hand}} with the Christian Coalition, whose main focus is on [...] "immigrant and gay bashing." [...] The 2015 {{reedition}} argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Revolution remains relevant because [...] "for Sanders, <b>the</b> only thing <b>that’s</b> changed over <b>the</b> past 20 years is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bad guys have got worse." ...|$|R

25|$|Although DOL {{had begun}} {{investigating}} Presser in 1981, DOJ's failed 1981 prosecution {{as well as}} retractions of newspaper stories led many to believe that allegations of criminal wrongdoing by Presser were unfounded. Presser's close political ties to the Reagan administration convinced some <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were protecting Presser and the Teamsters from prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Dyer ran unsuccessfully {{for reelection}} in 1932, 1934 and 1936, during the Great Depression. Black voters had been {{disappointed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{had failed to}} deliver on their promise to pass an anti-lynching law, {{part of the national}} platform in 1920, and by President Hoover's approach to dealing with economic problems. The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt attracted many voters to Democratic candidates because he was putting people to work through the Works Progress Administration and providing social aid programs.|$|E
25|$|After {{passage of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964, most Southerners {{accepted}} the integration of most institutions (except public schools). With the old barrier to becoming a Republican removed, Southerners joined the new {{middle class and the}} Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Integration thus liberated Southern politics from the old racial issues. In 1963, the federal courts declared unconstitutional the practice of excluding African-American voters from the Democratic primaries, which had been the only elections that mattered in most of the South. Meanwhile, the newly enfranchised black voters supported Democratic candidates at the 85–90% level, a shift which further convinced many white segregationists <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were no longer the black party.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} results gave Nelson 292,771 votes (49.91%) to Orr's 288,741 (49.23%). [...] Sullivan, {{running as}} a write-in, garnered 1887 votes (0.32%); other write-ins received 3143 votes (0.54%). [...] Nelson won 19 counties <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had won in the 1986 gubernatorial election, {{many of them in}} areas that had been suggested as locations for the radioactive-waste disposal site.|$|E
500|$|In federal court, Bradley argued {{on behalf}} of the Republican minor {{officers}} that the Goebel Election Law deprived citizens of their right to vote. The right to vote, he claimed, was inherent in the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of [...] "liberty", and could not be taken from any citizen without due process. Federal judge William Howard Taft ruled <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> would have to seek remedy in the state courts. After a protracted legal battle, all of the minor officers were unseated except Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{opened his}} {{campaign}} on August 22 in London, a Republican stronghold in eastern Kentucky. Among his supporters were Senator Deboe, Congressman Samuel Pugh, Caleb Powers, and former Republican gubernatorial candidate Thomas Z. Morrow (who {{was also the}} brother-in-law of Governor Bradley). Taylor stressed the economic prosperity brought about during the McKinley administration. He reminded the crowd <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had not supported the enslavement of blacks and stated they would not now support {{what he called the}} [...] "political enslavement" [...] that would result from electing Goebel.|$|E
50|$|In The Grapple, {{comments}} by Jake Featherston suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> movement in Mexico {{has never been}} completely suppressed, and <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> Empire didn't support the Confederacy, the Confederates might support <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> rebels.|$|R

500|$|Dow mostly {{ignored the}} {{national}} contest that summer, focusing on campaigning for pro-temperance candidates in local Maine elections. Republicans pressured Dow to withdraw, fearing {{that he would}} claim enough votes to cost their nominee, James A. Garfield, the election. Dow declined to do so, but his vote totals were too small to harm Garfield in any case. The Prohibition ticket polled just 10,305 votes, 0.1% of the total. Garfield narrowly won the popular vote over Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, but in the electoral college, he carried a clear majority. Dow was not displeased with the result, happy <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had triumphed over the [...] "ex-slavedriving rebel element".|$|E
500|$|While Sam and Bruno are {{concerned}} about the loyalty of a powerful California union official (Sandoval), Toby and Josh are preparing for a meeting with the congressional opposition to re-negotiate the estate tax—or the [...] "death tax" [...] as the Republicans have labeled it—but are then surprised by a last-minute cancellation. It soon becomes clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> are planning to repeal the estate tax altogether, and might have the votes to do so. An attempt to win over the black caucus, led by Congressman Mark Richardson (Barry), fails. At a loss over what to do, an initiative comes from unexpected quarters. The previously over-cautious political strategist, Doug Wegland, suggests the president responds by doing something he has never done before: veto the bill.|$|E
500|$|The presidential {{campaign}} of 1904, as Roosevelt sought election {{in his own}} right, brought Mr. Dooley ample opportunity to comment. The bartender mocked those who wished to be vice presidential candidate on Roosevelt's ticket, alleging <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> [...] "found a man from Wisconsin who was in drink and almost nominated him when his wife came in and dragged him away. They got Senator Fairbanks to accept... by showing him a picture of our great and noble president trying to jump a horse over a six-foot fence". The president's enthusiastic campaigning attracted Mr. Dooley's attention: [...] "And when Theodore Roosevelt kisses a baby thousands of mothers in {{all corners of the}} land hear the report and the baby knows it's been kissed and bears the honorable scar through life. Twenty years from now the country will be full of young fellows looking as though they'd graduated from a German college." ...|$|E

500|$|Three {{weeks after}} the election, Breckinridge {{returned}} to Washington, D.C., to preside over the Senate's lame duck session. Lazarus Powell, now a senator, proposed a resolution creating a committee of thirteen members {{to respond to the}} portion of Buchanan's address regarding the disturbed condition of the country. Breckinridge appointed the members of the committee, which, in Heck's opinion, formed [...] "an able committee, representing every major faction". John J. Crittenden proposed a compromise by which slavery would be forbidden in territories north of parallel 36°30′ north—the demarcation line used in the Missouri Compromise—and permitted south of it, but the committee's five Republicans rejected the proposal. On December 31, the committee reported that it could come to no agreement. Writing to Magoffin on January 6, Breckinridge complained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were [...] "rejecting everything, proposing nothing" [...] and [...] "pursuing a policy which... threatens to plunge the country into... civil war".|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{was already}} {{arranging}} to research Voorhis's record {{and to meet}} with Republican leaders in Washington, including House Minority Leader (and future Speaker) Joseph W. Martin, Jr. [...] The newly minted candidate wrote to Day regarding Voorhis, [...] "His 'conservative' reputation must be blasted. But my main efforts are being directed toward building up a positive, progressive group of speeches which tell {{what we want to}} do, not what the Democrats have failed to do... I'm really hopped up over this deal, and I believe we can win." [...] However, [...] "" [...] Republicans deemed Nixon's campaign hopeless. [...] Nixon was a virtual unknown outside of his hometown of Whittier and was facing a popular and respected incumbent. [...] Charles Voorhis wrote his son <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had endorsed a Quaker named Richard Nixon, but hoped that his son would retain {{a large part of the}} Quaker vote. The elder Voorhis was confident that his son would triumph again, writing, [...] "It is just another campaign that we have to go through... In any event, we have nothing to worry about now." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} at Genoa {{was compounded by}} the presence of French warships in Genoese waters. Those parts of the French fleet which had not been seized at Toulon were now deprived of a home port and so had taken refuge in neutral Italian ports, relying on Italian neutrality to protect them from attack by the more numerous enemy fleets operating in the Ligurian Sea. [...] Two of the largest such ships were the 36-gun frigate Modeste and 40-gun Impérieuse, which had taken shelter at Genoa and Leghorn, in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, respectively. They presented both a threat to Allied shipping and an impediment to the movement of reinforcements through the Italian ports, but despite strong protests from Drake and Lord Hervey, Ambassador to Tuscany, the Republican sympathisers in Genoa and Leghorn refused to compel the French ships to leave. In July Modeste and the French corvette Badine had deliberately obstructed the frigate HMS Aigle in the neutral harbour, forcing Captain John Nicholson Inglefield to take evasive action, a calculated insult. In consequence, Hood resolved that the frigates be eliminated so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in Genoa would be coerced into withdrawing their support.|$|E

500|$|On October 17, 2008, in Brunner v. Ohio Republican Party, 07A332, the United States Supreme Court {{overturned}} the 6th Circuit Decision requiring Brunner to provide lists of improperly registered voters to each county election board. [...] The ruling means that Brunner can instruct the 88 county boards of elections to ignore public record requests by the Ohio Republican Party made to challenge registrants with information mismatched between their registration and their driver's license or social security number. [...] The Republican Party {{claimed that the}} ruling {{was based on a}} technicality rather than the merits of the arguments. [...] Bennett said that [...] "The justices did not disagree with our argument that Jennifer Brunner has failed to comply with federal election law. [...] They merely said we don't have a right to bring a private challenge against her under this particular provision." [...] The McCain-Palin campaign said [...] "...the United States Supreme Court does not address violations of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) by Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner. Rather, the Court ruled that Congress had likely not authorized private individuals or political parties to bring suit under the section of HAVA requiring voter registration verification through data-matching." [...] Since the ruling did not directly address the issues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> wanted determined, they filed a similar case in the Ohio Supreme Court. [...] However, they withdrew the case.|$|E
500|$|In 1883, Ohio Governor Charles Foster, a Republican who {{had held}} the office since 1880, looked for a Republican {{contender}} to succeed him. [...] Foster had sought increased regulation of the liquor trade, offending many German-Americans, who were deemed likely to vote Democratic in reaction, and who were especially concentrated in Cincinnati. [...] Few expected the Republicans to retain the governorship, and prominent candidates such as Senator John Sherman and Congressman Benjamin Butterworth declined to run. [...] Foster saw Foraker as a candidate likely to do well: [...] he was a Civil War veteran with a good record as a lawyer and a promising public speaker—and his Cincinnati residence might win back some votes. [...] Others agreed; the local United States Attorney wrote to Senator Sherman <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> should nominate [...] "Foraker or some other unobjectionable man". [...] Foster accordingly wrote to Foraker, offering him the chance at [...] "honorable distinction and useful service." [...] Foraker came to Columbus just before the 1883 state convention, and sounded out state Republican leaders such as Sherman and Congressman William McKinley. [...] When Foraker found them willing to support him, he allowed his name {{to be placed in}} nomination, and once it was clear that Sherman would not run, the convention nominated Foraker by acclamation. [...] The Democratic Cincinnati Enquirer summed up the Republican strategy: [...] "They determined to sacrifice as little as possible, so they sacrificed Foraker." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the caucus, {{comments}} made by Obama concerning former Republican president Ronald Reagan attracted rebuke from rivals and dissection from all sections of the media. Obama had stated in an interview that: [...] "Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America {{in a way that}} Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not." [...] According to the New York Times, Hillary Clinton [...] "ridiculed the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were the party of ideas, suggesting Mr. Obama had said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had 'better' ideas". MSNBC noted that Senator John Edwards [...] "criticized Obama specifically for referring to Ronald Reagan as an agent of change [...] in a newspaper interview [...] 'I would never use Ronald Reagan as an example of change.'" ...|$|E
