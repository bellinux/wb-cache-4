50|$|If not <b>thrombosed,</b> {{external}} <b>hemorrhoids</b> {{may cause}} few problems. However, when <b>thrombosed,</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> {{may be very}} painful. Nevertheless, this pain typically resolves {{in two to three}} days. The swelling may, however, take a few weeks to disappear. A skin tag may remain after healing. If hemorrhoids are large and cause issues with hygiene, they may produce irritation of the surrounding skin, and thus itchiness around the anus.|$|R
40|$|Introduction:External {{hemorrhoids}} {{are located}} {{outside of the}} dentate line and covered by anoderm. <b>Thrombosed</b> external <b>hemorrhoids</b> {{are one of the}} frequent acute anorectal diseases which are treated successfully in the proctology outpatient room. The etiology of this disease is still unknown. Knowledge of the etiology of <b>thrombosed</b> external <b>hemorrhoids</b> could prevent recurrence of this disease and help prepare good prophylaxis. Material/Methods:A group of 50 patients with a diagnosis of <b>thrombosed</b> external <b>hemorrhoids</b> and treated in the Mikolaj Pirogow Regional Specialist Hospital in Lodz was interviewed by means of the author’s own questionnaire concerning demography and published hypothesis. The necessary statistics were conducted by means of STATISTICA 7. 1 and EXCEL 2008 programs. Results:The analysis of the survey results shows a significant relationship of <b>thrombosed</b> external <b>hemorrhoids</b> and presence of internal hemorrhoids, practice of anoreceptive sex and consumption of more alcohol products than usual. There was no statistical relationship between lifting heavy objects, eating spicy food, having hard stools or straining at toilet during motions and <b>thrombosed</b> external <b>hemorrhoids.</b> Conclusions:This study confirmed three hypotheses on the causes of <b>thrombosed</b> external <b>hemorrhoids</b> which were presented in medical journals available in the MEDLINE database. The author of this article believes {{that it is necessary to}} conduct a multi-center study, which would explain the exact etiology of this disease. Knowledge about the etiology of thrombosed external disease would help develop effective prevention and treatment...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMalignant {{melanoma}} of the anal canal is a rare, but aggressive, tumor with a poor prognosis. It represents {{less than}} 1 % of all melanomas and 4 % of anorectal tumors. We are reporting {{this case because}} of its rarity in men and because, in this instance, the tumor was misdiagnosed as prolapsed <b>thrombosed</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> and excised. Examination showed a visible exophytic irreducible growth measuring about 3  ×  3  cm and protruding outside the anal verge and involving the anterior two-thirds of the circumference of the anal canal. A biopsy sample showed round to oval cells with prominent nucleoli and marked intracytoplasmic pigmentation. A magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a tumor with nearly complete luminal obstruction and liver metastasis. The patient received chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but the response was very poor and he died 2 months later...|$|R
30|$|Chronic {{pelvic pain}} (CPP) afflicts 7 to 24  % of the {{population}} and is associated with impaired quality of life and high health care costs. Coccygeal, perianal, perineal, and/or genital pain are frequent complaints that usually occur as a result of common and easily recognizable organic disorders, such as anal fistulae, viral or bacterial infections, <b>thrombosed</b> <b>hemorrhoids,</b> genitoanal cancer, or other dermatologic pathologies. However, they can also occur under circumstances in which no organic cause can be identified. Chronic pelvic pain without any apparently etiology always constitutes a challenge for patients and clinicians. A correct diagnosis is crucial for etiologic treatment of the underlying cause. CPP can occur due to pelvic conditions that affect the nerves or to pathologies of the pelvic nerves and plexuses themselves. Therefore, knowledge beyond the limits of gynecology is required for proper diagnosis. Additional knowledge of pelvic neuroanatomy and clinical neurology is mandatory. This multidisciplinary field, referred to as neuropelveology, focuses on the diagnosis of pathologies and injuries to the pelvic nerves and plexuses responsible for the development of “non-gynecologic” chronic pelvic pain.|$|R
5000|$|Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is a {{surgical}} excision of the hemorrhoid used primarily only in severe cases. It {{is associated with}} significant postoperative pain and usually requires 2-4 weeks for recovery. However, the long-term benefit is greater in those with grade 3 hemorrhoids as compared to rubber band ligation. It is the recommended treatment in those with a <b>thrombosed</b> external <b>hemorrhoid</b> if carried out within 24-72 hours. Glyceryl trinitrate ointment after the procedure helps both with pain and healing.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Hemorrhoid {{disease is}} the cause of most proctologic {{complaints}} and hundreds of medical and surgical therapies have been proposed to relieve symptoms. However, the role and the correct indication of medical treatments are still controversial. Further, the utility of conservative measures are rarely scientifically supported by adequate trials. Areas covered: This narrative review is based on the search and analysis of full papers in English language selected from PubMed in the past 30 years using the following MeSH Editing: hemorrhoids, conservative treatment, medical treatment and hemorrhoids, pregnancy and <b>hemorrhoids,</b> <b>thrombosed</b> <b>hemorrhoids,</b> randomized trials and hemorrhoids, postoperative pain and hemorrhoids. Expert opinion: Early stages (I/II degrees) of this disease could be effectively managed conservatively with several approaches as lifestyle changes, fiber supplement, topical ointments and phlebotonic drugs. The more advanced hemorrhoid stages (III/IV degrees) need some type of surgery, but medical therapy is still useful to minimize anal symptoms as a bridge-to-surgery treatment. Further, post-hemorrhoidectomy pain, hemorrhoidal crisis even in pregnancy could benefit from the adjunct of local and systemic medical treatment. This expert opinion, based also on long-lasting clinical practice, also supports the use of medical treatment in symptoms relief in patients with hemorrhoid disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy is {{believed}} to result in less postoperative pain because of a closed wound. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy, without a perianal wound, should thus have lesser pain. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to compare stapled hemorrhoidopexy (SH) with Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy (FH). Methods: Fifty patients with third-degree or early fourthdegree hemorrhoids who required surgery were recruited. Patients were prospectively randomized to receive either FH or SH. Data collected include operative time, hospital stay, fecal incontinence and pain scores, morbidity and complications. Results: SH patients had less pain in the early postoperative period. There {{were no significant differences}} in hospital stay or major complications. One patient after SH required emergency reintervention for <b>thrombosed</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> distal to the staple line. FH patients had more minor problems of bleeding, wound discharge and pruritus. Fecal incontinence was similar in the 2 groups but two of the three patients with daily incontinence to gas after SH claimed that their lifestyle was affected. Conclusions: SH is safe to perform and results in less postoperative pain as well as less minor morbidity. Early reintervention and incontinence to gas compromising lifestyle occurred only after SH...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. An {{association}} between hemorrhoidal disease and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{has been described}} previously. MMPs regulate extracellular structural proteins and tissue remodeling. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) {{is involved in the}} regulation of MMP activity. The aim of this work was to study the relationship between tissue immunoreactive levels of MMPs and NGAL and different stages of hemorrhoids. Methods. In a multicenter, open-label, prospective study, the population under investigation consisted of 2 groups: group I (with symptomatic hemorrhoids; Goligher grade I–IV) and group II (healthy volunteers). Results. We enrolled 97 patients with hemorrhoids: 21 with grade I hemorrhoids, 37 with grade II, 14 with grade III, and 25 with grade IV. Finally, 90 healthy volunteers (53 males and 37 females; age range, 19 – 70 years; median, 56) were enrolled in group II. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis revealed greater levels of immunoreactive MMPs and NGAL in all patients with hemorrhoids. We recorded significantly greater levels of MMP- 1 and MMP- 3 in grade I and II patients compared with control, and greater levels of MMP- 3, MMP- 7, MMP- 8, and MMP- 9 in grade III compared with grade II. MMP- 9 and NGAL were particularly increased in patients with grade IV especially in case of <b>thrombosed</b> <b>hemorrhoids.</b> Conclusion. These results provide potentially important insights into the understanding of the natural history of hemorrhoids. MMPs and NGAL play a role in development of disease and may represent molecular markers for the complications such as hemorrhoidal thrombosis. (Surgery 2015...|$|R

Methods: A prospective cohort study of 72 adults with TEH was conducted: no surgery, no sitz baths but gentle dry cleaning with smooth toilet paper after defecation. Follow-up information was collected six months after admission by questionnaire. Results: Despite our strict conservative management policy 62. 5 % (45 / 72) of patients (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 51. 0 &ndash; 74. 0) described themselves as &ldquo;healed&rdquo; or &ldquo;ameliorated&rdquo;, and 61. 1 % (44 / 72, 95 % CI: 49. 6 &ndash; 72. 6) found our management policy as &ldquo;valuable to test&rdquo; or &ldquo;impracticable&rdquo;. 13. 9 % (10 / 72, 95 % CI: 5. 7 &ndash; 22. 1) of patients suspected to have recurrences. 4. 2 % did not know. Twenty-two of the 48 responding patients reported symptoms such as itching (18. 8 %), soiling (12. 5 %), pricking (10. 4 %), or a sore bottom (8. 3 %) once a month (59. 1 %, 13 / 22), once a week (27. 3 %, 6 / 22), or every day (13. 6 %, 3 / 22). Conclusions: The dictum that surgery is {{the gold standard}} for therapy for TEH should be checked by randomized controlled trials.

40|$|Hemorrhoids are common, and a {{significant}} proportion of patients who have hemorrhoids experience symptoms such as bleeding, pain and itching. Endoscopic hemorrhoidal ligation is a safe and effective technique indicated for the treatment of grade 1 to 3 hemorrhoids, with a high success and low complication rate. Complications, when they occur, are minor and may include painful <b>thrombosed</b> prolapsed <b>hemorrhoids,</b> slippage of bands, minor rectal bleeding and chronic longitudinal ulcer. Rare, potentially life-threatening complications are massive hemorrhage and pelvic sepsis. A case of massive, life-threatening lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage following endoscopic hemorrhoidal rubber-band ligation is presented. Our patient ingested aspirin intermittently following the procedure. In a study documenting complications after hemorrhoidal band ligation, two of three individuals requiring transfusion for massive hemorrhage were taking aspirin on a regular basis. The risk of massive hemorrhage after hemorrhoidal rubber band ligation is probably increased by ingestion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It may be wise to withhold such drugs soon after the procedure, if feasible...|$|R
