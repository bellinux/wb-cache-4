40|$|The {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in a nursery <b>of</b> <b>sour</b> cherry ‘Łutówka’ budded on Prunus mahaleb L. in the years 1993, 2000 – 2003, and 2013. The height of trees, the diameter of stems, {{and the length of}} lateral shoots were measured. The air temperature and precipitation higher than the long-term mean (by approximately 10 % and 28 %, respectively) contributed to the increase in the stem diameter, the total length of shoots, and the number of shoots per tree. The length of lateral shoots increased {{from the top of the}} crown towards the lower parts, however, the number of feathers per tree and the mean length of shoots decreased. A strong positive relationship (r = 0. 74, P < 0. 05) was revealed between the stem diameter and the total length of shoots.

50|$|In the 19th century, {{bread-making}} in {{the cities}} moved to local bakeries. Poor households baked their own bread daily in small apartments. The bread consisted of thinner, multigrain breads, elongated sekaleipä mixed-cereal bread. Bread was made from {{all four of the}} cereals grown in Finland: wheat, rye, barley and oats, usually ground into various grades. Rye bread can be either light or dark in colour, depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> flour mixture used, and it is typical for rye bread to include about 20% wheat flour. New trends and old traditions are bringing old-fashioned rye breads back to the shelves in shops. These rye breads are made entirely from rye flour and are the most common breads in the Finnish diet. Other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>sour</b> bread are still baked in the residual heat of ovens and the longer baking time at low temperature gives the bread both a darker colour and a higher density and hardness than ordinary rye bread. A few wheat breads are still made in Finland, although most are simple buns or loaves of sliced or unsliced bread. Vesirinkeli, water rings, are small, almost tasteless rings of yeast-leavened wheat bread, which resemble bagels. They are cooked in salted boiling water before being baked. Oats are the most commonly produced grain in Finland and many oat bread types are available, although they are not as popular as rye breads. The most common bread types in Finland are bread rolls or buns, “sämpylä” or flat soft bread pieces.|$|R
50|$|Animals, {{specifically}} humans, {{have five}} different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> tastes: sweet, <b>sour,</b> salty, bitter, and umami. As animals have evolved, the tastes {{that provide the}} most energy (sugar and fats) are the most pleasant to eat while others, such as bitter, are not enjoyable. Water, while important for survival, has no taste. Fats, on the other hand, especially saturated fats, are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.|$|R
40|$|Research {{studies in}} the area of biotechnologies in fruit growing started at the Agricultural Institute Osijek in 2006 with the {{establishment}} of the first experimental in vitro laboratory for micropropagation. The laboratory started an active research related to the Project "Biotechnological methods in fruit tree identification, selection and propagation" Project is part of program "Preservation and revitalization of grape and fruit autochthonous cultivars". The goal of this research is to determine genetic differences between autochthonous and introduced cultivars of cherry as well as cultivars and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>sour</b> cherry, to find and optimize a method for fast recovery of clonal material. A great number of cherry cultivars and types within the population <b>of</b> cv. Oblacinska <b>sour</b> cherry exists in Croatia. A survey with the purpose of selecting autochthonous cultivars for further selection has been done in previous research. Differences have been found in a number of important agronomic traits within the populations <b>of</b> cv. Oblačinska <b>sour</b> cherry. Autochthonous cherry cultivars are suspected to be synonyms of known old cultivars which were introduced randomly and have been naturalized under a local name. Identification and description <b>of</b> cultivars and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> fruits is based on special visible properties which were measurable or notable. In this approach difficulties arise from the effect of non-genetic factors on expression of certain traits. Genetic-physiological problem of S allele autoincompatibility exists within cherry cultivars. Therefore it is necessary to put different cultivars in the plantation to pollinate each other. Apart form the fast and certain sort identification independent of environmental factors, biotechnological methods based on PCR enable faster virus detection compared with classical serologic methods and indexing and cover a wider range of plant pathogens including those undetectable by other methods. Thermotherapy and tissue culture makes possible the recovery of valuable clone material and its introduction in the premultiplication process. Detection of S alleles enable determination of compatible cultivar pairs in orchards...|$|R
