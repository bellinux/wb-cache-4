5|$|Early in his reign, Justinian {{appointed}} the quaestor Tribonian to oversee this task. The {{first draft of}} the Codex Iustinianus, a codification of imperial constitutions from the 2nd century onward, was issued on 7 April 529. (The final version appeared in 534.) It {{was followed by the}} Digesta (or Pandectae), a compilation of older legal texts, in 533, and by the Institutiones, a textbook explaining the principles of law. The Novellae, a collection of new laws issued during Justinian's reign, supplements <b>the</b> <b>Corpus.</b> As opposed to the rest of <b>the</b> <b>corpus,</b> the Novellae appeared in Greek, the common language of the Eastern Empire.|$|E
5|$|The luteal {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the ovarian cycle and it {{corresponds}} to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into <b>the</b> <b>corpus</b> luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by <b>the</b> <b>corpus</b> luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that <b>the</b> <b>corpus</b> luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and <b>the</b> <b>corpus</b> luteum subsequently atrophies. Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation {{and the beginning of the}} next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a collection of}} multimodal corpora of referring expressions, <b>the</b> REX <b>corpora.</b> <b>The</b> <b>corpora</b> have two notable features, namely (1) they include time-aligned extra-linguistic information such as participant actions and eye-gaze on top of linguistic information, (2) dialogues were collected with various configurations {{in terms of the}} puzzle type, hinting and language. After describing how <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> were constructed and sketching out each, we present an analysis of various statistics for <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> with respect to the various configurations mentioned above. The analysis showed that <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> have different characteristics in the number of utterances and referring expressions in a dialogue, the task completion time and the attributes used in the referring expressions. In this respect, we succeeded in constructing a collection of corpora that included a variety of characteristics by changing the configurations for each set of dialogues, as originally planned. <b>The</b> <b>corpora</b> are now under preparation for publication, to be used for research on human reference behaviour...|$|R

50|$|Physiologically, {{erection}} is {{triggered by}} the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), causing nitric oxide (a vasodilator) levels to rise in the trabecular arteries and smooth muscle of the penis.

5|$|Justinian {{achieved}} lasting fame {{through his}} judicial reforms, particularly through the complete revision of all Roman law, {{something that had}} not previously been attempted.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of prothoracicotropic hormone in the pupal brain of Manduca sexta {{has been determined}} by an in vitro assay for prothoracic gland activation. Prothoracicotropic activity was observed in both the brain and retrocerebral complex, but predominantly in the dorosolateral regions of the protocerebrum. Of {{the two groups of}} neurosecretory cells present in this area of the brain, only the two lateral type III neurosecretory cells exhibited significant prothoracicotropic hormone activity. Further analysis revealed that the neurohormone was localized in only one of the two type III cells, suggesting that a single neurosecretory cell in each hemisphere {{is the source of the}} hormone at the stage examined (day 0). Prothoracicotropic hormone activity was detected in both <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> allata and <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> cardiaca, but <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> allata contained 2 to 9 times the activity of <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> cardiaca, depending on developmental stage. The significantly higher level of activity in <b>the</b> <b>corpora</b> allata suggests that they may be the neurohemal organs through which the prothoracicotropic hormone of Manduca is released...|$|R
