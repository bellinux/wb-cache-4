5|$|After {{suffering}} over 4,000 {{casualties in}} ten days, {{the failure of}} the last attack ended the 45th Division's role as the only combatant on the Chinese side. The UN forces had gained strong control over most of the area, with the remaining Chinese defenders trapped in tunnels under the UN positions. Despite the initial setbacks, Deng Hua, acting commander of the PVA, considered the situation a golden opportunity <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> the US military white. In the strategy meeting held on the evening of October 25, the 15th Corps was ordered to retake the two hills regardless of the cost.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{promotion}} for the event, Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania, where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock —a move that cuts off {{the flow of blood}} to the brain. Belzer, however, fell to the floor unconscious and began <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> profusely. His injury required eight stitches. Belzer later sued Hogan for $5million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event.|$|E
5|$|His next {{opponent}} was unbeaten West Ham-based fighter Kevin Lear on 1 June 2002, {{again in}} Manchester, on the undercard of the Ricky Hatton vs. Eamonn Magee fight. Lear, a former Amateur Boxing Association of England (ABA) champion, kept a one-dimensional Gomez at bay with his sharp jab {{from the outset}} of the fight. Gomez took several punches to the face, and his nose began <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> heavily starting in the sixth round. By the eighth round Gomez was slowing, suffering the effects of Lear's continuing barrage of combinations. At the end of the eighth round Gomez's trainer Brian Hughes retired his fighter, giving Lear a surprise victory.|$|E

The match concluded with Orton performing an RKO for the win. After the match, the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|McGee's first post-TUF {{fight was}} against UFC veteran, Ryan Jensen at UFC 121. Early {{in the first}} round, McGee {{was hit with a}} stiff shot that dropped him and later {{suffered}} a minor cut below his eye. In the second round, Jensen began to visibly tire and after being hit, began <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> from the nose. McGee won the second round after a takedown just before the bell. In the third round, McGee successfully executed a takedown and a full mount, where he secured an arm triangle choke to force the tapout at 1:21 of the final round.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, Striker {{made his}} first post-WWE appearance, by {{appearing}} on Family Wrestling Entertainment iPPV, FWE Rumble in Queens, New York as a color commentator. On October 21, 2013, Striker was defeated by Justin Credible in NYWC's House of Madness. After the match, Striker nailed Credible, causing him <b>to</b> <b>bleed.</b> Backstage, Striker tried to apologize but Credible cursed {{him out in the}} locker room and stormed off. On July 2013, Championship Wrestling from Hollywood (CWFH) announced Striker as the new announcer of the promotion on MAVTV. On November 2, 2013, Striker made his in ring debut for CWFH, unsuccessfully challenging Scorpio Sky for the CWFH Heritage Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually friable, which explains the tendency of these lesions <b>to</b> <b>bleed.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Chuck and Sarah's {{rehearsal}} dinner, Morgan tells Alex that he {{will stop}} going on missions and simply become an analyst. Chuck's sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) is unable {{to make her own}} video montage, having previewed and rejected Lester's deeply disturbed first cut. However, Jeff offers his own flawless cut of the montage, being rewarded with a kiss from Ellie. During the video, Chuck gets a phone call from Vivian, who intends to make him suffer. Vivian activates the Norseman device on a target at the dinner, who Chuck initially fears is his mother. Suddenly, Sarah's nose starts <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> and she collapses in Chuck's arms as he calls out for help.|$|E
5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.|$|E

5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E
5|$|Since the Turtle’s {{emergence}} {{over two}} centuries ago, the international playing field has leveled. The monopoly over submersible technology once {{held by the}} United States was lost over time as other navies around the world modernized and adopted submarine warfare. From the innovations of John Holland {{in the early twentieth}} century to the German U-boat campaigns of the World Wars, and the nuclear-powered ICBM submarines of the Cold War, modern navies embraced the submarine, first, for missions of reconnaissance and commerce-raiding, but, increasingly, in offensive, attack roles. In the postwar era, the submarine has become a central component of modern navies. Submarine usage has gone far beyond Bushnell’s conception of lifting naval blockades designed <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> a country dry of their imports to become an essential arm of offensive naval warfare and power projection.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} AMW, who were {{accompanied}} by Gail Kim, against The Naturals in the sixth bout on the card. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 37 seconds. Douglas' head was busted open during the match, causing him <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> from the forehead throughout. The Naturals got a two-count on Harris after they performed AMW's signature Death Sentence maneuver on him by slamming him back-first into the mat while jumping on his throat. Kim interfered in the bout by distracting The Naturals, which allowed Storm to bash Douglas over the head and then handcuff him to the ring-barrier. AMW followed by performing the Death Sentence on Stevens and pinning him to remain champions.|$|E

5|$|The second-ever Barbed Wire Massacre was {{the sixth}} match {{on the card}} between Abyss and Judas Mesias, who was {{accompanied}} by Father James Mitchell. Its duration was fourteen minutes and fifty-one seconds. It was featured from the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida, because the city of Greenville, SC refused to allow a match that violent to take place live. In Barbed Wire Massacre, the ring ropes are switched with strands of barbed-wire and several weapons are featured wrapped in barbed-wire. The match falls under no disqualifications rules and is won by either a pinfall or submission. Mesias bashed Abyss {{over the head with}} a barbed-wire wrapped chair, which caused Abyss <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> from the forehead. Abyss performed his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver on Mitchell after he interfered in the bout. Abyss won the contest after using the Black Hole Slam to drop Mesias onto a barbed-wire wrapped board.|$|E
5|$|An {{aneurysm}} may {{be detected}} incidentally on brain imaging; this presents a conundrum, as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms {{are associated with}} potential complications. The International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means. Those having previously had a SAH were more likely <b>to</b> <b>bleed</b> from other aneurysms. In contrast, those having never bled and had small aneurysms (smaller than 10mm) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms. On {{the basis of the}} ISUIA and other studies, it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture. At the same time, there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of unruptured aneurysms is actually beneficial.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Kennedy {{joined forces}} with Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in matches against The Brothers of Destruction (Undertaker and Kane) in various combinations. On a November episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy and MVP lost to the Brothers of Destruction three times. After first getting counted out, Theodore Long {{restarted}} the match with no countouts. When they disqualified themselves following a low blow by Kennedy, Long restarted the match again with no countouts and no disqualifications. Kennedy and MVP continued to feud with the brothers, with MVP feuding with Kane while Kennedy challenged the Undertaker to a match at Survivor Series, which was later announced as a First Blood match. Kennedy won the match after MVP turned on him and aimed for {{his head with a}} steel chair, but missed and hit the Undertaker instead, leaving him bleeding. After the match, the Undertaker attacked Kennedy, forcing him <b>to</b> <b>bleed.</b> At Armageddon, Kennedy and the Undertaker met in a final match; they were scheduled in a Last Ride match. In the match, the Undertaker defeated Kennedy.|$|E
