Here he busied himself about some task that should have been attended to a week before, and which even now was not destined to be completed that day, since Willie had no more than set himself to it than his attention was distracted by the sudden appearance of a touring car being brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the gate.|$|E

50|$|For {{the grand}} finale, when both the #1A and #2B ride {{vehicles}} were in use, they both entered a dark theatre where they lined up side-by-side and came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of a large}} movie screen.

5000|$|Capone's lookouts likely mistook one of Moran's men for Moran himself - {{probably}} Albert Weinshank, who was {{the same}} height and build. That morning the physical similarity {{between the two men}} was enhanced by their dress: both happened to be wearing the same color overcoats and hats. Witnesses outside the garage saw a Cadillac sedan pull <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the garage. Four men, two dressed in police uniform, emerged and walked inside. The two fake police officers, carrying shotguns, entered the rear portion of the garage and found members of Moran's gang and two gang collaborators, Reinhart Schwimmer and John May, who was fixing one of the trucks. The [...] "police officers" [...] then ordered the men to line up against the wall.|$|E
50|$|Poe's {{identity}} and true intent is {{revealed to the}} prisoners when Diamond Dog discovers Billy Bedlam's corpse and Poe's possessions. As Grissom wounds Baby-O {{and is about to}} kill Poe, Larkin and Malloy arrives with Bell AH-1 Cobra assault helicopters and fire upon the Jailbird, damaging its engines and draining its fuel tank. After being persuaded by Poe not to fire and Larkin revealing his identity as a parolee, Malloy joins forces. When the two order the plane to land at McCarran International Airport, Swamp Thing is forced to crash-land the plane in the only open paved surface nearby, the Las Vegas Strip. The aircraft causes a great deal of destruction as it skids <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a casino. The ensuing chaos allows Grissom, Diamond Dog, and Swamp Thing to escape on a fire truck while Las Vegas police secure the area and apprehend the other prisoners. Poe and Larkin team up to chase down the trio, eventually killing all three. Poe thanks Larkin and tells him he is now someone whom he can trust, and then goes to reunite with Tricia and his daughter whom he has never met. Garland Greene's fate after the crash is revealed: he is now a free man, gambling and drinking while on a winning streak at a casino, seemingly giving up his life of crime, although it is not known whether the police later apprehend him.|$|E

Shirley is no match for the two men who get out, [...] "completely overpower" [...] her, and [...] "push her into the automobile," [...] That night Beverly is in bed when something comes [...] "hurtling through the window"; the piece of paper tied to a rock declares that Shirley has been kidnapped, and demands [...] "ten thousand dollars from her parents."

[...] "This certainly wasn't a comfortable way to ride." [...] Over bumps and ruts the car travels [...] "for hours," [...] traveling [...] "at least fifty miles from Vernon"; Beverly forces herself to remain [...] "perfectly quiet," [...] lest she be discovered and forced [...] "to walk back to Vernon." [...] An [...] "old house," [...] "three stories" [...] tall with shades [...] "drawn tight to shut out prying eyes," [...] is the destination. Beverly waits for the men to enter, then follows through the back door. Inside she overhears the men gloating over their money and planning to [...] "deliver another note demanding twenty-five thousand." [...] Climbing the stairs, she encounters a locked room on the second floor. [...] "Who is it? What do you want?" [...] Shirley [...] "trembles" [...] as Beverly unlocks the door. The two run descend the stairs, hiding in [...] "the enveloping folds of a tapestry" [...] when one of the kidnappers goes to check on Shirley. From there they dash to the car, driving off and leaving the men [...] "dancing like wild Indians." ...|$|E

This article explores five recent state laws, from Indiana, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, and Missouri requiring citizens to present proof of identity, {{in the form of a}} government issued photo identification card, as a prerequisite to voting in a polling place on Election Day. In Crawford v. Marion County Elec. Bd., the Seventh Circuit upheld an Indiana election law that required virtually all voters to show a government-issued photo identification in order to vote on Election Day. On September 25, 2007, the United States Supreme Court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari in Crawford and will decide the constitutionality of these so-called 2 ̆ 2 voter identification 2 ̆ 2 laws. This article examines these laws under the First and Fourteenth Amendment and concludes that these statutes, although they do not impose a severe burden on the right to vote, should nonetheless be invalidated...|$|E
