This success must be attributed to <b>the</b> <b>interest,</b> <b>support,</b> and competency of the participants. The apparent consistency of water color and turbidity condition over time and between test sites at sites of menhaden capture is significant especially since color is readily measured with satellite and aircraft sensors and a LANDSAT MSS based computer model for inferring tubidity has been developed...|$|E

Without their encouragement and prayer, I {{would not have had}} such a great experience studying here in the department of Second Language Studies (SLS). Also, this study {{would not have been possible}} without <b>the</b> <b>interest,</b> <b>support,</b> and encouragement of many people from the SLS department. Above all, I am especially grateful to my Scholarly Paper readers for their feedback and encouragement towards the completion of this paper as well as the M. A. degree. Dr. John Norris has trusted me and guided me throughout the years of my study as my advisor, and has always provided me with valuable advice. I learned much about Quantitative Research from his SLS 670 class and from his detailed feedback on several versions of this study. Dr. Lourdes Ortega has always encouraged me and gave me confidence with my study along the way. She provided valuable comments and supported me, when the earlier version of this study was presented at the Symposium on Second Language Writing. I gained more interest in Second Language Writing from listening to her talks and from her SLS 614 course. I am indebted to the students who wrote the essays analyzed in this study and th...|$|E

40|$|Being {{asked to}} deliver a plenary talk at a Critical Link conference is a {{singular}} privilege and honor, for which I am very grateful. Of course, I am terribly disappointed not {{to be present in}} person, and to miss out on this tri-annual opportunity to hear the many stimulating presentations and to learn about the latest developments in our field. Much of what I had planned to say probably amounts to preaching to the converted, but every now and then one needs to say the obvious and to restate the things that we know and believe in. I chose to speak about academic activism because of my own frustration over the gap between theory and practice, between research and implementation, between our role as scholars and our interest in seeing results on the ground. Over the past few years I have spent as much time attending meetings, writing letters to politicians and drawing up action plans as I have spent doing research. I felt that for now, the critical link for people in academe is the one that connects us to the movers and shakers, and policy makers. Instead of presenting new research as such, I had hoped, in this talk, to underscore the pressing need for scholars and researchers to engage <b>the</b> <b>interest,</b> <b>support</b> and dedication of those without whom our work cannot bear fruit and our findings cannot be translated into tangible deeds – the politicians, the major foundations, the media and of course, wherever possible, the communities as well. I realize that this double role – academic and activist – is controversial and problematic, but I hope you will agree to consider this (abridged) elaboration of my own point of view...|$|E

I would like to extend special thanks to my advisor and committee members, for their support, insight, and guidance in creating and writing this program evaluation. To my doctoral cohort, I can’t {{think of a better}} small group to spend two and half years with during all our course work. Thank you to all my colleagues and friends that stand with me in advocacy for specialized instruction delivered by well-qualified educators using only the most effective teaching strategies. From eight boys with EBD in the Options Day Treatment Program in 1994 to all the current students in Eastern Carver County School Programs experiencing challenges, this is to your future. Let it be one that will provide you with rich learning environments, dedicated professionals, and equal opportunities that guide you down the road to success. This journey never would have been possible without <b>the</b> <b>interest,</b> <b>support</b> and teaching roots that were inspired by my family. To my immediate family, you have been the foundation that has kept me on course. To my son Max and daughters Ella and Jackie, always reach for your dreams and never quit working hard to achieve them. Thank you for helping me reach mine. To Paul, my husband, thank you for your never-ending encouragement and for believing in me. To my Grandma Maxwell, you taught me the importance of education and you continue to inspire me every day. You are the best life-long teacher. To my parents, Mary and Jim, you taught me the value of education, pursuing dreams and certainly the importance and expectation of hard work.

40|$|My basic {{thesis is}} that, in American {{constitutional}} law, rights typically do not operate, as we often assume, as conceptually independent {{constraints on the}} powers of government. We {{have no way of}} thinking about constitutional rights independent of what powers it would prudent or desirable for government to have. Balancing tests offer an obvious, banal example: <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>supporting</b> claims of right are balanced against interests in upholding governmental power to determine what rights we actually have. But there are other, deeper interconnections as well. Throughout our structure of constitutional discourse, I shall argue, rights are conceptually interconnected with, and occasionally even subordinate to, governmental powers...|$|R

Under the Hasmonean princes, who were at first high priests and then kings, the Jewish state displayed even a certain luster and annexed several territories. Soon, however, discord within the royal family and the growing disaffection of the pious, the soul of the nation, towards rulers who no longer evinced any appreciation of the real aspirations of their subjects made the Jewish nation easy prey for the ambitions of the now increasingly autocratic and imperial Romans, the successors of the Seleucids. In 63 BCE Pompey invaded Jerusalem, the Jewish people lost their political sovereignty and independence, and Gabinius subjected the Jewish people to tribute.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This article explores a {{possible}} discursive history of NHS ‘management’ (with management, {{for reasons that}} will become evident, very much in scare quotes). Such a history is offered as a complement, {{as well as a}} counterpoint, to the more traditional approaches that have already been taken to the history of the issue. Design/methodology/approach: Document analysis and interviews with UK NHS Trust Chief Executives. Findings: After explicating the assumptions of the method it suggests, through a range of empirical sources that the NHS has undergone an era of administration, an era of management and an era of leadership. Research limitations/implications: The paper enables a recasting {{of the history of the}} NHS; in particular, the potential for such a discursive history to highlight <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>supported</b> and denied by different representational practices. Practical implications: Today’s so-called leaders are leaders because of conventional representational practices – not because of some essence about what they really are.
