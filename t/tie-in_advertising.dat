5000|$|This {{practice}} continued, {{albeit in}} a much toned-down manner, through the 1980s in the United States, when the Federal Communications Commission prohibited <b>tie-in</b> <b>advertising</b> on broadcast television.

5000|$|Gargoyles comics were {{published}} in the magazine Disney Adventures, 11 stories in total. A two-part story [...] "Stone Cold" [...] is notable in that it provided a story idea that was later used in the TV series in the episode [...] "The Price". Another story, [...] "The Experts", was intended as <b>tie-in</b> <b>advertising</b> for Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2003, {{they were}} dropped by their record label, 679 Recordings, for [...] "lack of record sales." [...] Ironically, {{it was about}} this time that the band began to break into pop culture. The song [...] "Light and Day / Reach For the Sun" [...] was used in a joint Volkswagen Beetle/iPod <b>tie-in</b> <b>advertising</b> campaign, {{appearing}} on television commercials nationwide in 2004. The same song was used in a tribute to Bill Walsh during an NFL football preseason special, in an episode of the TV series Scrubs, in Murderball, a documentary about the U.S. wheelchair rugby team, and as the end music for the first series of the BBC Radio 7 sci-fi comedy Undone; the song's video was adapted for the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (the DVD features a clip). Also during this time the band was invited to be an opening act for Bowie's Reality Tour and again performed at South by Southwest.|$|E

25|$|In September 2006, Burger King reintroduced {{an updated}} version of its 1970's {{animated}} king design.

50|$|Posters are a {{standard}} feature of classrooms worldwide. A typical school in North America will display a variety, including: <b>advertising</b> <b>tie-ins</b> (e.g. an historical movie {{relevant to a}} current topic of study); alphabet and grammar; numeracy and scientific tables; safety and other instructions; artwork and displays by the students.|$|R
50|$|In June 1999, {{during the}} {{broadcast}} of two children's programs that aired on the station, KWMJ ran {{an advertisement for}} a videotape of the program that was being aired at the time, followed by an commercial for a toy resembling a character from that program. Under the Federal Communications Commission's Children's Television Act, the usage of character <b>tie-ins</b> in <b>advertising</b> during children's programs is treated as a program-length commercial in violation with an advertising clause in the Act. The station originally was to be fined $8,000, but KGEB {{managed to get the}} fine reduced by 20% as remedial action had been taken and there had not been any other problems since then; this was also because the error came from a syndicator that distributed the program and not KGEB.|$|R

2500|$|To {{promote the}} second season, which started on September 25, 2011, the {{producers}} paid the Metropolitan Transportation Authority $150,000 to decorate and operate a New York Transit Museum train of four retired New York City Subway Lo-V cars for each weekend in September 2011. The subway cars used were 5290, 5292 (both built in 1917), 5443, 5483 (both built in 1924). The train operated between noon and 6 p.m. {{and as an}} express between 96th Street and Times Square–42nd Street Subway on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. While the MTA runs [...] "nostalgia trains" [...] each year, {{this was the first}} time they had been used for an <b>advertising</b> <b>tie-in.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Leo Eaton {{was a new}} {{addition}} to Century 21 {{for the production of}} Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. Initially working as an assistant director on various Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episodes as well <b>advertising</b> <b>tie-ins</b> for Gerry Anderson's previous series, Thunderbirds, Eaton had quickly expressed an interest in writing for Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and was granted the opportunity to both write and direct [...] "Place of Angels". Concerning the inspiration behind the script, Eaton explains, [...] "I'd been thinking for some time about writing a sci-fi short story about someone releasing poison into a big-city reservoir." [...] Several scripting changes were made before the voice and film recording. The working title for this episode was [...] "The City of Angels" [...] and in the script the Mysteron threat was to [...] "destroy the population of the City of Angels".|$|R

I get a lot of letters from young housewives who sort of started watching the cartoons with their kids and sort of started getting into the characters, and then somewhere along the line they picked up the comic book and they started following the stories and {{got caught up in the}} continuity.|$|R
