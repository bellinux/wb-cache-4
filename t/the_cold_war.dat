5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> {{continues}} to influence world affairs. The post-Cold War world {{is considered to}} be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. <b>The</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> defined the political role of the United States after World WarII—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which in west Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea). <b>The</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science. These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E

5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> beginning in 1946.

During <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War,</b> although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights of}} Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> {{was a major}} political, {{economic}} and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically {{by the end of}} Reagan's presidency. The significance of Reagan's role in ending <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> has spurred contentious and opinionated debate. That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> {{developed}} and the Guatemalan government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of the Guatemalan Revolution. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> predisposed the Truman administration to see the Guatemalan government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to the Guatemalan government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|By 1986, Angola {{began to}} assume a more central role in <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War,</b> with the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Eastern bloc nations {{enhancing}} support for the MPLA government, and American conservatives beginning to elevate their support for Savimbi's UNITA. Savimbi developed close relations with influential American conservatives, who saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and rollback Soviet-backed, undemocratic governments around the world.
