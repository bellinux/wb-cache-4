5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 2004, Aladdin was re{{released}} onto VHS and for {{the first}} time released onto DVD, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line. The DVD release featured retouched and cleaned-up animation, prepared for Aladdin's planned but ultimately cancelled IMAX reissue in 2003, and a second disc with bonus features. Accompanied by a $19 million marketing campaign, the DVD sold about 3million units in its first month, but it was less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of copies, sold in that amount of time, by any other Platinum Edition released before it. The film's soundtrack was available in its original Dolby 5.1 track or in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The DVD went into moratorium in January 2008, along with its sequels.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 purse {{was set at}} $150,000, {{but fewer}} than 15 mushers {{finished}} the race that year, meaning the money allotted for the final two prizes were distributed {{to each of the}} 13 mushers who finished. The purse peaked at $200,000 in 2007, and winner Lance Mackey took home $40,000. In 2014, the purse was $115,000, but only 11 mushers finished the race, fewer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of paying positions. Rather than distribute the extra money to the finishers, the race chose to roll over the unused prize money into the 2015 race.

5|$|The {{founder effect}} is a special case of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E

The exact identification of several gates is debatable for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence.|$|E

5|$|Estimates of {{accepted}} described {{living species}} of molluscs vary from 50,000 {{to a maximum}} of 120,000species. In 1969 David Nicol estimated the probable total number of living molluscs at 107,000 of which were about 12,000 fresh-water gastropods and 35,000 terrestrial. The Bivalvia would comprise about 14% of the total and the other five classes less than 2% of the living molluscs. In 2009, Chapman estimated the number of described living species at 85,000. Haszprunar in 2001 estimated about 93,000named species, which include 23% of all named marine organisms. Molluscs are second only to arthropods in numbers of living animal species—far behind the arthropods' 1,113,000 but well ahead of chordates' 52,000. About 200,000 living species in total are estimated, and 70,000 fossil species, although the total number of mollusc species ever to have existed, whether or not preserved, must be many times greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> alive today.|$|E

5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or column of the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each column of the matrix.|$|E

A tie for {{second in the}} men's Super G skiing competition meant that a pair of silver medals were given out, so no bronze medal was awarded for that event. In the four-man bobsleigh, a tie for third resulted in the awarding of two bronze medals. Due to these ties, the number of gold medals awarded was one more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of silver or bronze medals.

Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 {{percent of the}} Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-shūgō. However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of true believers. The number of Shinto shrines in Japan {{is estimated to be}} around 100,000. Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. According to Edwin Reischauer and Marius Jansen, some 70–80% of the Japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs. Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas.|$|E

5|$|The 1974 Congressional midterm {{elections}} took place {{less than three}} months after Ford assumed office and {{in the wake of the}} Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats from the Republican Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865–1869). Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan. In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body.|$|E
5|$|The {{controller}} {{is central}} to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number of agents on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of agents on an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or queued for a small number of agents. When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number of agents on the network is lower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of tasks the controller has to complete.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{development}} of Red and Green, all Pokémon {{were designed by}} Ken Sugimori, a long-time friend of Tajiri, {{and a team of}} fewer than ten people, including Atsuko Nishida who is credited as the designer of Pikachu. By 2013 a team of 20artists worked together to create new species designs. A committee of five people determine which designs are incorporated into the games, with Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida finalizing the look of each creature. Furthermore, Sugimori is responsible for the boxart legendary Pokémon and all of the official artwork for the games. According to Yoshida, the number of rejected Pokémon designs is five to ten times more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> that are finalized in each game. In rare cases, rejected designs are brought back and released in a later generation. Shigeru Ohmori, director of Sun and Moon, admitted that creating new Pokémon has become a difficult task with the sheer number of creatures designed over the franchise's 20-year history. Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.|$|E
