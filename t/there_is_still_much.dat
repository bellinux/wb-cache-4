From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> {{debate about}} the origins of lemurs on Madagascar, it is {{generally}} accepted that a single rafting event, similar to the one that brought New World monkeys to South America, occurred around 50–80million years ago and allowed ancestral lemurs to cross the Mozambique Channel and colonize the island, which had already split from Africa (while it was joined to the Indian subcontinent), approximately 160million years ago. The resulting founder effect and either non-existent or inferior competition resulted in speciation as the lemur ancestors radiated out to fill open or insufficiently guarded niches. Today, the endemic primate fauna of Madagascar contains over three-quarters of the extant species of the suborder Strepsirrhini, which had been abundant throughout Laurasia and Africa during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs.|$|E
5|$|The NDL is a {{theoretical}} time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake and release in the body, using a model {{such as the}} Bühlmann decompression algorithm. Although the science of calculating these limits has been refined over the last century, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave the human body. In addition, every individual's body is unique and may absorb and release inert gases at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically have a degree of safety built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.|$|E

5|$|The {{works of}} Mario Vargas Llosa {{are viewed as}} both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> debate over the {{differences}} between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and Conversation in the Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta, and The Storyteller (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution {{as well as the}} workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.|$|E

25|$|The lunar {{geological}} timescale (or selenological timescale) {{divides the}} history of Earth's Moon into five generally recognized periods: the Copernican, Eratosthenian, Imbrian (Late and Early epochs), Nectarian, and Pre-Nectarian. The boundaries of this time scale are related to large impact events that have modified the lunar surface, changes in crater form that occur through time, and the size-frequency distribution of craters superposed on geological units. The absolute ages for these periods have been constrained by radiometric dating of samples obtained from the lunar surface. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> debate concerning the ages of certain key events, because correlating lunar regolith samples with geological units on the Moon is difficult, and most lunar radiometric ages have been highly affected by an intense history of bombardment.|$|E

25|$|The {{relative}} {{youth of}} this field means <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> progress {{to be made}} in characterizing all modifications to the transcriptome and elucidating their mechanisms of action. Once these questions are answered and biologists have a better sense of the amount of variation in RNA modification, the focus will turn to each modification’s biological function. This has already been investigated in a select few proteins such as adenosine deaminase, which acts on RNA (ADAR). ADAR has been shown to affect antibody production and the innate immune system as well as transcripts encoding important receptors for the central nervous system. This plurality in function has caused some scientists to speculate that the epitransciptome may be even more expansive than the better defined epigenome.|$|E
25|$|For over {{a hundred}} years, {{biologists}} have been keeping track of populations of different species with population models. Most models are continuous, but recently scientists {{have been able to}} implement chaotic models in certain populations. For example, a study on models of Canadian lynx showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth. Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as hydrology. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory. Another biological application is found in cardiotocography. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of fetal hypoxia can be obtained through chaotic modeling.|$|E
25|$|B. canadensis {{was first}} {{described}} in 1880 by J.F. Whiteaves, using {{a limited number}} of disfigured samples. The next to propose a reconstruction of the species was W. Patten, who published his findings in 1904 after a discovery of several specimens that were well preserved in 3-D. In 1948, E. Stensio released a detailed depiction of B. canadensis anatomy using an abundance of material, which eventually became the most widely accepted description of this species. Since Stensio’s publication, many others have provided reconstructed models of B. canadensis with modified aspects of the anatomy, including Vezina's modified single dorsal fin and more recently, reconstructions by Arsenault et al from specimens with little taphonomic distortion. Presently, the model of Arsenault et al. is regarded to be the most accurate, while <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> debate about various aspects of this species' external anatomy. Despite the uncertainty, B. canadensis is still classically {{considered one of the most}} well known species.|$|E

25|$|Brazil’s Government {{considers}} that, {{despite many}} studies, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> {{uncertainty about the}} consequences of climate change and its links to worsening critical events. On the other hand, the Technical Summary of the Fourth Assessment Report of the UNFCC, reflecting a consensus view, indicates a potential Amazon forest loss of between 20 and 80% as a result of climate impacts induced by a temperature increase in the basin of between 2.0 and 3.0degrees Celsius. The IPCC is also indicating a likelihood of major biodiversity extinctions as a consequence. Specifically, according to the Earth Simulator, temperature increases and disruption in precipitation cycles (up to a 90% reduction {{by the end of the}} century) could seriously hamper the workings of the Amazon as a forest ecosystem, reducing its capacity to retain carbon, increasing its soil temperature, and eventually forcing the Amazon through a gradual process of savannization. These predictions were reinforced in 2005, when large sections of southwestern Amazonia experienced one of the most intense droughts of the last hundred years. The drought severely affected human population along the main channel of the Amazon River and its western and southwestern tributaries.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Otello premièred in 1887, more than 15 years after Aida, the operas of Verdi's (predeceased) {{contemporary}} Richard Wagner had begun their ascendancy in popular taste, and many sought or identified Wagnerian aspects in Verdi's latest composition.

Nonetheless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>much</b> originality, building on the strengths which Verdi had already demonstrated; the powerful storm which opens the opera in medias res, the recollection of the love duet of Act I in Otello's dying words (more an aspect of tinta than leitmotif), imaginative touches of harmony in Iago's [...] "Era la notte" [...] (Act II).|$|E
