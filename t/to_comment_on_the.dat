5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, have continued <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> theme of race within the game.

Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping {{had never been in}} intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 2007, Kurt Jellinek responded on the Slackers website {{by stating}} that the article was sensationalist and misleading.

Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue and therefore she would stay mum about what led to the need for security.|$|E

5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only once per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or agree to a debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E
5|$|England made 141 and Bradman {{forced them}} to follow on. Miller removed Hutton again, this time caught by Sid Barnes from the first ball of the innings. He {{combined}} with Barnes 45 minutes later to remove Hutton's opening partner Washbrook to leave England at 3/33. The pitch, still rain-affected, hastened England's defeat by an innings and 332 runs within 44 overs. Miller finished with 2/17 from 11 overs in the second innings to end with match figures of 9/77. England had fallen to their heaviest Test defeat on Australian soil, losing 15 wickets {{in the space of}} 210 minutes on the fifth day. Miller's highly productive Ashes debut led to further speculation as to whether he was willing to end his Test career to turn professional in England. Miller continued to ignore Rawtenstall's requests for confirmation and refused <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue to the media, hoping that he would get a better job offer in Australia in the meantime.|$|E

5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Maariv {{newspaper}} {{reported on the}} assassination of al-Wazir.

Up until 1 November 2012, Israel however did not take official responsibility for his killing and government spokesman Moshe Fogel and aides to Barak declined <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue. According to the report, Barak, who was then a deputy military chief, coordinated the planning by the Mossad, {{as well as the}} army's intelligence branch, the air force, navy and the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit. Mossad intelligence agents watched al-Wazir's home for months before the raid. The Washington Post reported on 21 April that the Israeli cabinet approved al-Wazir's assassination on 13 April and that it was coordinated between the Mossad and the IDF.|$|E
