40|$|Although {{ecosystem}} behaviour {{is ultimately}} {{determined by the}} combination of energy flow through the system and material cycling within it, remarkably little effort has been directed towards elucidating the effects of material cycling on ecosystem stability, noteworthy exceptions being the works of Ulanowicz 1, May 2, and Dudzik et al. 3. Ulanowicz 1 and May 2 studied {{a model of a}} linear <b>trophic</b> <b>chain</b> in which both the biomass and energy fluxes between any two levels involved bilinear sums of the biomasses of all the species present and concluded that the system was stable only if the specific energy (that is, energy content per unit biomass) increased on ascending the <b>trophic</b> <b>chain.</b> Although producers are normally found to have a lower specific energy than consumers, there seems to be little or {{no significant difference between the}} specific energy of different consumer levels (see, for example, refs 4 and 5). The implication of the Ulanowicz–May model is thus that the stability of a <b>trophic</b> <b>chain</b> is a fragile property dependent on small differences in specific energy between levels. We believe that this result is due to a neglect of the distinctive nature of the dynamics of the decomposition of biological material to inorganic material, a viewpoint consistent with the results of Dudzik et al. 3 who analysed a number of detailed models of nutrient cycles in both open and closed ecosystems. Here we propose an alternative model of a <b>trophic</b> <b>chain,</b> which suggests that the effect of material cycling is to stabilise the system...|$|E
40|$|Publicación ISIBy {{means of}} {{qualitative}} techniques we analyze {{the consequences of}} inducible defenses of species embedded in <b>trophic</b> <b>chains</b> on the community stability and responses of population equilibrium densities to press perturbations. Our {{results show that the}} inclusion of inducible defenses in <b>trophic</b> <b>chains</b> leads to profound changes in system dynamics. Inducible defenses increase the likelihood of instability, especially when exhibited by species of lower trophic levels. We obtained biologically reasonable feedback conditions that must be satisfied to ensure stability. Species responses to press perturbation are modified by inducible defenses and their associated costs in multiple ways. Many of the direct effects in the community are reinforced, while indirect effects are either weakened, if they propagate in a top-down direction, or are unaffected if they propagate from basal species. The dominant view of inducible defenses as a stabilizing force seems to be valid only within a biologically constrained parameter space. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the mercury and methylmercury transfers to {{and within the}} macroinvertebrate communities of a floodplain lake of the Beni River basin, Bolivia, during three hydrological seasons and in two habitats (open water and vegetation belt). Using the stable isotopes delta C- 13 and delta N- 15, six <b>trophic</b> <b>chains</b> were identified during a previous study. Four are based on only one source: seston, organic matter from the bottom sediment, periphyton and macrophytes. Two are based on mixed sources (seston and periphyton in one case, periphyton and macrophytes in the other). During sampling, we found only one taxon that had surface sediment organic matter as food source and very few taxa whose trophic source was constituted by macrophytes. The periphyton {{was the most important}} source during all seasons; it produced the longest <b>chain,</b> with three <b>trophic</b> positions. Whatever the season and trophic source, all collected macroinvertebrates contained methyl mercury and the latter was biomagnified in all <b>trophic</b> <b>chains</b> that we identified. The biomagnification of methylmercury through invertebrate <b>trophic</b> <b>chains</b> accurately reflected the existence and length of these chains. Biomagnification was virtually non-existent in the sediment-based chain, low and restricted to the dry season in the macrophyte-based chain. It was significant in the seston-based chain, but limited by the existence of only two trophic levels and restricted to the wet season. Finally, it was very effective in the periphyton-based chain, which offers the highest rate of contamination of the source but, above all, the largest number of trophic levels...|$|R

The concepts and methodology of mathematical systems theory provide useful tools to face this problem. In many cases, state monitoring of a complex ecological system consists in observation (measurement) of certain state variables, and the whole state process has to be determined from the observed data. The solution proposed in the paper is the design of an observer system, which makes it possible to approximately recover the state process from its partial observation. The method is illustrated with a <b>trophic</b> <b>chain</b> of resource – producer – primary consumer type and a numerical example is also presented.

In the paper a <b>trophic</b> <b>chain</b> is considered, and control systems are obtained by changing certain model parameters into control variables. For the equilibrium control two approaches are proposed. First, for a fixed time interval, local controllability into equilibrium is proved, and applying tools of optimal control, it is also shown how an appropriate open-loop control can be determined that actually controls the system into the equilibrium in given time.

A high inter-specific variability, survival ability and harsh conditions resistance built a clear path for these animals to the top of <b>trophic</b> <b>chains,</b> with a corresponding raising impact on sea-related anthropogenic activities. Indeed, cnidarians possess efficient stinging characteristics and represent a threat to bathers and fishermen. Pelagia noctiluca (Forsskål, 1775), the “Mauve Stinger”, is a common Mediterranean scyphozoan jellyfish. It occurs mainly from March to May, but also throughout the year in South Tyrrhenian waters around Northeastern Sicily. The venomousness of this jellyfish is due to three main different kinds of nematocysts, which are known to contain toxins which at present are not exhaustively known. In this study, a first evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of heterotrichous microbasic eurytele nematocysts from Pelagia noctiluca is presented and discussed. Nematocysts were isolated from tentacles of Pelagia noctiluca and the content was extracted by sonication (aqueous extract). Cytotoxicity assays employing MTT assay and Trypan Blue dye exclusion were carried out on L 929 mouse lung fibroblasts. Aqueous extracts induced cytotoxicity to L 929 cells with 36. 9 % cell survival after 24 hours treatment with aqueous extract of 150 × 103 P. noctiluca nematocysts/ml, and 68. 9 % cell survival after treatment with extract of 75 × 103 nematocysts/ml.

This highest phytoplankton diversity of the Palaeozoic was possibly the result of palaeogeography (greatest continental dispersal) and major orogenic and volcanic activity, which provided maximum ecospace and large amounts of nutrients. With its warm climate and high atmospheric CO(2) levels, the Ordovician was similar to the Cretaceous: a period when phytoplankton diversity was at its maximum during the Mesozoic.
