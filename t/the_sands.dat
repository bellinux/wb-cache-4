5|$|Prince of Persia: <b>The</b> <b>Sands</b> of Time is a third-person action-adventure puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ubisoft. First revealed in March 2003, it was released across Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox and Microsoft Windows in November 2003. <b>The</b> <b>Sands</b> of Time is a reboot of the Prince of Persia series, created by Jordan Mechner. Mechner served as creative consultant, designer, and scenario writer for <b>The</b> <b>Sands</b> of Time.|$|E
5|$|The game follows {{an unnamed}} Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's {{city at the}} {{instigation}} of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures an hourglass containing <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> of Time. Visiting Azad to present <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> {{as a gift to}} the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing <b>the</b> <b>Sands,</b> transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> to the hourglass. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by <b>the</b> <b>Sands.</b> A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger to rewind time if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies.|$|E

50|$|For {{the scene}} in which the {{character}} is buried in <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> Browne's body {{was placed in a}} wooden box under <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> to prevent him from being physically buried and the top of the box was covered with sand, leaving his head above <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> and creating <b>the</b> illusion he's been physically buried. In the later scene when he gets out of <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> Browne was buried in <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> horizontally.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this study, for the {{numerical}} simulation of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> ripple’s forming process which caused by <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> flow, <b>the</b> simulation models {{based on the}} fluid dynamics and <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> flow field by the wind are analyzed. Due to sand field’s characteristics is very complex, the establishing process of stream flow field constitutive equations analyzed at first, and then the implication relations and independency between stream flow field and <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> flow field analyzed. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> ripple forming and moving process simulated in uniform and non-uniform stream flow field...|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>sand</b> flux {{is defined}} as <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> {{discharge}} per width (note that this differs from the general definition of flux {{in terms of the}} unit cross section). <b>The</b> <b>sand</b> discharge does not distinguish between that due to flow motions and that due to avalanching, and therefore, <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> flux includes both bedload transport and avalanching. If <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> discharge is quantified by bulk volume (including both sand and intergrain voids) per unit time, <b>the</b> dimensions of <b>sand</b> flux are <b>the</b> square of length over time (L 2 /T), because the volume per width is measured in units of L 2.|$|R
5|$|Salim {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by TJ Ramini. After Drake defeats the henchmen {{in the desert}} ghost town, Salim comes to him on horseback and helps him escape. After Drake was rescued, Salim tells him that the Atlantis of <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> is a {{dangerous}} place and that Marlowe cannot be allowed to enter because of the evil within. Drake believes that she could use these powers to control others through fear, realising it was not treasure they were after. When Sully is rescued, Salim brings both {{of them to the}} open desert where the Atlantis of <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> is located. Salim heads off and gets separated from Drake and Sully because of the heavy sandstorm. After Talbot is defeated and the Atlantis of <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> collapse, Salim appears in time to save them.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set in Persia during the 9th century AD, and begins with the Prince narrating to an unseen {{listener}} about his adventures. The Prince and the army of his father Shahraman are passing through India to visit the Sultan of Azad. The Vizier of a local Maharaja, wanting to prevent his death using a substance known as <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> of Time, entices them into attacking the Maharaja's palace, where <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> are stored. During the fight, the Prince loots an artefact called the Dagger of Time, and the Maharaja's daughter Farah is taken {{as a gift for}} the Sultan of Azad. Visiting Azad, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing <b>the</b> <b>Sands,</b> turning everyone but the Prince, the Vizier and Farah (protected by the Dagger, a staff and an amulet respectively) into sand creatures. The Vizier attempts to seize the Dagger from the Prince, but he escapes and eventually allies with Farah to undo the damage he has caused and prevent <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> from covering the world, even though he has doubts about her loyalties and motives.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{were first}} camouflaged during World War I; {{aircraft}} camouflage {{has been widely}} employed since then. In World War II, disruptive camouflage became widespread for fighters and bombers, sometimes combined with countershading. Some air forces such as the German Luftwaffe varied their paint schemes to suit differing flight conditions such as the skyglow over German cities, or <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> of the Mediterranean front.|$|E
50|$|Molds made of sand are {{relatively}} cheap, and sufficiently refractory even for steel foundry use. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> a suitable bonding agent (usually clay) is mixed or occurs with <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b> <b>The</b> mixture is moistened, typically with water, but sometimes with other substances, {{to develop the}} strength and plasticity of the clay {{and to make the}} aggregate suitable for molding. <b>The</b> <b>sand</b> is typically contained in a system of frames or mold boxes known as a flask. The mold cavities and gate system are created by compacting <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> around models, or patterns, or carved directly into <b>the</b> <b>sand.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{procedures are}} as follows: (1) Brine {{was placed in}} the injection fluid container and injected into <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack by a syringe pump. The injection rate was adjusted by the controller provided with the pump. Brine was injected at constant pressure mode (varying from 20 to 100  psi pressure drop) and 2 – 3 pore volumes were passed through <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack. It was assumed that <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack was totally saturated with brine. The effluent brine sample was collected in a measuring cylinder with time and the absolute permeability of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack calculated using the Darcy equation. <b>The</b> <b>sand</b> pack was saturated by injecting 2 – 3 pore volumes of brine through it. (2) After brine injection, the oil (crude oil having 14.27  cP viscosity at 303  K) was injected into <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack to calculate the relative oil permeability (k o) of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack at <b>the</b> saturation of connate water and again brine was injected into <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack to calculate the relative water permeability (k w) of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack at <b>the</b> saturation of residual oil before gel injection. (3) The prepared gelant solution was injected into <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack under <b>the</b> same conditions and 2 – 3 pore volumes of gelant were collected. (4) When <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack was saturated with the gelant and the effluent samples of gelant collected in a small glass bottle, <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack and <b>the</b> effluent gelant were kept in the hot air oven for a period to insure the gel formation. Considering the time required to form the gel in the bottle test, <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack was kept in the hot air oven for three times this gelation time. (5) Then brine and oil was again injected through <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack at constant pressure mode (varying from 620 to 1500  psi pressure drop) to find out the relative water permeability and the relative oil permeability after gel injection. It is noted that the experimental fluid (brine or oil) was injected into <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack at different flow rates and different pressures. The outlet of the core holder containing <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack was kept at atmospheric pressure, and the pressure gradient inside <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack is <b>the</b> difference of the injection pressure of the fluid and atmospheric pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Biblical link to John 8:6. Some have (perhaps erroneously) {{interpreted}} Jesus' {{writing in}} <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> as drawing {{a line in}} <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> {{in order to address}} those who are about to stone a woman caught in adultery. However, the literal translation is not that he drew a line in <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> but that he [...] "wrote" [...] (or [...] "drew lines" [...] in some translations) in <b>the</b> <b>sand,</b> an important distinction.|$|R

5|$|The canal {{served the}} mines well for almost 30 years, but {{the dock and}} river were {{affected}} by silting. A new channel across <b>the</b> <b>sands</b> was created in 1797, but this too was affected by silting, and by 1809 navigation to Kymer's dock was becoming dangerous.|$|E
30|$|According to the {{constitutive}} equation of sand mould shear zone (Eq. (23)), for <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> mould with uniform grain size, {{there are two}} aspects {{of the influence of}} particle size on cutting force. One is the static strength of <b>sand</b> mould, <b>the</b> other are the linear and quadric terms of shear rate which are the momentum and kinetic energy of <b>the</b> moving <b>sand</b> respectively. In general, the static strength of sand mould increases with the increase of <b>the</b> diameter of <b>sand,</b> and <b>the</b> momentum and kinetic energy of <b>the</b> single <b>sand</b> also increase with <b>the</b> diameter of <b>sand</b> particles. So <b>the</b> cutting force of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> mould increases with the diameter increasing. However, <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> granularity in <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> mould is of 70 / 140, which means that <b>the</b> size of <b>sand</b> distributes randomly within a certain range. Therefore, the distributions of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> particles and strength are non-uniform. In <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> mould cutting process, when cutting <b>the</b> large <b>sand</b> particle or <b>the</b> region with higher strength, the cutting forces will increase. Otherwise, cutting forces will decrease. In the {{constitutive equation}}s of prediction model (Eq. (23)), the compression strength σs is calculated as the macroscopical experimental results of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> mould, and <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> particle diameter is calculated as an average diameter. That means the predictive model does not consider the effect of non-homogeneity, so the fluctuation of predicted cutting force is lower than the measured results.|$|R

5|$|According to a People {{magazine}} {{profile of}} McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from {{the owners of}} 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. <b>The</b> <b>Sands</b> Directory indicates that she moved her operation briefly to No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that she closed the school when the airlines established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College. She continued to help the occasional pupil with special difficulties at her home.|$|E
5|$|After leasing it to Warner {{for four}} years, Sinatra sought {{to sell the}} {{property}} to Howard Hughes in 1967 {{as part of the}} renewal of his contract at <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> Hotel and Casino. Following a fallout between Hughes and Sinatra, the entertainer instead signed a contract with Caesars Palace. This included a requirement for Sinatra's stake in Cal Neva to be purchased by his new employer for $2 million, but instead the lodge passed {{into the hands of the}} same owners as Reno's Club Cal-Neva in 1968 for $1.4 million.|$|E
30|$|The data of ΔP 2 were {{collected}} after a constant {{flow of water}} was obtained at the outlet of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack (approximately 0.5 PV water injected). Table  5 and Fig.  6 show that the permeability of <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack reduced by 94.5  % at 80  °C after treatment with the PAM-methenamine-resorcinol gel solution. This indicates that the PAM-methenamine-resorcinol gel solution, a CO 2 -sensitive gel, can effectively block the CO 2 channels in <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack. With more formation water injected into <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack, <b>the</b> <b>sand</b> pack permeability changed slightly and the final permeability reduction remained at 93.8  %.|$|R

5|$|During exploration, the Prince navigates areas {{filled with}} traps: these traps include spike pits, arrow traps, {{wall-mounted}} blades and saws, and spinning spiked stakes. The Prince's main contextual move is wall-running, an action where he runs up onto and along a wall {{for a set}} distance, either to land on or jump off to a platform. The Prince's other acrobatic abilities include climbing along and across ledges, walking along beams, swinging on and jumping from poles, jumping onto and between pillars, and swinging on ropes. Large environmental puzzles are encountered during the Prince's journey, extending across multiple areas in large rooms. Many puzzles are cooperative, requiring Farah's help to complete them. In combat, the Prince fights monsters created by <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> infecting the Palace's inhabitants. A single command contextually triggered different moves depending on position and directional movement, while other special moves such as a somersault attack and bouncing off walls into enemies require additional commands. Enemies can only be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger of Time, which gathers up <b>the</b> <b>Sands</b> inside them.|$|E
