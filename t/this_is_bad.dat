Examples include plates [...] and [...] (With or without reason and The same), [...] and [...] (The women are courageous and And they are fierce), and , [...] and [...] (They do not want to, Nor these and Or these). Other plates show scenes from the same story or incident, as in plates [...] and [...] (<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> and This is how it happened), in which a monk is murdered by French soldiers looting church treasures; a rare sympathetic image of the clergy, who are generally shown to be on the side of oppression and injustice.|$|E
2500|$|The USA PATRIOT Act's {{expansion}} of court jurisdiction {{to allow the}} nationwide service of search warrants proved controversial for the EFF. They believe that agencies {{will be able to}} [...] "'shop' for judges that have demonstrated a strong bias toward law enforcement with regard to search warrants, using only those judges least likely to say no—even if the warrant doesn't satisfy the strict requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution", and that it reduces the likelihood that smaller ISPs or phone companies will try to protect the privacy of their clients by challenging the warrant in court—their reasoning is that [...] "a small San Francisco ISP served with such a warrant is unlikely to have the resources to appear before the New York court that issued it." [...] They believe that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> because only the communications provider will be able to challenge the warrant as only they will know about it—many warrants are issued ex parte, which means that the target of the order is not present when the order is issued.|$|E

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> {{news for}} the Woggle-Bug; {{but he did not}} despair.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> news. But I was, as usual, too obstinate to own myself defeated.|$|R
5000|$|Nine out of {{ten people}} in the United States claim <b>this</b> bill <b>is</b> a <b>bad</b> idea; therefore, <b>this</b> bill <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> for the people.|$|R
6000|$|... "All <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad,</b> Ned," [...] Mr. Porson said gravely; [...] "but {{of course}} much {{depends upon the}} amount of his ill treatment. I assume {{that he does not}} {{actively}} ill treat your mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|JAMES. [Gravely] Let's {{look at that}} ninety cheque. [He sorts the cheque {{out from}} the bundle {{in the pocket of}} the pass-book] Seems all right. There's no nine here. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad.</b> Who cashed that nine-pound cheque? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be a fool." [...] Mercedes was beckoning to Mrs. Olsen {{across the}} street. [...] "You {{go into the}} house, little mother that is to be. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> for you. We'll carry him in. Mrs. Olsen is coming, and we'll get Maggie Donahue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was sent}} with some {{important}} papers, which I lost. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> enough, {{but there was}} some ground for suspecting that I had stolen them." ...|$|R
60|$|Trent's {{face grew}} serious. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> news for him, {{and he was}} thankful {{that they had not}} carried out their first plan and {{commenced}} their prospecting at Bekwando village.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I say, Jem,' said Louis, quietly, 'all <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> {{enough on}} neutral ground; it is mere treason under my father's own roof, and I {{will have no}} more of it.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> news; and yet sinners must hear it. They must hear it {{not only}} put into words by Moses, or by St. Paul, or by any other {{inspired}} writer; but they must hear it, likewise, in that perpetual voice of God which we call facts.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote B: Now, it just {{occurs to}} us {{that some of our}} temperance friends will take issue with us, and say that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> doctrine, and that it is ungentlemanly to get drunk under any {{circumstances}} or under any possible conditions. We do not think so.--The same.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "George, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad.</b> I {{must tell}} you, you know, as a friend, you'd {{better not be}} meddling with such notions; they are bad, George, very bad, for boys in your condition,--very;" [...] and Mr. Wilson sat down to a table, and began nervously chewing the handle of his umbrella.|$|E
50|$|Due to peat {{harvesting}} {{and drainage}} the remaining swamp became a lot drier. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> {{for the military}} function of the eastern branch.Therefore, dikes were built near Bourtange to keep water there.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{stations}} in <b>this</b> category <b>are</b> <b>Bad</b> Wimpfen, Loxstedt, and Hagen-Vorhalle.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} <b>bad</b> style, although sometimes used.|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> as fancy for {{precisely}} {{the same reason that}} it would be good as a pun. The comparison is unintentionally wanting in logic, just as a pun is intentionally so. To make the contrast what it should have been,--to make it coherent, if I may use that term of a contrast,--it should read: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely," [...] he said, [...] "you do {{not mean}} us to {{understand}} {{that you have been}} brawling with Comrade Stone! <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> hearing. I thought that you and he were like brothers. Such a bad example for Comrade Robinson, too. Leave us, Adair. We would brood. Oh, go thee, knave, I'll none of thee. Shakespeare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we've no weapon {{bigger than}} an Eskimo knife," [...] exclaimed the sailor, {{with a frown}} of discontent--"not even a bit of stick to tie the knife to. What a chance lost! He would have kept us in food for some weeks. Well, well, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> luck. Come, Ippe, we'll {{go back to the}} cave, and consult about this." ...|$|E
6000|$|Decidedly <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> form, and Mr Evans, pursing up {{his lips}} and raising his eyebrows, was silent. 'That's the worst of these half-educated people,' he said to himself; 'they get some idea in their heads which they don't understand, and, of course, they do idiotic things....' ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. <b>This</b> {{beginning}} <b>was</b> <b>bad,</b> and yet I fear it was but {{the beginning}} of bad.|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. <b>This</b> {{beginning}} <b>was</b> <b>bad,</b> {{but what}} shall I say? It was like Mr. Badman himself. Poor woman! <b>this</b> <b>was</b> but a <b>bad</b> beginning for her; I fear it {{filled her with}} trouble enough, as I think such a beginning would have done one perhaps much stronger than she.|$|R
6000|$|Nor {{was this}} {{military}} criticism entirely a private one. When the courier arrived at headquarters the next morning, {{it was to}} bring the report that Mistress Thankful Blossom, after assisting her lover to escape had fled with him. [...] "The renegade is well off our hands," [...] said Gen. Sullivan gruffly: [...] "he has saved us the public disgrace of a trial. But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> news of Major Van Zandt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Upon my word, my good friend,' murmured the doctor, {{in a tone}} of stately reproof, as {{he stepped}} up to the old man's side, 'this is worse than weakness. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad,</b> selfish, very wrong, Mr Chuffey. You should take example from others, my good sir. You forget that you were not {{connected}} by ties of blood with our deceased friend; and that he had a very near and very dear relation, Mr Chuffey.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my men, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> work you're doing here," [...] said he, {{walking into}} the drawing-room. Whereupon the cook curtsied low, and the bailiffs, knowing his lordship, stopped from their {{business}} and put their hands to their foreheads. [...] "You must stop this, if you please,--at once. Come, let's {{go out into the}} kitchen, or some place outside. I don't like to see you here with your big boots and the pen and ink among the furniture." ...|$|E
2500|$|The huge score led Steve Waugh to {{say that}} 500 in an innings is the next possibility. Others have said that scores like <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>bad</b> for the sport, with Barry Richards saying, [...] "There is such a {{propensity}} for hitting boundaries that bowlers have {{been taken out of}} game".|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> enough, but all {{the time}} Peter {{was filled with a}} dreadful fear that Hooty the Owl or Granny Fox might just happen along. He had to stop to rest very, very often, and then he would listen and listen. Over and over again he said to himself: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad,</b> and shocking, {{and had a}} sort of unhuman sound; {{but when}} you once hear the war-whoop, you will never mistake it for {{anything}} else!

6000|$|... "'All <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad.</b> I see that, if {{we enter}} Egypt, {{we shall be}} like a flight of locusts. We shall eat up the country and leave a desert behind us. Surely this cannot be {{according}} to the wishes of Allah, who is all merciful. You have taught me much in your talks with me, and I do not see things as I used to. So much do I feel it, that in my heart I could almost wish that your countrymen should come here, and establish peace and order.|$|E
6000|$|You may say <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> news. I do {{not believe}} it is. I believe it is good news, and the very best of news: but if it is bad news, I cannot help it. I did not make it so. God made it so. And God must know best. [...] God is love. And we are His children, and He loves us. And {{therefore}} His ways with us must be good and loving ways, and any news about them must be good news, and a gospel, though we cannot see it so at first.|$|E
6000|$|It is eleven, I think, for a clock struck. O Lord, {{there has}} been a deal of time through our hands since I went down to supper! All this has come from my own folly; I somehow could not think the gulf so impassable, and I read him some notes on the Duke of Argyll[8]--I thought he would agree so far, and that we might have some {{rational}} discussion on the rest. And now--after some hours--he has told me that he is a weak man, and that I am driving him too far, and that I know not what I am doing. O dear God, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> work! ...|$|E
60|$|And as if <b>this</b> <b>were</b> not <b>bad</b> enough, Tuppy had {{to shove}} his oar in.|$|R
50|$|The post-democracy era meant a boom for {{the wine}} {{industry}} in South Africa. Estates were enlarged, and production was going up. But <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>bad</b> for the biodiversity of the area, and at Neetlingshof a biodiversity and conservation programme {{was developed by}} master viticulturist, Prof. Eben Archer, who was commissioned to re-plan and replant {{nearly all of the}} vineyards on the Neetlingshof estate.|$|R
