25|$|Sraffa {{suggested}} an aggregation technique (stemming {{in part from}} Marxian economics) by which {{a measure of the}} amount of capital could be produced: by reducing all machines to a sum of dated labor from different years. A machine produced in the year 2000 can then be treated as the labor and commodity inputs used to produce it in 1999 (multiplied by the rate of profit); and the commodity inputs in 1999 can be further reduced to the labor inputs that made them in 1998 plus the commodity inputs (multiplied by the rate of profit again); and so on until the non-labor component was reduced to a negligible (but non-zero) amount. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> add up the dated labor value of a truck to the dated labor value of a laser.|$|E

If you lock them together {{in a room with}} no food for a week, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see what it is, friends!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett {{has spoken}} about {{feminism}} and politics, telling Sky News in 2013 {{that she was}} concerned that [...] "a wave of conservatism sweeping the globe" [...] was threatening women's role in society. She has also commented on the pressures women in Hollywood face now: [...] "Honestly, I think about my appearance less than I did ten years ago. People talk about {{the golden age of}} Hollywood because of how women were lit <b>then.</b> <b>You</b> <b>could</b> be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, because you were lit and made into a goddess. Now, with everything being sort of gritty, women have this sense of their use-by date." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Gereth looked {{dark and}} void. [...] "Yes, but I hadn't heard from <b>you</b> <b>then</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> invent nothing better than, {{as you call}} it, to send him back to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Mrs. Hall {{said just}} about the same to me, Billy. Carmel wouldn't be so bad to pass the rainy season in. And <b>then,</b> too, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> go {{swimming}} with Mr. Hazard." ...|$|R
2500|$|However, in 1981, Faulkner {{discovered}} {{a book about}} neuro-linguistic programming called The Structure of Magic I: A Book About Language and Therapy by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. The book's methodology described ways of affecting immediate and positive life changes by reprogramming speech, movement and thought patterns. That moment was a major turning point for Faulkner, as he understood that [...] "if you {{could get to the}} root of the crucial relationship between language and beliefs, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> change everything." [...] Upon the realization that Bandler and Grinder were developing innovations in areas where Northwestern University had not yet [...] "cracked the code," [...] Faulkner decided to forgo the pursuit of his degree and, instead, dive headfirst into NLP training. By 1987, he was a certified NLP trainer. Today, Faulkner describes Grinder and Bandler as having been at least 10 years ahead of their time.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, Ahern said he {{believed}} {{that he would have}} [...] "done all right" [...] in the presidential election but for the decline in the popularity of Fianna Fáil. Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election. [...] "I still would have done all right. I mean they have done some figures and I would probably sit in around 30 per cent, which you haven’t a hope with as the party is on 20 per cent." [...] He added that [...] "the party popularity is the thing that snookers it, because if your party isn’t winnable..." [...] Mr Ahern said: [...] "If there was no downturn and if it wasn’t all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have had a good run at it." [...] He predicted that [...] "nobody is going to win it outright – like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: [...] "Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that’s 14 years, so that ends any chance that I’ll have." [...] He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. [...] "The only thing that is important to me is the central allegations. And what the tribunal says about the other trash is irrelevant." [...] Michael Martin said the former taoiseach was [...] "out of touch with reality" [...] if {{he believed}} he could have won the presidency for Fianna Fáil. Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that.|$|E

6000|$|Now and <b>then,</b> too, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{have heard}} them singing on the steamer,--the {{voices of the}} girls and the men blended into unison by the distance, rising and falling in long-drawn melody: [...] "O--Can-a-da--O--Can-a-da." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I hope I am. I {{believe you}} {{would soon be}} {{intimate}} with them; but <b>then</b> <b>you</b> always <b>could</b> get on {{with all sorts of}} people, and I have a shrinking from getting under the surface--if I could.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Or at my {{saying that}} I really believe I felt, even <b>then,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be {{faithfully}} affectionate against all discouragement, and never {{cease to be}} so, until you ceased to live?---Will you laugh at such a dream?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I knew I {{would show}} you soon enough, Mr. Meyer, for <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take the stuff and our {{partnership}} {{would be at}} an end." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>could</b> {{hear the}} Germans talking and singing among {{themselves}} {{as though there}} was no war on at all.

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] she said, [...] "I won't {{play any}} more, but I don't {{want to go}} home yet. It is early, and I can never sleep here if I go to bed. Sit with me for half-an-hour, and <b>then</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>could</b> give me some supper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He leant {{forward on}} his desk and opened an {{argumentative}} palm. [...] "You know, Remington," [...] he said, [...] "and I know, that if this could be fended off for six months--if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> be clapped in prison, or got out of the way somehow,--until this marriage was all over and settled down for a year, say--you know <b>then</b> <b>you</b> two <b>could</b> meet, curious, happy, as friends.

6000|$|... 'Just so. And {{therefore}} you can dispose of nothing else. Your son, of course, could join you, and <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> sell either one estate or the other.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, baas," [...] said poor Hans, [...] "this {{is worse}} than {{shooting}} at the geese in the Groote Kloof. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only lose your horse, but now--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear me! Won't {{the truth}} do, <b>then?</b> I hoped <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{have told them}} {{something}} consoling. I am thinking of the poor mother now. Your Russia is a cruel country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> know I <b>could</b> have mamma go, but {{it would}} bore her; or I could have a maid go, but that would bore me; and so I've decided to have you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bother it! I {{never thought}} of that. Well, I might do the securing, one fellow first, and <b>then</b> the other. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> get close to him, and if he moves, catch up his kris and cut him down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Louis," [...] I answered, [...] "unless I were {{convinced}} that Miss Delora herself was implicated in these things. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> all go to the devil for anything I cared!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Winston, [...] "it {{would please}} {{me if you}} did, as well as cool your feet. <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> climb up, and hold that twine down on the other side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Peter," [...] asked Honora, [...] "can't you get Judge Brice to {{send you}} on to New York this winter on law business? <b>Then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> come up to Sutcliffe to see me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think she}} can, Peter; at any rate, {{it is certain}} she can't find us, {{it would take a}} long time to bring her round, and <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> see, she <b>could</b> not sail {{straight}} back against the wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was very}} {{glad to see you}} as bad as myself, sir," [...] said Mrs. Frederick Langford. [...] "I was very much ashamed of being so foolish, but <b>then,</b> <b>you</b> know, I <b>could</b> hardly ever read through that scene without crying." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes--my whole idea. The way I've been justified. That's the joy I give her. If for HER, either, it had failed--!" [...] That, however, was {{not worth}} talking about; he had broken off. [...] "You think <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> now risk Fawns?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The verses ARE pretty," [...] he said, {{recovering}} himself, with {{a critical}} air, [...] "and I am glad you like them.
