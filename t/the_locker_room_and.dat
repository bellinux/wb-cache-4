5|$|After scoring touchdowns, Payton {{declined}} to celebrate; instead, he would often hand {{the ball to}} his teammates or the official. He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations; he preferred post-game antics such as rushing into <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> locking his teammates {{out in the cold}} while taking a long shower. Although Payton would have won the respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone, he retired as the career leader in receptions for a running back with 492 for over 4,500 yards, and still holds the career record for a running back with 8 touchdown passes.|$|E
5|$|However, the discontent within <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> the team's overall struggles culminated with Holmes criticizing {{and arguing}} with {{teammates}} in the huddle against Miami. Holmes was benched {{in the fourth}} quarter while the Jets subsequently lost 19–17, ending their postseason pursuit. After the Jets finished the season with a disappointing 8–8 record, Ryan admitted to having lost the pulse of the team. Then free agent running back LaDainian Tomlinson remarked that Ryan's Super Bowl predictions had an adverse effect on the locker room by placing undue pressure on the players. Ryan conceded this point and announced that he would refrain from making such statements publicly in the future.|$|E

5|$|After {{failing to}} qualify {{on the final}} day of the 2009 campaign, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said {{anything}} short of a playoff spot in 2010 would be unacceptable. With that directive, former director of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the U.S. Hall of Famer's plan to play a tough, defensive style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC played well at the start, going undefeated in seven games at one time. The team struggled following the World Cup break. Sensing problems in <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> to try to salvage the season, MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach. The players responded to Dasovic's more open flexible style, but it wasn't enough as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings.|$|E

500|$|Later, Youkilis {{was swept}} up in the team's ritual annual hazing, in which he and other rookies were made to wear skimpy Hooters {{waitress}} outfits, orange satin shorts and tight, clingy white tank tops, for the team trip from Canada through US Customs in Florida. [...] "I walked into <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> all my clothes were gone", Youkilis said. [...] "There was just a Hooters outfit and shoes." [...] Youkilis was named the American League (AL) Rookie of the Month for May, after leading AL rookies with nine walks and a [...]446 OBP as he batted [...]318 with 7 RBIs, and 15 runs in 13 games. Noting ways that his life had suddenly changed, he said: [...] "I'm staying in the best hotel I've ever stayed in, and my paycheck has quadrupled." [...] In mid-July he was sent back down to AAA, however, to make room for Ramiro Mendoza, though he was brought up again {{towards the end of the}} season.|$|E
500|$|Most of the glee {{club has}} learned that Puck (Mark Salling), not Finn (Cory Monteith), {{is the father of}} Quinn's baby. They hide this fact from Rachel (Lea Michele), believing that she will tell Finn. Emma takes over as faculty advisor of the club as they start working on their set list for sectionals. With two group songs selected, Rachel says that she'll sing the solo ballad; Mercedes (Amber Riley) strenuously objects to this, and sings [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] to wild applause. Rachel agrees that Mercedes deserves to sing the solo and the two hug. Meanwhile, Rachel has deduced that Puck {{impregnated}} Quinn and tells Finn; he attacks Puck and confronts Quinn, who tearfully admits the truth. Angered by their betrayal, Finn quits the club on the eve of sectionals, and has to be replaced by school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman). New Directions arrive at the event to discover their competitors have received an advance copy of their set list, and are performing all three of their chosen songs. Emma calls Will, who convinces Finn to help his New Directions teammates. Will finds Finn in <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> talks to him about how special he is and that the club needs him.|$|E

500|$|Before Kentucky's February 13 {{game against}} Tennessee, Woods was hospitalized with an [...] "acute viral illness". Farmer started in his place, {{tallying}} 14 points and 7 rebounds in an 8574 win. Although Farmer also started {{the next game}} against Ole Miss, just 48 seconds into the game his knee made contact with an opponent's knee, sending him to <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> Woods into the game. Farmer returned to score a team-high 21 points, but also suffered a scratched eye, in a win that gave Kentucky {{the best record in}} the SEC; Woods logged 9 points and 7 assists in almost 24 minutes of action off the bench. Woods returned to the starting lineup in Kentucky's next game at Vanderbilt, but Farmer remained a starter as well, replacing Jeff Brassow at shooting guard. He scored 13 of his team-high 19 in the first half, but Kentucky lost the game 9887. Pitino characterized Farmer as [...] "exhausted" [...] in the second half, playing heavy minutes in relief of Woods, who managed only 15 minutes before fouling out. Two games later, Farmer hit four of his first five shots [...] including three 3-pointers [...] and finished with a team-high 16 in a win against Alabama. Farmer notched 20 points [...] one behind team leader Jamal Mashburn [...] in Kentucky's final game of the season, a 11493 win over Auburn. The win pushed Kentucky to a conference-best 144 record, but an SEC rule forbade declaring a team the regular season champion if they were ineligible for postseason play, as Kentucky was.|$|E
500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. I could tell he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E
