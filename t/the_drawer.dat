5|$|A {{negotiable}} instrument {{is a type}} of contract that allows the transfer of money, such as a cheque. With a cheque there are three parties - the person holding the bank account who gives the cheque (<b>the</b> <b>drawer),</b> the party the cheque is made out to (the payee) and the drawer's bank which promises to pay the money to the payee (the drawee).|$|E

A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the director inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Early {{mechanical}} registers {{were entirely}} mechanical, without receipts.

Those original machines were nothing but simple adding machines.|$|E
50|$|In {{case the}} prison {{director}} {{does not have}} to distribute the numbers into <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> randomly, he can foil the prisoners' strategy if he knows the numbering of <b>the</b> <b>drawers.</b> To this end, he just has to ensure that his assignment of prisoners' numbers to drawers constitutes a permutation with a cycle of length larger than 50. The prisoners in turn can counter this by choosing their own numbering of <b>the</b> <b>drawers</b> randomly.|$|R

25|$|A cash drawer {{is usually}} of strong {{construction}} {{and may be}} integral with the register or a separate piece that the register sits atop. It slides {{in and out of}} its lockable box and is secured by a spring-loaded catch. When a transaction that involves cash is completed, the register sends an electrical impulse to a solenoid to release the catch and open <b>the</b> <b>drawer.</b>|$|E
25|$|A cash drawer {{is usually}} a {{compartment}} underneath a cash register in which the cash from transactions is kept. <b>The</b> <b>drawer</b> typically contains a removable till. The till {{is usually a}} plastic or wooden tray divided into compartments used to store each denomination of bank notes and coins separately {{in order to make}} counting easier. The removable till allows money to be removed from the sales floor to a more secure location for counting and creating bank deposits. Some modern cash drawers are individual units separate {{from the rest of the}} cash register.|$|E
25|$|A cash register's drawer {{can only}} be opened by an {{instruction}} from the cash register except when using special keys, generally held by the owner and some employees (e.g. manager). This reduces the amount of contact most employees have with cash and other valuables. It also reduces risks of an employee taking money from <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> without a record and the owner's consent, such as when a customer does not expressly ask for a receipt but {{still has to be}} given change (cash is more easily checked against recorded sales than inventory).|$|E

25|$|On December 21, 1911, Fremont Weeks, the {{plaintiff}} in error and defendant, {{was arrested by}} a police officer at the Union Station in Kansas City, Missouri, where an express company employed him.

At the time of his arrest, police officers went to Weeks' house to search it. A neighbor told them where to find the key. Officers entered the house of the defendant without a search warrant and took possession of papers and articles, which were turned over to the US Marshals. The officers returned later on the same day with the marshal, still without a warrant, and seized letters and envelopes that they found in <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> of a chiffonier.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E
25|$|Robin, however, {{sensed the}} truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the {{evidence}} and made the three calls {{to make it appear}} that a woman had committed the crime. At this point he still had the photo, but rather than destroy it, he kept it and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> earlier and did not see the photo, so he knew it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which was why she didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, and not that of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams {{turns out to be the}} daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has always believed that her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame. She came to see Mrs Upward, who she thought was Eva Kane, intending to confront her, but found her dead and left quietly. She admits this to Poirot, who agrees to keep it a secret and wishes her good luck in her life.|$|E

2500|$|Cash drawers {{that are}} {{integral}} to a stand-alone register {{often have a}} manual release catch underneath to open <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> {{in the event of}} a power failure. More advanced cash drawers have eliminated the manual release in favor of a cylinder lock, requiring a key to manually open <b>the</b> <b>drawer.</b> The cylinder lock usually has several positions: locked, unlocked, online (will open if an impulse is given), and release. The release position is an intermittent position with a spring to push the cylinder back to the unlocked position. In the [...] "locked" [...] position, <b>the</b> <b>drawer</b> will remain latched even when an electric impulse is sent to the solenoid.|$|E
