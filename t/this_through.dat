Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about <b>this</b> <b>through</b> his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.|$|E

5|$|During 1936 the {{experimental}} system at Bawdsey was tested against {{a variety of}} simulated attacks, along with extensive development of interception theory carried out at RAF Biggin Hill. One observer was Hugh Dowding, initially {{as the director of}} research for the RAF, and later as the commander of RAF Fighter Command. Dowding noted that the CH stations provided so much information that operators had problems relaying it to the pilots, and the pilots had problems understanding it. He addressed <b>this</b> <b>through</b> the creation of what is today known as the Dowding system.|$|E
5|$|In the Crystal City, Virginia {{headquarters}} of the software company Eurisko, founder Brad Wilczek {{and chief executive officer}} Benjamin Drake argue about downsizing measures. After Wilczek leaves, Drake writes a memo proposing to shut down the Central Operating System, a computer which runs the Eurisko Building. Seeing <b>this</b> <b>through</b> a surveillance camera, the COS sets up a trap and lures Drake into a bathroom, locking the door behind him. Drake tries to use his keycard to open it, but it rejects the card. When he inserts a manual override key, he is fatally electrocuted.|$|E

He does <b>this</b> <b>through</b> an inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about everything, adding that since he now has the test answers he does not need the study group. As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E

5|$|Porfiry Petrovich– The {{head of the}} Investigation Department {{in charge}} of solving the murders of Lizaveta and Alyona Ivanovna, who, along with Sonya, moves Raskolnikov towards confession. Unlike Sonya, however, Porfiry does <b>this</b> <b>through</b> {{psychological}} games. Despite the lack of evidence, he becomes certain Raskolnikov is the murderer following several conversations with him, but gives him the chance to confess voluntarily. He attempts to confuse and to provoke the unstable Raskolnikov {{in an attempt to}} coerce him to confess. According to the creators of the TV series Columbo (William Link and Richard Levinson), the title character was based on Porfiry.|$|E
5|$|The coin {{stems from}} {{the desire of the}} Columbian Exposition's {{organizers}} to gain federal money to complete construction of the fair. Congress granted an appropriation, and allowed it to be in the form of commemorative half dollars, which legislators and organizers believed could be sold at a premium. Fair official James Ellsworth wanted the new coin to be based on a 16th-century painting he owned by Lorenzo Lotto, reputedly of Columbus, and pushed for <b>this</b> <b>through</b> the design process. When initial sketches by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber proved unsatisfactory, fair organizers turned to a design by artist Olin Levi Warner, which after modification by Barber and by his assistant, George T. Morgan, was struck by the Mint.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to <b>this</b> <b>through</b> the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved <b>this</b> <b>through</b> various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E

5|$|Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt, supreme {{commander}} of the German forces in the west (OB West), directed on 1 July that Caen should be gradually abandoned and {{the bulk of the}} German armoured divisions be shifted to the west end of the beachhead against the US First Army but the city and its surroundings were considered by Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, Armed Forces High Command) to be fundamental to the defence of Normandy. OKW wanted an arc of defensible terrain from the English Channel to the western banks of the Orne to be held and Adolf Hitler sacked Rundstedt and replaced him with Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge. Learning of <b>this</b> <b>through</b> Ultra, the Allied ground forces commander, General Bernard Montgomery, planned an offensive to capture Caen and to prevent a large redeployment of German forces from the Anglo-Canadian sector to the American front.|$|E
5|$|In 1973 the British Railways Board, London Transport Executive, Greater London Council and the Department of the Environment {{produced}} a report examining the modernisation of London transport. It recommended high priority given to reconstructing Liverpool Street and Broad Street stations and recommended financing <b>this</b> <b>through</b> property {{development on the}} site. Liverpool Street {{had a number of}} design and access issues, many of which derived from the 1890 extension which had effectively created two stations on one site, with two concourses linked by walkways, multiple booking halls, and inefficient traffic flows within the station. Additionally the rail infrastructure presented limitations; only seven of the platforms could accommodate 12-carriage trains, and the track exit layout was a bottleneck. In 1975 British Railways announced plans to demolish and redevelop both stations. The proposed demolition met considerable public opposition and prompted a campaign led by the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, leading to a public inquiry from November 1976 to February 1977.|$|E
5|$|Like all French draft breeds, the Norman Cob was {{threatened}} by the advent of mechanization in farming. The only option left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman Cob avoided <b>this,</b> <b>through</b> the efforts of Laurens St. Martin, {{the head of the}} Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a reorientation of the Cob breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman Cob in appearance.|$|E

5|$|Similar issues {{occurred}} in New Brunswick where 18,000customers remained without power through July11. More than 310crews remained deployed throughout the province with electricity {{expected to be}} fully restored by the following week. Costs to repair the power grid were estimated in excess of C$12million (US$11.1million). There was criticism that New Brunswick Power did not appropriately prepare for the storm and actually requested assistance from other public power companies and private contractors after the storm had struck. Two public buildings in Fredericton were utilized as recharging centers for residents to charge their phones and shower. An estimated 6,000people took advantage of <b>this</b> <b>through</b> July10. Shaved ice was later distributed from the Grant-Harvey Centre in the city while several waste disposal sites were opened for residents {{to get rid of}} spoiled food from power outages. Gaëtan Thomas, {{president and chief executive officer}} of NB Power, likened the effects of Arthur in the region to Hurricane Katrina along the United States Gulf Coast in August2005. He referenced that during Katrina, 50 percent of the affected region lost power, while in the wake of Arthur 57 percent of New Brunswick was in the dark over a similar geographic area. Earlier cuts to the company's tree-trimming budget were cited as a possible cause in the scale of damage. As such, their budget for trimming in 2015 was increased from C$6million to C$8million.|$|E
5|$|Social {{ecological}} behaviours are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied {{for this type of}} relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain <b>this</b> <b>through</b> selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{reviews of}} defence {{policy and the}} {{strategic}} situation in South East Asia after the war had resulted {{in the formation of}} the Australian Regiment in 1948, the first regular infantry unit of the Australian Army. From that time on as tension within the region increased the strength of the Regular Army increased rapidly in contrast to the CMF, signifying if not an end to Australian military planners' reliance upon citizen soldiers, at least a shift in focus and a realisation of the mistakes that had been made prior to World War II. This would see the CMF providing a platform upon which the Army could mobilise in the event of a war. Initially, the plan had been for the CMF to be made up of 50,000 men organised into two divisions and other units, however, recruitment was unable to meet these targets as initially it was attempted to achieve <b>this</b> <b>through</b> voluntary enlistment. Indeed, in its first year of existence, the actual strength of the CMF was only 8,698 personnel, although this rose the following year to 16,202 and to 32,779 in 1950. In March 1951, a system of compulsory national service was re-established.|$|E
