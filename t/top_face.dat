25|$|Beginning 2002, {{although}} Austin's character {{remained with}} the WWF's most popular wrestlers as <b>top</b> <b>face,</b> his upcoming storylines in the build-up to WrestleMania were somewhat questionable {{compared to those}} of his previous years. In the 2002 Royal Rumble, Triple H made his long-awaited return from injury, with him and Austin two {{of the last four}} participants in the ring along with Kurt Angle and Mr. Perfect. Austin was eliminated by Kurt Angle, but he shortly went back in the ring and hit all three with a steel chair. A few days later on Raw, he defeated Kurt Angle to earn a shot at Chris Jericho's Undisputed WWF Championship at No Way Out.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Coleman started wrestling for Hustle and its partner {{promotion}} Pro Wrestling Zero-One. He {{debuted in}} the first as part of Nobuhiko Takada's villainous faction Monster Army, going against babyface Toshiaki Kawada in a singles match which Mark lost by TKO. Coleman continued teaming with other Monster Army wrestlers, including Dan Bobish, Commander An Jo and Giant Silva, but he {{was kicked out of}} the stable after failing to defeat <b>top</b> <b>face</b> Naoya Ogawa, turning face himself. Coleman then went free, but he ended joining Wataru Sakata's team after losing a bout to him. Coleman and Sakata were successful as a tag team, but it was dissolved after Coleman left the promotion in 2005.|$|E
25|$|From Florida {{the team}} {{traveled}} to Memphis {{to compete for}} the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) where they were immediately pitted against the <b>top</b> <b>face</b> team of the territory The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn). On January 24, 1984, the Zambuie Express were awarded the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship when the Fabulous Ones failed to show up for a match, but the titles were declared vacant instead of giving them to Akeem and Muhammad. The CWA held a tournament for the vacant championship, a tournament won by the Zambuie Express as they defeated the Pretty Young Things (Koko B. Ware and Norvell Austin) in the final match. The Pretty Young Things won the championship only a week later, defeating the Zambuie Express on CWA's weekly show at the Mid-South Coliseum. Eight days later the Zambuie Express regained the championship. The duo held on to the belts until March 12, 1984 when they lost to Jerry Lawler and Jos LeDuc. The team toured with New Japan Pro Wrestling in the spring of 1984 and then ended up working for Jim Crockett Promotions based in the Carolinas by the summer of 1984. The team sided with Paul Jones and became part of Paul Jones' Army as they fought against Jimmy Valiant and Valiant's friends. The Express competed on the 1984 version of Starrcade, where they lost to the team of Buzz Tyler and The Masked Assassin #1. The loss to Tyler and the Assassin {{was one of the last}} matches the Zambuie Express worked together, splitting up a short time later.|$|E

500|$|The team {{signed with}} the WWF and took on the new name Well Dunn, with Doll {{competing}} as Steven Dunn and King wrestling under the name Timothy Well. They wore bow ties in addition to wrestling singlets with thongs over top. This led wrestling author RD Reynolds to state that the team was [...] "proof positive that bow ties and thongs do not match". The team made its WWF television debut on the July 18, 1993 episode of All-American Wrestling, teaming with Blake Beverly in a loss to Tatanka and The Steiner Brothers. They continued to face the WWF's <b>top</b> <b>face</b> (fan favorite) tag teams, including The Smoking Gunns and Men on a Mission.|$|E
500|$|Hanson is {{regarded}} as an intimidating but honest wrestler. The character he portrayed was hated by many fans, but Hanson was different from many heel wrestlers {{because he did not}} cheat to win matches. Even while competing as a heel, however, Hanson and Hawk were admired by many spectators and had a fan club devoted to them. In contrast to Hawk, who remained a heel during his entire run in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, Hanson gained popularity with even more fans when he feuded with Hawk and became the promotion's <b>top</b> <b>face</b> wrestler. Writers who have looked back on his career have noted that he wrestled with [...] "heart" [...] and always worked his hardest in the ring. Hanson has had a lasting impact on the business, as he was willing to put over other wrestlers, including Blackjack Mulligan and Angelo Mosca to help boost their careers. He and Hawk also helped popularize the quick tag, which saw them trading places in the ring every few seconds to remain energized while their opponents became worn down.|$|E

[...] It was used to find solutions to several problems that the Martlesham flights had revealed. [...] The original fuel tanks, mounted just outboard of the innermost interplane struts and projecting both {{above and below the}} upper wing were found to be the source of aerodynamically-induced vibration at high angles of attack, so they were modified to have a <b>top</b> <b>face</b> matching the upper wing surface. [...] The exhaust pipes were modified to avoid flame dazzle and flow into the cockpit by discharging at the forward end via [...] "rams horn" [...] exits; the ventral gun position was canvassed over, for there was such a draught through the dorsal and ventral openings that neither position was usable.|$|E
2500|$|Research in 2011 by Ropars et al., {{confirms}} {{that one can}} identify {{the direction of the}} sun to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye. [...] The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow entoptic pattern on the fovea of the eye. Alternatively a dot can be placed on top of crystal so {{that when you look at}} it from below, two dots appear, because the light is “depolarised” and fractured along different axes. The crystal can then be rotated until the two points have the same luminosity. The angle of the <b>top</b> <b>face</b> now gives the direction of the sun. Attempts to replicate this work in both Scotland and off the coast of Turkey by science journalist Matt Kaplan and mineralogists at The British Geological Survey in 2014 failed. Kaplan communicated extensively with Ropars and neither could understand why the samples of Iceland spar that were being used during the trials did not reveal the sun's direction.|$|E
