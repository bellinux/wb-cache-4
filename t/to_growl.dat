500|$|... "Falsas Esperanzas" [...] was {{released}} {{as the third}} single from Mi Reflejo on July 2, 2001 in Spain and on July 3, 2001 in the United States. A remix of the song {{was released}} in Germany on July 17, 2001. It peaked at number seven on the Dutch Tipparade chart and number fifteen in Spain. Patty Gettelman from Orlando Sentinel thought that the piece had more Latin influence than contemporary Latin hits such as Ricky Martin's [...] "La Vida Loca" [...] or Lou Bega's [...] "A Little Bit of Mambo". David Browne, writing for Entertainment Weekly [...] felt that [...] "Falsas Esperanzas" [...] left Aguilera [...] "room <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> like a [...] "blues singer". Sonic.net editor Kembrew McLeon lauded the song as one of Aguilera's best uptempo songs that [...] "breathe life into the album". Picolli praised the song as the album's best track, noting: [...] "a dizzy Vegas showstopper... that scoots along on Aguilera's high-flying harmonies and a defiant chorus". [...] "Falsas Esperanzas" [...] was later included on the Spanish edition of Aguilera's greatest hits album [...] (2008). The song also served as the main theme for the Mexican telenovela Como en el cine.|$|E
2500|$|Intrigued by {{the results}} of the automaton, Bell {{continued}} to experiment with a live subject, the family's Skye Terrier, [...] "Trouve". After he taught it <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and vocal cords to produce a crude-sounding [...] "Ow ah oo ga ma ma". With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate [...] "How are you, grandma?" [...] Indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a [...] "talking dog". These initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using tuning forks to explore resonance.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremy Black {{suggests}} the hymn describes the statues of bulls or lions that were {{placed at the}} entrances to temples [...] "Kesh temple, > (something) {{in the shape of}} winged lions stands, (something) in the shape of 'white' wild bulls stands facing the desert." [...] The hymn discusses music being played at the temple towards the end with drums and the coarse sound of a bull's horn sounding at temple ceremonies: [...] "the wild bull's horn was made <b>to</b> <b>growl,</b> the algarsura instrument was made to thud." [...] Samuel Noah Kramer suggested that the musical instruments mentioned in the hymn were played in accompaniment. He proposed that the tigi was probably a hymn accompanied by lyre, that irshemma was perhaps one accompanied by a type of drum and that adab possibly a hymn accompanied by another form of string instrument.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a review}} for All About Jazz, Mark Corroto states [...] "Anker's command of her {{instruments}} (soprano, alto, and tenor saxophones) is exceptional. She has the {{full complement of}} sounds from overblowing <b>to</b> <b>growls</b> and at times, ineffable beauty." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{powerful}} singer with a preternaturally broad range, able {{to reach}} the highest registers of the soprano range without losing either purity or volume, she could also swoop down <b>to</b> <b>growling</b> low notes {{in the style of}} a country preacher.|$|R
60|$|While {{overtaking}} and {{conversing with}} {{her he had}} not observed that the rising wind, which had proceeded from puffing <b>to</b> <b>growling,</b> and from <b>growling</b> <b>to</b> screeching, with the accustomed suddenness of its changes here, had at length brought what it promised by these vagaries--rain. The drops, which had at first hit their left cheeks like the pellets of a popgun, soon assumed {{the character of a}} raking fusillade from the bank adjoining, one shot of which was sufficiently smart to go through Jocelyn's sleeve. The tall girl turned, and seemed to be somewhat concerned at an onset which she had plainly not foreseen before her starting.|$|R
60|$|In this I {{would have}} succeeded had not, all at once, our captive lions begun <b>to</b> <b>growl.</b> That ominous, low murmuring awoke {{me with a}} vengeance, for it was unusual for them <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> {{in the middle of}} the night. I {{wondered}} if they, as well as the pup, had gotten the scent of a prowling lion.|$|E
60|$|On seeing this, Semiramis began <b>to</b> <b>growl,</b> as cats do {{when they}} are angry, and slowly {{approached}} his Majesty.|$|E
60|$|A pause; {{during which}} Minny is stroked again, but has {{sufficient}} insight {{not to be}} grateful for it, <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> rather.|$|E
50|$|The {{band was}} also going for an epic sound {{inspired}} {{by the likes of}} Symphony X and Bal-Sagoth. A choir and orchestra was said to be added to their overall sound but it is unclear as to what extent they would be used. As for bonus tracks, the band and label decided on releasing material previously unheard by the public from their demo Within Reach. At this time, the band used clean vocals as opposed <b>to</b> <b>growling</b> vocals.|$|R
6000|$|Then Lingard, {{standing}} with his back <b>to</b> them, <b>growled</b> out something which must have exasperated Mr. Travers, because his voice was pitched higher: ...|$|R
60|$|It was a bold speech, but foolish. The she-wolf had loosed her hold <b>to</b> growl--to <b>growl</b> at {{a hunter}} with a bloody sword.|$|R
60|$|The agent began <b>to</b> <b>growl,</b> but, seeing {{he could}} do nothing, {{he went off to}} inform Alexander Slocum that Nellie Ardell {{intended}} to move.|$|E
60|$|The bloody mongrel began <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> that'd put {{the fear}} of God in you seeing {{something}} was up but the citizen gave him {{a kick in the}} ribs.|$|E
60|$|But White Fang refused <b>to</b> <b>growl.</b> Instead, {{and after}} a wistful, searching look, he snuggled in, {{burrowing}} {{his head out of}} sight between the master's arm and body.|$|E
50|$|This is a metalcore album {{influenced}} by post-hardcore and electronica sound. The vocalist employed pop punk vocal style in every chorus and screaming similar <b>to</b> death <b>growls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gothic Metal {{is to be}} {{considered}} a subgenre of heavy metal. It links sinister, melancholic melodies with highly aggressive heavy metal. Musical characteristics are the use of keyboards and typically female singers. Vocal styles show a wide range of diversity, from clean <b>to</b> <b>growling.</b> The lyrics show great similarities to gothic rock. Northern Europe and especially Norway are classified as origin of both metal music in general and gothic metal in particular. In Oslo, many goth metal music clubs can be found.The large Norwegian gothic metal scene includes bands like: ...|$|R
6000|$|What ship comes sailing {{home from}} India, and what English lady is this, married <b>to</b> a <b>growling</b> old Scotch Croesus with great flaps of ears? Can this be Julia Mills? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] replied Toto. [...] "Yesterday {{morning the}} Woozy nearly stepped on me, and I tried <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> {{at him and}} found I couldn't growl a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, oh! no, not by no means," [...] replied Richards, [...] "only {{the crust}} o' this 'ere toast is rayther 'ard, and I'm apt <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> w'en that's so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] {{said the}} nephew; [...] "I am very much obliged to you. Is your dog safe?" [...] For Blink had begun <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> {{in a low}} and uneasy manner.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you haven't got {{anything}} newer than that <b>to</b> say,' <b>growled</b> Mr Codlin, {{glancing at the}} clock, 'you'd better let us fix our minds upon the supper, and not disturb us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{there was}} a {{depression}}. But how came it? who devised it? The 'bears,' sir. The depression of our stock was solely owing <b>to</b> the <b>growling,</b> the hypocritical growling, of the bears." ...|$|R
60|$|Saying this, Robin's {{champion}} {{left the}} room and Stumps retired <b>to</b> his berth <b>growling.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd just as lief be tied up as not I {{like to play}} dog;" [...] and Nan put on a don't-care face, {{and began}} <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> and grovel on the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "And it don't do <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> either. The {{best thing}} to do is to pitch in and get through as fast as possible," [...] went on Henry, and then set to {{chopping}} with renewed vigor.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be--he ain't Prime Minister yet," [...] growled Jabez Jenkins, who, being {{a secret}} ally of Hugh Morris, {{was one of}} the disaffected, and had, besides, a natural {{tendency}} <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> and object to everything.|$|E
60|$|In answer <b>to</b> the <b>growl</b> I tossed my head, and {{sheathing}} my sword I {{flung the}} bloodstained kerchief into their very midst. The audacity of the gesture left them breathless, and they growled no more, but stared.|$|R
50|$|The vocals are of {{a varied}} Death Metal style, varying from high shrieks <b>to</b> low <b>growls</b> and roars.The music is monolithic, but is more fast-paced and up-tempo than Doom Metal.The bass intertwines with the guitar, but is neither inaudible or emphasized.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-2009, {{the band}} was joined by Adel Al-Qattan on guitars, and Bader Nana on drums. The band soon began writing {{original}} material, which culminated in two track: [...] "Corporatacide" [...] and [...] "Augmented". (The song [...] "Augmented" [...] was later released on the band's debut EP under the name [...] "The Tyrant"). The sound that the band presented in the two new releases declared a new direction and change of sound that the band is moving toward, {{in comparison to the}} band's previous release [...] "Solace", the new tracks were very heavy, and with the vocals shifting <b>to</b> <b>growls</b> throughout. However, the band carried forward the ambient and atmospheric elements into their new direction.|$|R
60|$|He {{tried to}} pass on, but I stopped him with my hand. The Kanakas were {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>growl.</b> Guess they didn't like my tone, for I spoke to that man as free as I would to you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely--which is the {{universal}} greeting in the freemasonry of animal speech. I see you've {{got it all}} down pat. Well, good-bye again. I'm off. Oh, don't bother <b>to</b> <b>growl,</b> please. I'm sick of that line of stuff." ...|$|E
60|$|If Billy had {{desired to}} arouse {{the ire of}} Detective Sergeant Flannagan by this little speech he succeeded quite {{as well as he}} could have hoped. Flannagan {{commenced}} <b>to</b> <b>growl</b> and threaten, and presently again hurled himself against the door.|$|E
60|$|In {{the centre}} of the room both men paused, and Heron turned with a surly <b>growl</b> <b>to</b> his friend.|$|R
60|$|For an hour they howled {{about the}} tree, {{but after a}} few {{attempts}} to reach us they confined their efforts to terrorizing shrieks and screams, <b>to</b> horrid <b>growling</b> {{on the part of the}} great white apes, and the fearsome and indescribable purring by the plant men.|$|R
50|$|Two (Poverty) is {{the second}} release from Indianapolis thrash band Demiricous. It was {{released}} through Metal Blade Records in 2007. Like their debut, the album contains 12 tracks and is slightly over 40 mins. A noticeable difference between the previous album and the current album is that Olp's vocals have changed from a rasping <b>growl</b> <b>to</b> a barking <b>growl,</b> reminiscent {{of the kind of}} vocals that thrash metal bands have used in the past.|$|R
