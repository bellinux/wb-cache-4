25|$|Massachusetts {{was first}} colonized by principally English Europeans {{in the early}} 17th century, and became the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the 18th century. Prior to English {{colonization}} of the area, it was inhabited {{by a variety of}} mainly Algonquian language indigenous tribes. The first permanent English settlement in New England came in 1620 with the founding of Plymouth Colony by the Pilgrims who sailed on the Mayflower. It set precedents but never grew large. A large-scale Puritan migration began in 1630 with the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and spawned the settlement of other New England colonies. Friction with the natives erupted in the high-casualty King Philip's War in the 1670s. Puritanism was the established religion and was strictly enforced; dissenters were exiled. The Colony clashed with Anglican opponents in England over its religious intolerance and the status of its charter. Most people were farmers. Businessmen established wide-ranging trade links, sending ships to the West Indies and Europe, and sometimes shipping goods in violation of the Navigation Acts. These political and <b>trade</b> <b>issues</b> led to the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in 1684.|$|E

Winthrop's communication with Williams encouraged Williams to convince the Narragansetts to side with the English against the Pequots, who were their traditional enemies.
