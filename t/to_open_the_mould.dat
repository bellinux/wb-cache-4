50|$|For thermosets, {{typically}} {{two different}} chemical components are {{injected into the}} barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions which eventually crosslinks the material into a single connected network of molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid. Solidification in the injection barrel and screw can be problematic and have financial repercussions; therefore, minimising the thermoset curing within the barrel is vital. This typically means that the residence time and temperature of the chemical precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be reduced by minimising the barrel's volume capacity and by maximising the cycle times. These factors {{have led to the}} use of a thermally isolated, cold injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot <b>mould,</b> which increases <b>the</b> rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component. After the part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical precursors, and <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> <b>opens</b> <b>to</b> eject <b>the</b> <b>moulded</b> parts. Then, <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> closes and <b>the</b> process repeats.|$|R

5000|$|Slipcasting: This {{ideally suited}} to the making of wares that cannot be formed by other methods of shaping. A slip, made by mixing clay body with water, is poured into a highly {{absorbent}} plaster <b>mould.</b> Water from <b>the</b> slip is absorbed into <b>the</b> <b>mould</b> leaving a layer of clay body covering its internal surfaces and taking its internal shape. Excess slip is poured out of <b>the</b> <b>mould,</b> which is then split <b>open</b> and <b>the</b> <b>moulded</b> object removed. Slipcasting is widely used {{in the production of}} sanitary wares and is also used for making smaller articles, such as intricately detailed figurines.|$|R
