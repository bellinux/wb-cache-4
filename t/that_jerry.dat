5|$|It was announced, by Fey and {{executive}} producer Lorne Michaels, at the annual Television Critics Association tour in July 2007 <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> Seinfeld would be appearing in the season premiere of 30 Rock. Seinfeld had only appeared in two television acting roles since his own sitcom ended in 1998. Those roles were in Mad About You and Newsradio.|$|E
5|$|Chris angrily demands Leslie {{bring the}} {{painting}} to city hall {{the next day to}} be destroyed. When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> forgot to draw a penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, then it will eventually happen.|$|E
60|$|He felt Jerry's cool nose {{against his}} bare calf, heard his joyous sniff, and bent and caressed him. In the {{darkness}} {{he could not}} see, but his heart warmed with knowledge <b>that</b> <b>Jerry's</b> tail was surely bobbing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just <b>that,</b> Mr. <b>Jerry.</b> <b>That</b> ain't {{my idea of}} a free country. I {{can work}} as well as another, but I ain't going to be told that I'm a swindler because I'm making the most of my time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} me {{to measure}} words with such as you, sir.

5|$|Later in Monk's Café, Jerry {{goes back}} on the deal and decides {{not to take the}} place because George wants it. The two {{continue}} to argue about who should own it, and decided that neither of them should take it. A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, but it is clear <b>that</b> <b>Jerry,</b> George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all three ask what the apartment's rent is.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Donna (Retta) to {{participate}} in a new game show called Know Ya Boo, that he is hoping to pitch to networks; he admits that it is a rip-off of The Newlywed Game. It quickly becomes clear <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> and Donna know much more about each other than the recently married Andy and April. When April reveals her favorite band is Neutral Milk Hotel and not Andy's band Mouse Rat, Andy angrily leaves the game and they later have a big fight which causes him to quit his music. April seeks advice from Ann because, although she dislikes her, Ann previously dated Andy for several years. Ann tells April she has to be supportive of Andy no matter how she feels. The next day, April brings the other members of Mouse Rat to city hall and surprises Andy by singing one of his songs. A thrilled Andy reconciles with April.|$|E

And {{when it comes to}} friendship, he has no peers. <b>That's</b> <b>Jerry's</b> great talent. He doesn't just light up a room, he lights it on fire. He's a great producer, a great organizer, a great friend, and truly the {{greatest}} showman on earth." [...] George Clooney ...|$|R
5000|$|On Grateful Web, Dylan Muhlberg wrote, [...] "The {{first two}} discs {{are packed with}} varied American {{traditional}} songs from folk, bluegrass, blues, and spiritual.... The electric set displays the music <b>that</b> <b>Jerry’s</b> band had accumulated in his vast electric incarnations. The chemistry and ease between these players was previously marveled at and these 1987 concerts display {{some of the finest}} Garcia Band." ...|$|R

5|$|Reinsdorf {{was one of}} two bidders for the Phoenix Coyotes {{that would}} commit to not {{relocating}} the team. On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and his group were approved for ownership of the Coyotes for $148 million. In August 2009, it was reported <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> Reinsdorf & Ice Edge LLC had dropped its bid for the Coyotes, leaving only Balsillie and the NHL as bidders for the team. The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however the league stated it wished to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was once again a possible buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes. Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona. As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of Glendale were still in process for the purchase of the Coyotes. However, in 2013, the Coyotes were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that did not include Reinsdorf.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} programme, {{particularly}} during the Shuttle-Mir programme, Mir suffered from various systems failures. It had been designed for five years of use, but eventually flew for fifteen, and in the 1990s was showing its age, with constant computer crashes, loss of power, uncontrolled tumbles through space and leaking pipes. NASA astronaut John Blaha's account of the air quality on Mir—"very healthy, it's not dry, it's not humid. Nothing smells."—contradicts sharply the concerns about air quality on the space station <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> Linenger relates in his book about his time on the facility. Linenger says that due {{to the age of}} the space station, the cooling system had developed tiny leaks too small and numerous to be repaired, that permitted the constant release of coolant, making it unpleasant to breathe the air. He says that it was especially noticeable after he had made a spacewalk and become used to the bottled air in his spacesuit. When he returned to the station and again began breathing the air inside Mir, he was deeply shocked by the intensity of the chemical smell and very worried about the possible negative health effects of breathing such heavily contaminated air.|$|E
5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't want everyone to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E

50|$|The next day, Gideon {{arrives and}} a {{surprised}} family grudgingly accepts the artificial life form. Though Gideon is initially ignored, the family quickly becomes attached to it. Gideon performs better than Jerry could ever hope for, so well <b>that</b> <b>Jerry's</b> role {{as head of}} the household is removed in favor of an artificial replacement. Jerry grows increasingly hostile towards Gideon but despite his change of heart, Gideon's hold on the family has become too strong.|$|R

25|$|Superboy was {{the subject}} of a legal battle between Time Warner, the owner of DC Comics and the estate of Jerry Siegel. The Siegels argued <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> Siegel was an {{independent}} contractor at the time he proposed the original character, which DC declined at the time. After returning from World War II, Siegel found that DC had published a Superboy story which bore similarities to his proposal.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Sandusky, the adopted son of Jerry Sandusky, {{was also}} {{involved}} in lawsuits against Penn State. While Matthew Sandusky originally took his adopted father’s side {{when he was first}} questioned by the grand jury, he later revealed <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> Sandusky had started to sexually abuse him when he was eight years old. The law firm of Ross Feller Casey LLP went on to represent him in the civil lawsuit, and Matthew Sandusky reached a settlement with Penn State University. He was among one of the 26 victims involved in the settlement amount that was reached in October 2013.|$|E

George becomes so obsessed over the fact <b>that</b> <b>Jerry's</b> girlfriend doesn't like him, he dumps his own girlfriend (Lisa Edelstein) after she gives him an ultimatum to choose between them.|$|R
5000|$|Kramer's ex-girlfriend Leslie the Low-Talker (Wendel Meldrum) from [...] "The Puffy Shirt" [...] is {{apparently}} there {{to testify against}} Jerry for bad-mouthing the puffy shirt she had him promote on The Today Show. Jackie Chiles objects because Leslie is a low-talker and that nobody can hear her. He tells Judge Vandalay to either get Leslie a microphone or they should move on with the trial. A deleted scene had District Attorney Hoyt getting close enough to hear <b>that</b> <b>Jerry's</b> negative comment ruined her business prior to Jackie Chiles' objection.|$|R
25|$|At {{the debut}} {{pre-season}} game of Cowboys Stadium, a punt by Tennessee Titans kicker, A. J. Trapasso, hit the 2,100 in. screen above the field. The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until Titans coach Jeff Fisher informed the officials that the punt struck the scoreboard. (Many believe Trapasso {{was trying to}} hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and {{the angle of the}} kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines — hanging approximately five feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> Jones invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them hitting it consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet.|$|E
25|$|On November 8, 1997, one {{day before}} Survivor Series, McMahon met with Pat Patterson and Michaels {{in a hotel room}} in Montreal and planned the screwjob. It is unclear how many people knew of the {{impending}} screwjob, but McMahon's close aides Gerald Brisco and Sgt. Slaughter had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross has insisted {{that he did not know}} the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved. In a radio interview, Ross also confirmed <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> Lawler also did not know that the screwjob would take place. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested. The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart would kick out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} Jerry-centered episode arose {{when the}} writers decided one of the {{characters}} would get mugged. Muharrar said, [...] "Once we thought about it, it was obvious it had to be Jerry. He's the Parks Department punching bag, and it seemed like it was time for Jerry's revenge." [...] Muharrar said the script tried to convey that although his co-workers mock him, they do not hate him, and <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> does not take the jokes against him personally. Series co-creator Michael Schur said once it was established in the episode [...] "Practice Date" [...] <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> was the co-worker everyone else picked on, he felt it was important to write an episode that established the other characters actually liked Jerry, despite their jokes at his expense.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, {{there was}} an attempt to revive the show with a cast <b>that</b> {{included}} <b>Jerry</b> Lewis and Lynn Redgrave, but it closed on the road before reaching Broadway.|$|R
5000|$|Afterwards, Jerry is seen {{around town}} with heiress Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont). To break up this relationship, {{on the night}} before the final divorce decree, Lucy crashes a party at the Vance mansion, pretending to be Jerry's sister. She acts like a showgirl (recreating a risqué musical number she had seen {{performed}} by Dixie Belle) and lets on <b>that</b> <b>Jerry's</b> father ("their" [...] father) had been a gardener at Princeton University, not a student athlete as Jerry had claimed. Realizing that his chances with Barbara have been effectively sabotaged, Jerry drives Lucy away in her car.|$|R
5000|$|Hanna and Barbera {{achieved}} {{the effect of}} Kelly dancing with Jerry by rotoscoping: live-action plates of Kelly dancing alone were shot first, and the action traced frame by frame so <b>that</b> <b>Jerry's</b> movements would match. The success of the animated segment of Anchors Aweigh, which was noted as [...] "stealing the show" [...] in contemporary trade reviews, led to two more live-action/animated projects for Hanna and Barbera and MGM: an underwater ballet sequence featuring both Tom and Jerry in Esther Williams' 1953 film Dangerous When Wet, and the [...] "Sinbad the Sailor" [...] sequence of Kelly's 1956 film Invitation to the Dance.|$|R
500|$|Jerry {{proposes to}} Dale, who, while still believing <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> is Horace, [...] is disgusted that her friend's husband could behave {{in such a}} manner and agrees instead to marry Alberto. Fortunately, Bates (Eric Blore), Horace's meddling English valet, disguises himself as a priest and conducts the ceremony; Horace had sent Bates to keep tabs on Dale.|$|E
500|$|Jerry has {{problems}} with a childhood friend, Joel Horneck, who persists in keeping in touch with him. He does not like Horneck, who does not pay attention to anything <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> says. Jerry says that he feels uncomfortable [...] "breaking up with" [...] Horneck, so George suggests that he should pretend that Horneck is a woman and break up normally. Jerry therefore attempts to break up with Horneck at Monk's Café, but Horneck bursts into tears. Deeply uncomfortable, Jerry assures Horneck he didn't mean it, and agrees {{to take him to}} see the New York Knicks, although he was supposed to take George.|$|E
500|$|Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] "The series' most {{multifaceted}} (if {{not most}} engaging) narrative so far", and graded {{it with a}} B. David Sims gave the episode an A, writing, [...] "George is really the most revolutionary character: he's often repulsive and pathetic, but here these are traits we heartily enjoy and sympathize with and want more of... The best thing about this episode is <b>that</b> <b>Jerry</b> almost immediately getting with George's ex-girlfriend creates no drama in the group, though it would on almost any other sitcom." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a {{critical}} review, Frank Rich of The New York Times wrote [...] "The only thing <b>that</b> <b>Jerry's</b> Girls has {{in common with}} a bona fide Jerry Herman musical is that it occupies the St. James, the theater where Dolly once promised she'd never go away again... Whatever {{the point of the}} all-female cast, one must still wonder why the show's particular female stars were chosen. None of them have been associated with Mr. Herman's musicals. Only one (Miss Uggams) is primarily a singer. All three have strident mannerisms that the director, Larry Alford, takes sadistic glee in calling to our attention." ...|$|R
