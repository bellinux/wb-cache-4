500|$|In Demosthenes' time, {{different}} political goals developed around personalities. Instead of electioneering, Athenian politicians used litigation and defamation to remove rivals from government processes. Often they indicted {{each other for}} breaches of the statute laws (graphē paranómōn), but accusations of bribery and corruption were ubiquitous in all cases, being part of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>dialogue.</b> The orators often resorted to [...] "character assassination" [...] (diabolē, loidoria) tactics, both in the courts and in the Assembly. The rancorous and often hilariously exaggerated accusations, satirised by Old Comedy, were sustained by innuendo, inferences about motives, and a complete absence of proof; as J. H. Vince states [...] "there {{was no room for}} chivalry in Athenian political life". Such rivalry enabled the [...] "demos" [...] or citizen-body to reign supreme as judge, jury and executioner. Demosthenes was to become fully engaged in this kind of litigation and he was also to be instrumental in developing the power of the Areopagus to indict individuals for treason, invoked in the ecclesia by a process called [...] "ἀπόφασις".|$|E
500|$|The Federalist Party {{had died}} out nationally by 1820, but new party {{divisions}} were soon {{to form in}} Kentucky. The Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians deeply in debt and without a means of repaying their creditors. Two factions grew up around the issue of debt relief. Those who favored laws favorable to debtors were dubbed the [...] "Relief Party" [...] and those who favored laws protecting creditors were called the [...] "Anti-Relief Party". While not formal political parties—members of both factions still considered themselves Democratic-Republicans—these factions defined <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> of the 1820s in Kentucky. The debt relief issue began under Gabriel Slaughter, who identified with the Anti-Relief Party, but Slaughter's two immediate successors, John Adair and Joseph Desha, {{were members of the}} Relief Party. The struggle between the two parties culminated in the Old Court– New Court controversy, an attempt by the pro-relief legislature to abolish the Court of Appeals because the court overturned some debt relief measures as unconstitutional. The controversy ended with the restoration of the Old Court over Desha's veto in late 1826.|$|E

40|$|Does <b>the</b> {{existence}} of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> signal <b>the</b> lack of party institutionalization? Research on <b>political</b> <b>dialogue,</b> and <b>the</b> dynamics of issue ownership and issue salience, argues that parties have {{no incentive to}} trespass on issues owned by opponents. This requires that parties have niches of advantaged issues, which are obtained through the specialization of parties and their members via their platform and experiences in office. This characteristic signals the {{existence of}} an institutionalized party system where the party label has a meaning the electorate can interpret. In a non-institutionalized system; however, the party label has no meaningful value. In this context parties lack the programmatic clarity and experience that gives them advantages on issues. Given this, <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> should be more prevalent because politicians will be prone {{to talk to each other}} in order to set the agenda, attempt to control issues, and send signals to the electorate. As parties define themselves and become institutionalized, issues will become owned and parties will have more incentive to talk past each other, effectively diminishing <b>political</b> <b>dialogue.</b> In this paper I seek to understand these dynamics and the relationship of wining <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> and party system institutionalization. I argue that following a party system collapse, and the subsequent de-institutionalization of <b>the</b> parties, <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> will be more frequent; however, as political actors adapt to their new environment instances of <b>political</b> <b>dialogue</b> will diminish, signaling that the new party system is institutionalizing...|$|R
