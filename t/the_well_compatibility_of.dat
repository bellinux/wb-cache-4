40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} HOL-Omega, {{a recent}} extension by Homeier {{to the type}} system of the HOL theorem prover. We describe how it per-mits an implementation of categories, where we model the objects of a category as the types of HOL-Omega. This gives a “light-weight ” im-plementation of categories into a theorem prover: we explore how this is sufficient for easily proving some non-trivial results of category theory, although some other results cannot be expressed in HOL-Omega in this way. We illustrate the use of HOL-Omega by first proving the multiple characterisations of an adjoint pair of functors. Then we consider com-pound monads, where we consider distributive laws and the conditions for <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> monads. We show how in HOL-Omega we can ex-press {{the concept of a}} monad in the Kleisli category of another monad, and use this to obtain easy proof of some results about distributive laws, including a new result simplifying the conditions of Barr & <b>Wells</b> for <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> monads...|$|R

Transmission {{electron microscope}} images clearly {{indicate that the}} surfaces of the MWCNTs are uniformly decorated by well-crystallized BaTiO 3 particles with diameters of 15 - 30 nm. The result of Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption properties analysis, determined by the EM parameters, shows that the reflection loss (RL) in the BaTiO 3 /MWCNT composite is higher than that occurring in pure MWCNTs or BaTiO 3, which resulted from the better matched characteristic impedance and enhanced complex permeability in the high frequency. The maximum RL of – 37. 5 dB in the BaTiO 3 /MWCNT composite is obtained at a frequency of 10. 4 GHz and the absorption range is under – 10 dB in the frequency range of 9. 6 – 13. 1 GHz with the absorber thickness of 2 mm.   BaTiO 3 /MWCNT/PAN hybrid fibres, derived from a PAN solution containing 10 wt% BaTiO 3 /MWCNT composite, were prepared by the electrospinning process.

40|$|According to an Australian {{department}} of health and aging (www. health. gov. au), adoption of new technologies is crucial in addressing health issues. Currently, wireless technology is used in Australian healthcare with limited scope addressing specific aspects of quality of service offered to various stakeholders. While prior studies agree that wireless applications have the potential to address the endemic problems of healthcare, very limited information can be found about the determinants of such applications. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} identify factors that assist in the adoption of wireless applications in healthcare and the factors acting as barriers for the uptake of wireless applications. In doing so, this study used focus group discussions and a survey method to accomplish the requirements of this study. The study was structured in two specific phases. The first phase of the study involved conducting focus group discussion sessions with selected healthcare professionals to explore their views and opinion regarding factors involved in the adoption of wireless handheld devices as applicable to the Australian healthcare environment.

40|$|Non-equilibrium {{rarefied}} flows are encountered {{frequently in}} supersonic flight at high altitudes, vacuum technology and in microscale devices. Prediction of {{the onset of}} non-equilibrium is important for accurate numerical simulation of such flows. We formulate and apply the discrete version of Boltzmann’s H-theorem for analysis of non-equilibrium onset and accuracy of numerical modeling of rarefied gas flows. The numerical modeling approach {{is based on the}} deterministic solution of kinetic model equations. The numerical solution approach comprises the discrete velocity method in the velocity space and the finite volume method in the physical space with different numerical flux schemes: the first-order, the second-order minmod flux limiter and a third-order WENO schemes. The use of entropy considerations in rarefied flow simulations is illustrated for the normal shock, the Riemann and the two-dimensional shock tube problems.

Methods In this work, we present a new toolkit suitable for indicative radionuclide dose calculation. The software is built using open source tools and it uses dose kernels calculated using the Geant 4 Application for Tomographic Emission simulation toolkit. In addition, a method that uses kernel data to extract a material-specific dose absorption factor is described and a proof of concept is given. In this work, time dependency and organ sensitivity are not modeled. Results The developed software utilizes Monte Carlo calculated dose kernels and proposes a fast dose calculation method. Using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging it can provide a more accurate and personalized indicative dose map.

Subjects and methods: The beliefs lay people and patients have about the origins of suicidal behaviour as <b>well</b> as <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> their beliefs with the views of the mental health personnel (general practitioners and psychiatrists) were assessed. 45 semi-structured interviews with the general population, suicide attempters, general practitioners and psychiatrists were conducted, audio typed, transcribed and a thematic analysis of the data was carried out. Results: The results indicated the incompatibility of the views. The general population and the suicide attempters favoured psychological explanations of suicidal behaviour, whereas the general practitioners and psychiatrists promoted medical explanations. The only common theme was perception of the suicidal crisis as a crucial factor in suicidality. Conclusions: Lay people and experts believe that suicidal crisis is the main origin of suicidal behaviour. The awareness of this common denominator and also of the differences in opinions between lay people and experts should be kept in mind when planning and implementing prevention and treatment programmes if we wish to promote help-seeking behaviour and attain good adherence to treatment...|$|R

A thorough {{characterization of the}} transport properties demonstrates the high quality of these devices for both electron and hole accumulation, which enables the quantitative determination of the band gap (Δ 1 L = 2. 14 eV for monolayers and Δ 2 L = 1. 82 eV for bilayers). It also enables {{the operation of the}} transistors in the ambipolar injection regime with electrons and holes injected simultaneously at the two opposite contacts of the devices in which we observe light emission from the FET channel. A quantitative analysis of the spectral properties of the emitted light, together with a comparison with the band gap values obtained from transport, show the internal consistency of our results and allow a quantitative estimate of the excitonic binding energies to be made.

State aid is therefore primarily set {{in the context of}} protection of competition in the EU internal market. Furthermore, the thesis provides an interpretation of Article 107, paragraph 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which contains four attributes of state aid: state resources, favoring certain undertaking or the production of certain goods, distortion of competition and effect on trade between EU Member States. Analysis of the attribute "effect on trade between Member States" is made in a separate part of the work. In this section, the work seeks to explore how European Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union approach and interpret this attribute.

40|$|The {{execution}} environments For scientific applications {{have evolved}} significantly over the years. Vector and parallel architectures have provided significantly faster computations. Cluster computers {{have reduced the}} cost of high-performance architectures. However, the software development environments have not keep pace. Object-oriented and component-based languages have not been widely adopted. Distributed computing on local area networks and Grids is only being used by a most number of applications. Clearly, {{there is a need}} for development environments that support the efficient creation of applications that use modern execution systems. This has been the goal of a continuing research effort over the last several years. The previous focus has been on using component-based ideas to develop a programming model and associated framework to support such a development approach. In this paper, two additional concepts are added to the base approach. Aspect-oriented concepts are applied to support the reduction of intertwined code related to different programming concerns; mixing I/O with a numerical computation is one example. Particularly in large applications, intertwining code can lead to applications that are difficult to modify and to manage. The second concept being added is the use of behavioral metadata. When coupling smaller pieces of code (or components) to make a larger composite application, one needs to determine the suitability of the internal behavior of component as <b>well</b> as <b>the</b> <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> its interfaces.

Within the scientic debate the implementation of such policies highlights a set of problems of choice of the macro variables {{that make up the}} policy control - nal demand components, disposable income or other - of the determination of its amount, structure and balance. In a multi-sectoral framework these issues require a careful identication of the relationship among amount and structure of the policy control - which normally is brought back to a demand control - since the aggregation criterion in uences the achievable results and their interpretability. The Macro Multiplier approach, which extends the Leontief multipliers analysis, identies the complete representation of the structures of the macro variables, components of nal demand, consistent with the technologies in use.
