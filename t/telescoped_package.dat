5000|$|Solar filters block {{most of the}} {{sunlight}} to avoid any damage to the eyes. They are usually made from a durable glass or a plastic film which transmits 1/100,000th of the light. Film filters are used over the aperture of the telescope and do not heat up significantly, whereas glass filters are used near the objective end causing them to heat up greatly {{and it is not}} unknown for them to shatter from thermal shock. Glass solar filters are therefore not recommended by most experts and some stockists refuse to sell them or remove them from <b>telescope</b> <b>packages.</b> [...] "Solar filters designed to thread into eyepieces that are often provided with inexpensive telescopes are also unsafe. These glass filters can crack unexpectedly from overheating when the telescope is pointed at the Sun, and retinal damage can occur faster than the observer can move the eye from the eyepiece." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{publicly}} available tool (DustPol) aimed {{to model the}} polarised thermal dust emission. The module DustPol, which is publicly available, {{is part of the}} ARTIST (Adaptable Radiative Transfer Innovations for Submillimetre <b>Telescopes)</b> <b>package,</b> which also offers tools for modelling the polarisation of line emission together with a model library and a Python-based user interface. DustPol can easily manage analytical as well as pre-gridded models to generate synthetic maps of the Stokes I, Q, and U parameters. These maps are stored in FITS format which is straightforwardly read by the data reduction software used, e. g., by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). This turns DustPol into a powerful engine for the prediction of the expected polarisation features of a source observed with ALMA or the Planck satellite {{as well as for the}} interpretation of existing submillimetre observations obtained with other telescopes. DustPol allows the parameterisation of the maximum degree of polarisation and we find that, in a prestella...|$|R

40|$|The Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) is a five <b>telescope</b> <b>package,</b> {{which has}} been {{developed}} for the Solar Terrestrial Relation Observatory (STEREO) mission by the Naval Research Laboratory (USA), the Lockheed Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory (USA), the Goddard Space Flight Center (USA), the University of Birmingham (UK), the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK), the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (Germany), the Centre Spatiale de Leige (Belgium), the Institut d'Optique (France) and the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale (France). SECCHI comprises five telescopes, which together image the solar corona from the solar disk to beyond 1 AU. These telescopes are: an extreme ultraviolet imager (EUVI: 1 1. 7 R[SUB]o[/SUB]), two traditional Lyot coronagraphs (COR 1 : 1. 5 4 R[SUB]o[/SUB] and COR 2 : 2. 5 15 R[SUB]o[/SUB]) and two new designs of heliospheric imagers (HI- 1 : 15 84 R[SUB]o[/SUB] and HI- 2 : 66 318 R[SUB]o[/SUB]). All the instruments use 2048 × 2048 pixel CCD arrays in a backside-in mode. The EUVI backside surface has been specially processed for EUV sensitivity, while the others have an anti-reflection coating applied. A multi-tasking operating system, running on a PowerPC CPU, receives commands from the spacecraft, controls the instrument operations, acquires the images and compresses them for downlink through the main science channel (at compression factors typically up to 20 ×) and also through a low bandwidth channel {{to be used for}} space weather forecasting (at compression factors up to 200 ×). An image compression factor of about 10 × enable the collection of images at the rate of about one every 2 3 minutes.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{describe}} an IDL-based {{package for the}} reduction of spectral data obtained with SpeX, a medium-resolution, 0. 8 – 5. 5 mm cross-dispersed spectrograph and imager for the NASA Infrared <b>Telescope</b> Facility. The <b>package,</b> called Spextool, carries out all the procedures necessary to produce fully reduced spectra including preparation of calibration frames, processing and extraction of spectra from science frames, wavelength calibration of spectra, and flux calibration of spectra. The package incorporates an “optimal extraction ” algorithm for pointsource data and also generates realistic error arrays associated with the extracted spectra. Because it is fairly quick and easy to use, requiring minimal user interaction, Spextool can be run by observers at the telescope to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio of their data. We describe the procedures incorporated into Spextool and show examples of extracted spectra. 1...|$|R

40|$|The Global Atmospheric Backscatter Experiment (GLOBE) Mission, {{using the}} NASA DC- 8 {{aircraft}} platform, {{is designed to}} provide the magnitude and statistical distribution of atmospheric backscatter cross section at lidar operating wavelengths. This is a fundamental parameter required for the Doppler lidar proposed to be used on a spacecraft platform for global wind field measurements. The prime measurements will be made by a CO 2 lidar instrument in the 9 to 10 micron range. These measurements will be complemented with the Goddard YAG Aerosol Lidar (YAL) data in two wavelengths, 0. 532 and 1. 06 micron, in the visible and near-infrared. The YAL, is being designed to utilize as much existing hardware, as feasible, to minimize cost and reduce implementation time.

40|$|We {{introduce}} DarkBit, {{an advanced}} software code for computing dark matter constraints on various extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics, comprising both new native code and interfaces to external packages. This release includes a dedicated signal yield calculator for gamma-ray observations, which significantly extends current tools by implementing a cascade decay Monte Carlo, {{as well as}} a dedicated likelihood calculator for current and future experiments (gamlike). This provides a general solution for studying complex particle physics models that predict dark matter annihilation to a multitude of final states. We also supply a direct detection package that models a large range of direct detection experiments (DDcalc), and provides the corresponding likelihoods for arbitrary combinations of spin-independent and spin-dependent scattering processes. Finally, we provide custom relic density routines along with interfaces to DarkSUSY, micrOMEGAs, and the neutrino <b>telescope</b> likelihood <b>package</b> nuLike. DarkBit is written in the framework of the Global And Modular Beyond the Standard Model Inference Tool (GAMBIT), providing seamless integration into a comprehensive statistical fitting framework that allows users to explore new models with both particle and astrophysics constraints, and a consistent treatment of systematic uncertainties. In this paper we describe its main functionality, provide a guide to getting started quickly, and show illustrative examples for results obtained with DarkBit (both as a standalone tool and as a GAMBIT module). This includes a quantitative comparison between two of the main dark matter codes (DarkSUSY and micrOMEGAs), and application of DarkBit's advanced direct and indirect detection routines to a simple effective dark matter model.

40|$|The {{results of}} this study show the {{feasibility}} of carrying a wind measuring lidar on an ATN-derivative free flying spacecraft. The overall configuration fits within the Shuttle bay and uses the same techniques for STS Launch as the proposed SAATN spacecraft. The lidar can be made light enough that the total weight of the satellite is well within the capability of the onboard propulsion system for transfers to a Sun synchronous orbit at 833 km attitude. The principal techniques for weight minimization are the use of the Perkin Elmer proprietary HIP process for the <b>telescope,</b> new <b>packaging</b> concepts for the laser and for the optics-laser interface, and the application of current technology to the signal processing hardware. Power minimization is achieved for the lidar primarily by use of a low pulse repetition frequency, i. e., 2 pps, and again by the use of current processor technology. The power capability of the spacecraft is enhanced by increasing the ATN array size 25 percent, through the addition of two more solar array panels of the present size, and by limiting the range of Sun angles over which the spacecraft is operated. The same basic concept for the lidar as proposed in the Shuttle Windsat study is recommended here, but there are some changes in details to improve weight and power. No major technology break-throughs are required for the lidar, but some technology experiments are recommended for the laser subsystem to verify isotopic gas lifetime and performance, modulator life and weight, and for space qualification. Spacecraft changes are all natural modifications or growth to accommodate the payload. Overall, the proposed system provides substantial margin for the uncertainties for the future and for potential payload change, and also demonstrates the reasonableness of the Windsat Free Flyer concept...|$|R

40|$|The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) {{is a large}} (6. 6 m), cold (50 K), infrared-optimized space {{observatory}} {{that will}} be launched early in the next decade. The observatory will have four instruments: a near-infrared camera, a near-infrared multi-object spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will cover the wavelength range, 0. 6 to 5. 0 microns, while the mid-infrared instrument will do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5. 0 to 29 microns. The JWST science goals are divided into four themes. The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization theme seeks to identify the first luminous sources to form and to determine the ionization history of the early universe. The Assembly of Galaxies theme seeks to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars, metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from the epoch of reionization to the present day. The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems theme seeks to unravel the birth and early evolution of stars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary systems. The Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme seeks to determine the {{physical and chemical properties}} of planetary systems including our own, and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. To enable these observations, JWST consists of a <b>telescope,</b> an instrument <b>package,</b> a spacecraft and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments, some of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment on-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. The JWST operations plan is based on that used for previous space observatories, and the majority of JWST observing time will be allocated to the international astronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.
