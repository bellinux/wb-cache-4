5|$|In {{physics and}} fluid mechanics, a Blasius {{boundary}} layer (named after Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius) describes the steady two-dimensional {{laminar boundary layer}} that forms on a semi-infinite plate which is held parallel to a constant unidirectional flow. Falkner and Skan later generalized Blasius' solution <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> flow (Falkner–Skan boundary layer), i.e. flows in which the plate is not parallel to the flow.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like {{extensions}} of the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede more difficult for predators to swallow.|$|E
5|$|The nuthatches {{are all in}} {{the genus}} Sitta Linnaeus, 1758, a name derived from , Ancient Greek for this bird. Nuthatch refers to the {{propensity}} of some species <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> a large insect or seed in a crack and hack at it with their strong bills. Species boundaries in the nuthatches are difficult to define. The red-breasted nuthatch, Corsican nuthatch and Chinese nuthatch have breeding ranges separated by thousands of kilometres, but are similar in habitat preference, appearance and song. They were formerly considered to be one species, but are now normally split into three and comprise a superspecies along with the Krüper's and Algerian nuthatch. Unusually for nuthatches, all five species excavate their own nests.|$|E

5|$|One of the higher-level predators {{within its}} ecosystem, the Australian swellshark feeds on {{crustaceans}} (particularly crabs and rock lobsters), cephalopods (including squid and octopus), and small fishes. Even large-sized prey {{tends to be}} swallowed whole; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to digestion. Like {{the other members of}} its genus, this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water or air into its stomach, as a defense against predators. These include larger fishes, such as the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and marine mammals. By inflating, the shark may be able <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> itself inside crevices, make itself harder to swallow, or simply intimidate a would-be predator. Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species, but these are poorly documented.|$|E
5|$|The Overland Campaign was {{a series}} of battles fought in Virginia during May and June 1864. Sigel's and Butler's efforts sputtered, and Grant was left alone to fight Lee. Grant crossed the Rapidan River on May 4, attacking Lee in the Battle of the Wilderness, a three-day battle with many casualties. Rather than retreat as his {{predecessors}} had done, Grant flanked Lee's army to the southeast and attempted <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> his forces between Lee and Richmond at Spotsylvania Court House. Lee's army got to Spotsylvania first and a costly battle ensued, lasting thirteen days. Grant attempted to break through Lee's defenses, resulting in one of the bloodiest assaults of the Civil War, known as the Battle of the Bloody Angle. Unable to break Lee's lines, Grant again flanked the rebels to the southeast, meeting at North Anna, where a battle lasted three days.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E

25|$|In the 1830s rolled T-shaped (or single-flanged T {{parallel}} rail) and I-shaped (or double-flanged T parallel or bullhead) rails were introduced; both required cast-iron {{chairs to}} support them. Originally, iron keys were used <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> the rail into the vertical parallel jaws of the chair; these were superseded by entirely wooden keys. The wooden keys were formed from oak, steam softened and then compressed with hydraulic presses {{and stored in}} a drying house. When inserted into the chair, exposure to the wet atmosphere caused the key to expand, firmly holding the rail. The wedge {{may be on the}} inside or outside of the rail. In Britain they were usually on the outside.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his technical skills at playing and composing, Emerson was a theatrical performer. He cited guitarist Jimi Hendrix and organist Don Shinn as his chief theatrical influences. While in ELP, Emerson continued to some degree the physical abuse of his Hammond organ that he had developed with the Nice, including playing the organ upside down while having it lie over him and using knives <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> down specific keys and sustain notes during solos. In {{addition to}} using his knives on the organ, he also engaged in knife throwing onstage, using a target fastened to his keyboard rig. He was given his trademark knife, an authentic Nazi dagger, by Lemmy, who was a roadie for the Nice in his earlier days.|$|E

25|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cephaloscyllium are {{generally}} slow-moving, sedentary animals with an anguilliform (eel-like) mode of swimming. Of the species whose diets have been documented, they {{have been known to}} feed {{on a wide variety of}} benthic organisms, including other sharks and rays, bony fishes, crustaceans, and molluscs. Swellsharks are perhaps best known for their ability to inflate themselves by rapidly swallowing water or air when threatened; this behavior may allow them <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> themselves inside crevices, make themselves harder to swallow, and/or intimidate a would-be predator. Reproduction is oviparous, with females producing two eggs at a time, one in each oviduct. Individual eggs are enclosed in a flask-shaped capsules with tendrils at the corners that allow them to be attached to underwater structures.|$|E
25|$|Gillemont and Ginchy lay on spurs, which {{constricted}} the British {{right flank}} and commanded {{the ground to}} the south, in the French Sixth Army area. During {{the time when the}} German third line and intermediate lines and redoubts, were being completed on the rear slopes of Bazentin Ridge, Allied attacks had become smaller and periods of wet weather, the terrain, supply and ammunition difficulties, combined with the German policy of unyielding defence and the reinforcements reaching the German 1st and 2nd armies, slowed the Anglo-French advance, particularly south of the Somme. The German second line ran north-west, from the French sector near Maurepas <b>to</b> <b>Wedge</b> Wood, behind Arrow Head Copse, in front of Guillemont, past the station and thence to Delville Wood and Longueval, before turning sharply west. The approaches to the village were bare and overlooked by German posts in Leuze Wood.

500|$|The nuthatches are a genus, Sitta, {{of small}} {{passerine}} birds which derive their English {{name from the}} propensity of some species <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> large insects or seeds into cracks, and then hack at them with their strong bills.

500|$|Like {{other members}} of its genus, when {{threatened}} the blotchy swellshark is capable of rapidly inflating its stomach with water or air. This allows the shark <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> itself inside a rocky crevice, becoming extremely difficult to remove. This species is an opportunistic, highly voracious predator; one recorded female [...] long had 10 fish about [...] long and 15 squid about [...] long in her stomach. Predominantly piscivorous, this species is known to prey upon hagfish and at least 50 species of bony fishes, including fast-swimming types that inhabit open water; significant prey species include the mackerel Scomber japonicus, the sardine Sardinops melanostictus, the filefish Thamnaconus modestus, and the hakeling Physiculus japonicus. Unusually for such a small shark, it also feeds on at least 10 species of cartilaginous fishes, including lantern sharks, catsharks (particularly the cloudy catshark, Scyliorhinus torazame, and its eggs), the electric ray Narke japonica, and skates (including their eggs). It also cannibalizes smaller members of its own species. Cephalopods, mostly the squid Doryteuthis bleekeri and the cuttlefish Sepia spp., are also frequently taken, while crabs, shrimp, and isopods are occasionally consumed. The dietary composition of juveniles varies notably from place to place.|$|E
500|$|Nests are {{generally}} large and untidy, {{consisting of a}} bowl or platform of sticks lined with grasses, barks, and feathers that can be up to [...] thick. As they are relatively heavy, they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> sticks, which are [...] long and [...] thick, into the tree fork to make a platform. Thinner sticks and rootlets are {{used to make the}} bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers. Both birds build the nest, with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material. New nests are built each year generally, as the re-use of old ones might spread disease or parasites—nests become caked with faeces as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal. Furthermore, old nests often disintegrate within twelve months due to their exposed locations. The female develops a brood patch—a patch of bare skin on the bird's underparts that reddens and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid. The skin itself is oedematous and wrinkled, and does not get re-feathered until December after the breeding season has finished.|$|E

They had five small holds, {{each with its own}} hatch. Their curved sides made them wider at the top than the bottom, and wider amidships than fore and aft. Containerisation of shipping did not begin until a decade after war, so most wartime military shipments were break bulk cargo, with goods in bags, boxes, crates, barrels and drums. This was very efficient in terms of shipping space, but loading and unloading was consequently slow and manpower intensive. It also meant that ships could be unloaded with their own tackle, without special port facilities. Loading a ship was something of an art form. The ideal was to make best use of irregular spaces. Goods had to be stowed so as <b>to</b> <b>wedge</b> everything together tightly, as items that shifted at sea could break open and cause damage to their contents and other items. A load that shifted could even cause the ship to capsize.|$|E
