In January 1911, they returned to the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba before continuing to another base in Norfolk.

5|$|How the Phylloxera aphid was {{introduced}} <b>to</b> <b>Europe</b> remains debated: American vines {{had been taken}} <b>to</b> <b>Europe</b> many times before, for reasons including experimentation and trials in grafting, without consideration {{of the possibility of}} the introduction of pestilence. While the Phylloxera was thought to have arrived around 1858, it was first recorded in France in 1863, near the former province of Languedoc. It is argued by some that the introduction of such pests as phylloxera was only a problem after the invention of steamships, which allowed a faster journey across the ocean, and consequently allowed durable pests, such as the Phylloxera, to survive the trip.|$|E
