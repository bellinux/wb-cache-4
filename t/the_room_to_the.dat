5|$|The {{entrance}} hall was flanked {{on either side}} by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. The one on the west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak-away in {{the central part of}} the building, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east may possibly have been a guardroom. On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of these rooms is uncertain, but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed.|$|E

Inside, a winding staircase leads to the attic. To the north is the kitchen, retaining a hewn summer beam and flared cased posts while sporting modern cabinets and wallpaper. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south also has a visible hewn summer beam and its original casing on the flared posts. The attic is finished with vertically placed beaded boarding, and the roof is framed with hewn rafters.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{east of the}} Oak Bedroom {{is known}} as The Great Room. The room was {{established}} in the mid 17th century as part of a reception suite, and was used by George John, the Second Earl for important political conferences during his period as First Lord of the Admiralty and Home Secretary. The Great Room, predominantly red and gold in design like many of the first floor rooms, contains a table and chairs with a large gilded mirror with three urns in front of it. The long mirror, designed by James Stuart, who was noted for his Athenian designs, features a tableaux at the top with the Spencer coat of arms and the pulling of chariots by cherubs, representing the love between John and Georgiana. The Great Room contains an extensive collection of miniature portraits, including a very rare Lucas de Heere portrait of Lady Jane Grey as a teenage girl at her family residence in Bradgate, Leicestershire. The Portrait of Isaak Abrahamsz. Massa is mentioned in the 1822 Bibliotheca Spenceriana as hanging in one of the bedrooms at Althorp. It was sold in 1924 to art merchant Joseph Duveen, who sold it the following year to Canadian businessman Frank P. Wood.|$|E

It consists of a kitchen, several bedrooms and an office, also accessed from a central corridor. <b>The</b> corridor and <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west have flagstone floors, while <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east have timber floors. <b>The</b> western <b>rooms</b> have been extensively refurbished, while <b>the</b> eastern <b>rooms</b> retain their timber boarded and pressed metal ceilings.|$|R

25|$|In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland, Lucy (called Lucia) is venerated on 13 December in a {{ceremony}} where a girl is elected to portray Lucia. Wearing a white gown with a red sash and a crown of candles on her head, she walks {{at the head of}} a procession of women, each holding a candle. The candles symbolize the fire that refused to take St. Lucy's life when she was sentenced to be burned. The women sing a Lucia song while entering <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> melody of the traditional Neapolitan song Santa Lucia; the Italian lyrics describe the view from Santa Lucia in Naples, the various Scandinavian lyrics are fashioned for the occasion, describing the light with which Lucia overcomes the darkness. Each Scandinavian country has lyrics in their native tongues. After finishing this song, the procession sings Christmas carols or more songs about Lucia.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{rule over}} {{northern}} and central India {{brought with it}} the use of domes constructed with stone, brick and mortar, and iron dowels and cramps. Centering was made from timber and bamboo. The use of iron cramps to join together adjacent stones was known in pre-Islamic India, and was used {{at the base of}} domes for hoop reinforcement. The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the Hindu tradition of trabeate construction created a distinctive architecture. Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition from the corners of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dome, rather than squinches. In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous.|$|E

It also contains a set of five paintings of Tabley by Anthony Devis. [...] The ceiling has Rococo plasterwork by Oliver. [...] This room leads to the Dining Room on the north side of the house, which contains paintings of the Leicester family. [...] These include 3rdLord Tabley by Frank Holl, Colonel Sir John Leicester, Bart., and the King's Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry exercising on the Sands at Liverpool by George Jones, Portrait of 2ndLorddeTabley by Margaret Carpenter, a full-length Portrait of 2nd Lord de Tabley as Colonel Commandant of the Earl of Chester's Yeomanry Cavalry by Francis Grant, Hilda, Mrs Cuthbert Leicester Warren by Simon Elwes, Lt. Colonel John Leicester Warren by Graham Rust, and Margaret Leicester Warren by Philip de László. [...] Also in the room is Extensive Picturesque Landscape, with Gypsies by Francis Bourgeois and, over the sideboard, is the Portrait of the Prince Regent, later George IV by Thomas Lawrence and his studio.

500|$|The {{upper floor}} rooms display more artistic and {{precious}} objects. In {{the main hall}} are two architectural models of the Grand Palace, the first representing the Grand Palace {{during the reign of}} King Rama I, and another in the reign of King Rama V. Behind these are numerous Buddha images and commemorative coins. In the doorway leading to the main hall is a small mother-of-pearl seating platform known as Phra Thaen Song Sabai (พระแท่นทรงสบาย), which was once located in the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall. The platform was used for informal audiences and dates from the time of King Rama I. [...] At the end of the main hall stands the Phra Thaen Manangsila Throne (พระแท่นมนังคศิลาอาสน์; [...] ), which is believed to date to the Sukhothai Kingdom and was brought back to Bangkok, from Sukhothai, by King Rama IV, when he was still a monk. Against the walls {{on either side of the}} hall are four different Buddha images of Javanese style; they were purchased by King Rama V. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right of the Manangsila Throne displays the various seasonal robes of the Emerald Buddha. To the left of the main hall is an lacquer ware screen depicting the crowning of Shiva, king of the gods. The screen was formerly kept in the Phra Thinang Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat; it was saved from the fire apparently by the hands of King Rama I himself. The rest of the upper floor displays various objets d′art (such as a model of Mount Kailasa) and more Buddha images.|$|E

2500|$|Page {{reportedly}} used natural room ambience {{to enhance}} the reverb and recording texture on the record, demonstrating the innovations in sound recording he had learned during his session days. Up until the late 1960s, most music producers placed microphones {{directly in front of}} the amplifiers and drums. For Led Zeppelin, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as far as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two.
