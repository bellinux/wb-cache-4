5|$|At 20:15, {{the camp}} was secured from the Japanese and Prince fired his flare to signal {{the end of the}} assault. No gunfire had {{occurred}} for the last fifteen minutes. However, as the Rangers headed towards the meetup, Cpl. Roy Sweezy was shot twice by friendly fire, and later died. The Rangers and <b>the</b> <b>weary,</b> frail, and disease-ridden POWs {{made their way to the}} appointed Pampanga River rendezvous, where a caravan of 26carabao carts waited to transport them to Plateros, driven by local villagers organized by Pajota. At 20:40, once Prince determined that everyone had crossed the Pampanga River, he fired his second flare to indicate to Pajota and Joson's men to withdraw. The Scouts stayed behind at the meetup to survey the area for enemy retaliatory movements. Meanwhile, Pajota's men continued to resist the attacking enemy until they could finally withdraw at 22:00, when the Japanese forces stopped charging the bridge. Joson and his men met no opposition, and they returned to help escort the POWs.|$|E
5|$|Twilight {{finds herself}} in the long-forgotten crystal caves beneath Canterlot. An image of Cadance appears and taunts her, {{explaining}} that the marriage will continue without Twilight's interference. Using her magic to shatter a crystal wall, Twilight finds another Cadance waiting there, but the mare is bruised and battered. Twilight attacks her, but <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> alicorn proves {{that she is the}} real Cadance by demonstrating their shared rhyme from their youth. Cadance explains she was abducted by the impostor in the castle to marry Shining Armor herself. The two then work together to escape the caves and try to stop the wedding. Meanwhile, the fake Cadance revels in her victory, secretly plotting against Shining Armor and the others ("This Day Aria").|$|E

5|$|As the Nameless officially do not exist, {{the upper}} echelons of the Gallian Army exploit {{the concept of}} {{plausible}} deniability in order to send them on missions that would otherwise make Gallia lose face in the war. While at times this works to their advantage, such as a successful incursion into Imperial territory, other orders cause certain members of the 422nd great distress. One such member, Gusurg, becomes so enraged that he abandons his post and defects {{into the ranks of}} Calamity Raven, attached to the ideal of Darcsen independence proposed by their leader, Dahau. At the same time, elements within Gallian Army Command move to erase the Nameless in order to protect their own interests. Hounded by both allies and enemies, and combined with the presence of a traitor within their ranks, the 422nd desperately move to keep themselves alive {{while at the same time}} fight to help the Gallian war effort. This continues until the Nameless's commanding officer, Ramsey Crowe, who had been kept under house arrest, is escorted to the capital city of Randgriz in order to present evidence exonerating <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> soldiers and expose the real traitor, the Gallian General that had accused Kurt of Treason.|$|E
25|$|Brown and Bedser {{deserved}} {{at least}} two day's rest – but the whole English side {{was in and out}} while the sun was still shining. One of the saddest sights I have seen on a cricket field was <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> Bedser trudging out to bat less than two hours after his marathon bowling effort...Bailey batted one handed and Wright did not bat. It was a sickening blow for the Englishmen, to lose by an innings after such heroic efforts by the bowlers, but Iverson was just too good.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan was}} to make a three-day dash to Johannesburg before the Boer commandos could mobilise, and once there, trigger an {{uprising}} by the primarily British expatriate workers (uitlanders) organised by the Reform Committee. However, the Transvaal authorities had advance warning of the Jameson Raid and tracked it from the moment it crossed the border. Four days later, <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> and dispirited column was surrounded near Krugersdorp within sight of Johannesburg. After a brief skirmish in which the column lost 65 killed and wounded—while the Boers lost but one man—Jameson's men surrendered and were arrested by the Boers.|$|E

25|$|The {{defenders}} of Biazza Ridge managed to capture two 75-mm pack howitzers, which they turned into direct fire weapons {{to defend the}} ridge. One managed to knock {{out one of the}} attacking Tiger tanks. By early evening, the situation had turned grim when six American M4 Sherman tanks suddenly appeared, eliciting cheers from <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> paratroopers, who had been joined by others, including some airborne engineers, infantry, clerks, cooks and truck drivers. With this scratch force and the Shermans, Gavin counterattacked and in so doing deterred the Germans from pressing their considerable advantage. The battle ended with the Americans still in control of Biazza Ridge. For his feats of valor that day, Colonel Gavin was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
25|$|Anthony Thistlethwaite was an {{original}} {{member of the}} band, and remained a member until 1991 when the band broke up, although he also joined a few recording sessions for A Rock in <b>the</b> <b>Weary</b> Land. After Scott and Wickham, Thistlethwaite has more songwriting credits than any other Waterboy. His saxophone, regularly featured in solos, was {{one half of the}} early group's distinctive brass section, but he has also played guitar, keyboards {{and a number of other}} instruments for the band. He pressed to return The Waterboys to a rock music sound after Room to Roam, but did not appear on Dream Harder, the result of that decision. He is now a member of The Saw Doctors, and has also released three solo albums.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in {{classical}} Antiquity, the warships of the 6th century did not feature rams; naval combat was therefore dominated by missile exchanges and boarding actions. In {{this form of}} combat, experience {{and the ability to}} maintain a formation of ships was essential, and the Byzantine crews held the advantage over the inexperienced Goths. Soon, in the heat of battle, some Gothic ships drifted off the main body and were easily destroyed, while others sailed too close together and were unable to maneuver. In the end, <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> Gothic fleet disintegrated and their ships fled as best as they could. They lost 36 ships, and Gibal was captured, while Indulf with the remainder fled towards Ancona. As soon as he came close to the Gothic army's camp, he beached his ships and set them on fire.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the attack}} {{the storm had}} {{continued}} and the rain had poured down, {{so that it was}} no small comfort to <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> soldiers when Jean Francois pointed out to them the storehouse, where they all obtained dry clothes, and where a ration of bread and wine with lard and pork was served out to each of them. Most of the food stores were looted by the soldiers. Menéndez found five or six thousand ducats' worth of silver, largely ore, part of it brought by the Indians from the Appalachian Mountains, and part collected by Laudonnière from Outina, from whom he had also obtained some gold and pearls. Most of the artillery and ammunition brought over by Ribault had not been landed, and as Laudonnière had traded his with Hawkins for the ship, little was captured.|$|E
25|$|The first {{transaction}} {{took place}} at the agreed-upon time of 04:00. Three prisoners were let aboard the aircraft and 30 passengers were let out. The final three prisoners were let aboard at 04:05. However, the remaining passengers were kept on board and instead the hijackers demanded that the aircraft be fueled before any more releases. This was accepted by Geijer at 04:08. The situation was not well received by the cabinet. Also, the six new prisoners were able to take over command of the situation on the aircraft, replacing <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> hijackers. Refueling {{took place at}} 04:48. They then demanded one million Swedish krona to release further hostages. Negotiations followed, whereby the police argued that acquiring such amounts of cash would be difficult {{in the middle of the}} night, and the hijackers reduced their demand to half a million. The police further argued that a rested flight crew would be at the advantage of the hijackers.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} fatigue started {{affecting}} the King Porus, he {{slowly began to}} retire. Throughout the battle, Alexander {{is said to have}} observed with growing admiration, the valor of King Porus and understood that he intended to be killed in combat. Hoping {{to save the life of}} this competent leader and warrior, Alexander commanded Taxiles to summon Porus for surrender. However, Porus turned indignant on the very sight of his nemesis and tossed a spear at him in furor without listening to his proposal forcing him to take flight on his steed. In such manner many other messengers, dispatched by the determined Alexander were spurned, till at last Meroes, a personal friend of Porus convinced him to listen to the message of Alexander. Overpowered by thirst, <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> Porus finally dismounted his War-Elephant and demanded water. After being refreshed, he allowed himself to be taken to Alexander. On hearing that the Indian King was approaching, Alexander himself rode out to meet him and the famous surrender meeting took place.|$|E

25|$|Once {{across the}} Snake River ford near Old Fort Boise <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> {{travelers}} traveled across {{what would become}} the state of Oregon. The trail then went to the Malheur River and then past Farewell Bend on the Snake River, up the Burnt River canyon and northwest to the Grande Ronde Valley near present-day La Grande before coming to the Blue Mountains. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable {{for the first time to}} wagons. The trail went to the Whitman Mission near Fort Nez Perces in Washington until 1847 when the Whitmans were killed by Native Americans. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats and started down the Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached The Dalles. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present day Pendleton, Oregon, crossing the Umatilla River, John Day River, and Deschutes River before arriving at The Dalles. Interstate 84 in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Anthony Boucher {{wrote that}} the book belongs [...] "pretty much to the private-eye school" [...] of fiction.

But then he decides to pad out the book to novel length and leads <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> reader {{through a set of}} tough clichés to an ending which surprises nobody save Operative 007. You should certainly begin this book; but you might as well stop when the baccarat game is over." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{critic of}} the Beatles' output {{immediately}} post-Sgt.

Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot considered it to be [...] "one of [...] least-memorable Beatles tracks … a song essentially about boredom – and it sounds like it". Similarly unimpressed with Magical Mystery Tour, Tim Riley describes [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] as a song that [...] "goes nowhere tiresomely", with a vocal that [...] "sounds as tired and droning" [...] as the musical accompaniment.|$|E
500|$|The deeper {{waters of}} the Tennessee River allowed the Timberlake {{expedition}} to proceed much more quickly. A hunting party led by the Cherokee chief Slave Catcher met the Timberlake expedition {{near the mouth of}} the Little Tennessee River, and supplied <b>the</b> <b>weary</b> expedition with provisions of [...] "dried venison, homminy, and boiled corn." [...] The following day, Slave Catcher guided the expedition by canoe up the Little Tennessee, although the Timberlake party struggled to keep up. Timberlake recalled, [...] "my hands were so galled, that the blood trickled from them, and when we set out the next morning I was scarce able to handle a pole." [...] The Timberlake party arrived in the Overhill town of Tomotley on December 20, where they were greeted by the town's head man, Chief Ostenaco.|$|E
