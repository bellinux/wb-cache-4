5|$|The {{police were}} {{satisfied}} with the new story, and both <b>The</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Journal and <b>The</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Georgian gave the story front-page coverage.

The police placed little credence in the officials' theory, but had no explanation for the failure to locate Phagan's purse that other witnesses had testified she carried that day. They were also concerned that Conley did not mention that he was aware a crime had been committed when he wrote the notes, suggesting Frank had simply dictated the notes to Conley arbitrarily. To resolve their doubts, the police attempted on May 28 to arrange a confrontation between Frank and Conley. Frank exercised his right not to meet without his attorney, who was out of town. The police were quoted in <b>The</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Constitution saying that this refusal was an indication of Frank's guilt, and the meeting never took place.|$|E
