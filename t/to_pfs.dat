30|$|On {{the other}} hand the above {{calculated}} sample size only gives a power of 0.32 to detect an effect of helminth infection on antibody response to sexual or asexual stage antigens. Therefore we run an additional sample size calculation {{that was based on}} data gathered from an immuno epidemiological study conducted in a setting similar to our study site. From this study it appears that gametocyte antigens usually elicit a weaker antibody response than asexual stage antigens and that the percentage of IgG responders <b>to</b> <b>Pfs</b> 48 / 45 and Pfs 230 was around 22 to 28 % (Ouédraogo et al. 2011). Given the fact that we did not have data comparing antibody response specific <b>to</b> <b>Pfs</b> 48 / 45 and Pfs 230 between schistosoma infected and uninfected subjects, we hypothesize that helminth infection will lead to a maximum twofold change in antibody response <b>to</b> <b>Pfs</b> 48 / 45 and Pfs 230. Considering this we calculated that a sample size of 63 subjects per group (power[*]=[*] 0.90 and p[*]=[*] 0.05) would be adequate to answer our research question. Based on the literature it antibody response to sexual or asexual stage antigens may vary according to the age of the subjects. Hence as our study will include both children and adult our final sample size will be of 126 subjects per group.|$|E

The goal {{of this study was}} to examine differences in propofol requirements and emergence time between propofol-ketamine and propofol-fentanyl combinations in patients undergoing curettage. A single-blind randomized controlled trial study was performed on 60 patients who underwent curettage procedures. The patients were divided into two groups: propofol-ketamine (PK) and propofol-fentanyl (PF). Blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate, and oxygen saturation and BIS data were analysed using a t-test and Mann-Whitney test. This study showed that propofol requirements differ significantly (p< 0. 001) between the two groups where in PK group where 4 / 30 subjects received additional propofol, compared <b>to</b> <b>PF</b> group 14 / 30 subjects received additional propofol.

40|$|Immunity to {{the sexual}} stages of Plasmodium falciparum can be induced during natural infections. Characterization of this {{immunity}} may facilitate {{the design of a}} transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV). This study aimed to assess the prevalence and serological correlates of functional transmission-blocking immunity in Gambian children (aged 1 - 4 years old) who were P. falciparum gametocyte carriers. Serological assays showed 100 % response to fixed, whole parasites but only 42 % to live gametes. Responses to the antigens Pfs 230 and Pfs 48 / 45 were 54. 1 % and 37. 3 %, respectively, in an IgG 1 ELISA. 14 / 55 sera were capable of reducing the infectivity of laboratory isolate NF 54 in a standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA). This activity was strongly correlated with IgG 1 responses <b>to</b> <b>Pfs</b> 48 / 45 (r = 0. 49, P < 0. 001) and to a serological reaction with epitopes of the same molecule (r = 0. 38, P = 0. 003). A weaker correlation was observed with IgG 1 <b>to</b> <b>Pfs</b> 230 (r = 0. 29, P = 0. 03). In direct membrane feeding assays (DMFA) with autologous isolates, sera from 4 / 29 children showed transmission-blocking activity. There was no correlation with serological assays and the DMFA or between the SMFA and DMFA. This may be caused by variation in sexual stage antigens and/or alternative modes of transmission-blocking immunity, both of which have implications for vaccine implementation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the associations between quantitative (18) [*]F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) uptake metrics, optimal debulking (OD) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer undergoing secondary cytoreductive surgery. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with recurrent ovarian cancer underwent FDG-PET/CT within 90  days prior to surgery. Standardized uptake values (SUVmax), metabolically active tumour volumes (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were measured on PET. Exact logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test {{were used to assess}} associations between imaging metrics, OD and PFS. RESULTS: MTV (p[*]=[*] 0. 0025) and TLG (p[*]=[*] 0. 0043) were associated with OD; however, there was no significant association between SUVmax and debulking status (p[*]=[*] 0. 83). Patients with an MTV above 7. 52  mL and/or a TLG above 35. 94  g had significantly shorter PFS (p[*]=[*] 0. 0191 for MTV and p[*]=[*] 0. 0069 for TLG). SUVmax was not significantly related <b>to</b> <b>PFS</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 10). PFS estimates at 3. 5  years after surgery were 0. 42 for patients with an MTV[*]≤[*] 7. 52  mL and 0. 19 for patients with an MTV[*]>[*] 7. 52  mL; 0. 46 for patients with a TLG[*]≤[*] 35. 94  g and 0. 15 for patients with a TLG[*]>[*] 35. 94  g. CONCLUSION: FDG-PET metrics that reflect metabolic tumour burden are associated with optimal secondary cytoreductive surgery and progression-free survival in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. KEY POINTS: Both TLG and MTV were associated with optimal tumour debulking. There was no significant association between SUVmax and tumour debulking status. Patients with higher MTV and/or TLG had significantly shorter PFS. SUVmax was not significantly related <b>to</b> <b>PFS...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Most small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients relapse or progress and have low survival rate {{although they have}} significant response to initial chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This study intends to explore the factors affecting the relapse (or progression) of nonoperative SCLC and to explore the correlations between progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods Clinical data of 182 patients diagnosed with SCLC between January 2009 and December 2011 at Shanghai Chest Hospital has been reviewed and retrospectively analyzed. All of these patients accepted chemotherapy combined (or not combined) with radiotherapy, and relapsed or progressed after first-line therapy. Univariate Kaplan-Meier survival estimates as well as multivariate Cox regression survival analysis were used to locate the potential factors affecting PFS. The correlation between PFS and OS was analyzed via Bivariate Correlation Analysis method. Results The univariate estimates showed that the TNM stage, liver metastasis or not, brain metastasis or not, first-line chemotherapy cycles, effect of initial chemotherapy, and thoracic radiotherapy combined or not were the significant contributive factors <b>to</b> <b>PFS.</b> In the subgroup of the patients without brain metastases, those received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) had longer PFS. Cox regression indicated that the three independent variables of first-line chemotherapy cycles, effect of initial chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy combined or not were closely related <b>to</b> <b>PFS.</b> In addition, significant positive correlation between PFS and OS had been observed. Conclusion PFS could be prolonged by having more first-line chemotherapy cycles (> 4 cycles), obtaining better effect of initial chemotherapy (partial response or complete response), combining with thoracic radiotherapy and implementing PCI for patients without brain metastasis...|$|E
