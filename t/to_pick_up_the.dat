5|$|Screening for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 testing is required <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.|$|E
