40|$|This paper investigates {{impressions}} of <b>approach</b> <b>motions</b> of a mobile robot based on psychophysiological analysis. In {{one of our}} previous studies, we suggested that actuation noise caused by the robots tended to raise the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response of heart rate variability. In another experiment {{it was observed that}} blocking out either the sound or the sight of the robot motion attenuated the electrodermal activity (EDA), which reflects the SNS. From these investigations, one candidate for motion rules for human-friendly robots was deduced such that robots must reduce their motion speed in the immediate vicinity of human. To confirm validity of the motion rule, we constructed an experimental setup with a mobile robot approaching humans at several speeds, and investigated the human impressions by means of psychophysiological methods. The experimental results showed that robot motion adjacent to humans tended to increase EDA responses. We found especially that the <b>approach</b> <b>motion</b> tented to give stronger stimuli to humans than motions at a distance. The faster <b>approach</b> <b>motion</b> tended to increase EDA responses, but there was no significant statistical difference from the response to slower <b>approach</b> <b>motion.</b> From factor analysis of the subjective ratings two factors were extracted, which were interpreted as "relief of mind" and "observation on motion...|$|R

40|$|Are objects {{moving in}} depth searched for efficiently? Previous studies have {{reported}} conflicting results, with some finding efficient search for only <b>approaching</b> <b>motion</b> (Franconeri & Simons, 2003), and others reporting that both <b>approaching</b> and receding <b>motion</b> are found more efficiently than static targets (Skarratt, Cole, & Gellatly, 2009). This {{may be due to}} presentation protocol differences and a confounding variable. We systematically tested the effect of the motion-in-depth presentation method and the effect of a confounding unique depth singleton on search performance. Simulating motion in depth using size scaling, changing binocular disparity, or a calibrated combination of these two depth cues, we found that search performance was affected by presentation method and that a combination of size scaling and changing disparity gives rise to the most compelling motion-in-depth perception. Exploiting this finding in Experiment 2, we found that removing the depth singleton does not affect motion-in-depth search performance. Overall, we found that search is more efficient for targets moving in depth than static targets. <b>Approaching</b> and receding <b>motion</b> had an equal advantage over static targets in target selection, shown through shallower search slopes. However, <b>approaching</b> <b>motion</b> had lower intercepts, consistent with an advantage over receding motion in later stages of processing associated with target identification and response...|$|R

40|$|A key {{survival}} {{strategy of}} animals is the detection and adaptive response to rapidly approaching danger. Accordingly, behavioral experiments {{have shown that}} animals have a bias towards <b>approaching</b> <b>motion</b> signals as opposed to receding signals in both the visual [e. g., Schiff et al., 1962 Science 136 : 982] and auditory [e. g., Ghazanfar et al., 2002 PNAS 99 : 15755] domain. In the auditory domain, primates (including humans) appear to detect <b>approaching</b> <b>motion</b> using dynamic intensity cues. Dynamic intensity can also give information about behaviorally-relevant variables such as the time-to-contact of approaching sound sources, independent of absolute intensity. In the present study, we investigated the representation of looming and receding sounds in rhesus monkey auditory cortex. We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity in the auditory cortex of an awake, behaving monkey while the subject was presented with amplitude modulated complex tones either unimodally or in combination with visual motion-in-depth signals. Auditory stimuli were rising and falling intensity complex tones, 1, 2 or 4 seconds in duration, simulating sound sources moving in depth at a constant velocity. Visual stimuli were expanding/contracting black disks. We independently varied strength and speed of the simulated source. Preliminary spectral analysis of LFP data shows a bigger sustained increase in gamma band (30 - 50 Hz) activity in response to rising intensity sounds compared to falling intensity sounds in 10 out of 19 cortical sites. This response is not triggered by the stimulus reaching an absolute intensity threshold. Because of the close link between auditory intensity and distance, and the behavioral relevance for detecting <b>approaching</b> <b>motion,</b> we hypothesize that dynamic auditory intensity is encoded as dynamic distance for the following reasons: 1) responses were biased towards rising intensity, in parallel with known behavioral biases; 2) responses were independent of absolute intensity; and 3) responses were enhanced when auditory stimuli were paired with congruent but not incongruent visual motion-in-depth signals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The pel-recursive <b>approach</b> to <b>motion</b> {{estimation}} {{has been}} widely studied for compensating progressively scanned, moderate-resolution video. Although pel-recursive algorithms may not be suitable for application to interlaced high-definition television (HDTV), the underlying principle of backward motion compensation, upon which pel-recursive algorithms are based, can be exploited to improve xisting motion compensation algorithms. This paper proposes applying a backward <b>approach</b> to <b>motion</b> compensation to improve the performance of standard block-based algorithms for motion-compensated interlaced HDTV sequences. First, we describe a framework for motion compensation i which motion information is parameterized by a motion operator and a domain for that operator. Within this framework, we characterize the type of motion information represented by forward (e. g. block-based) and backward <b>approaches</b> to <b>motion</b> compensation. We propose a method for combining these two sources of motion information to form an optimal motion-compensated prediction. Simulations on two interlaced HDTV sequences demonstrate p rformance improvements between 1 and 2 dB over standard block-based methods...|$|R
