2500|$|The US and Canadian {{version of}} the Chevrolet Cruze entered limited {{production}} at Lordstown, Ohio, in July 2010 as a 2011 model, replacing the Chevrolet Cobalt. Full production began September 8, 2010. For these markets, the Cruze utilizes a more advanced Watts Z-link rear suspension from the Opel Astra (J). Offered in LS, LT, LTZ, and Eco trim lines, both the 1.8-liter and the turbocharged 1.4-liter engines are offered, coupled with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. With a starting price slightly higher than most compact competitors, the base model Cruze LS is equipped with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine and comes with air-conditioning and power locks, the higher-level LT and LTZ models is fitted with the 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine. For the Eco model, aerodynamic improvements have been made such as an electronically controlled air shutter that adjusts air flow to the engine depending on the temperature, wind speed and tow weight. To save weight, Chevrolet replaces the space saving spare tire and jack on the Eco model with a <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> kit, reducing weight by [...]|$|E
50|$|If a canned <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> {{is used on}} a tire {{mounted on}} a wheel with chrome plating, then it is very {{important}} to thoroughly clean the entire wheel and the inside of the tire in order to prevent Chrome Peel.|$|E
50|$|In newer cars, {{the socket}} is {{equipped}} with a plastic cover without the lighter heating element, due to declining popularity of smoking. However, the socket has been repurposed and continues to be used to power consumer electronics in vehicles. Often, a vehicle may come with several outlets for convenience, some in the rear passenger area of the vehicle or even the cargo area, for such purposes as powering portable GPS devices, recharging mobile phones, or powering a <b>tire</b> <b>inflator,</b> a vacuum cleaner or a thermoelectric cooler. These outlets usually have a plastic cap tethered to them, and are usually labeled as being only for DC power, because they are not intended to withstand the heat produced by an electrical cigarette lighter.|$|E

50|$|The biggest {{complaint}} by tire professionals regarding <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> {{is around}} removing the sealant {{from inside the}} tire. They {{believe that it is}} a difficult, time-involved process that may damage the tire. Some brands like Fix-A-Flat offer a water-soluble formulation that allows the product to be removed quickly and easily with a towel and water.|$|R
50|$|Canned <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> are {{single-use}} devices {{intended to}} provide a quick, temporary solution to drivers who experience flat tires. These devices seal the punctured tire and then reinflate it with pressurized gas, providing enough pressure to allow the vehicle to be driven {{for a short period}} at low speed. This allows the motorist to have the damaged tire professionally repaired or replaced, avoiding the need to replace the wheel at the roadside.|$|R
50|$|ChromeSkull {{prepares to}} kill Princess, {{but he is}} out of tapes for his camera, so he coerces her into going into the store to get one. The clerk sees the {{threatening}} messages ChromeSkull is sending Princess through a cellphone, goes out to confront him, and has his head blown off when ChromeSkull turns his own shotgun on him. A customer goes to lock the backdoor, and is decapitated by ChromeSkull. Tucker and Steven reach the store, grab ChromeSkull's suitcase on the way in, and replace the glue he uses to keep his mask on with Cyanoacrylate. ChromeSkull cuts the power, and causes Steven's face to explode by injecting canned <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> into his ear. Tucker is stabbed while trying to give Princess enough time to escape with Tommy, the murdered customer's friend.|$|E

40|$|Motor vehicle {{accidents}} {{are one of}} the main killers on the road. Modern vehicles have several safety features to improve the stability and controllability. The tire condition is critical to the proper function of the designed safety features. Under or over inflated tires adversely affects the stability of vehicles. It is generally the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s user responsibility to ensure the tire inflation pressure is set and maintained to the required value using a <b>tire</b> <b>inflator.</b> In the <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> operation, the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s user sets the desired value and the machine has to complete the task. During the inflation process, the pressure sensor does not read instantaneous static pressure to ensure the target value is reached. Hence, the inflator is designed to stop repetitively for pressure reading and avoid over inflation. This makes the inflation process slow, especially for large tires. This paper presents a novel approach using artificial neural network based technique to identify the tire size. Once the tire size is correctly identified, an optimized inflation cycle can be computed to improve performance, speed and accuracy of the inflation process. The developed neural network model was successfully simulated and tested for predicting tire size from the given sets of input parameters. The test results are analyzed and discussed in this paper...|$|E
50|$|Also {{for safety}} reasons, the US National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration has {{mandated}} that all 2008 vehicles {{sold in the}} US and manufactured on or after September 1, 2007 must be equipped with tire pressure monitoring systems. Because many of these sensors are inside the tire, there was a concern {{about whether or not}} canned <b>tire</b> <b>inflators</b> and sealants would affect the sensors’ ability to correctly operate. Manufacturers have been working on finding solutions to this new legislation.|$|R
50|$|The gas {{used in some}} inflators {{contains}} butane {{which is}} flammable and which may explode if exposed to high temperatures (either when in the can or in a re-inflated <b>tire).</b> Other <b>inflators</b> use a non-flammable formulation instead.|$|R

Items removed include air conditioning, the stereo system, rear seats, trunk floorboard and carpet, backup camera and emergency <b>tire</b> sealer and <b>inflator.</b> Exhaust resonators also have been removed for weight savings {{with the benefit of}} creating a sharper exhaust tone.|$|R
40|$|Tire {{industry}} {{has become one}} of the huge industries at present since the number of vehicles are rapidly increasing. Since the tire directly related to the vehicle safety, durability, running cost and comfort level of the passengers tire selection and maintenance addressed widely. Maintaining a tire is a duty of the vehicle user and he may has to check the tire rapidly for wear, cuts and other irregularities. The most important activity of tire maintenance is to maintain the pressure of the tire. The tire pressure is an important issue since it directly relates to the safety of the vehicle, durability, running cost and comfort level of the passengers as mentioned above. A rapid check for tire pressure is essential since tire pressure may reduce normally with the time apart from losing pressure when the tire drives over a pothole or hump. Checking the tire is done using a machine called <b>tire</b> <b>inflator.</b> This machine must be accurate and user friendly since the operator has to trust on it. Tire inflators are available mostly in tire shops and in gas stations. Tire inflators are mainly two types, Analog tire inflators and Digital tire inflators. Digital tire inflators arrived the market recently and analog tire inflators are getting replaced with digital tire inflators as the convenience of operation. Digital tire inflators read the pressure with a pressure sensor and with this sensor the dynamic pressure readings are not possible. Hence to get the static pressure the inflation process has to be stopped. In other words, while in the inflation, the <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> has no idea about the tire pressure until the inflation stops. In this case, to have an idea about the rise of pressure, there must be a method to identify the type of the tire. The tire identification mechanism must be fast, accurate and reliable. The other requirement is that the tire has to be identified online and this process must not delay the inflation process. The main tusk of this exercise is to develop an artificial neural network based tire identification method. A developed <b>tire</b> <b>inflator</b> model was used to collect information and to test the tire identification process. To develop the network, three inputs were considered. By expanding the number of layers in the network experiment was carried out. The results were successful and that the network with two hidden layers zero percent error achieved...|$|E
5000|$|For example, the [...] "Regina Valve" [...] is a valve {{very much}} {{similar to the}} Presta and mostly being used in Italy. Invisible tire valves are {{different}} in design from traditional <b>tire</b> valves. An <b>inflator</b> stem is not used; instead, a removable cap on a valve stem embedded in the tire rim is fitted, with only the cap visible. When inflating the tire, the cap is first removed, typically with a coin, and then a [...] "portable" [...] dedicated inflator stem is screwed onto the valve stem. Through the <b>inflator</b> the <b>tire</b> is inflated as usual.|$|R
