This paper studies the partial <b>F</b> <b>tests</b> from the view point of simultaneous confidence bands.

This view point of confidence bands also leads to insights of the major weakness of the partial <b>F</b> <b>tests,</b> that is, a partial <b>F</b> <b>test</b> requires implicitly that the linear regression model holds over the entire range of the covariates in concern. Improved tests are proposed and they are induced by simultaneous confidence bands over restricted regions of the covariates. Power comparisons between the partial <b>F</b> <b>tests</b> and the new tests have been carried out to assess when the new tests are more or less powerful than the partial <b>F</b> <b>tests.</b> Computer programmes have been developed for easy implements of these new confidence band based inferential methods.
