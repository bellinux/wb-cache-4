5|$|While at Hall-Place, Smart {{was sent}} to the local Maidstone Grammar School where he was taught by Charles Walwyn, a scholar from Eton College who had {{received}} an MA from King's College, Cambridge in 1696. It was here <b>that</b> <b>Smart</b> received an intensive education in Latin and Greek. He did not complete his education at Maidstone however, as his father died on 3 February 1733, and his mother took Smart and his siblings to live near relatives in Durham after selling off {{a large portion of the}} estate to pay off Peter Smart's debts.|$|E
5|$|In July 1996, Firaxis {{began work}} on Alpha Centauri, with Reynolds heading the project. Meier and Reynolds wrote playable {{prototype}} code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development libraries. Because the development of Gettysburg took up most of Firaxis' time, the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas. By late 1996, the developers were playing games on the prototype, and {{by the middle of}} the next year, they were working on a multiplayer engine. Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games, an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single-player mode because they believed that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way. Reynolds felt <b>that</b> <b>smart</b> computer opponents are an integral part of a classic computer game, and considered it a challenge to make them so. Reynolds' previous games omitted internet support because he believed that complex turn-based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online.|$|E

25|$|In 1937 Smart {{took a job}} as {{secretary}} to the noted Mrs. Alfred Watt, head of the Associated Country Women of the World, an international organization for rural women, travelling extensively throughout the world accompanying Watt to various conferences.

She also suggested publicly that Ricci's girlfriend was involved in the cover-up of his alleged crime. Grace continued to accuse Ricci, though he died while in custody.

25|$|Smart cards, often colloquially {{referred}} to as “chip cards” were {{designed to provide a}} more secure financial transaction than a traditional credit card. They contain simple embedded integrated circuits designed to performed cryptographic functions. They connect directly to a card reader which provides the power necessary to perform an encrypted financial transaction. Many side-channel attacks {{have been shown to be}} effective against smart cards because they obtain their power supply and clock directly from the card reader. By tampering with a card reader, it is simple to collect traces and perform side-channel attacks. Other works, however, have also shown <b>that</b> <b>smart</b> cards are vulnerable to electromagnetic attacks as well.|$|E
25|$|Some smart TV {{platforms}} {{also support}} interactive advertising, addressable advertising with local advertising insertion and targeted advertising, and other advanced advertising {{features such as}} ad telescoping using VOD and DVR, enhanced TV for consumer call-to-action and audience measurement solutions for ad campaign effectiveness. The marketing and trading possibilities offered by Smart TVs are sometimes summarized by the term t-commerce. Taken together, this bidirectional data flow means <b>that</b> <b>smart</b> TVs can be and are used for clandestine observation of the owners. Even in sets that are not configured off-the-shelf to do so, default security measures are often weak and will allow hackers to easily break into the TV.|$|E
25|$|He {{believed}} that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether {{within the same}} corporation or in others. Ford also {{believed that}} union leaders had a perverse incentive to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis {{as a way to}} maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed <b>that</b> <b>smart</b> managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.|$|E

5|$|Late 18th-century critics felt <b>that</b> <b>Smart's</b> madness {{justified}} them in {{ignoring his}} A Song to David, {{but during the}} following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition {{to be the source}} of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), <b>that</b> critics reconsidered <b>Smart's</b> case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|R

500|$|Beyond Smart's {{circle of}} friends, few {{were willing to}} dismiss claims <b>that</b> <b>Smart</b> was {{affected}} by madness. Most contemporary literary critics knew of Smart's time in asylum and, upon publication of his A Song to David, called attention to aspects of the poem which they could use to claim <b>that</b> <b>Smart</b> was still [...] "mad". The view was widely held, and the poet William Mason wrote to Thomas Gray, [...] "I have seen his Song to David & from thence conclude him as mad as ever." ...|$|E

They even go as far as to claim that other studies have found <b>that</b> “being much <b>smarter</b> than your subordinates can actually hinder effective leadership” due to the level of communication between the leaders and followers.|$|R

500|$|During Smart's {{confinement}} at St Luke's, {{not even}} other doctors {{were allowed to}} see Smart unless they had received personal permission from Battie. It was improbable <b>that</b> <b>Smart</b> could have left the asylum without being released by Battie. Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means, the rules for subpoenaing release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that Battie had in place, which isolated the individual from all contact. Eventually, Smart was deemed [...] "incurable" [...] {{and would not have}} been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds.|$|E
500|$|The English poet Christopher Smart (1722–1771) was {{confined}} to mental asylums from May 1757 until January 1763. Smart was admitted into St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics, Upper Moorfields, London, on 6 May 1757. He was taken there by his father-in-law, John Newbery, although {{he may have been}} confined in a private madhouse before then. While in St Luke's he wrote Jubilate Agno and A Song to David, the poems considered to be his greatest works. Although many of his contemporaries agreed <b>that</b> <b>Smart</b> was [...] "mad", accounts of his condition and its ramifications varied, and some felt that he had been committed unfairly.|$|E
30|$|The {{interview}} findings {{revealed that}} the participants were amazed <b>that</b> the <b>smart</b> school bag could actually speak and provide interactive responses and reminders to users.

The users suggested that a reminder service could be provided for other objects apart from books, including water bottles, lunch boxes and sportswear. According {{to the results of}} the quantitative questionnaire, all of the students and 90 % of their guardians believed <b>that</b> the <b>smart</b> school bag helped them to avoid forgetting the objects they needed to take to school. All of the students and guardians agreed <b>that</b> the <b>smart</b> bag helped the students to get into the habit of tidying up their school bags and reduced the weight of them. More than 30 % of the guardians worried that the use of smart school bag might reduce students' personal management ability if they relied too much on the technology.|$|R

500|$|Few {{details are}} known about Smart's time at St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics. He was {{admitted}} to St Luke's on 6 May 1757 as a [...] "Curable Patient". It is possible <b>that</b> <b>Smart</b> was confined at Newbery's behest over old debts and a poor relationship that existed between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart's immorality in A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High. Regardless of Newbery's exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery's admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on madness. To have Smart admitted, Newbery probably provided a small bribe, although bribes were against St Luke's policy.|$|E
500|$|A more {{negative}} review came from EW.com's Ken Tucker, {{who called the}} animation clunky, which he said made Hanna-Barbera's animation look like state-of-the-art. Tucker also said in his review that he hoped <b>that</b> <b>smart</b> people would use the Family Guy half-hour {{to turn off the}} television set and start a debate over the air strikes in Kosovo. He also called the show [...] "The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows". Even before it aired the pilot had received some criticism from the Parents Television Council, a watchdog; the creator of this website L. Brent Bozell III wrote that he initially speculated that Family Guy would be [...] "pushing the envelope".|$|E
500|$|Smart's {{behaviour}} {{was probably}} influenced by St Paul's command in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians to [...] "Pray without ceasing" [...] and William Law's The Spirit of Prayer, which {{argues that a}} constant state of prayer will establish a connection with God. Smart began by praying at regular intervals but this slowly deteriorated into irregular praying in which he would interrupt his friends' activities and call them into the street to pray with him. These calls for public prayer continued until an incident <b>that</b> <b>Smart</b> later described in Jubilate Agno: [...] "For I blessed God in St James's Park till I routed all the company... For the officers of the peace are at variance with me, and the watchman smites me with his staff" [...] (Jubilate Agno B 90–91).|$|E
