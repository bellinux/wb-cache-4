25|$|Witnesses dispute this account, {{saying that}} Tabatabainejad {{had begun to}} walk <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with his {{backpack}} when an officer approached him and grabbed his arm, whereupon Tabatabainejad told the officer several times to let go.|$|E
500|$|As Augustus {{went for}} a pistol, Powell ran downstairs <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> where he {{encountered}} a telegraph messenger, who he stabbed in the back, then ran outside exclaiming [...] "I'm mad! I'm mad!". Screams from the house had frightened Herold, who ran off, leaving Powell to find his own way in an unfamiliar city.|$|E
2500|$|When {{a person}} died at home, {{family members and}} {{intimate}} friends gathered around the death bed. In accordance with a belief that equated the soul with the breath, the closest relative sealed the passing of spirit from the body with a last kiss, and closed the eyes. The relatives began lamentations, calling on the deceased by name. The body was then placed on the ground, washed, and anointed. The placing of the body {{on the ground is}} a doublet of birth ritual, when the infant was placed on the bare earth. Male citizens were then dressed in a toga, and others in attire appropriate to their station in life. Men who had earned a wreath wore one in death, and wreaths also are found in burials of initiates into mystery religions. After the body was prepared, it lay in state in the atrium of the family home (...) , with the feet pointed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Other circumstances pertained to those who lived, as most Romans did, in apartment buildings (...) , but elite practices are better documented.|$|E

60|$|Sir Alfred glanced <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> closed <b>door.</b> Without a {{doubt they}} were alone.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Johanan and Rabbi Eleazar {{differed}} {{on how the}} Cherubim stood. One {{said that}} they faced each other, and the other said they faced inward (<b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door).</b> The Gemara asked how one could reconcile the view that they faced each other with 2 Chronicles [...] which says, [...] "And their faces were inward." [...] The Gemara explained that they faced each other (in a sign of affection, symbolizing the relationship between God and the people) when Israel obeyed God's will of God; they faced inward (away from each other, symbolizing God's unrequited love for Israel) when Israel did not obey God's will. The Gemara asked how one could reconcile the view that they faced inward with , which says, [...] "With their faces one to another." [...] The Gemara explained that they were slightly turned sideways (partly facing each other and partly facing inward). As it was taught in a Baraita, Onkelos the proselyte said that the Cherubim were formed like children (as some read [...] ) and their faces were turned sideways, {{like those of a}} student who takes leave of the student's master (turning sideways for some distance before turning the student's back completely on the master).|$|E
60|$|That gentleman, whose {{back was}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> had not {{observed}} the {{addition to the}} company. Molly had turned the handle quietly, and her slippered feet made no sound. It was the amazed expression on Jimmy's face that caused the captain to look <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Norris Vine {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} and turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|That reply roused her. She started, {{and looked}} nervously <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> bed-chamber <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|In sudden alarm {{the four}} boys turned back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> folding <b>doors</b> {{through which they}} had entered the dining-room. To their consternation, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were tightly shut.|$|R
60|$|The great {{audience}} {{turned as}} one <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> at <b>the</b> {{end of the}} long central aisle. There, through the wide-swung portals, they saw mounted men forcing their way into the cathedral. The great horses shouldered aside the foot-soldiers that attempted to bar their way, and twenty troopers of the Royal Horse thundered to the very foot of the chancel steps.|$|R
60|$|Madame Christophor turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Falkenberg {{barred the}} way.|$|E
60|$|Powers moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but the {{professor}} called him back.|$|E
60|$|Jeanne {{hesitated for}} a moment. Then she turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|MINNIE (glancing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> study <b>door,</b> {{where she}} {{suspects}} ASHER is). No you don't, either! You {{come along with}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why don't he show it then?" [...] muttered Tom, with a half-wistful, half-defiant glance <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> library <b>door,</b> {{which stood}} ajar.|$|R
60|$|I {{confess that}} I {{was not very}} anxious to look him up, but I {{followed}} the boarder, as he slowly made his way <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>door.</b> As we opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> we instinctively stopped.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{streamed}} imperceptibly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and flowed silently out.|$|E
60|$|He moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but lingered there, betraying {{a slight}} perplexity.|$|E
60|$|Saton turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with {{a little}} shrug of the shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Alison {{heard him}} cross the room, {{and when he}} came back his hostess evidently walked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> house with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma is at home," [...] {{said the}} child. She ran forward, calling <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open <b>doors</b> and windows, [...] "Mamma! Mamma! Here's a lady!" ...|$|R
60|$|Losing no time, {{for they}} had now passed several rods beyond the road-house, the plucky boy wriggled his body <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> coach.|$|R
60|$|She started, {{and drew}} a little away, glancing nervously <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|DR. JONATHAN (going <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door).</b> Oh, it's you, Hillman. Come in.|$|E
60|$|Hardwick glanced <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> to {{see that}} no one was coming.|$|E
60|$|Fuzzy {{had shot}} his arrow. They drank. The Lady smiled again {{the smile of}} her caste. James enveloped and re-conducted him <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> front <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> harp music still softly drifted through the house.|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open <b>door.</b> I arose {{and closed}} it. When I had resumed my seat {{he drew his}} chair closer to me, leaned toward me, and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{regarded}} her darkly. [...] "Well, I trust you. You won't give me away. I'm {{not so sure}} of her." [...] He nodded his head <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|With every {{nerve in}} his body {{twitching}} he went <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jack did not reply, but {{moved from}} the window <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|I moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but {{she checked}} {{me with an}} {{imperative}} gesture.|$|E
60|$|The descent {{came to an}} end, however, as {{must all}} things in this world, and he groped his way <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>door,</b> {{not so much as}} daring to breathe.|$|R
60|$|She moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> closed <b>door</b> that {{connected}} <b>the</b> two rooms, but stopped, and half turned and bestowed upon Goodwin a grave, searching look {{that ended in}} a quizzical smile.|$|R
60|$|The {{younger man}} scowled, but he {{advanced}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> locked <b>door,</b> {{and as it}} swung in upon its hinges, he entered the room beyond {{at the side of}} Vas Kor.|$|R
