5|$|University College was the {{founding}} nondenominational college, created in 1853 after {{the university was}} secularized. Knox College, a Presbyterian institution, and Wycliffe College, a low church seminary, both encouraged their students to study for non-divinity degrees at University College. In 1885, they entered a formal affiliation with the University of Toronto, and became federated schools in 1890. The idea of federation initially met strong opposition at Victoria University, a Methodist school in Cobourg, but a financial incentive in 1890 convinced the school to join. Decades {{after the death of}} John Strachan, the Anglican seminary Trinity College entered federation in 1904, followed in 1910 by St. Michael's College, a Roman Catholic college founded by the Basilian Fathers. Among <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> had considered federation but ultimately remained independent were McMaster University, a Baptist school that later moved to Hamilton, and Queen's College, a Presbyterian school in Kingston that later became Queen's University.|$|E

25|$|Ali Khamenei, himself, has {{remained}} {{silent on the}} issue of whether Iran should have an Islamic Republic or an Islamic Administration. However, he clearly rejected the supervision of Assembly of Experts on <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> are governed directly under his responsibility (e.g. Military forces, Judiciary system and IRIB).|$|E
25|$|Machen's {{influence}} {{can still}} be felt today through the existence of <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> he founded—Westminster Theological Seminary, The Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions, and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. In addition, his textbook on basic New Testament Greek is still used today in many seminaries, including PCUSA schools.|$|E

25|$|Writing is {{powerful}} {{in a different}} way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas {{over a long period}} of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using mnemonic tools.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of early}} splits in the {{national}} organization, several unofficial national coalitions and rogue groups granted their own charters. As a result, many conflicts exist surrounding the actual founding dates and chapter designations, even at <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> had officially recognized groups. The following list of chapters is composed of all chapters either founded by the Alpha, or founded by the successive nationals from 1907 to 1949, or made legitize after their original founding. Institution names have been modernized where necessary.|$|E
25|$|The first {{decades of}} the 19th century saw the gradual {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> would come to dominate the artistic life of Victorian Birmingham. In 1809 a group of eight artists including Samuel Lines, Charles Barber and Vincent Barber opened an academy of life drawing in Peck Lane, now the site of New Street railway station. This held its first exhibition of members' work in 1814 as the Birmingham Academy of Arts, and was refounded as the Birmingham Society of Arts under the patronage of wealthy local businessmen in 1821.|$|E

25|$|By {{the fall}} of 1920 it became {{increasingly}} clear that the Soviet regime would emerge from the Russian Civil War victorious. With fall of the Whites, a common enemy which united disparate factions around the Soviet banner, much unity was loosened. Dissident {{groups such as the}} so-called Workers' Opposition and the Democratic Centralists emerged in the Communist Party, widespread dissatisfaction among the peasantry over forced grain requisitioning resulted in isolated uprisings. All of these factors prompted a wave of debate about <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> had sprung up in Soviet society during wartime, including Proletkult.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{community}} established many of <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> characterize a durable society, and indeed came to dominate an entire section of Munich, the overriding imperative {{was to find}} new homes for the refugees. To make the point, many of the leaders emigrated at the first possible opportunity. Both overt lobbying efforts and underground migration sought to open for unrestricted immigration to Palestine. And the camps largely emptied once the state of Israel was established, many of the refugees immediately joining the newly formed Israel Defense Forces to fight the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> would {{eventually}} develop {{as what is}} now Florida State University were established in Tallahassee; it became a university town. These included the Tallahassee Female Academy (founded 1843) and the Florida Institute (founded 1854). In 1851, the Florida legislature decreed two seminaries to be built {{on either side of}} the Suwannee River, East Florida Seminary and West Florida Seminary. In 1855 West Florida Seminary was transferred to the Florida Institute building (which had been established as an inducement for the state to place the seminary in Tallahassee). In 1858, the seminary absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy and became coeducational. Its main building was located near the northwest corner of South Copeland and West Jefferson streets, approximately where FSU's Westcott Building is today.|$|E

25|$|In {{parallel}} to this change, the teaching institutions are now categorized into Registered and Affiliate centers (collectively known as recognised centres). Students can either decide to study entirely by themselves, or {{to enjoy the}} administrative and academic support of <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> are recognised by the University of London for the International Programmes. Registered Centres have demonstrated commitment to developing high standards in respect of teaching, support to students and administrative processes. Affiliate Centres have demonstrated a sustained commitment to developing excellence in respect of quality of teaching, support to students and administrative processes. Affiliate Centre status is {{the highest level of}} recognition awarded by the University of London. Recognition applies to specific programmes on named campuses. New College of the Humanities, a private college founded in London in 2011, though not affiliated with the University of London, also plans to register its students for degrees through the programme.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Nietzsche's {{greatest}} philosophical legacy lies in his 20th century interpreters, {{among them}} Pierre Klossowski, Martin Heidegger, Georges Bataille, Leo Strauss, Alexandre Kojève, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze (and Félix Guattari), Jacques Derrida and Albert Camus. Foucault's later writings, for example, adopt Nietzsche's genealogical method to develop anti-foundationalist theories {{of power that}} divide and fragment rather than unite politics (as evinced in the liberal tradition of political theory). The systematic institutionalisation of criminal delinquency, sexual identity and practice, and the mentally ill (to name but a few) are examples used to demonstrate how knowledge or truth is inseparable from <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> formulate notions of legitimacy from 'immoralities' such as homosexuality and the like (captured in the famous power-knowledge equation). Deleuze, arguably the foremost of Nietzsche's interpreters, used the much-maligned 'will to power' thesis in tandem with Marxian notions of commodity surplus and Freudian ideas of desire to articulate concepts such the rhizome and other 'outsides' to state power as traditionally conceived.|$|E
25|$|This pattern transcended the {{political}} {{ideology of the}} historians involved during this time. The Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (ICP) was among <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> adopted the Brau-inspired narrative and aided in dispersing it in its work. During the 1950s and 1960s, Salvador Tío emerged as a dissenting figure and argued the importance of references made to Agüeybana II in Spanish documents that were dated after 1511. During this time, Veicente Murga also brought a series of documents from Spain, in which the attack at Caparra was revealed. He, along Ricardo Alegría and Álvaro Huerga, assumed that the attack {{was carried out by}} Carib forces, but eyewitness accounts, a Taíno confession and the testimony of those involved in the defense of Caparra, such as Francisco Juancho, blame the belligerent caciques. Towards the century's end, Francisco Moscoso published La Conquista Española y la Gran Rebelión de los Taínos after analyzing several documents at the University of Puerto Rico's Centro de Investigaciones Históricas (Spanish for Center of Historic Investigations), marking another departure from the common narrative.|$|E

500|$|Internationally, Koht {{tried to}} prop up <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> {{maintained}} public international law. In 1923 he participated in the arbitrations between Denmark and Norway about the disposition of Eastern Greenland. Sovereignty was claimed by Denmark. Koht teamed up with the conservative politician C. J. Hambro, who had edited Nordmanns-Forbundets tidsskrift to which Koht had contributed. The negotiations led to an agreement on Norwegian trade rights in the area, but a question of sovereignty over Eastern Greenland remained unsolved. In 1931, forces in {{and outside of the}} then-Agrarian government annexed [...] "Erik the Red's Land".|$|E
500|$|Simon has {{identified}} the organizations {{featured in the}} show—the Baltimore Police Department, City Hall, the Baltimore public school system, the Barksdale drug trafficking operation, The Baltimore Sun, and the stevedores' union—as comparable institutions. All are dysfunctional in some way, and the characters are typically betrayed by <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> they accept in their lives. There is also a sentiment echoed by a detective in Narcotics—"Shit rolls downhill"—which describes how superiors, especially in the higher tiers of the Police Department in the series, will attempt to use subordinates as scapegoats for any major scandals. Simon described the show as [...] "cynical about institutions" [...] while taking a humanistic approach toward its characters.|$|E
500|$|With the {{combined}} influence of [...] "Cloud Piece" [...] and the prayer book {{given to him}} by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as [...] "a humanistic paean for the people". Blaney wrote, [...] "Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential." [...] In the opinion of Blaney, with [...] "Imagine", Lennon attempted to raise people's awareness of their interaction with <b>the</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>that</b> affect their lives. Rolling Stones David Fricke commented: [...] " [...] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order: geopolitical borders, organised religion, [...] economic class." ...|$|E
