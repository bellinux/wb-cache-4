5|$|During the Pacific War, the US Navy's fast battleships had mainly {{been used}} to escort the groups of {{aircraft}} carriers that formed the United States Pacific Fleet's main striking force.

5|$|Inshore {{lifeboats}} (ILBs) {{are smaller}} boats that operate closer to <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>and</b> in shallower waters than ALBs. There are two classes, inflatables and RIBs capable of 25–40 knots.

5|$|After {{waiting for}} the wind, Endeavour resumed her voyage on the {{afternoon}} of 5 August 1770, reaching the northernmost point of Cape York Peninsula fifteen days later. On 22 August, Cook was rowed ashore to a small coastal island to proclaim British sovereignty over the eastern Australian mainland. Cook christened his landing place Possession Island, and ceremonial volleys of gunfire from <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>and</b> Endeavours deck marked the occasion.|$|E
5|$|He {{worked with}} Corréard, Savigny {{and another of}} the survivors, the {{carpenter}} Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of planks. Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to Le Havre to study the sea and sky. Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast {{on a number of}} occasions to witness storms breaking on <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> <b>and</b> a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the English Channel.|$|E

Lieutenant Edward Evans, who had been the navigating officer on Morning, the Discovery expedition's relief ship in 1904, was appointed Scott's second-in-command.

5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away from <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>and</b> does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|The Ama are Japanese skin divers, {{predominantly}} women, who traditionally {{dive for}} shellfish and seaweed {{wearing only a}} loincloth and {{who have been in}} action for at least 2,000 years.

5|$|The American crow is omnivorous.

As they begin the long swim to the beach, Billie the oiler, the strongest of the four, swims ahead of the others; the captain advances towards the shore while still holding onto the boat, and the cook uses a surviving oar. The correspondent is trapped by a local current, but is eventually able to swim on.

There was an inconsequential exchange of gunfire with the militia men who were located on <b>the</b> <b>shore,</b> <b>and</b> Moore was able to raise anchor and travel to a safe anchorage. The remaining men armed themselves with muskets, pitchforks, and axes to set out after the Margaretta.|$|E
5|$|With a {{storm track}} {{very close to}} <b>the</b> <b>shore</b> <b>and</b> a {{retreating}} high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A frontal boundary between the warm Atlantic air and a residual wedge of colder air over the interior served as the focus for a severe ice storm in central New England. Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas. By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed cold-core low. The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|As Hondo {{began to}} regenerate, Mauritius and Réunion were placed under {{a state of}} alert.

Initially, residents in Madagascar feared that Hondo would make landfall in the country after being struck by Cyclone Ivan on February16. However, the storm turn towards the southwest, away from Madagascar. On February23 ex-Hondo tracked just offshore Mauritius before passing directly over Réunion, just short of moderate tropical storm status. Sustained winds of 50km/h (31mph) with gusts up to 76km/h (47mph) were recorded on Mauritius while sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph) with gusts up to 99km/h (61mph) were recorded on Réunion. The highest rainfall total was recorded at Takamaka, totaling to 750mm (29.5in). Up to 760,000 people were affected on Réunion and overall damage was minimal.|$|E
