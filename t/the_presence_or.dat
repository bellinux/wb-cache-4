5|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{classification scheme}} {{has been suggested}} by Ogilvy and Carter to predict outcome and gauge therapy. The system consists of five grades and it assigns one point for <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of each of five factors: age greater than 50; Hunt and Hess grade 4 or 5; Fisher scale 3 or 4; aneurysm size greater than 10 mm; and posterior circulation aneurysm 25 mm or more.|$|E
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
5|$|Gene flow {{involves}} {{the exchange of}} genes between populations and between species. <b>The</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due {{to the complexity of}} organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.|$|E

The reliability of annotations may be influenced by <b>the</b> <b>presences</b> <b>or</b> absence of certain key features.

5|$|The chief {{environmental}} factors affecting {{the distribution of}} living organisms are temperature, humidity, climate, soil type and light intensity, and <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of all the requirements that the organism needs to sustain it. Generally speaking, animal communities are reliant on specific types of plant communities.|$|E
5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Airline EasyJet is {{interested}} in the inspection of aircraft with drones. It made a first inspection in 2015. Equipped with laser sensors and high resolution camera, the drone performs autonomous flight around the aeroplane. It generates a three-dimensional image of the aircraft and transmits it to a technician. The operator can then navigate in this representation and zoom to display a high-resolution picture of some parts of the aircraft. The operator must then visually diagnose <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E

5|$|At 09:35, a Catalina {{made the}} first {{sighting}} of the Ryūjō force. Later that morning, several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo's and Mikawa's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher {{to believe that the}} Japanese knew where his carriers were, which actually was not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was sure there were no other Japanese carriers in the area. Finally, with no firm word on <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> location of other Japanese carriers, at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō. However, he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. carriers potentially ready should any Japanese fleet carriers be sighted.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of subsurface liquid oceans on Jupiter's moons Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, there has been great interest in studying the icy moons in detail. Funding difficulties have delayed progress. The Europa Orbiter was a planned NASA mission to Europa, which was canceled in 2002. Its main objectives included determining <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of a subsurface ocean and identifying candidate sites for future lander missions. NASA's JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter), which was canceled in 2005, and a European Jovian Europa Orbiter mission were also studied, but were superseded by the Europa Jupiter System Mission.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he expanded his diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} to monitor <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> {{amount of water}} in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The {{intensity}} of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|In 1735 Brandt {{proposed}} to make <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of malleability {{the principle of}} this classification. On that basis he separated mercury from the metals. The same view was adopted by Vogel (1755, Institutiones Chemiæ) and Buffon (1785, Histoire Naturelle des Minéraux). In the interim, Braun had observed the solidification of mercury by cold in 1759–60. This was confirmed by Hutchins and Cavendish in 1783. The malleability of mercury then became known, and it was included amongst the metals.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} studying <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> {{absence of}} a dorsal stripe suggested that it has independently evolved several times in Timema species and is an adaptation for crypsis on needle-like leaves. All of the eight Timema species with a dorsal stripe {{have at least one}} host plant with needle-like foliage. Of the thirteen unstriped species, seven feed only on broadleaf plants. Four (T. ritensis, T. podura, T. genevieve, and T. coffmani) rest during the day on the host plant's trunk rather than its leaves and have bodies that are brown, gray, or tan. Only two species (T. nakipa and T. boharti) have green unstriped morphs that feed on needle-like foliage; both are generalist feeders that also feed on broadleaf hosts.|$|E

40|$|Few {{reports have}} been {{published}} on the chemical nature of the keratohyaline granules, and all are not in agreement. In addition to the published disagreements as to <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> (8) <b>or</b> absence (4) of iron, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> (4) <b>or</b> absence (8) of calcium and magnesium, and <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> (5) <b>or</b> absence (4) of rihonucleic acid, we wish {{to call attention to}} our findings on the absence of alkaline phosphatase in the granules. Association of these granules with alkaline phosphatase has been reported (4).

5|$|In certain regions, {{presence}} or absence of certain scales may be a quick way to distinguish non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} a location in the galaxy as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for. These include the distribution of stars and spiral arms, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of an active galactic nucleus, the frequency of nearby supernovae that can threaten the existence of life, the metallicity of that location, and other factors. Without fulfilling these factors, a region of the galaxy cannot create or sustain life with efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species {{can be identified}} by their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E

5|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view. Superficially, {{it seems to be}} a form of property dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form of property dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>or</b> absence of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary.
