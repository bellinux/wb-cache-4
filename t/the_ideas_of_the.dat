5|$|In Eastern Europe, Milica Bakić–Hayden {{developed}} {{the concept of}} Nesting Orientalisms (1992), derived from <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historian Larry Wolff (Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment, 1994) and Said's ideas in Orientalism (1978). The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (Imagining the Balkans, 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (Ethnologia Balkanica, 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.|$|E

The Church of England had dismissed Prince earlier in his career for his radical teachings. The Agapemonites predicted the imminent return of Jesus Christ. According to newspaper accounts, Prince's successor, John Hugh Smyth-Pigott, declared himself Jesus Christ reincarnate.|$|E
5|$|A year later, Catherine was {{banished from}} court, and her rooms {{were given to}} Anne. Anne was an unusually educated and {{intellectual}} woman for her time, and was keenly absorbed and engaged with <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Protestant Reformers, though {{the extent to which}} she herself was a committed Protestant is much debated. When Archbishop of Canterbury William Warham died, Anne's influence and the need to find a trustworthy supporter of the annulment had Thomas Cranmer appointed to the vacant position. This was approved by the Pope, unaware of the King's nascent plans for the Church.|$|E

5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko was an anti-apartheid {{activist who}} was a {{founding}} member of the South African Students' Organisation in 1968 and the Black People's Convention in 1972. Through these groups, and through other activities, he promoted <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Consciousness movement, and became a prominent member of the resistance to apartheid in the 1970s. The government of South Africa placed a banning order on him in 1973, preventing him from leaving his hometown, meeting with more than one person, publishing his writing, and speaking in public. In August 1977 Biko was arrested for breaking his banning order.|$|E
5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E

40|$|This thesis, {{presented}} as a theoretical contribution to <b>the</b> discipline <b>of</b> International Relations, describes <b>the</b> intellectual origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state has a privileged place in International Relations for it is an integral element <b>of</b> Realism, <b>the</b> discipline's dominant intellectual tradition. Realism assumes that the primary actors in the modern international system are states, as identified by their exercise of sovereignty over a delimited space or territory. In Realist history, the territorial state and the modern territorial international order emerged together, twin products of seventeenth century political theory and practice, as signified by political settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peace <b>of</b> Westphalia in 1648. This thesis challenges <b>the</b> Realist narrative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state on two counts: methodologically and historically. First, it rejects the view {{that it is possible}} to account for <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state exclusively in terms of political practice and knowledge. It argues that <b>the</b> Realist <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state needs to be understood as one expression of a much broader and more complex matrix of narratives - social, political, philosophical and cultural - about man's capacity to know, represent and order <b>the</b> spaces <b>of</b> modernity. Second, <b>the</b> thesis rejects the Realist history that dates <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state to the seventeenth century. An alternative chronology is put forward that dates <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state to fifteenth and sixteenth century Renaissance Italy. The thesis argues that <b>the</b> first signs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> territorial state can be identified in various Renaissance spatial discourses: political, cosmological, artistic and cartographic. These spatial discourses and the practices they led to established the templates for thinking about and representing space in modernity, including those underlying <b>the</b> articulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern territorial state...|$|R

5|$|Henri IV was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy {{built to}} test some of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prominent naval architect Louis-Émile Bertin. She began World War I as guardship at Bizerte. She {{was sent to}} reinforce the Allied naval force in the Dardanelles campaign of 1915, although some of her secondary armament had been removed for transfer to Serbia in 1914. Afterwards, she was relegated to second-line roles before being sent to Taranto as a depot ship in 1918. She was struck from the navy list in 1920 and scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, {{beginning}} a lifelong friendship. Engels showed Marx his recently published The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, convincing Marx that {{the working class}} would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history. Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as The Holy Family. Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.|$|E

5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as a deterrent.

Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively more difficult for him to speak. He died on October 12, 1812, while the trial was still underway.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the Partenope class was {{prepared}} by Engineering Inspector Carlo Vigna, and {{was based on the}} earlier torpedo cruiser , the first modern vessel of the type built by Italy.

In the same month, Saxon clergymen from Kronstadt (now Brașov in Romania), who had adopted Lutheranism, participated in a debate with Catholic priests {{in the presence of the}} queen and Martinuzzi in Gyulafehérvár. The Saxons were allowed to leave, although Martinuzzi, who was bishop of Várad, wanted to bring them before court on charges of heresy. In April 1544, the Diet of Torda prescribed that travellers should respect the religious customs of the settlements they visited, showing that <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reformation had spread to the whole province.|$|E

5|$|Although Golos Truda sharply {{criticized the}} anarchist communists of Petrograd as romantics, {{ignorant of the}} complex social forces of the Revolution among Petrograd's Bolshevik-supporting factory workers, <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union and its paper were {{considered}} bizarre and met with little initial success. Despite this, the anarcho-syndicalist union persisted and gradually acquired a degree of influence, focusing its efforts through propaganda in Golos Truda, {{with the intent of}} capturing the attention of the public with its ideals and by differentiating itself from the other radical factions. The paper's circulation continuing to increase in the city and its provinces, with robust anarcho-syndicalist collectives and meetings emerging in Kronstadt, Oboukhovo, and Kolpino. In March 1918, the Bolsheviks moved the seat of government from Petrograd to Moscow, and the anarchists swiftly followed, moving the printing of Golos Truda to the new capital.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{was born}} in Buenos Aires, the fourth child of Italian {{businessman}} Domingo Belgrano y Peri and Josefa Casero. He {{came into contact with}} <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Age of Enlightenment while at university in Spain {{around the time of the}} French Revolution. Upon his return to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, where he became a notable member of the criollo population of Buenos Aires, he tried to promote some of the new political and economic ideals, but found severe resistance from local peninsulars. This rejection led him to work towards a greater autonomy for his country from the Spanish colonial regime. At first, he unsuccessfully promoted the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to become a regent ruler for the Viceroyalty during the period the Spanish King Ferdinand VII was imprisoned during the Peninsular War (1807–1814). He favoured the May Revolution, which removed the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros from power on 25 May 1810. He was elected as a voting member of the Primera Junta that took power after the ouster.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{professional}} life was distinctive {{in that he}} never ceased to investigate mechanical building structures. Early on, Gaudí was inspired by oriental arts (India, Persia, Japan) through {{the study of the}} historicist architectural theoreticians, such as Walter Pater, John Ruskin and William Morris. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the Güell Palace, the Güell Pavilions and the Casa Vicens. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French architect Viollet-le-Duc. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house {{as well as in the}} crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Família. Eventually, Gaudí embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.|$|E

5|$|Largely non-religious, Heinrich {{was a man}} of the Enlightenment, {{interested}} in <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire. A classical liberal, he took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, then governed by an absolute monarchy. In 1815, Heinrich Marx began work as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family to a ten-room property near the Porta Nigra. His wife, Henriette Pressburg, was a Dutch Jewish woman from a prosperous business family that later founded the company Philips Electronics. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married Lion Philips (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both Gerard and Anton Philips and great-grandmother to Frits Philips. Lion Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl and Jenny Marx would later often come to rely for loans while they were exiled in London.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream Christianity has {{typically}} rejected <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Age. Most published {{criticism of}} the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's fundamentalist wing. In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of evangelical Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; {{a number of them}} have been characterised as propagating conspiracy theories regarding the origin and purpose of the movement. The most successful such publication however was Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel This Present Darkness, which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with feminism and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Belgrano had a vast {{intellectual}} {{awareness of}} most important topics of his age. He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions, {{and was a}} versatile polyglot, capable of understanding Spanish, English, French, Italian, and some indigenous languages. This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment, and understand the social, economic, technical, educative, political, cultural, and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas. He helped to promote those ideas using the press and with {{his work in the}} Consulate. He rejected localist perspectives, favouring a Latin Americanist one. He was driven by the concept of the common good, which he regarded as an ethical value. He considered public health, education, and work as part of the common good, as well as religion. He did not share completely <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution, but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment: most notably, he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs, being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology. His monarchism was not a conservative one, as he agreed that the existing state of things should be modified, but not towards a republic as in France or the United States, but towards a constitutional monarchy, like in Britain.|$|E
