500|$|Throughout his cross-examination, {{prosecutor}} Hausner {{attempted to}} get Eichmann {{to admit he}} was personally guilty, but no such confession was forthcoming. Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries, but stated that he never thought their annihilation was justified. When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have five million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets. During later examination by the judges, he admitted he meant the Jews, and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time.|$|E
500|$|Between {{his time}} in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later {{recalled}} making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in Aldershot. This was an isolated occurrence, {{but by the time he}} was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: [...] " [...] imbued me with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had some sort of talent". Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the Eight Lancashire Lads clog-dancing troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900. Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.|$|E
500|$|The game's combat {{was praised}} by most critics. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Crispin Boyer {{described}} {{the game as}} [...] "a thrill ride. And not just 'cause Return of the King unleashes larger hordes of foes than last year's equally slick Two Towers prequel. Many of Return of the Kings levels actually force you to multitask while you hack and slash." [...] PC Gamer UKs Tony Ellis wrote [...] "combat in RotK is superbly satisfying. Your blows connect with a solid, visceral thud you can almost feel." [...] He also noted the variation between levels. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed praised the [...] "subtleties of the combat." [...] In contrast, Game Informers Matthew Kato found the gameplay to be [...] "repetitious", writing [...] "sometimes I got <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was working harder only to have less fun than in Two Towers." [...] The co-op mode was also praised.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I, for {{it would}} have been {{positively}} wrong in me to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had for <b>the</b> Scotch hadn't any meaning at all.|$|R
60|$|But {{you were}} {{throwing}} a slur upon {{the character of}} the upper classes in this country, by insinuating that abroad a great deal more interest was taken in the working classes than in England. Now <b>I</b> assert, <b>that</b> quite the contrary is the fact.--I should be very sorry to express all <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have respecting <b>the</b> relations between the upper classes and the working classes in this country; it is a subject which cannot at present be discussed, and one upon which I would decline any further examination.|$|R

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} moment when Nico Rosberg let him past {{in the early stages}} of the race, Hamilton told the press that he had thanked his {{teammate}} for [...] "being a gentleman". When asked how painful it had been to be asked to let Hamilton go by, Rosberg said: [...] "It was more painful <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had in the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that's not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [...] was just a consequence of that." [...] Mercedes's motorsport director Toto Wolff also praised Rosberg for working for the team and moving to the side without questioning the team's decision. Rosberg was however unable to give an explanation for his slow pace during the early stages. He pointed to the possibility that his car's tyre and brake temperatures had been particularly affected by the period behind the safety car.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, DeVille {{relocated}} from New York to New Orleans, {{where he}} found a spiritual home. [...] "I was stunned", {{he said in a}} 1993 interview. [...] "I had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going back home. It was very strange... I live in the French Quarter, two streets away from Bourbon Street; at night, when I go to bed, I hear the boogie that comes from the streets, and in the morning, when I wake up, I hear the blues." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was {{the kind of place where}} it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E
5000|$|Broken is {{the sixth}} EP {{released}} by the South Korean boy group MBLAQ. The album was released online on March 24, 2014 at 12PM (KST). The album consists of 7 tracks, and Wheesung {{took part in the}} writing of the lyrics and composing for the title song Be a Man, whereby he gifted the song to MBLAQ. He expressed that [...] "MBLAQ is the only male group <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to give a song to, so it was a pleasure to work with them on the album. I am thankful for MBLAQ for conveying <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted from this track".|$|R

2500|$|The 'holy trinity' of Best, Law and Charlton {{remained}} {{effective as}} {{ever in the}} 1968–69 campaign. However the club's new recruits were not up to scratch, as United dropped to 11th in the league before Busby announced his retirement. Best later said that [...] "I increasingly had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was carrying the team at times on the pitch." [...] He scored 22 goals in 55 games, though only he and Denis Law scored more than six league goals. In the Intercontinental Cup, fans and players alike looked forward to seeing United take on Argentine opposition Estudiantes de La Plata {{over the course of}} two legs. However Best said [...] "no one tackled harder or dirtier than this Argentinian team" [...] as a 1–0 defeat at the Estadio Camilo Cichero was followed by a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford. In the home tie, Best was kicked and spat on by José Hugo Medina, and both players were sent off after Best reacted with a punch. Despite their poor league form, United managed to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup (they had a relatively easy run in getting past the Republic of Ireland's Waterford United, Belgium's Anderlecht, and Austria's Rapid Wien) where they were knocked out 2–1 on aggregate by A.C. Milan following a 2–0 defeat at the San Siro; Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini was the hero after keeping United to only one goal at Old Trafford.|$|E

60|$|So {{far from}} {{this being the}} fact, it is just because <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> most desire to {{cultivate}} in your minds are those of reverence and admiration, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am so earnest to prevent you from being moved to either by trivial or false semblances. This is the thing which I KNOW--and which, if you labour faithfully, you shall know also,--that in Reverence is the chief joy and power of life;--Reverence, for what is pure and bright in your own youth; for what is true and tried {{in the age of}} others; for all that is gracious among the living,--great among the dead,--and marvellous, in the Powers that cannot die.|$|R
2500|$|In 1975, when Thomas read Race and Economics by {{economist}} Thomas Sowell, {{he found}} an intellectual foundation for his philosophy. The book criticized social reforms by government and instead argued for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. He was also influenced by Ayn Rand, particularly The Fountainhead, and would later require his staffers to watch the 1949 film version. Thomas later said that novelist Richard Wright {{had been the most}} influential writer in his life; Wright's books Native Son and Black Boy [...] "capture a lot of <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had inside <b>that</b> you learn how to repress." [...] Thomas acknowledges having [...] "some very strong libertarian leanings".|$|R

6000|$|... "Awfully sorry, old man. I hadn't {{foreseen}} the cigar. I was bearing up tolerably well till I {{began to}} sniff the smoke.

60|$|When I {{said good}} night and went below it was with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been talking with the one half {{of some sort of}} a dual creature. The other half had not spoken. Yet I sensed it there, {{fluttering}} and quick, behind the mask of words and flesh.|$|E
5000|$|Christopher Judge {{was born}} and raised in Los Angeles, California. He has one younger brother, Jeff Judge, also an actor. Christopher Judge harbored the desire to become an actor from an early age, and studied drama in high school. [...] "The {{television}} set was my babysitter growing up. I can remember wanting to invoke <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was getting from television—I wanted to be the one who was the catalyst for those feelings in other people. Performing was something I've always known I was going to do." [...] He always knew that sports would be a stepping stone to an acting career. Judge was an All-L.A. City football player at Carson High School and graduated from Carson in 1982. He played for legendary Coach Gene Vollnogle.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, yes!" [...] {{returned}} Mr. Skimpole, smiling. [...] "Though I forgot {{how much}} it was and when it was.

6000|$|... "No; {{because then}} he'd {{give me that}} too.

60|$|Even as {{the blow}} which had plunged me into {{senselessness}} had imparted {{to me the}} sinking sensation which I have feebly endeavoured to depict, so did the first dim ray of returning consciousness bring with it <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was again being buoyed upwards through the thick waters that had enveloped me, to their surface, where intelligence and wakefulness awaited.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the press}} release, Collins said {{the idea behind}} the album was [...] "not to bring {{anything}} 'new' to these already great records, but to try to recreate <b>the</b> sounds and <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had when I first heard them. My intention was to make an 'old' record, not a 'new' record".|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but that}} is impossible!" [...] she replied. [...] "I cannot keep the bitter {{thoughts}} from my own heart.

500|$|In 1936, {{she became}} the {{youngest}} pupil to graduate from the Guildhall School of Music at the time, and the following year she won the Dawn Beauty Competition, winning £50. As she matured into a young woman, O'Hara, like many actresses, became increasingly self-conscious, which affected her for a while. In one performance, which was watched by her father {{from the back of}} the theatre, O'Hara [...] "sensed there was someone out front watching me, perhaps critically. My arms felt like lead.
