5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> was of {{one-piece}} forged construction, with uniform rifling (12 grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 25 calibers). The breech end of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> was screwed into a breech ring. The breech mechanism was {{of vertical}} sliding-block type. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> was {{fitted with a}} hydrospring recoil system.|$|E
5|$|The P90 {{requires}} minimal maintenance, {{and it can}} be disassembled {{quickly and}} easily. It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and optical sight group, the moving parts group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is 20,000 rounds.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded from the end of <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> Before it could be loaded the bore of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of <b>the</b> <b>barrel).</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{the case}} of older, side-by-side, Spanish guns, the choke is often marked on the tang of <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> {{becoming}} exposed when the wooden forearm is removed, after <b>the</b> double <b>barrels</b> are pivoted off of the break-action, such as when performing a field-stripping and cleaning. The manufacturer's mark, along with the proof marks, {{and the weight of}} <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> in grams, and the proof test pressures are also stamped alongside the choke marking on the tang of <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> near where <b>the</b> shells are inserted into <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The setter takes <b>the</b> first <b>barrel</b> {{and rolls}} {{it to the}} rick. His job is to {{properly}} align <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> such that after rolling down the final rail, the bungs of all <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> are pointed straight up.|$|R
2500|$|The report {{discussed}} {{testing the}} interiors of <b>the</b> steel <b>barrels</b> at <b>the</b> wreck site of four intact barrels and five 'open' ones, that were probed with a siphon-extraction tube. These {{nine out of}} <b>the</b> several hundred <b>barrels</b> were all located on a remote part of the wreckage separated by 787ft from the main wreck site, which contains the bulk of <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b> <b>The</b> origin of <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> was not verified.|$|R
5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} a combination of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter {{than that of the}} M-10, <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The Heilongjiang hand cannon is 34 centimeters (13.4 inches) {{long without}} a handle and weighs 3.55kg (7.83 pounds). The {{diameter}} of the interior {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is 2.6cm (1.0 inches). <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> is the lengthiest part of the hand cannon and is 6.9 inches long. There is no inscription on the hand cannon.|$|E
50|$|Exactly what {{triggered}} the conflagration of <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> was never determined, although {{the day of}} the explosion was noted as unusually dry. Given the circumstances, an accidental ignition in one of <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> was not improbable.|$|R
50|$|The weapon {{developed}} {{on its own}} initiative, out of competition and technical tasks. The weapon has no bolt, but a stationary breech and movable barrels with its own gas cylinders with piston connected to <b>the</b> next <b>barrel.</b> Upon firing one <b>barrel,</b> <b>the</b> next one was forced backwards, and thus caused <b>the</b> next <b>barrel</b> to move forward. When firing operates a feeding device that channels rounds into <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> with <b>the</b> spent cartridges ejected from both sides. <b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> {{move back and forth}} the full length of the cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|Blowback {{operation}} {{uses the}} backward force to retract <b>the</b> entire <b>barrel</b> and bolt assembly, which unlock {{at the rear}} of <b>the</b> <b>barrel's</b> path.|$|R
5|$|The bore {{evacuator}} and the gun's thermal sleeve, {{designed to}} regulate the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> are made of glass-reinforced plastic, while <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> has a chrome lining to increase barrel life. Originally the gun had an EFC barrel life of ~1,500 rounds, but with recent advances in propellant technology the average life has increased even further. The gun's recoil mechanism is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a hydropneumatic assembly.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, {{inside of}} which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had {{requested}} that he be put in <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over her mouth to muffle, but he kills her by accident.|$|E
50|$|Añejos {{are often}} rested in barrels {{previously}} used to rest reposados. <b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> cannot {{be more than}} 600 liters (158 gallons), and most are in the 200-liter (52-gallon) range. Many of <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> used are from whiskey distilleries in the US or Canada, and Jack Daniels barrels are especially popular. This treatment creates many of the aspects of the dark color and more complex flavors of the añejo tequila. After aging {{of at least one}} year, the añejo can be removed from <b>the</b> wood <b>barrels</b> and placed in stainless steel tanks {{to reduce the amount of}} evaporation that can occur in <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> triple <b>barrel</b> shotgun is <b>the</b> rarest configuration, {{and arguably}} {{is an odd}} variant of a double-barreled shotgun rather than a drilling, since it lacks the rifle/shotgun {{combination}} that all the other drillings have. <b>The</b> triple <b>barrel</b> shotgun is generally laid out like a side-by-side shotgun, with <b>the</b> third <b>barrel</b> centered and below the other two. <b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> are all <b>the</b> same gauge.|$|R
50|$|After the Detour, {{teams have}} to {{transport}} two <b>barrels</b> through <b>the</b> {{other side of}} the canal using the two steels bars provided. Team members are not allowed to get contact on the water while moving <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b> If they safely transport <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> dry, they receive the next clue.|$|R
5|$|In 1985, James and Scamper {{qualified}} for the NFR and won five go-rounds at the event. James recalled that it was Friday the 13th during the 7th go-round of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> racing competition when Scamper's bridle fell off his head during the run.|$|E
5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or {{bakelite}} resting bar or support under <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing {{over the side of}} open-top armored personnel carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from bakelite, was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip. <b>The</b> <b>barrel</b> lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E
5|$|Quint, Brody, and Hooper {{set out on}} Quint's boat, the Orca, to {{hunt the}} shark. While Brody lays down a chum line, Quint waits for an {{opportunity}} to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint examines the shark and harpoons a barrel into it, but it drags <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> underwater and disappears.|$|E
50|$|Maker's Mark is aged {{for around}} six years, being bottled and marketed when the company's tasters {{agree that it}} is ready. Maker's Mark {{is one of the few}} {{distillers}} to rotate <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> from <b>the</b> upper to the lower levels of the aging warehouses during the aging process to even out the differences in temperature during the process. The upper floors are exposed to the greatest temperature variations during the year, so rotating <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> ensures that <b>the</b> bourbon in all <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> have <b>the</b> same quality and taste.|$|R
5000|$|On some levels, <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> {{appear with}} just their tops, without the body beneath it. Jumping off a barrel makes it disappear, {{becoming}} inaccessible for Pogo Joe. Once Pogo Joe becomes trapped and cannot jump anywhere any more, the game advances {{to the next}} level. Pogo Joe receives [...] "Shadow Bonus" [...] points if few enough barrels are left on the level. Also, on some levels, <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> initially appear as invisible, and the player has to guess where <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> are so Pogo Joe can jump on them.|$|R

5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, it was {{possible}} to increase the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{attempts}} {{to rescue the}} freighter Sanction, which is trapped in a star's magnetic field. An agreement is reached to transport over {{the crew of the}} freighter, but they surprisingly send over a cargo barrel first. The Enterprise crew {{attempts to}} transport the freighter's crew, but is only successful in recovering four of them before their ship is destroyed. Two, T'Jon (Merritt Butrick) and Romas (Richard Lineback), are scruffy and unshaven, while the other two, Sobi (Judson Scott) and Langor (Kimberly Farr), are groomed and well dressed. They all show relief that <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> made it over, and little remorse for the lost ship and crewmen. Both groups start to fight over the ownership of <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> and are escorted to the observation lounge under guard.|$|E
5|$|The Model 1200 was {{the first}} shotgun to utilize a rotary bolt with four locking lugs secured within <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> extension. The 1200 was Winchester's first shotgun to {{incorporate}} the company's patented Winchoke system, a quick change tube to allow the easy replacement of chokes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hi! {{let me get}} down! Do {{you want}} to burn me up?" [...] yelled the story-teller of the school, suddenly, as, chancing to glance down, he saw that <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> were on fire. [...] "Let me down, I say!" [...] And he made a leap from <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> into <b>the</b> midst of the crowd.|$|R
60|$|More {{water was}} thrown on <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> {{and then a}} small army of cadets {{commenced}} to dig up dirt and stones, with which to cover the burning objects. This worked very well on <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b> But to reach the trees was different. One thick cedar was blazing away like a torch--the flames far above their heads.|$|R

5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match {{the lay of the}} river bed. The differences however could point to the repeated use of differently-sized falsework structures in the construction of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> vaults (see animation below).|$|E
5|$|The similar Dardanelles Guns (for the location) {{were created}} by Munir Ali in 1464 and were still in use during the Anglo-Turkish War (1807–09). These were cast in bronze into two parts, the chase (<b>the</b> <b>barrel)</b> and the breech, which {{combined}} weighed 18.4tonnes. The two parts were screwed together using levers to facilitate moving it.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescopic}} sight on the M6 and both elevation and traverse controls were {{located on the}} left side, so one gunner was able to aim the gun. The traverse gear had a release mechanism which allowed free movement of <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> in case a quick traverse was needed.|$|E
50|$|Prohibition in the United States created {{opportunity}} in West Dover from 1920 - 1933 for rum running. Rum running {{was something that}} supplemented fishing income and was risky but highly profitable. The fishermen would set out with a load of alcohol on moonless nights and navigate in the darkness to the coast of Maine. The alcohol was stored in wooden barrels loaded with salt. If the fishermen noticed law enforcement vessels they would dump <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> overboard. <b>The</b> salt in <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> would slowly dissolve. A few hours later, after the law enforcement officials had left, <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> would float {{back up to the}} surface and be brought back on board.|$|R
50|$|Standard barrel racing {{patterns}} {{call for}} a precise distance between the start line and <b>the</b> first <b>barrel,</b> from <b>the</b> first to <b>the</b> second <b>barrel,</b> and from <b>the</b> second to <b>the</b> third <b>barrel.</b> <b>The</b> pattern from every point of the cloverleaf will have a precisely measured distance from one point to the next.|$|R
