5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> disease for individuals having a specific allele and <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> {{posterior}} <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> guilt can, of course, also be {{computed for}} the other two outcomes, namely, filler IDs and lineup rejections (Wells, Yang, & Smalarz, 2015). For example, if <b>the</b> prior <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> guilt are even (i.e., half target-present lineups, half target-absent lineups), one can ask about <b>the</b> posterior <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> guilt for <b>the</b> subset of lineups {{that resulted in a}} filler ID or No ID. Given either of those outcomes, laboratory studies suggest that <b>the</b> posterior <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> guilt are slightly less than even (Wells, Smalarz, et al., 2015, Wells, Smith, et al., 2015, Wells, Yang, et al., 2015), which means that filler IDs and lineup rejections are slightly probative of innocence. However, our focus here, like most of the focus in the prior academic literature, is on the far more consequential outcome, suspect IDs (and the corresponding measures, namely, the HR and the FAR). In other words, our main focus is on the measures that once led the field to conclude that sequential lineups are diagnostically superior to simultaneous lineups.|$|R
5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills {{and the difficulty of}} the task. In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E
5|$|Family {{studies on}} {{schizophrenia}} were reviewed. That the disorder runs in families did not suggest it was genetically inherited, since cultural transmission occurs from parents to children. Twin and adoption studies were presented {{as the standard}} methods to disentangle contributions from genes and the environment. Gottesman used a computer-based method for calculating <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> becoming schizophrenic based on the many causes. The book examines the problems caused by schizophrenia for relatives of patients and for society at large, larger-scale ones exemplified by the eugenics policies of states such as Nazi Germany. Two final chapters cover molecular biology and neuroanatomy briefly. Newer methods of behavioral genetics being researched {{at the time of}} publication, such as linkage analysis which used the likelihood of neighboring genes being inherited together, were not covered.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> cure {{vary depending}} on the tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{reversibility}} of new/novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) is {{not well}} understood, whereas the reversal strategies for bleeding associated with vitamin k antagonists (VKA), such as warfarin, is well established.

Objectives This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials determines <b>the</b> relative <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> fatal bleeding given that a patient suffered a major bleed while on NOAC versus VKA therapy. Search Methods Data on major and fatal bleeding events was sought from randomized controlled trials of NOAC agents compared to VKAs. Main Results 20 trials {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. From which, 4056 first-time, major bleeding events were reported and included in the primary analysis. <b>The</b> summary <b>odds</b> ratio for <b>the</b> conditional <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> fatal bleeding given that a major bleeding event occurred was 0. 65 [0. 52, 0. 81] favoring the NOAC agents (p = 0. 0001). <b>The</b> reduced <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> fatal bleeding with NOACs was not demonstrated after controlling for bleeding location. Given that an intracra-nial bleeding event occurred, <b>the</b> summary <b>odds</b> ratio for <b>the</b> conditional <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> fatal bleed-ing was 0. 96 [0. 70, 1. 32].

5|$|In Britain, {{a number}} of {{scientists}} considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat tackled the problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it could fall into German hands. Unsure {{as to how to}} go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> success at 100,000 to 1.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to traverse {{the asteroid belt}} was Pioneer 10, which entered the region on 16 July 1972. At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by 12 spacecraft without incident. Pioneer 11, Voyagers 1 and 2 and Ulysses passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. Galileo imaged 951 Gaspra in 1991 and 243 Ida in 1993, NEAR imaged 253 Mathilde in 1997, Cassini imaged 2685 Masursky in 2000, Stardust imaged 5535 Annefrank in 2002, New Horizons imaged 132524 APL in 2006, Rosetta imaged 2867 Šteins in September 2008 and 21 Lutetia in July 2010, and Dawn orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited Ceres since March 2015. On its way to Jupiter, Juno traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data. Due to the low density of materials within the belt, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> a probe running into an asteroid are now estimated at less than one in a billion.|$|E
5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} the capture of a planet from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or free-floating planets, in a process similar to the capture of irregular satellites around the giant planets, leaving one in a stable orbit around the Sun. A planet that originated in a system with a number of Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of capture by another star. Although this increases <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> the Sun capturing another planet from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing the probability of a planet being captured on an orbit like that proposed for Planet Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where the capture takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the planet, potentially allowing this capture scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of the capture of a free-floating planet is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated free-floating planets being captured on orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.|$|E

5|$|Following Jutland, Barham {{was under}} repair until 5 July 1916. On {{the evening of}} 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in {{response}} to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on 19 August, based on extensive reconnaissance conducted by Zeppelins and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnoughts and 6 battlecruisers while the Germans mustered 18 dreadnoughts and 2 battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commander of the High Seas Fleet, received conflicting intelligence; after reaching the location in the North Sea where they expected to encounter the High Seas Fleet, the British turned north in the erroneous belief that they had entered a minefield. Scheer turned south again, then steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers under Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. The British and the German fleets returned home; the British lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and one German dreadnought had been torpedoed. After returning to port, Jellicoe issued an order that prohibited risking the fleet in the southern half of the North Sea due to the overwhelming risk from mines and U-boats unless <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> defeating the High Seas Fleet in a decisive engagement were favourable.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E
