Two viral gene products—a protease, V-CATH, and a chitinase, chiA—have {{been shown to}} be required for liquefaction to occur. It has been generally accepted that the primary functions of these proteins is to degrade the proteinaceous and chitinous components of the host cadaver, respectively. We have generated suggestive evidence, however, that chiA may also serve as a molecular chaperone for proV-CATH, the precursor of V-CATH. When cells were infected with virus lacking a functional chiA gene, proV-CATH failed <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>processing</b> in vivo and in vitro and formed insoluble aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells. Thus, expression of chiA may be required for the proper folding of the nascent V-CATH polypeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum.

40|$|On a droplet-based Labs-on-Chip (LoC) device, tiny {{volumes of}} fluids, {{so-called}} droplets, flow in channels of micrometer scale. The droplets contain chemical/biological samples that are processed by different modules on the LoC. In current solutions, an LoC is a single-purpose device {{that is designed}} for a specific application, which limits its flexibility. In order to realize a multi-purpose system, different modules are interconnected in a microfluidic network - yielding so-called Networked LoCs (NLoCs). In NLoCs, the droplets are routed to the desired modules by exploiting hydrodynamic forces. A well established topology for NLoCs are ring networks. However, the addressing schemes provided {{so far in the}} literature only allow to address multiple modules by re-injecting the droplet at the source every time, which is a very complex task and increases the risk of ruining the sample.

40|$|The present thesis {{investigated}} how {{words are}} processed {{within the context}} of visual search. Both explicit and implicit measures were used to assess whether spatial attention is a prerequisite for words <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>processing.</b> In the explicit search task, subjects searched a display and indicated whether a word was present or absent among nonword distractors. In the implicit task, priming was employed to index word processing. Subjects viewed the same search displays that were used in the explicit task, however, the displays were presented briefly and were followed by a single target letter string to which subjects performed a lexical decision. In Experiments 3 through 6, in which the target was always presented at fixation, no priming was evident. In Experiments 7 and 8 when the location of the target moved from trial to trial, priming was observed. It is argued that attentional resources are narrowly allocated to a location in visual space when target location is certain but diffusely allocated when target location is uncertain. Furthermore, processing only occurs for words that fall within the suffusion of this strategically pliable attentional beam. The results are also interpreted within the domains of perceptual cuing and attentional capture...|$|R

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of {{the first member of}} this family from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The enzyme, which has been named krp for KEX 2 -related protease, is a type I membrane-bound endopeptidase that cleaves substrates after pairs of dibasic residues.

Krp is N-glycosylated on all five of its potential sites and both the pre-sequence and the pro-sequence are quickly removed following translocation, the latter probably by autocatalytic cleavage. The inhibitor profile of krp broadly reflects the known properties of the eukaryotic subtilisin proteases, while its pH and Ca 2 + dependence are consistent with it being active within the secretory pathway.

40|$|Intrinsic to {{the life}} cycle of {{hepatitis}} delta virus (HDV) is the fact that its RNAs undergo different forms of posttranscriptional RNA processing. Transcripts of both the genomic RNA and its exact complement, the antigenomic RNA, undergo ribozyme cleavage and RNA ligation. In addition, antigenomic RNA transcripts can undergo 5 � capping, 3 � polyadenylation, and even RNA editing by an adenosine deaminase. This study focused on the processing of antigenomic RNA transcripts. Two approaches were used to study the relationship between the events of polyadenylation, ribozyme cleavage, and RNA ligation. The first represented an examination under more controlled conditions of mutations in the poly(A) signal, AAUAAA, which is essential for this processing. We found that when a separate stable source of �Ag-S, the small delta protein, was provided, the replication ability of the mutated RNA was restored. The second approach involved an examination of the processing in transfected cells of specific Pol II DNA-directed transcripts of HDV antigenomic sequences. The DNA constructs used were such that the RNA transcripts were antigenomic and began at the same 5 � site as the mRNA produced during RNA-directed HDV genome replication. A series of such constructs was assembled in order to test the relative abilities of the transcripts <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>processing</b> by polyadenylation or ribozyme cleavage at sites further 3 � on a multimer of HDV sequences.

Membrane association of NS 2 and the autocatalytic nature of the NS 2 / 3 processing event have so far constituted hurdles to the detailed investigation of this reaction. We now report the first biochemical characterization of the self-processing activity of a purified NS 2 / 3 precursor. Using multiple sequence alignments, {{we were able to}} define a minimal domain, devoid of membrane-anchoring sequences, which was still capable of performing the processing reaction. This truncated protein was efficiently expressed and processed in Escherichia coli. The processing reaction could be significantly suppressed by growth in minimal medium in the absence of added zinc ions, leading to the accumulation of an unprocessed precursor protein in inclusion bodies. This protein was purified to homogeneity, refolded, and shown <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>processing</b> at the authentic NS 2 /NS 3 cleavage site with rates comparable to those observed using an in vitro-translated full-length NS 2 / 3 precursor. Size-exclusion chromatography and a dependence of the processing rate on the concentration of truncated NS 2 / 3 suggested a functional multimerization of the precursor protein. However, we were unable to observe trans cleavage activity between cleavage-site mutants and active-site mutants. Furthermore, the cleavage reaction of the wild-type protein was not inhibited by addition of a mutant that was unable <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> self-processing. Site-directed mutagenesis data and the independence of the processing rate from the nature of the added metal ion argue in favor of NS 2 / 3 being a cysteine protease having Cys 993 and His 952 as a catalytic dyad.

T cell clones specific for penicillin G or BPO-HSA were established and their phenotype and reactivity to both forms of the beta-lactam were analyzed. T cell clones stimulated by penicillin G were CD 4 and CD 8 positive, whereas BPO-HSA stimulated the growth of CD 4 + T cells. The penicillin G-specific clones were HLA class I or class II restricted and processing was not required as fixed APC could still present penicillin G. In contrast, BPO-HSA has <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>processing</b> <b>to</b> stimulate BPO-HSA-specific T cell clones. In addition to classical APC, activated MHC class II expressing T cells could also restimulate the penicillin G-specific clones, indicating that various cell types might serve as APC. Penicillin G and BPO-HSA-specific T cell clones produced a heterogeneous cytokine pattern as most clones produced high amounts of IL- 2, IFN-gamma, TFN-alpha, and rather variable levels of IL- 4 and IL- 5. Since no Ag processing was required, penicillin G may stimulate T cells by binding directly to MHC molecules on the cell surface or to their embedded peptide. Alternatively, it may bind to soluble proteins like HSA, which are processed and subsequently presented in an immunogenic form. These different modes of presentation, which elicit a variety of immunological reactivities, may explain the great heterogeneity of the clinical pictures seen in penicillin allergy.

In addition, the ability of ORF B <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> <b>processing</b> through an alternative pathway was identified. Mutation of either of the p 48 catalytic residues eliminated the capability of p 48 to complement the δp 48 mutant virus, suggesting that these residues are essential for in trans rescue (Chapter 2). Extensive deletion/addition analyses identified two independent but redundant p 48 functional domains that are essential for virus replication. The first functional domain is between amino acids Thr 169 -Glu 302 and the second functional domain is between amino acids 330 - 418. The requirements for p 48 function were found to be different when p 48 was provided in trans than when provided in cis. Whereas only one functional domain is required for viral replication when p 48 is supplied in cis, neither functional domain alone is sufficient for complementation of the δp 48 mutant virus (Chapter 3). The information gained from these studies has significantly increased our knowledge of the requirements and role of p 48 in hypovirus replication and provided new insights into the diversity of replication strategies employed by positive strand RNA viruses...|$|R
40|$|Bmdsx is an orthologue of the sex-determining gene doublesex (dsx) {{and known}} to be sex-specifically {{expressed}} in various tissues of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Its pre-mRNA is sex-specifically spliced and encodes female-specific or male-specific polypeptides. The open reading frame of Bmdsx consists of 5 exons, of which exons 3 and 4 are female-specific and its pre-mRNA was known <b>to</b> <b>undergo</b> default <b>processing</b> <b>to</b> generate the female-type mRNA. Previous reports {{have shown that the}} mechanism of splicing of the doublesex gene is different in Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori. However, intron 4 is so long {{that it is difficult to}} identify the intronic cis-element(s) required for male-specific splicing of Bmdsx pre-mRNA using Bmdsx minigenes whose introns are shortened in various manners. As a first step toward discovery of the cis-element, the Bmdsx mini gene, which consisted of exon 1 and 5 and internally shortened introns 2 to 4, was constructed, and transgenic silkworms expressing this construct were generated. Bmdsx pre-mRNA transcribed derived from transgene was sex-specifically spliced. This result shows that the mini gene contained the information necessary for the correct regulation of alternative splicing...|$|R
