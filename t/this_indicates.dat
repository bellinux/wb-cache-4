5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} horse was an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in the dire wolf diet. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores.|$|E

This {{was the first}} instance of a non-native marine species being found in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were discovered to have spread into British Columbia, Canada. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> that C.mutica have completely expanded up the entire west coast of North America.|$|E
5|$|F. rubiginosa is {{exclusively}} pollinated in {{a symbiotic}} relationship with Pleistodontes imperialis, a species of fig wasp. Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term the P. imperialis species complex. They diverge {{to a greater degree}} than some distinct wasp species, yet form a monophyletic group; <b>this</b> <b>indicates</b> that the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E
5|$|In 1965 LeMessurier and Hills {{published}} A thermodynamic approach {{arising from}} a study on Torres Strait diving techniques, which suggests that decompression by conventional models forms bubbles that are then eliminated by re-dissolving at the decompression stops—which is slower than elimination while still in solution. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> the importance of minimizing bubble phase for efficient gas elimination, Groupe d'Etudes et Recherches Sous-marines published the French Navy MN65 decompression tables, and Goodman and Workman introduced re-compression tables using oxygen to accelerate elimination of inert gas.|$|E

5|$|Lekson {{developed}} a theory called the Chaco Meridian, {{which is based}} on architectural similarities between the Ancestral Puebloan sites at Aztec Ruins and Chaco Canyon, and Paquime at Casas Grandes in northern Mexico. He believes the sites were intentionally located on the same approximate line of longitude (107°57'25"), and <b>this</b> <b>indicates</b> a ceremonial connection between them. The Great North Road roughly follows the Chaco Meridian, and many of the ancient roads in the area appear to follow it towards key sites in the basin.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} of different ages, is well studied {{in regards to}} its growth and development. Throughout ontogeny, the skull of Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became proportionally smaller. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E

5|$|S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids {{are more}} common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun. The spectra of their {{surfaces}} reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. <b>This</b> <b>indicates</b> that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo, and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.|$|E

Health is only restored through automatic recharging when the player is not taking fire.
