5|$|Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't {{do things}} by halves.... Upon the screen he {{discovered}} an area {{large enough for}} his expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence is <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts.

In act 5, scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its constant stream of tears (Myrrha's tears). The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses, just like his previously written poem, Venus and Adonis, did.|$|E

She arrives, handing him a letter from his detective, and they sing about how exactly in agreement are their ideas on economy. Caroline is disconcerted that Rudolph insists on courting her in the market square, but he explains <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> a law compelling couples to do all courting in the square so as to increase the value of his properties around the square. She approves of this example of economy.|$|E

500|$|Danny Boyle, the film's director, {{speaking}} on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said, [...] " [...] was what Shakespeare used to do. He would {{take some of the}} facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it. And that's what's wonderful about the writing I think, is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs, the people he hurt. But in the end, he brings it back to a very simple father-daughter relationship that he has to admit <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> {{some of the most beautiful}} things in the world." ...|$|E

500|$|Superhuman {{psychologist}} Leonard Samson says of Osborn: [...] "In clinical terms, {{the words}} psychotic and psychopathic {{are far from}} synonymous... but in Norman Osborn's case, both apply. I'd characterise him as a bipolar psychotic with concurrent aspects of psychopathic megalomania and malignant narcissism. In layman's terms, a lethal cocktail of intersecting personality disorders that makes {{him one of the}} most dangerous human beings on the planet." [...] There are many examples of Osborn's pronounced superiority complex, to the point that he will rarely, if ever, admit <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> mistakes. He often transfers blame for his shortcomings to others or claims that he was better than he was; even before his accident, he spent more time providing Harry with gifts or outings rather than actually being there for his son or trying to listen to his problems, and nevertheless claims that he was still a good father, likely due to the abusive nature of his own father.|$|E

Thomas Gonlianpoulous of Spin commended Swizz Beatz' [...] "bombastic production", Wayne's [...] "energetic yet nonsensical rap", and Brown's [...] "joyful, brisk vocals." [...] Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song, serving as lead single, says [...] "Brown's promise {{for the future is}} to be an altogether more interesting kind of RB& artist." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly referred to the song as a [...] "swaggering" [...] lead single. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times referred to the song as a type <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> his specialty, and called it an [...] "electric, brassy collaboration." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the song [...] "a brutal, tuneless hunk of industrial R - as musically ugly as something like 'With You' was pretty", he said [...] "for that matter, this track rocks", commenting [...] "Whatever you may think of him, you can't deny that Chris Brown lacks balls." [...] Jude Rogers of BBC Music said the song was catchy, but was one of the album's tracks that were a [...] "pale imitation of Justin Timberlake album tracks." ...|$|E
