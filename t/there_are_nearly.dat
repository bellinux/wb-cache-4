For this last one, the Turkish term Tanzimat Fermanı is more accurate.

5|$|According to {{a survey}} in 1989–90, Tripura hosts 90 land mammal species from 65 genera and 10 orders, {{including}} such species as elephant (Elephas maximus), bear (Melursus ursinus), binturong (Arctictis binturong), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), porcupine (Artherurus assamensis), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), sambar (Cervus unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), gaur (Bos gaurus), leopard (Panthera pardus), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and many species of small cats and primates. Out of 15 free ranging primates of India, seven are found in Tripura; this is {{the highest number of}} primate species found in any Indian state. The wild buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is extinct now. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 300 species of birds in the state.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of the Netherlands, the Grave Registration units of 2nd Army began the task of {{identifying}} the British dead. They were buried together in a field that is on permanent loan to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission just north of Oosterbeek. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 1,800 graves {{in what is now}} known as the Airborne Cemetery, ¾ of which are for those killed during the 1944 battle. By 2003, there were still 138 men unaccounted for and human remains, equipment and weaponry continue to be dug up in the farmland around the city.|$|E
5|$|Due to Madagascar's highly {{seasonal}} climate, lemur evolution {{has produced a}} level of species diversity rivaling {{that of any other}} primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male gorilla. Today, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 100 species of lemurs, and most of those species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used. Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.|$|E

5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} is controversial, {{and not all}} experts agree, {{particularly with}} the recent {{increase in the number}} of recognized species. According to Russell Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International (CI), taxonomist Colin Groves, and others, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 100recognized species or subspecies of extant (or living) lemur, divided into five families and 15genera. Because genetic data indicates that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs were closely related to living lemurs, an additional three families, eight genera, and 17species can be included in the total. In contrast, other experts have labeled this as taxonomic inflation, instead preferring a total closer to 50 species.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{planners}} {{designed the}} system with passenger safety and order maintenance as primary considerations. The open vaulted ceiling design of stations {{and the limited}} obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal criminal activity. Station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism and provide for diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights. Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind, has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 6,000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security.|$|E
5|$|Perl is {{implemented}} as a core interpreter, written in C, {{together with a}} large collection of modules, written in Perl and C. , the interpreter is 150,000 lines of C code and compiles to a 1MB executable on typical machine architectures. Alternatively, the interpreter can be compiled to a link library and embedded in other programs. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> 500 modules in the distribution, comprising 200,000 lines of Perl and an additional 350,000 lines of C code (much of the C code in the modules consists of character encoding tables).|$|E

5|$|Transportation in Minnesota is {{overseen by}} the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT for short and used in the local news media).

The major Interstate highways are Interstate35 (I-35), I-90, and I-94, with I-35 and I-94 passing through the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area, and I-90 traveling east-west along {{the southern edge of}} the state. In 2006, a constitutional amendment was passed that required sales and use taxes on motor vehicles to fund transportation, with at least 40 percent dedicated to public transit. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>nearly</b> two dozen rail corridors in Minnesota, most of which go through Minneapolis–St. Paul or Duluth.
