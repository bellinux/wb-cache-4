5|$|By 1790, on the {{political}} front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established {{the separation of the}} <b>three</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia's permission, and again the Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France. Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.|$|E

25|$|Finally, in Federalist No. 51, Madison {{argued that}} {{to create a}} {{government}} that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly.

25|$|Most recently, the {{government}} of Serbia announced its decision to move the Constitutional Court of Serbia to this town {{as part of the}} national strategy for decentralization.

The court will probably occupy the building of the magistrate some time during 2010.

25|$|A crucial {{reason why}} {{governmental}} powers are separated among <b>three</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> – the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary – is {{so that the}} exercise of power by one branch may be checked by the other two branches. In addition to approving the Government's expenditure of public funds, Parliament exercises a check over the Cabinet {{through the power of}} MPs to question the Prime Minister and other Ministers regarding the Government's policies and decisions. MPs may put questions to Ministers relating to affairs within their official functions, or bills, motions or other public matters connected with the business of Parliament for which they are responsible. Questions may also be put to other MPs relating to matters that they are responsible for. However, this is a weak check when most of the MPs are members of the political party in power, as they are constrained by party discipline to adhere to the policies it espouses.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of March 21–23, John Brown Baldwin of the Valley’s Augusta County made a Unionist speech, {{beginning}} with a defense of “African slavery, as it exists in Virginia, is a right and a good thing…” But {{he believed that the}} idea that the election of someone to the Presidency could justify secession “as a direct assault upon the fundamental principles of American liberty”. The <b>three</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> with their Constitutional checks and balances protect against “encroachment upon the liberties of the minority of the people or upon the rights of the States.” And even with the withdrawal of Southern delegations, the remaining Republican majority passed a Constitutional Amendment for ratification prohibiting the Federal Government to interfere with slavery in the states in any respect. “...the great masses of people, leaving out the politicians and fanatics of both sections, have this day an earnest yearning for each other, and for peace and Union with each other…” Baldwin sought a conference of border states to adopt the Peace Convention recommendations that he believed would cause the Confederate states to separately return to the Union.|$|E
500|$|The Polish {{constitution}} {{was one of}} several to reflect Enlightenment influences, in particular Rousseau's social contract and Montesquieu's advocacy of a separation and balance of powers between the <b>three</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> and his advocacy of a bicameral legislature. Once the government was established, it aimed to ensure, in accordance with Article V, that [...] "the integrity of the states, civil liberty, and social order shall always remain in equilibrium". According to Polish-American historian Jacek Jędruch, the liberality of its provisions [...] "fell somewhere below [...] the French, above the Canadian, and left the Prussian far behind", but did not equal the American Constitution". King Stanisław August Poniatowski said the new {{constitution was}} [...] "founded principally on those of England and the United States of America, but avoiding the faults and errors of both, and adapted as much as possible to the local and particular circumstances of the country." [...] George Sanford said that the Polish constitution provided [...] "a constitutional monarchy close to the English model of the time." ...|$|E
