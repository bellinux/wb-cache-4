25|$|Handicap International {{estimates}} {{that up to}} 50 percent of people injured during the attacks have sustained severe injuries that will require rehabilitation to prevent permanent disability. Of the 1.5 million {{people living in the}} Gaza Strip, international and national agencies working in disability and rehabilitation estimate that, even before the military operation, over 10 percent had moderate or severe impairments. They estimate that as many as half of the 5,380 men, women and children injured over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> of conflict may suffer lifelong impairment, exacerbated by the inability of rehabilitation workers to provide early intervention. These agencies has highlighted the importance of providing early intervention for those newly injured, especially those discharged prematurely from health facilities; re-establishing and strengthening the capacity of rehabilitation services and disabled peoples organizations to respond to the increased need. This is especially critical given that the main provider of specialist rehabilitation services in Gaza sustained severe damage and is not yet fully operational. Even before 27 December, {{the first day of the}} attacks, there was already a back-log of people waiting for specialised services including rehabilitation and surgery.|$|E

Secret reports that can be obtained by completing additional missions after beating the game reveal that Joshua, after seeing the change in personality of Neku over the weeks of playing the game, decides to spare Shibuya, now believing the city to be ideal. The game ends with Neku abandoning his headphones, before a title card appears entitled [...] "The World Begins with You".|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} games, God of War: Ascension {{is set in}} an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian Gods, Titans, and other beings from Greek mythology. Game events are set six months after Kratos killed his family, and ten years before the original God of War (2005); Chains of Olympus (2008) takes place some time between Ascension and God of War. The game's narrative takes place over four weeks; it shifts between the present (the fourth <b>week)</b> and <b>past</b> (<b>the</b> preceding <b>three</b> <b>weeks),</b> while the player controls Kratos in both. Several locations, including the Prison of the Damned and some real-world locations—including the village Kirra, the city Delphi, and the island Delos—are explored in the game.|$|R

He spoke with some friendliness of the man Bates.|$|R
40|$|Glucose {{molecules}} {{are joined}} to protein molecules to form stable ketoamines, or fructosamines, through glycation, a nonenzymatic mechanism involving a labile Schiff base inter-mediate and the Amadori rearrangement. The amount of fructosamine in serum is increased in diabetes mellitus {{owing to the}} abnormally high concentration of sugar in blood. The concentration of fructosamine in serum thus reflects the degree of glycemic control attained by the diabetic patient and is useful in monitoring the effectiveness of therapy in diabetes {{over a period of}} several weeks, in a manner analogous to the determination of glycated hemoglobin. 01 the analytical approaches used to measure fructosamine, affinity chromatography with m-aminophenylboronic acid and the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction method appear to be the most practical means for clinical chemists to assay fructosa-mine quickly, economically, and accurately. Fructosamine values can readily distinguish normal individuals and diabetic patients in good glycemic control from diabetics in poor control. Unlike glycated hemoglobin, which reflects the aver-age blood sugar concentration over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> six to eight weeks, fructosamine reflects the average blood sugar con-centration over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two to <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> Thus a clinical advantage is that fructosamine responds more quickly to changes in therapy, thereby allowing for improved glycemic control. Used in conjunction with determinations of blood sugar and (or) of glycated hemoglobin, or by itself, the fructosamine assay can provide clinically useful information for the detection and control of diabetes.

40|$|Psychiatric {{disorders}} affect up to {{one third}} of patients with non-psychiatric diseases. 1 - 5 Nevertheless, despite the high prevalence of psychopathology in general medical patients, only between 30 - 50 % of all cases are detected. 2, 6 - 8 Some {{have suggested that the}} difficulty in the detection and diagnosis of mental disorders among patients who seek medical attention for other reasons, lies in the lack of screening questions that might alert the physician to the possibility of a psychiatric co-morbidity. 9 Such questions would identify medical patients at high risk of psychiatric problems. Previous work on clinical predictors of psychopathology have identified the following: specific physical symptoms 10 - 11; patient report of severity of illness 11; recent stress 12, 13; low self-perception of health status 13; and age less than 50. 14 Two specific studies on the detection of psychopathology in the general medical population are worth highlighting. The first, by Jackson and his research team 13 updating a 2001 study evaluating a prediction model with four parameters (recent stress, severity of physical symptoms, five or more specific symptoms, self-assessment of physical condition). They found that those patients who report recent stress, have five or more physical symptoms or a low self-perception of their health state are at a higher risk of having a psychiatric disorder. The second study, by Lowe et al. published in 2003, 9 examines a series of factors that could serve as indicators of psychopathology in ambulatory medical (i. e. non-psychiatric) patients. After evaluating several different models they found that the combination of four of factors (taken as a group) had a high sensitivity (86 %), specificity (100 %), positive predictive value (100 %), and negative predictive value (91 %). This suggests that a physician could use the combination of these four indicators to evaluate for the presence of co morbid mental disorders. These factors are: self-reported tension/anxiety/stress present at least 14 days of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> four weeks, a sensation of sadness/despair at least 14 days of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two <b>weeks,</b> <b>three</b> or more physical symptoms, and relationships troubles.
