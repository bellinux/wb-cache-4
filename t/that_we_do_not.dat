Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but {{if they were the}} ones no longer relevant in his own time, it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt then {{comments}} {{on some of}} the other characters seen not in isolation but as they interact with and affect one another, comparing and contrasting them to highlight subtle differences. For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> even like to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, given the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E

5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

25|$|Peter Singer, a bioethicist {{and author}} of Animal Liberation {{published}} in 1975, suggested that consciousness {{is not necessarily the}} key issue: just because animals have smaller brains, or are ‘less conscious’ than humans, {{does not mean that they}} are not capable of feeling pain. He goes on further to argue <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> assume newborn infants, people suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases or people with learning disabilities experience less pain than we would.|$|E

However, Dominic will no longer be playing music or working on behalf of Love Equals Death.

25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E
25|$|Many consequentialist {{theories}} {{may seem}} {{primarily concerned with}} human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue {{that we should not}} limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.|$|E

As a result of this, the {{presence of}} a U.S. aircraft carrier in a foreign port has occasionally provoked protest from local people, for example when USS Nimitz docked in Chennai, India, in 2007. At that time, the Strike Group commander Rear Admiral John Terence Blake stated that: [...] "The U.S. policy is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> routinely deploy nuclear weapons on board Nimitz." ...|$|E
500|$|Al-Tamimi is {{an admirer}} of Indian {{independence}} leader Mahatma Gandhi and believes that armed conflict against a more powerful Israeli opponent will only bring disaster. Al-Tamimi states that he advocates nonviolent resistance, telling a reporter in 2011, [...] "Our strategic choice of a popular struggle—as a means to fight the occupation taking over our lands, lives and future—is a declaration <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> harm human lives. The very essence of our activity opposes killing." [...] However, he has stated he is not concerned as to whether stone-throwing {{is a form of}} violence, but views it instead as a symbol of Palestinian resistance: [...] "We see our stones as our message." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{last meeting}} between Zwingli and Luther {{was at the}} Marburg Colloquy of October 1529, {{organised}} by Philip of Hesse and attended by various leading reformers, including Bucer. Luther and Zwingli agreed on 13 of the 14 topics discussed, but Zwingli did not accept {{the doctrine of the}} real presence, on which Luther would not compromise. After the discussion broke down between the two, Bucer tried to salvage the situation, but Luther noted, [...] "It is obvious <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have one and the same spirit."

[...] By the next month, she moderated her concern, but expressed opposition to any congressional [...] "slicing and dicing" [...] that would separate energy and climate concerns. [...] Attempts to pass any kind of climate legislation collapsed in July 2010 due to lack of enough votes in the Senate; Browner appeared on behalf of the administration and said, [...] "Obviously, everyone is disappointed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> yet have an agreement on comprehensive legislation." ...|$|E

The case {{then went to the}} Court of Appeal, where, in light of the new DNA evidence available, Hodgson's conviction was quashed. The judgement, which was delivered by Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, on 18March 2009 concluded: [...] "The decision leaves some important, unanswered questions. Perhaps the most important is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know who raped and killed the dead girl. We can but hope {{for the sake of the}} appellant and the family of the murdered girl that her killer may yet be identified and brought to justice. But for now all we can do is to quash the conviction. It is accordingly quashed. The appellant will be discharged. There will be no new trial." ...|$|E
