5|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} highlighted its comedic achievement. Game Informer said it {{is frequently}} hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released. IGN praised The Stick of Truth for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others said {{that as well as}} being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend. Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to South Park fans; some jokes are lost on <b>the</b> <b>uninitiated</b> but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players' familiarity with the source material. IGN said that it is the game South Park fans have always wanted, but some reviewers said that without the South Park license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.|$|E

[...] In Isis, Leo Roberts wrote that while Russell was a deft and witty writer, A History of Western Philosophy was perhaps the worst of Russell's books.

25|$|Eating meat : Both {{initiated}} and uninitiated Sikhs {{are strictly}} prohibited from eating meat from animals slaughtered by halal method, known as Kutha meat, where {{the animal is}} killed by exsanguination (via throat-cutting). According to Eleanor Nesbitt, the general issue of vegetarianism versus non-vegetarianism is controversial within Sikhism, and contemporary Sikhs disagree. The ban on kutha meat, along with ban on any sexual relations with Muslims and a ban on smoking habit common among 18th-century Indian Muslims, states Nesbitt, {{was a part of}} Sikh Guru's efforts to socially isolate Muslims. Amritdhari Sikhs, or those baptised with the Amrit, have been strict vegetarians, abstaining from all meat and eggs. Sikhs who eat meat seek the Jhatka method of producing meat believing it to cause less suffering to the animal. <b>The</b> <b>uninitiated</b> Sikhs too are not habitual meat-eaters by choice, and beef (cow meat) has been a traditional taboo. Typically meat is not served in community free meals such as langar.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Bacon, the {{influential}} work of Pseudo-Geber (sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto) appeared. His Summa Perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity {{with which they}} were described. By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could {{have an effect on the}} human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead <b>the</b> <b>uninitiated.</b> Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.|$|E

It may perhaps be regarded as a figure of speech, to indicate how few are really admitted to the most exclusive circles. Moreover, there can be no dominant 'leader of society' here, for the reason that not all grades of society would recognize the supremacy of any one set, or clique. These cliques exist for various reasons. They fraternize generally, but keep well within their own circles. Kindred tastes attract some; ancient lineage others. There is an ultra-fashionable set, a sporting set, a literary set, an aristocratic set, a rather 'fast' set, a theatrical set--and so on. These may all lay claim with certain justice to membership in good society. Their circles are to an extent exclusive, because some distinction must mark the eligibility of members. And outside each luminous sphere hovers a multitude eager to pass the charmed circle and so acquire recognition.

Tony Sullivan of Eye for Film said it is [...] "beautifully acted, shot and scored" [...] but cited the [...] "lack of oomph" [...] as a reason why [...] "the movie is rather dull". Mark Schilling from The Japan Times praised Odagiri but criticized the film for being [...] "a text too tangled and murky for <b>the</b> <b>uninitiated</b> to easily penetrate or parse".

The new series' pilot episode [...] "In Thy Image" [...] was based on a two-page outline by Roddenberry about a NASA probe returning to Earth, having gained sentience. Alan Dean Foster wrote a treatment for the pilot, which Livingston turned into a teleplay. When the script was presented to Michael Eisner, he declared it worthy of being told as a feature film. At the same time, the success of Close Encounters of the Third Kind showed Paramount that Star Wars success in the science fiction genre at the box office could repeat. On November 11, just {{two and a half weeks}} before production on Phase II was due to start, the studio announced that the television series had been cancelled in favor of a new feature film. Cast and crew who had been hired that Monday were laid off by Friday, and construction came to a halt.

60|$|But {{the river}} below the Abbey {{is to be}} traversed by stepping-stones, which, to <b>the</b> female <b>uninitiated</b> foot, appear {{to be full of}} danger. The Wharfe here is no {{insignificant}} brook, to be overcome by a long stride and a jump. There is a causeway, of perhaps forty stones, across it, each some eighteen inches distant from the other, which, flat and excellent though they be, are perilous from their number. Mrs. Lovel, who knew the place of old, had begun by declaring that no consideration should induce her to cross the water. Aunt Julia had proposed that they should go along the other bank, on the Abbey side of the river, and thence cross by the bridge half a mile up. But the Earl was resolved that he would take his cousin over the stepping-stones; and Minnie and the curate were equally determined. Minnie, indeed, had crossed the river, and was back again, while the matter was still being discussed. Aunt Julia, who was strong-limbed, as well as strong-minded, at last assented, the curate having promised all necessary aid. Mrs. Lovel seated herself at a distance to see the exploit; and then Lord Lovel started, with Lady Anna, turning at every stone to give a hand to his cousin.|$|R
60|$|The {{superiority of}} sailing, which a ship fitted for war {{possesses}} over one employed in commerce, proceeds {{from a variety}} of causes. The first is {{in the construction of the}} hull, which in the one is as justly fitted, as the art of naval architecture will allow, to the double purposes of speed and buoyancy; while in the other, the desire of gain induces great sacrifices of these important objects, in order that the vessel may be burthensome. Next comes the difference in the rig, which is not only more square, but more lofty, in a ship of war than in a trader; because the greater force of the crew of the former enables them to manage both spars and sails that are far heavier than any ever used in the latter. Then comes the greater ability of the cruiser to make and shorten sail, since a ship manned by one or two hundred men may safely profit by the breeze to the last moment, while one manned by a dozen often loses hours of a favorable wind, from the weakness of her crew. This explanation will enable <b>the</b> otherwise <b>uninitiated</b> reader to understand the reason why Ludlow had hoped the coming squall would aid his designs on the chase.|$|R
40|$|During the {{welcoming}} {{session at the}} start of every academic year, teachers in Vanier College’s Psychology Department put on a skit to introduce incoming “psychology major” students, in a concise and entertaining manner, to the three different theoretical approaches currently prevailing in the discipline. In the skit, a teacher plays the role of a client who consults a psychotherapist (played by another teacher) for help with a marital problem. Seeking a solution to his problem, the “client” appears on stage three different times and receives treatment from three psychotherapists (played by another teacher) of different theoretical orientations: B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and “Dr. Phil”, the famous American talk-show host (who respectively represent behaviorism, psychoanalysis, and cognitive psychology). Generally speaking, this skit is the first real exposure to psychological theories for the new cohort of students. Based on the feedback received afterwards, it seems to have made a powerful impression on them. Which explains why we keep putting on the same skit year after year! One reason for the impressive success of this simple skit is quite clear: complex ideas can be effectively conveyed to even <b>the</b> most <b>uninitiated</b> in a concise and easily understood manner through dramatic techniques, because drama is engaging, entertaining, and thought-provoking. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
