The observations were made with a dipole rotating in the plane of the ecliptic where the sources are assumed to be. The apparent angular sizes obtained are unexpectedly large. We <b>discuss</b> <b>different</b> <b>explanations</b> for the results. It seems that the scattering of radio waves by electron density inhomogeneities is the most likely cause.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{showed that}} the eyes revisit the location in which the stimulus has been encoded when visual or verbal information is retrieved from memory. A recent study showed that this behavior still occurs 1 week after encoding, suggesting that visual, spatial and linguistic information is tightly associated with the oculomotor trace and stored as an integrated memory representation. However, it is yet unclear whether looking behavior simply remains stable between encoding and recall or whether it changes over time in a more fine-tuned manner. Here, we investigate {{the time course of}} looking behavior during recall in multiple sessions across 1 week. Participants encoded visual objects presented in one of the four locations on the computer screen. In five sessions during the week after encoding, they performed on a visual memory recall task. During retrieval, participants looked back to the encoding location, but only in the recall sessions within 1 day of encoding. We <b>discuss</b> <b>different</b> <b>explanations</b> for the temporal dynamics of looking behavior during recall, searching for the role of eye movements in memory...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Elevated blood {{pressure}} (BP) is frequent {{in patients with}} acute ischemic stroke. Pathophysiological data support its usefulness to maintain adequate perfusion of the ischemic penumba. This review article aims to summarize the available evidence from clinical studies that examined the prognostic role of BP during the acute phase of ischemic stroke and intervention studies that assessed the efficacy of active BP alteration. RECENT FINDINGS: We found 34 observational studies (33, 470 patients), with results being inconsistent among the studies; most studies reported a negative association between increased levels of BP and clinical outcome, whereas a few studies showed clinical improvement with higher BP levels, clinical deterioration with decreased BP, or no association at all. Similarly, the conclusions drawn by the 18 intervention studies included in this review (1637 patients) were also heterogeneous. Very recent clinical data suggest a possible beneficial effect of early treatment with some antihypertensives on late clinical outcome. SUMMARY: Observational and interventional studies of management of acute poststroke hypertension yield conflicting results. We <b>discuss</b> <b>different</b> <b>explanations</b> that may account for this and discuss the current guidelines and pathophysiological considerations {{for the management of}} acute poststroke hypertension...|$|R
40|$|In the ultimatum-game, {{as in many}} real-life social {{exchange}} situations, the selfish {{motive to}} maximize own gains conflicts with fairness preferences. In the present study we manipulated the availability of cognitive-control resources for ultimatum-game proposers to test whether preference for fairness is a deliberative cognitive-controlled act or an automatic act. In two experiments we found that a shortage in cognitive control (ego depletion) led proposers in the ultimatum game to propose significantly more equal split offers than non-depleted proposers. These results {{can be interpreted as}} resulting from an automatic concern for fairness, or from a greater fear of rejection, which would be in line with a purely self-interested response. To separate these competing explanations, in Experiment 2 we conducted a dictator-game in which the responder cannot reject the offer. In contrast to the increased fairness behavior demonstrated by depleted ultimatum-game proposers, we found that depleted dictator-game allocators chose the equal split significantly less often than non-depleted allocators. These results indicate that fairness preferences are automatically driven among ultimatum game proposers. The automatic fair behavior, however, at least partially reflects concern about self-interest gain. We <b>discuss</b> <b>different</b> <b>explanations</b> for these results...|$|R
