5|$|Faramir's {{decision}} {{to reject the}} One Ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to Tolkien from the medieval poem The Battle of Maldon.

In October 2011, however, discussions over Smith returning were halted, due to Fox's refusal to provide the $50 million salary demanded by Smith for the two sequels. Emmerich, however, made assurances that the films would be shot back-to-back, regardless of Smith's involvement.|$|E

5|$|As the {{population}} of German settlers in the region began to increase, <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> Lutheran religious services and education also grew. Ministers, including Henry Muhlenberg disciple Christian Streit, began to establish congregations in the largest communities of western Virginia. Muhlenberg was a German pastor, requested by colonists in Pennsylvania, {{who served as a}} missionary there from 1742 until his death in 1787; he is considered the patriarch of the Lutheran Church in the United States. Johannes Schwarback and Muhlenberg's son, Peter, reportedly visited the Cacapon River Valley between 1763 and 1776 (before Hebron Church's founding). Streit, charged with ministering to a Lutheran congregation in Winchester, settled there on July 19, 1785.|$|E

5|$|In 1972 all {{production}} at Churchill-Redman in Halifax moved to Blaydon with the consequent loss of 350 jobs. This formed {{a part of}} TI's many rationalisation measures taken in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the closure was explained as being due to <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> greater productivity and {{a recognition of the}} low sales generated at the site. A Churchill factory at Bedford which had been operating since 1967 was closed at this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Canadian {{historian}} William H. McNeill gave {{a series}} of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was the argument that it has been the cultural norm for societies to be composed of different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in the belief in a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I was the point in time when <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> homogeneous nations began to weaken.|$|E
5|$|In both Feuchtwanger's {{novel and}} Harlan's film, the {{dramatic}} climax is rape. However, Feuchtwanger posits that Süß has a hidden daughter whom the duke discovers, rapes and who then dies by drowning. The novel then focuses on Süß's grappling with <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> revenge and the tragedy resulting from {{his decision to}} exact vengeance {{for the loss of}} his daughter. Harlan replaced the rape of Süß's daughter by the duke with Süß's rape of an Aryan woman, thus completely inverting Feuchtwanger's plot device from a father's tragic quest for vengeance to the punishment of a Jew for having sexual relations with a Christian.|$|E

5|$|No written {{contemporary}} {{description of}} Shakespeare's physical appearance survives, and no {{evidence suggests that}} he ever commissioned a portrait, so the Droeshout engraving, which Ben Jonson approved of as a good likeness, and his Stratford monument provide perhaps the best evidence of his appearance. From the 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> authentic Shakespeare portraits fuelled claims that various surviving pictures depicted Shakespeare. That demand also led {{to the production of}} several fake portraits, as well as misattributions, repaintings, and relabelling of portraits of other people.|$|E
5|$|Other {{factors may}} include Enlightenment {{thinking}} and {{the examples of}} the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, a brief boom in textile {{manufacture}} {{was followed}} by periods of chronic economic depression, particularly among textile weavers and spinners (the textile trade was concentrated in Lancashire). Weavers who could have expected to earn 15shillings for a six-day week in 1803, saw their wages cut to 5shillings or even 4s6d by 1818. The industrialists, who were cutting wages without offering relief, blamed market forces generated by the aftershocks of the Napoleonic Wars. Exacerbating matters were the Corn Laws, the first of which was passed in 1815, imposing a tariff on foreign grain in an effort to protect English grain producers. The cost of food rose as people were forced to buy the more expensive and lower quality British grain, and periods of famine and chronic unemployment ensued, increasing <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> political reform both in Lancashire and in the country at large.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sterilization}} {{is considered}} a permanent procedure, {{it is possible to}} attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal. Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

5|$|Male {{grasshoppers}} {{spend much}} of the day stridulating, singing more actively under optimal conditions and being more subdued when conditions are adverse; females also stridulate, but their efforts are insignificant when compared to the males. Late-stage male nymphs can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movements, although they lack the equipment to make sounds, demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait. The songs are a means of communication; the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity, <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> social cohesion and individual well-being. Social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshoppers because of their ability to jump or fly large distances, and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat. The generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity, and is modified {{in the presence of a}} rival male, and changes again to a courtship song when a female is nearby. In male grasshoppers of the family Pneumoridae, the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 as the work of the Devil. In the Middle Ages, the Church had drawn-out discussions as to when <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> martyrdom was suicidal, {{as in the case of}} martyrs of Córdoba. Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe, even for the times: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>desire</b> <b>for</b> {{responsible}} government {{resulted in}} the abortive Rebellions of 1837. The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture. The Act of Union merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849. The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This {{paved the way for}} British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858). In 1867, the same year as Canadian Confederation, Britain declined to purchase for Canada the Alaska territory that was to that point tenuously held by Russia. With the United States purchasing Alaska instead, clearly demarcated borders for Canada, although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarkation of the Alaska-Yukon and Alaska-BC border for years to come.|$|E
