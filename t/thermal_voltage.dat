From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might appear that the voltage has a positive temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the reverse saturation current term is more significant than the variation in the <b>thermal</b> <b>voltage</b> term. Most diodes therefore have a negative temperature coefficient, typically −2 mV/˚C for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 kelvins.

40|$|A {{measuring}} device (1) {{is used for}} the electrical measurement of a resistance (3) forming a sensor (2), the resistance possibly being a Pt 100 resistor, for example. A storage capacitor (11) is switched in parallel to said resistor (3). The measurement resistance (3) and the storage capacitor (11) are connected to a meter (5) via two wires (4). The line length may be several meters. Using a current source (10 a, 10 b), a constant measuring current can be sent through the measuring circuit. A voltage proportional to the current falls off at the resistor (3), said voltage being used to charge the storage capacitor (11) switched in parallel. If the constant current is then switched off, the charge voltage of the storage capacitor (11) can be remotely measured without voltage drops occurring in the line resistors since measurements are performed with practically no current.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of nano-particle fillers in {{insulating}} materials, the insulating materials of superior quality have come to fore. In the recent past, nanocomposite LDPE/XLPE (Low Density Polyethylene/Cross Linked Polyethelene) power cable dielectrics have been synthesized. A preliminary evaluation of these new class of materials seem to show that, addition of small amounts of sub-micron inorganic fillers improved the dielectric properties of the composite, in particular, the volume resistivity, and the dc breakdown strength. The thermal behaviour, for example, the stability of composites against decomposition and ensuing electrical failure, {{do not seem to}} have been addressed. In a conventional XLPE insulated cable, the average thermal breakdown strength and maximum temperature at the onset of breakdown were seen to be markedly lower than the corresponding intrinsic breakdown strength and decomposition temperature. In the present paper, the Authors have presented and demonstrated the methods of estimating the limiting <b>thermal</b> breakdown <b>voltages</b> on a few nanocomposite materials used as power cable insulation. Experimental data on the volume resistivity reported in recent literature has been used in the series of computations.
