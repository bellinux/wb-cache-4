40|$|SUMMARY In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} the technique {{and reliability of}} measuring digital blood pressure {{by means of a}} rigid, airtight container (a bladder-free cuff) and a photocell placed on <b>the</b> digit. As <b>cuff</b> pressure increased, <b>the</b> position of digits in <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> was maintained in the hand by fixing one or two fingers in-side <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> and, in <b>the</b> foot, by using a supporting stick to keep the distance from <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> to <b>the</b> bed constant. An airtight seal inside <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> was achieved using a thin rubber sleeve and adhesive tape.

Upset over what she did to him, Hook takes the dreamcatcher to erase Emma's memories of the events in Camelot, while Zelena places the anti-magic cuffs on her. Mary Margaret, David, Henry and Regina arrive to find Emma unconscious on a couch, and powerless. When she awakens, she tells them about Hook's becoming a Dark One. They reason that they can simply use the dreamcatchers to regain their memories and find out what Hook’s plans are, but Hook had taken all of the dreamcatchers. At the pawn shop, Hook shows up to challenge Gold to a battle on the Jolly Roger, so that he can finally get his revenge, giving Gold a cutlass to use for the battle, while Hook wields Excalibur. As Gold and Belle alert the others about Hook's challenge, they debate about whether they should leave <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> on Emma, and with Henry's distrust of Emma, they agree to leave her at the house with <b>the</b> <b>cuffs,</b> as they devise a plan to stop Hook.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{pneumatic}} tourniquets {{have three}} basic components: an inflatable cuff, a compressed gas source, and an instrument which automatically monitors and controls <b>cuff</b> pressure. <b>The</b> <b>cuff</b> is secured around the limb proximal to the operative site. Pressure is exerted on {{the circumference of}} the limb by means of compressed gas which is introduced into <b>the</b> tourniquet <b>cuff</b> by a microprocessor-controlled source, via connection tubing. When sufficient pressure is exerted, vessels and arteries beneath <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> become temporarily occluded, preventing blood flow past <b>the</b> <b>cuff.</b> While <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> is inflated, <b>the</b> tourniquet system automatically monitors and maintains the pressure chosen by <b>the</b> user. <b>Cuff</b> pressure and inflation time are displayed, and an audiovisual alarm alerts the user to alarm conditions, such as a cuff leak.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, as the {{pressure}} in <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> drops further, <b>the</b> sounds change in quality, then become muted, and finally disappear altogether. This occurs because, as {{the pressure}} in <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> drops below <b>the</b> diastolic blood pressure, <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> no longer provides any restriction to blood flow allowing the blood flow to become smooth again with no turbulence and thus produce no further audible sound.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} types of cufflinks that may be worn with black tie. The most formal and {{decorative}} are the double-panel type, which dress {{both sides of the}} cuff and are connected by a chain or link of metal; this model conceals the mechanism by which the cuff is secured. The most common, and least decorative, are the swivel bar type; whilst these are acceptable, they leave the inner side of <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> and mechanism exposed which is incongruous with formal dress.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the rigid}} design, speedcuffs {{can be applied}} in one of four {{different}} positions, which also apply to hinged handcuffs but not chain-linked. In British police training, these positions are termed 'front stack', 'palm to palm', 'rear stack', and 'back to back'. Many forces teach two positions to their officers, but some teach all four. The 'stacked' positions are those where, once applied (assuming a standing prisoner), the handcuffs are vertical and the wrists pass through <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> in opposite directions, resulting in one hand {{on each side of}} the handcuffs.|$|E
25|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} the jersey that Kerry wore {{in the first of}} the three games of the 1903 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final series with Kildare, but both accounts agree that the predominant colour was red. One account says that it was a red jersey with green neck and cuffs, which were the colours of the Tralee Mitchels junior football team. Another account says that it was an entirely red jersey with no green in it. The reason that Kerry wore this red or mainly red jersey was that a new set of green and gold jerseys was not delivered in time for the game. For the later games in the 1903 series of games, Kerry wore green jerseys with gold on <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> and over the shoulders. These were the colours of the Tralee Mitchels senior team.|$|E

25|$|Lively {{tries to}} {{drive a wedge between}} Kenehan and the miners by convincing a young widow, Bridey Mae Tolliver, to falsely accuse Kenehan of sexual assault, and he plants a letter which makes Kenehan appear to be the infiltrator.

One of the miners hurries to the camp to find Few Clothes (James Earl Jones), who had drawn the short straw for who would kill Kenehan for his assumed treachery. Few Clothes tells Kenehan he is there to guard him when he comments on the gun the black miner has. Asked whether he knows how to use it, Few Clothes says yes, {{that he was in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898. Kenehan tells him that he was in Fort Leavenworth Military Penitentiary in 1917, and saw Mennonites imprisoned for refusing to bear arms passively resist having their beards shaved and rip the buttons off their prison clothes, since all these were against their religion. They were punished by being handcuffed to cell bars for eight hours per day, until <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> had cut into their wrists and caused gangrene. Despite it all, they ripped off re-sewn buttons with their teeth, not one giving up. Kenehan says he never saw braver men, and ironically they were in there for refusing to fight. This tale of bravery and injustice leaves Few Clothes conflicted and unsure about his mission to execute Kenehan. Another miner arrives and tells Few Clothes the truth and Kenehan's execution is called off just in time.

40|$|Background: To prevent {{endotracheal tube}} (ETT) -related {{complications}} during mechanical ventilation, ETT cuff pressure {{should be kept}} within proper range. In clinical settings, cuff pressure often decreases from target values. Methods: We performed an experimental study to investigate the effects of measuring devices and endotracheal tubes on change in cuff pressure. We continuously measured cuff pressure by inserting a three-way stopcock {{in the middle of}} an ETT pilot balloon system. After adjusting <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure to 24 cmH 2 O, we disconnected and reconnected each <b>cuff</b> inflator to <b>the</b> inflation valve of the ETT and measured the changes in <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure. We measured <b>the</b> change in <b>cuff</b> pressure with different ETT sizes, cuff shapes, brands of cuff inflator, and with and without added extension tubes. Results: <b>The</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure decreased, on average, by 6. 6 cmH 2 O (standard deviation 1. 9), when connecting <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> inflator to <b>the</b> pilot balloon. <b>The</b> measured <b>cuff</b> pressure was less than 20 cmH 2 O in 67 % of <b>the</b> tests. <b>The</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure decreased more when an extension tube was used. <b>The</b> brand of <b>cuff</b> inflator made no difference to the pressure loss. <b>The</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure decreased more with ETTs of smaller size and with ETTs with pyriform cuffs. Conclusions: Procedures to connect cuff inflators to inflation valves resulted in <b>the</b> loss of <b>cuff</b> pressure by 6. 6 cmH 2 O on average...|$|R

500|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel cage match contested between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper), with the losing team {{disbanding}} forever. Mid-way through, Skipper handcuffed Harris to {{the ropes and}} kept the key away from the referee. Storm later took the key from Skipper and freed Harris from <b>the</b> <b>cuffs.</b> [...] At {{one point in the}} match, Skipper and Daniels double teamed Harris and performed America's Most Wanted signature finishing maneuver, the Death Sentence by holding Harris in place while the other member climbed to the top rope and performed a leg drop across Harris's neck and head. Skipper followed by covering Harris for a pinfall, however, he kicked out before the count of three. Harris later climbed {{up to the top of}} the cage. While Harris sat on top of the cage, Skipper climbed up at another corner and walked across the top similar to walking a tightrope. Skipper then jumped and grabbed Harris's head with his legs, falling backwards towards the ring in a move he dubbed the New School. This move caused Harris to fly off of the top of the cage and land on his back in the middle of the ring. A brief time later, all four men were positioned at certain points on one of the padded turnbuckles to perform what TNA calls the [...] "Tower of Doom". In a variation of the move, Daniels was being held upside-down by Storm, until Skipper grabbed Storm and placed his head between Storm's legs to lift him off of a padded turnbuckle. Harris then grabbed Skipper and placed Skipper on his shoulders while he held Storm, who remained holding Daniels. Harris then performed a powerbomb on Skipper, while Skipper pulled down Storm, who suplexed Daniels off of the top of the cage. The conclusion to the match saw America's Most Wanted cuff Daniels to the ropes and perform Triple X's signature maneuver, the Powerplex by lifting Skipper up onto Storm's shoulders while Harris held Skipper's head. Storm and Harris then fell to the mat, forcing Skipper's neck into Harris's shoulder and mat while slamming his back into the mat as well. Storm then pinned Skipper for the pinfall victory. As a result of Triple X's loss, the team had to disband forever.|$|E
