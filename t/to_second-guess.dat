25|$|Generally {{the courts}} have taken a deferential {{approach}} to reviewing unions' decisions challenged as a breach of their duty of fair representation. Recognizing that the collective bargaining process typically requires compromises, which may favor some workers {{at the expense of}} others, {{the courts have}} held that a union only breaches its duty if it acts arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily. Practical considerations have also led the courts to refuse <b>to</b> <b>second-guess</b> unions' decisions: if a court or jury could substitute its judgment as to whether a particular grievance had merit, then unions could not function, since their decisions would rarely be final in any practical sense. Accordingly, the courts have refused to overturn union decisions as arbitrary so long as they were based on a reasoned decision by the union, even if the court might believe that this decision was wrong.|$|E
25|$|As Governor Bush's {{counsel in}} Texas, Gonzales also {{reviewed}} all clemency requests. A 2003 article in The Atlantic Monthly asserted that Gonzales gave insufficient counsel, and failed <b>to</b> <b>second-guess</b> convictions and failed appeals. Gonzales' deputy general counsel from 1995 to 1999, Pete Wassdorf, in turn sought to defend Gonzales {{from what he}} characterized as an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the clemency process under Bush. Under Section II, Article 4 of the Texas Constitution, the Governor cannot grant a pardon or commute a death sentence except with a majority vote recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, so Bush was constrained in granting clemency {{even if he had}} wanted to do so in a case. The fact remains that only one death sentence was overturned by Governor Bush, and the state of Texas executed more prisoners during Gonzales's term than any other state.|$|E

Andrée being Sweden's first balloonist, no national had the requisite knowledge <b>to</b> <b>second-guess</b> him about buoyancy or drag ropes; but both Germany and France had long ballooning traditions and several of their more experienced balloonists expressed skepticism about Andrée's methods and inventions. However, just as with the Svea mishaps, all objections failed to dampen Andrée's optimism. Eagerly followed by national and international media, he began negotiations with the well-known aeronaut and balloon builder Henri Lachambre in Paris, world capital of ballooning, and ordered a varnished three-layer silk balloon, 20.5meters (67ft) in diameter, from his workshop. The balloon, originally called Le Pôle Nord (French for [...] "The North Pole"), was to be renamed Örnen (Swedish for [...] "The Eagle").|$|E
500|$|Sunsoft was not {{interested}} in the game for PC, and was instead focused on the video game console market. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game's environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that most people did not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—not like a puzzle, but something for players to figure out like a circuit breaker in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not know exactly who the game would appeal to; Robyn felt like they did not have <b>to</b> <b>second-guess</b> their choices and could [...] "explore the world as we were designing" [...] and build a game for themselves. In a 2016 interview, Rand Miller stated that they strived to design the puzzles in Myst and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. Rand also stated they {{wanted to make sure that}} clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: [...] "once the player finds the solution, if they blame us, then we haven’t done a good job.

Miguel Sapochnik, who directed last week's battle-heavy episode, brought a different kind of precision and urgency to Sunday's installment. Cersei's scheme unspooled amid insistent strings and a series of shots — those vicious little birds taking out Pycelle, Lancel and the dwindling candle-fuse, Margaery's growing concern and rising tension in the Sept — that built inexorably to the High Sparrow's realization that he wasn't as smart as he thought." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly stated he felt the episode introduced new conflicts to look forward to in the next season, saying [...] "Though the finale shifted from the battlefield, the events were, if anything, far more seismic, with game-changing revelations and huge moves from every corner of the realm that established some very clear new conflicts going into season 7."

Additionally, it must be remembered that an under-staffed FCC was given an enormous amount of work to do within fixed time limits. Therefore, it must be expected that the rulemaking would be vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>second-guessing.</b> Nonetheless, whenever a governmental entity regulates communications, sensitivity to First Amendment concerns is mandatory. Moreover, the FCC serves in part as an explicator of electronic communications law. Thus, the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s. analysis impacts on innumerable other discussions and decisions concerning free speech.

40|$|Thinking with {{my heart}} and my mind is a skill that I have {{cultivated}} in my graduate studies and an attribute that distinguishes my stage management style. When I allow my work as a stage manager to be supported by my heart, I increase my capacity to empathize with others.

As Kate discovers what is holding Marlow back in She Stoops to Conquer, she begins to sense what he needs and therefore begins to adapt her approach. I have learned that by remaining flexible, I am better prepared to serve the work and meet the needs of my collaborators.

40|$|Hackett {{wrote about}} his company’s {{struggle}} {{to prepare for}} the “ten percent ” of the time (46) that their innovation process faltered. Hackett attributed this problem to Max Bazerman’s concept of “bounded awareness, ” (ibid.) which states that stakeholders often fail to see relevant business information during the decision-making process and therefore make bad decisions or no decisions at all. To counteract this problem, Hackett devised a four phase “critical thinking” (ibid.) strategy: think, set the point of view, plan the implementation, and implement. (48) In the think phase, the idea is to get team members thinking individually about a research idea for a potential product. The team members start out as admittedly “naive beginners,” (47) but quickly attempt to work toward becoming experts on the subject matter through a kind of intense autodidactic studying process. (48) Team members are then expected to be able to “ask the right questions ” (47) about the research, again individually. Pooling all of their individually-produced documentation into a repository for group evaluation, members are then asked to work together to discover patterns in their work. (48) Once patterns are discovered, they are expected to verify these patterns (ibid.) by tapping into the company’s established network of international connections- “the smartest people in the world ” (ibid.) - and getting their input before proceeding.
