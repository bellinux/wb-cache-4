40|$|Exploiting several {{fish species}} {{simultaneously}} reduces variability in daily catches. The reduction {{depends on the}} number of species, the catch-frequency distributions of individual species, and the level of co-occurrence of species in the catch.

40|$|The Turks and Caicos Islands' <b>total</b> marine {{fisheries}} <b>catches</b> {{were estimated}} for 1950 – 2012 using a catch reconstruction approach, estimating all removals, including reported catch destined for export, and unreported domestic artisanal and subsistence <b>catches.</b> <b>Total</b> reconstructed <b>catch</b> {{for the period}} is approximately 2. 8 times that reported by the Turks and Caicos to the FAO, and 86 % higher than the export-adjusted national reported baseline. The pattern of <b>total</b> <b>catches</b> (strong decline to 1970, followed by gradual increase) differs distinctly from that shown by data reported to FAO. Reported landings show a steady increase from less than 1000 t·year− 1 in the 1950 s to around 6000 t·year− 1 in the 2000 s. In contrast, the <b>total</b> reconstructed <b>catches</b> suggest declines in <b>total</b> <b>catches</b> from around 20, 000 t in 1950 {{to a low of}} about 5000 t in 1970, before gradual increases to about 12, 500 t·year− 1 in the late 2000 s. Major discrepancies between reported and reconstructed data are under-reported artisanal catches in the early decades (accounting for 86 % of <b>total</b> <b>catches),</b> and the absence of subsistence catches (14 % of <b>total</b> <b>catches)</b> in reported data. Queen conch (Strombus gigas) and Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) dominate reconstructed catches. No discards were estimated as fishing has been highly selective, carried out by hand collection (conch), trap or hook (lobster), or hook and line (finfish). New data published here from local seafood consumption surveys demonstrates that the total local consumption of conch equates to almost the entire <b>total</b> allowable <b>catch,</b> before exported amounts are even factored.

40|$|The Danish Government has {{proposed}} a catch quota management system (CQMS) in which fishers are obliged to report their <b>total</b> <b>catches,</b> including discards and landings, and both are counted against the formal <b>total</b> allowable <b>catch</b> (TAC). The success of a CQMS requires appropriate documentation to verify the <b>total</b> <b>catch,</b> the validity of scientific advice, and {{the implementation of the}} TACs through national catch quotas. A remote electronic monitoring (EM) system, providing full documentation of fishing operations and catches, was tested on six Danish fishing vessels operating under a CQMS for cod (Gadus morhua).

40|$|Longitudinal {{surveys of}} anglers or boat owners {{are widely used}} in {{recreational}} fishery management to estimate <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> over a fishing season. Survey designs with repeated measures of the same random sample over time are effective {{if the goal is}} to show statistically significant differences among point estimates for successive time intervals. However, estimators for <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> over the season that are based on longitudinal sampling will be less precise than stratified estimators based on successive independent samples. Conventional stratified variance estimators would be negatively biased if applied to such data because the samples for different time strata are not independent. We formulated new general estimators for <b>catch</b> rate, <b>total</b> <b>catch,</b> and respective variances that sum across time strata but also account for correlation stratum samples. A case study of the Japanese recreational fishery for ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) showed that the conventional stratified variance estimate of <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> was about 10 % of the variance estimated by our new method. Combining the catch data for each angler or boat owners throughout the season reduced the variance of the <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> estimate by about 75 %. For successive independent surveys based on random independent samples, catch, and variance estimators derived from combined data would be the same as conventional stratified estimators when sample allocation is proportional to strata size.

40|$|One {{strategy}} for estimating <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> is to employ two separate surveys that independently estimate total fishing effort and catch rate with the estimator for <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> formed by their product. Survey designs for estimating catch rate often involve interviewing the fishermen during their fishing episodes.

Bibliography: leaves 107 - 114. ix, 114 leaves, bound ill. 28 cmThe {{objectives}} of the study are to include endogenous supply and uncertainty in a fisheries market analysis and to provide an economic explanation for the allocation of <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> between two markets, a fresh fish market and a cannery market. In order to accomplish these objectives, an econometric model of the Hawaiian skipjack tuna market was constructed and evaluated. A five equation model was specified which determined the monthly number of fishing trips taken, the <b>total</b> <b>catch,</b> the quantity supplied to the fresh market, the fresh market price and the revenues received from the cannery. The effect of seasonal variation in availability of fish {{was included in the}} specification of the model. Uncertainty was included through a variable which reflected the probability of a successful trip. The estimation technique was three-stage-least squares (3 SLS). This method was selected because of the hypothesized simultaneous relationships and because of the known properties of the technique. Monthly time-series data for 1970 - 78 were used. The results of the estimation show that the probability of a non-zero catch trip and the expected revenues from cannery sales were positive determinants of the monthly number of trips taken. <b>Total</b> monthly <b>catch</b> is positively related to the number of trips and to the expected revenues from cannery sales and negatively related to the price of gasoline. The quantity supplied to the fresh fish market is negatively related to revenues from the cannery implying substitution between the two markets. Quantity sold to the fresh market is also positively determined by <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> in the off season with no empirical relationship observed in the on season between the quantity sold and <b>total</b> <b>catch.</b> The number of vessels fishing is a positive determinant of quantity supplied to the fresh market. The market price is negatively related to the quantity supplied and positively related to per capita income and average size of fish caught. The elasticity of demand for the fresh fish market is calculated to be - 1. 8. The revenues from the cannery are determined by the wholesale price of canned tuna, the fresh market price and the <b>total</b> <b>catch.</b> The conclusions of the study indicate that endogenous supply is an appropriate specification in this market; that the allocation of <b>total</b> <b>catch</b> between the markets is occurring by equalizing marginal revenues; and that uncertainty is a major determinant of the number of trips taken...|$|R
