In a July 2008 interview with CNN, he was {{endorsed by}} Ben Stein, a noted entertainer, speechwriter, lawyer and author known for his conservative views, who generally supported Republican candidates. Stein said of Franken, [...] "He is my pal, {{and he is a}} really, really capable smart guy. I don't agree with all of his positions, but he is a very impressive guy, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in the Senate." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2008, Jason Statham {{expressed}} interest in appearing as Daredevil in the future. Statham requested [...] "just give me the chance, I {{would love to be}} Daredevil." [...] Frank Miller commented in agreement [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> Daredevil too." [...] In October 2008, 20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman said [...] "a Daredevil reboot is something we are thinking very seriously about." [...] Rothman added that [...] "what it really needs is, it needs a visionary at the level that Chris Nolan was. It needs someone, it needs a director, honestly, who has a genuine vision." [...] By February 2010, 20th Century Fox and New Regency were looking to develop the reboot with News Corp., with Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script. On March 15, 2011, it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot, [...] but he later had to drop out due to other obligations. Fringe writer and producer Brad Caleb Kane was hired to pen the Slade-directed film. On September 3, 2012, Duncan died, precluding him from reprising his role as Kingpin.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the case}} {{reaching}} the high court, Lewis tweeted that Avicii was fully aware of his song being sampled on [...] "Collide", [...] "With regards to my song, Avicii was aware & agreeing publishing splits {{for himself and his}} manager. When Avicii sent his track out to have a song written over it I totally fell in love with this version and I think he's super talented." [...] Syco also responded to the claim, stating that Avicii was always going to work with Lewis, and that he would be credited on the song. In response, Avicii accused Lewis and her label of lying about working together, and tweeted [...] "Thanks for accusing me of lying and speaking on my behalf. Since we never met or even spoke, please let me and my manager know who told you that and what confirmation they gave you." [...] Hours before both Lewis's and Avicii's record labels were supposed to appear in the high court, Syco released a statement that both record labels had reached an agreement and that Avicii would appear as a featured artist on [...] "Collide", whilst Lewis would appear as the lead artist. Avicii and his record label were pleased with the result, with the former saying [...] "Glad to FINALLY have resolved situation with Leona. Music is the answer... We've finally come to an agreement with Leona on all the issues... So happy to move on and focus on hit making... So happy to move on with Leona and focus on having a hit together." [...] The latter stated [...] "Avicii is an up-and-coming talent; we <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given a fair crack at making this record the hit it deserves to be." ...|$|E

5000|$|Despite only {{playing on}} a toy piano, Schroeder is a very talented musician, who is obsessed with the music of Beethoven.

2500|$|However, in April 2006 it was {{announced}} that Christie would be a senior mentor for athletes on the national team, along with former athletes Steve Backley, Daley Thompson and Katharine Merry. This proved controversial however, due to Christie's drugs ban. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in that mentor role," [...] said Paula Radcliffe, the marathon world record-holder. [...] "We {{have to make sure that}} the people in that mentor role have an integrity and strong sense of ethics and morals." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2009, Queenie Fletcher {{suggested}} that Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, {{who at the}} time was appealing his conviction for the Lockerbie bombing, should be moved to a prison in Libya, on condition that the Libyan government co-operate with detectives investigating her daughter's murder. Mrs Fletcher said: [...] "I know he is ill and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> returned to a prison in Libya so his family can visit him. The appeal could still go ahead in Scotland, but he could stay in prison in Libya. It's got to be a fair exchange, so Yvonne's case can be closed. I'd like the police here to be given permission to interview whoever they've got to interview in Libya and see whoever they need to for someone to be brought to trial." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Lustiger {{was awarded}} the Nostra Aetate Award for {{advancing}} Catholic-Jewish relations by the Center for Christian-Jewish Understanding, an interfaith group housed {{on the campus of}} Sacred Heart University, a Catholic university at Fairfield, Connecticut in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group, protested the award, saying it was [...] "inappropriate" [...] to honor Lustiger, who was born a Jew but left the faith. [...] "It's fine to have him speak at a conference or colloquium," [...] said the league's national director Abraham Foxman. [...] "But I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> honored because he converted out, which makes him a poor example." [...] In France, however, Lustiger enjoyed good relations with the Jewish community. Th√©o Klein observed that although conversions usually carry out negative connotations in the Jewish world, it was not so with the Cardinal. Klein called Lustiger [...] "his cousin".|$|E
5000|$|Jim Croce {{described}} this song {{as having a}} [...] "funky street feel". During a performance, he explained the song as [...] "a story {{about a guy who}} <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> ruling the universe somewhere, but he is really working at a car wash". Croce explained he {{came up with the idea}} for the song while in the military at Fort Jackson running telephone cables on poles and thinking <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> doing something else. While on top of the pole he thought about everyone in the same situation thinking they <b>should</b> <b>be</b> doing another [...] "gig" [...] and have a different job.|$|R

Dandy is tricked by Gloria into visiting the therapist, and becomes enraged when he realizes {{what is going on}} and that his mother <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> institutionalized. Upon returning to the house, Dandy shoots Gloria in the head and bathes in her blood.|$|R

This stresses out Tamura even more that he isn't actual upset like <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> Seiwa {{is just a little}} too enthusiastic about going out with Tamura, especially on the physical level. Tamura has to ward him off constantly, especially when he finds out that Seiwa is inexperienced and doesn't know how to sleep with a man, which brings more problems.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regardless, Clooney was {{determined}} {{to stay with the}} role. Loyal to the script, Clooney helped convince executives to support certain aspects of the film (such as the exploding cow scene) even after he was urged to drop out of production, as his contract called for his compensation with or without his decision to stay in the film. After a number of arguments, Clooney wrote Russell a letter that criticized Russell's behavior in a last attempt to make peace between the two, days before another fight would break out during the filming of the movie's finale. In it, the three lead characters attempt to escort Iraqi rebels across the border to Iran. There were a number of actors and extras in the scene, as well as other elements, such as helicopters flying overhead and landing {{in the center of the}} location. The fight began after an extra was having difficulty throwing Ice Cube's character to the ground. After a number of takes, Russell came to the extra and put him through the motions of the action. Some individuals present on the set during the incident state that Russell was simply showing the extra how to convincingly act in the scene. However, Clooney and others thought that Russell had violently thrown the extra to the ground. Clooney recalls: [...] "We were trying to get a shot and then he went berserk. He went nuts on an extra." [...] Clooney approached Russell and began criticizing him again, coming to the extra's defense. The two began shouting at one another before entering a physical fight. Second assistant director Paul Bernard was so fed up with the experience when the fight broke out that he put down his camera and walked off the set, effectively quitting. Clooney concludes, [...] "Will I work with David ever again? Absolutely not. Never. Do I think he's tremendously talented and do I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> nominated for Oscars? Yeah." [...] Russell offered a different view, saying [...] "we're both passionate guys who are the two biggest authorities on the set," [...] and maintaining that the two continue to be friends. Ice Cube felt the conflict helped the film, saying [...] "it kind of kicked the set into a different gear where everybody was focused and we finished strong. I wouldn't mind if the director and the star got into an argument on all of my movies." ...|$|E

5000|$|After the meeting, Wilson is {{offended}} by Rawls' [...] "naked appeal to racial solidarity." [...] Carcetti asks Wilson about Daniels, an African American {{officer in the}} department whom Carcetti views as a competent and good police officer. Wilson tells him {{that he does not}} have any political connections. Pearlman visits Daniels at his office and finds him on the phone with Carcetti. Daniels tells her that Carcetti wants to meet with him to discuss what is successful in the police department. Daniels asks Pearlman how honest she <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> Pearlman tells him to be himself despite his worries that the mayor will not get rid of Burrell and Rawls.|$|R
500|$|The Kurt‚ÄìBlaine relationship, {{sometimes}} referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Klaine" [...] by Glee fans and the media, developed slowly. As the series showrunner, Murphy felt tasked with keeping the two apart as long as possible. He was initially unsure whether the relationship would become a romantic one, and intended to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> the boyfriend, part of me <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> just <b>be</b> the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until we got into sort of {{the middle of the}} season." [...] In December 2010, Colfer said, [...] "Fans really want it to happen. It's funny how many people want to see these boys hook up. We'll see." [...] Based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy decided to have Blaine become Kurt's love interest. Criss noted: [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." ...|$|R

For example, he accidentally shoots down the signal kite when he is messing around with Lex and he also falls out of a tree trying to get coconuts. He was portrayed as snobby in the novel, and wore rich people clothes, Slip-on sneakers, converse low-tops, slip-on converse, and canvas Boat shoes is what he wears throughout the books, also he wore water shoes for when going in the water and getting to the raft.|$|R

On the Tuesday morning Morel rose early. He was in good spirits. Quite early, before six o'clock, she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs. He had a pleasant way of whistling, lively and musical. He nearly always whistled hymns. He had been a choir-boy with a beautiful voice, and had taken solos in Southwell cathedral. His morning whistling alone betrayed it.|$|E

Meanwhile, the Simpsons visit a television museum that is soon to be closed. After a while, they come to an exhibit displaying The Adventures of Fatso Flanagan, which is one of Homer's favorite television shows. There, the family is approached by Annie Dubinsky, the agent of the actor who played Fatso Flanagan. They start chatting and become acquainted. At the Channel 6 studios, during a board meeting, Krusty is fired because [...] "Today's children are uncomfortable with a clown whose every reference they have to look up on Wikipedia", and because Itchy and Scratchy are shown to be more popular with the children.
