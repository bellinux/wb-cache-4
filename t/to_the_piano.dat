5|$|Fauré's opera {{based on}} the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first {{performed}} in 1913, after which the composer published {{a version of the}} prelude transcribed for piano. The piece, in G minor, contrasts a gravely noble andante moderato theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The polyphonic writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the {{instrument}} enjoyed a resurgence in popularity, resulting in Rhodes re-obtaining the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> in 1997. Although Harold Rhodes died in 2000, {{the instrument}} {{has since been}} reissued, and his teaching methods are still in use.|$|E
40|$|Almost all {{students}} who enroll in child education department at my college are novices at playing <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> Even some students {{who used to}} learn how <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> cannot play <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> well. In addition, almost {{all students}} forgot some knowledge of music, although they had taken music class at elementary and junior high school. Therefore, although {{it is necessary for}} their careers to learn how <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> they are reluctant <b>to</b> practice <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> because they can not help thinking that practicing <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> is difficult and it eats a lot of their time and energy. This time, I'd like to deliberate a teaching method which I have practiced in my class where my students learn how <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> especially in terms of improvement in technique of playing <b>the</b> <b>piano...</b>|$|R

5|$|External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to a courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards {{as many as four}} times. Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
5|$|On Schröter's {{death in}} 1782, Horn {{decided to move}} to Paris to try a living as a musician. He left his home with little money and a {{suitcase}} of clothes. En route to Paris, he encountered a stranger in Hamburg by the name of Winkelman, who persuaded the impressionable Horn that London would better serve the aspirations of a young German musician than France. Winkelman accompanied him to London, but upon arriving, stole almost all of Horn's money and disappeared. Destitute and knowing no English, he wandered the streets of London before encountering a German-speaking Irishman, who sympathised with his plight. The man took Horn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> shop of Longman and Broderip at Cheapside, where Horn played the piano for its co-proprietor, Francis Fane Broderip. Impressed, Broderip introduced Horn to the Saxon ambassador John Maurice de Brühl. de Brühl recommended Horn to Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford, who hired him as his daughters' music teacher.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodes piano {{became a}} popular {{instrument}} in jazz {{in the late}} 1960s, particularly for several sidemen who played with Miles Davis. Herbie Hancock first encountered the instrument in 1968 while booked for a session with Davis. He immediately became an enthusiast, noting that the amplification allowed him to be heard much more easily in groups when compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> Hancock continued to experiment with the Rhodes {{over the next few}} years, including playing it through a wah wah. Another former Davis sideman, Chick Corea started using the Rhodes prominently during the 1970s, as did Weather Report founder Joe Zawinul. From 1969's In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew onwards, the Rhodes became the most prominent keyboard on Davis's recordings until the mid-1970s. Vince Guaraldi started using a Rhodes in 1968, and toured with both a piano and a Rhodes. He achieved particular prominence with his soundtrack music for A Charlie Brown Christmas and other Peanuts / Charlie Brown films.|$|E

Excited <b>to</b> sell <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> Willie quickly partakes on his actions without a care of his sister's words. Berniece appears with Crawley's gun, leading Doaker and Avery to urge them to talk it through first. Sutter's {{presence}} as a ghost is suddenly revived. Avery attempts <b>to</b> drive <b>the</b> ghost away with his blessings but is not successful. Suddenly, Berniece knows that she must play <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> again as a plea to her ancestors. Finally, the house is led to a calm aura, and Willie leaves.|$|R

50|$|Nevio Passaro {{was raised}} in Neustadt an der Aisch, a city {{in the south of}} Germany. Already as a small child he was very {{interested}} in music, not in the least because his mother, a music teacher, taught him how <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> in an early stage of his life. In the years growing up, he taught himself how <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and <b>the</b> guitar.|$|R
5|$|The {{interior}} of the hall is opulently, but {{by the standards of}} the day, simply decorated and furnished. Ornament is used with such restraint that it was possible to decorate both private and state rooms in the same style, without oppressing the former. The principal entrance is through the Marble Hall, which is in fact made of pink Derbyshire alabaster; this leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> nobile, or the first floor, and state rooms. The most impressive of these rooms is the Saloon, which has walls lined with red velvet. Each of the major state rooms is symmetrical in its layout and design; in some rooms, false doors are necessary to fully achieve this balanced effect.|$|E
25|$|His {{compositions}} and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic {{twists and}} {{are consistent with}} his unorthodox approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations.|$|E

25|$|Monk was {{renowned for}} his {{distinctive}} style in suits, hats, and sunglasses. He was also noted for an idiosyncratic habit observed at times during performances: {{while the other}} musicians in the band continued playing, he would stop, stand up from the keyboard, and dance {{for a few moments}} before returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although McVie was {{introduced}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> {{when she was}} four, she did not study music seriously until age 11, when she was re-introduced to it by Philip Fisher, a local musician and school friend of McVie's older brother, John. Continuing her classical training until age 15, McVie shifted her musical focus to rock and roll when John brought home a Fats Domino songbook. Other early influences included The Everly Brothers.|$|E

25|$|Kozlovsky was {{well-known}} to be a favourite {{singer of}} Joseph Stalin.

Kozlovsky gained great renown throughout the Soviet Union, but was never allowed to leave its borders.|$|E
25|$|Armando Corea {{was born}} in Chelsea, Massachusetts. He is of {{southern}} Italian and Spanish descent. His father, a jazz trumpet player who had led a Dixieland band in Boston in the 1930s and 1940s, introduced him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> {{at the age of}} four. Growing up surrounded by jazz music, he was influenced at an early age by bebop and stars such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Horace Silver, and Lester Young. At eight Corea also took up drums, which would later influence his use of the piano as a percussion instrument.|$|E
30|$|Transfer {{learning}} {{is used to}} improve a learner from one domain by transferring information from a related domain. We can draw from real-world non-technical experiences to understand why transfer {{learning is}} possible. Consider an example of two {{people who want to}} learn <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b> One person has no previous experience playing music, and the other person has extensive music knowledge through playing the guitar. The person with an extensive music background will be able <b>to</b> learn <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> in a more efficient manner by transferring previously learned music knowledge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> task of learning <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> [84]. One person is able to take information from a previously learned task and use it in a beneficial way to learn a related task.|$|R

25|$|If Haydn {{created the}} {{conversational}} style of composition, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart greatly expanded its vocabulary. His chamber music added numerous masterpieces to the chamber music repertoire. Mozart's seven piano trios and two piano quartets {{were the first}} to apply the conversational principle to chamber music with piano. Haydn's piano trios are essentially piano sonatas with the violin and cello playing mostly supporting roles, doubling the treble and bass lines of the piano score. But Mozart gives the strings an independent role, using them as a counter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> and adding their individual voices to the chamber music conversation.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{experience}} in the ballet world, Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him clearly what he liked {{and what he did}} not like in music for dance. Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised {{that he would have to}} revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds were such a contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> score and made him think very differently.|$|E
25|$|At {{the inauguration}} of the UN in 1945, no {{delegation}} from Poland had been invited. The Polish pianist Artur Rubinstein, who was to perform the opening concert at the inauguration, began the concert by stating his deep disappointment that the conference {{did not have a}} delegation from Poland. Rubinstein later described becoming overwhelmed by a blind fury and angrily pointing out to the public the absence of the Polish flag. He then sat down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> and played Poland Is Not Yet Lost loudly and slowly, repeating the final part in a great thunderous forte. When he had finished, the public rose to their feet and gave him a great ovation.|$|E
