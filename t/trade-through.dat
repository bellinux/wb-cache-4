40|$|I {{am writing}} {{on behalf of}} Fidelity Investments, as {{investment}} adviser to the Fidelity family of mutual funds, {{with regard to the}} proposed <b>trade-through</b> rule, which forms part of the Commission’s proposed Regulation NMS. Although the Commission has not yet made a formal announcement under the Government in the Sunshine Act, we understand that the Commission intends to hold a public meeting on or about April 6, 2005 to put Regulation NMS, including the proposed <b>trade-through</b> rule, to a vote. As we have urged in prior comment letters, Fidelity, as have other institutional investors such as TIAA-CREF and Calpers, strongly urges the Commission either to refrain from adopting a <b>trade-through</b> rule or, if a <b>trade-through</b> rule is adopted, to allow informed investors to opt-out of the rule and continue to exercise their fiduciary judgment in choosing the market to which their orders will be sent. We believe, in any event, that it is premature for the Commission to take action on the proposed <b>trade-through</b> rule, particularly in view of the questionable economic study conducted by the Commission’s Office of Economic Analysis, dated December 15, 2004, addressing purported trade-throughs. We understand that this study is the primary economi...|$|E

40|$|On December 2002, The Nasdaq Stock Market {{completed}} the roll {{out of its}} new trading platform SuperMontage. It was initially conceived to centralize the order flow for Nasdaq stocks. How-ever, Island, {{one of the biggest}} ECN, decided not to participate to the montage and stopped to be “hard-linked ” to Nasdaq systems. To what extent this increase in order flow fragmentation affected market functioning? Are orders executed at the best available prices on the market? We find no evidence that market quality worsened following this exit. Effective and realized spreads remained unchanged. This suggests that information dissemination and third-parties smart routing services has been sufficient to counterbalance the lack of built-in linkages. Additionally, we observed a persistent frequency of <b>trade-through</b> of around 15 %, testifying of a non-negligible proportion of orders exe-cuted at a price worse than the best available one. However, using simulations, we showed that even when Island quote is better than the actual transaction price, an investor trading in Nasdaq would have generally experienced losses if the order were rerouted to Island. This suggests that <b>trade-through</b> regulation should consider depth as a major dimension...|$|E

40|$|In the U. S., several {{exchanges with}} {{different}} market microstructure designs compete to provide quotes and attract order flow {{on a common}} set of stock options. In this article, we analyze how the different microstructure designs affect the price discovery of options quotes and how they alter the flow of options trading activities over time. We find that the fully electronic exchange system at the International Secu-rities Exchange (ISE), where several market makers provide quotes independently and anonymously to compete for order flow within the exchange, generates options quotes that are the most informative and the most executable, with the narrowest bid–ask spreads. Over time, the ISE’s leading quote quality has attracted order flow to the exchange, and has com-pelled other exchanges to pursue technology innovations and structural reforms through either expansion or consolidation. T he financial industry has come to recognize the importance of deriv-ative securities in providing unique investment opportunities and risk-management vehicles. Trading volume on derivatives has increased tremendously during the past few years. Accompanying this expan-sion in derivatives have been rapid expansions and transformations in the stock options market. In the United States, in an effort to reduce <b>trade-throughs</b> and other market seg-mentations, a series of regulatory changes have taken place since the late 1990 s. In July 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a plan to electronically link the various market centers (the “Linkage Plan”). The SEC has also adopted more strin-gent quoting and disclosure rules on the options market. The “firm quote ” rule was applied to the options markets on April 1, 2001. At the time of our study, five options exchanges compete to provide quotes and attract order flows on {{a common set of}} stoc...|$|R

40|$|Modern physics has {{demonstrated}} that matter behaves very differently as it approaches the speed of light. This paper explores the implications of modern physics to the operation and regulation of financial markets. Information cannot move faster {{than the speed of}} light. The geographic separation of market centers means that relativistic considerations need {{to be taken into account}} in the regulation of markets. Observers in different locations may simultaneously observe different best prices. Regulators may not be able to determine which transactions occurred first, leading to problems with best execution and <b>trade-through</b> rules. Catastrophic software glitches can quantum tunnel through seemingly impregnable quality control procedures. Comment: Financial Review, 2014, forthcomin...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{consequences}} of trading fragmentation and speed on liquidity and asset prices. Exchanges invest in speed-enhancing technologies and price trading services to attract investors. Investors trade due to idiosyncratic preference shocks. We show how the resulting market organization affects asset liquidity and the composition of participating investors. In a consolidated market, speed investments raise liquidity and prices. When markets fragment, liquidity and asset prices can move in opposite directions. We also show how mechanisms that protect execution prices, such as the SEC’s <b>trade-through</b> rule, can decrease price levels and trading volume relative to unregulated markets. Our results suggest that recent regulatory reforms in secondary markets may have unintended negative consequences for public corporations. ...|$|E
40|$|Speed and {{fragmentation}} have reshaped global securities markets: Large-cap U. S. stocks can now {{be traded}} in almost 50 venues, and execution times are measured in milliseconds. We analyze these evolutions in a model where exchanges invest in trading speed and compete for investors who choose where {{and how much to}} trade. Faster venues charge higher fees and attract speed-sensitive investors. Competition among exchanges increases investor participation, traded volumes, and allocative efficiency but can lead to socially excessive levels of speed. Regulations that protect investors (e. g. SEC’s <b>trade-through)</b> lead to more fragmentation and faster speeds, but may reduce welfare. Independently of technology and entry costs, the optimal design has a single operating exchange. Our model sheds light on the experience of European and U. S. markets since the implementation of MiFID and Reg NMS...|$|E
40|$|I {{am writing}} this letter {{in support of}} the top-of-book option of the {{proposed}} <b>trade-through</b> rule for fast markets in listed stocks. I also urge the commission to extend the rule to NASDAQ stocks. Clearly establishing price as the primary priority rule in markets will encourage the submission of limit orders, leading to lower execution costs for investors, and consequently lowering the cost of capital for traded firms. Last year I wrote a short paper, “Networks, Nodes, and Priority Rules ” which supports my position. I have attached a copy of that paper. In the paper I consider priority rules as they apply to individual markets (nodes) and networks. The literature on priority rules suggests that the adoption of some priority rules can improve market quality. After a discussion of the development of the ITS and NASDAQ networks, I consider whether network priority rules matter. Since a network’s priority rules (or routing rules) can result in a concentration of orders, I discuss the literature on consolidated versus fragmented markets. I conclude that network priority rules improve market quality if they result in consolidated markets. This suggests that the current price priority rule on listed securities should therefore be retained and extended to the NASDAQ...|$|E
40|$|The Future of Computer Trading in Financial Markets - Driver Review 19, Foresight, Government Office of Science, [URL] {{the growth}} of {{computer}} trading and the implementation of MiFID, competition between trading venues and order flow fragmentation have considerably increased in Europe since 2007. Most of the rise in fragmentation took place from mid- 2008 to 2009. The total market share of new entrants such as Chi-X, BATS Europe, and Turquoise exceeded 30 % of on-exchange volumes {{at the end of}} 2011, and their contribution to price discovery is now substantial. Regulated dark pools, also known as crossing networks, execute less than 5 % of the order flow and are not expected to grow much more. Regulated internalization has not emerged. In contrast, OTC trading is the second source of liquidity after incumbent and new exchanges with more than 35 % of trading volumes. While MiFID served as a catalyst for the rise in fragmentation by allowing free competition, the actual drivers of fragmentation are investor clientele effects and technology. Clientele effects combined with a wider use of computer-based trading tools should sustain market fragmentation in the near future, yet liquidity aggregators should {{play a major role in}} consolidating the overall marketplace. The fragmentation of the visible order flow does not deteriorate price quality and does not harm liquidity. Crossing-network trading is not proved detrimental to liquidity either. On the contrary, competition contributes to reducing spreads and increasing market depth. Apart from those positive effects, significant <b>trade-through</b> rates are observed in European stock markets, and to date, fragmentation has been more beneficial to the liquidity of large stocks than to that of small stocks. These two observations are in contrast with U. S. stock markets where trade-throughs are prohibited and where market fragmentation benefits were found to be greater for small stocks than for large ones. Particular attention should be paid to the size of OTC trading as this type of internalization may have some adverse effects on liquidity. Last, as no regulatory body has been in charge of guaranteeing trade reporting consistency since MiFID 1 and because price discovery is fragmented between several venues, there is a need for an official consolidated trade and quote tape in Europe...|$|E
