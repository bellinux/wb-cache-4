500|$|Among {{the most}} popular areas for the vrijmarkt in Amsterdam is the Jordaan quarter, but the wide Apollolaan {{in front of the}} Hilton hotel in {{southern}} Amsterdam is gaining in popularity. [...] Children sell their cast-off toys or garments at the Vondelpark, also in southern Amsterdam, and in a spirit of fun passers-by often offer the young sellers more than <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for the goods. [...] Until 1996 the vrijmarkt began the evening before and continued for 24hours. [...] This was ended in the hope of gaining a pause in the celebrations so preparations could be made for the daytime activities. Utrecht, uniquely among Dutch municipalities, retains the overnight vrijmarkt.|$|E
500|$|The villagers of Glod, Romania, took {{legal action}} against the {{producers}} of Borat, complaining that they were lied to {{about the nature of}} the filming and they were portrayed as incestuous and ignorant. Some said they were paid only three lei (about US$1.28 in 2004) each, while others stated they were paid between $70 and $100 each, which did not cover their expenses. [...] <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for $38 million in damages.

2500|$|He {{writes that}} the apostles used the {{contemporary}} form of the Haustafeln in their ethical instruction with [...] "creative and imaginative pastoral insight". He does not think that the apostles, generally, are making social statements on prevailing customs. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> the question, [...] "What {{does it mean to}} be 'in Christ' in this situation?" [...] or [...] "What is the relationship between Christian freedom and this social institution?" [...] Parsons finds the implications to be profound. Even slaves are responsible; the possibility of living a Christian life depends solely on Christ’s grace―not circumstance.|$|E

Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as [...] "growing the vote". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists {{in the process of}} passing House bills. One lobbyist said, [...] "I've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill—at least like <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> us to whip bills now." [...] His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total.|$|E
2500|$|Founders of Women for the Wall {{have stated}} that they support {{alternative}} prayer at the Robinson's Arch section of the Kotel. They have requested meetings with leaders of Women of the Wall, who have declined. W4W leaders state that their objection is to the imposition of alternative prayer and associated political agendas on traditional women, plus their desire to confront and shock them, at Judaism's holiest site [...] [...] "Don't forget, Women FOR the Wall is {{not asking you to}} change. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> you not to change them." [...] Ronit Peskin has stated concerning traditional women, [...] "We want to come and pray peacefully, and you (The Women of the Wall group that insist on praying in the traditional women's section and not at Robinson's Arch) are disrupting the prayers of other women around you." [...] Leaders of W4W have condemned any show of verbal or phsycal violence by orthodox Jews against WoW and their supporters. The ongoing efforts of W4W to role model peaceful, silent prayer, plus their calls to the orthodox to refuse to respond to provocations have decreased heated reactions from the orthodox camp; The Forward described the gathering at the Kotel on 4 October 2013 (Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan) [...] "the calmest prayer service in months".|$|E

30|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was sent to}} all surgeons listed on the Gynecare database in the UK who were known to or thought to be carrying out TVT (n= 446).

The type of anaesthetic was requested and whether the surgeons used the concept of aqua dissection.

Secondly, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> about their management of endometriosis which involved the rectum or prerectal fascia. Finally, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> whether <b>they</b> felt there should be a network of centres of excellence to manage advanced endometriosis, and what services they should offer.

There is happily no chance of our aristocracy having to meet such a fate in this loyal-hearted, law-abiding, sober-minded country. <b>They</b> <b>are,</b> however, <b>asked</b> to discharge a certain obligation. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to contribute their share to the expenses of the State.

Now {{this letter}} is only a typical example of the entire class of those which, being a {{governor}} of Christ's Hospital, I receive, in common {{with all the other}} governors, at the rate of about three a day, for a month or six weeks from the date of our names appearing in the printed list of the governors who have presentations for the current year. Having been a governor now some twenty-five years, I have documentary evidence enough to found some general statistics upon; from which there have resulted two impressions on my mind, which I wish here specially to note to you, and I do not doubt but that all the other governors, if you could ask them, would at once confirm what I say. My first impression is, a heavy and sorrowful sense of the general feebleness of intellect of that portion of the British public which stands in need of presentations to Christ's Hospital. This feebleness of intellect is mainly shown in the nearly total unconsciousness of the writers that anybody else may want a presentation, besides themselves. With the exception here and there of a soldier's or a sailor's widow, hardly one of them seems to have perceived the existence of any distress in the world but their own: none know what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> for, or imagine, unless as a remote contingency, the possibility of its having been promised at a prior date. The second most distinct impression on my mind, is that the portion of the British public which is in need of presentations to Christ's Hospital considers it a merit to have large families, with or without the means of supporting them! ...|$|E

"The {{meaning of}} the outrages on Orientals," [...] replied Fisher, [...] "is that the financiers have {{introduced}} Chinese labor into this country with the deliberate intention of reducing workmen and peasants to starvation. Our unhappy politicians have made concession after concession; and now <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asking</b> concessions which amount to our ordering a massacre of our own poor. If we do not fight now we shall never fight again. They will have put England in an economic position of starving in a week. But {{we are going to}} fight now; I shouldn't wonder if there were an ultimatum in a week and an invasion in a fortnight. All the past corruption and cowardice is hampering us, of course; the West country is pretty stormy and doubtful even in a military sense; and the Irish regiments there, that are supposed to support us by the new treaty, are pretty well in mutiny; for, of course, this infernal coolie capitalism is being pushed in Ireland, too. But it's to stop now; and if the government message of reassurance gets through to them in time, they may turn up after all by the time the enemy lands. For my poor old gang is going to stand to its guns at last. Of course it's only natural that when they have been whitewashed for half a century as paragons, their sins should come back on them at the very moment when they are behaving like men {{for the first time in}} their lives. Well, I tell you, March, I know them inside out; and I know they are behaving like heroes.
