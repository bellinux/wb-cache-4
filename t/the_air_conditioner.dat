5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} {{aimed to}} develop plasma system used in <b>air</b> <b>conditioners.</b> This developed plasma system could be installed in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> conditioners- all split type. <b>The</b> quality of <b>air</b> could be improved to be equal to present plasma system. Development processes were as follows: 1) to study the plasma system used in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioners,</b> 2) to design a plasma generator, 3) to develop the plasma generator, and 4) to test its performance in many types of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioners.</b> This plasma system was developed by AC high voltage – 14 kv with a frequency of 50 kHz. Carbon was a conductor to generate arc in <b>air</b> purifier system. <b>The</b> research was tested by installing the plasma generator in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> conditioners- wall type. Whereas, there were 3 types of installations: air flow out, air flow in, and room center. The result of the plasma generator installed in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioners,</b> split type, revealed that <b>the</b> <b>air</b> flow out installation provided the highest average of o-zone at 223 mg/h.

25|$|It {{follows from}} the second law of {{thermodynamics}} that the entropy {{of a system that}} is not isolated may decrease. An air conditioner, for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

2500|$|Damaged power cords of {{portable}} air conditioners cause many electrical fires and about 350 deaths per year. To combat this, each portable air conditioner {{sold in the}} United States is now required to have a leakage current detector interrupter (LCDI) or ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protective device built into its power cord. The device can be integral with the power plug, or a separate module within 12 inches of the plug. An LCDI cord has a fine wire mesh around the conductors, and circuitry to detect current leaking from the conductors to the mesh, which {{would happen if the}} cord were damaged or frayed.

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the program, reactions to the cancellation of the EV1 continued to be mixed. In GM's view, the EV1 was not a failure, but the program was doomed when the expected breakthroughs in battery technology did not take place within the anticipated timeline, citing the lack of availability of the NiMH-technology battery packs, developed by Energy Conversion Devices of Michigan, until late in the production cycle. The batteries improved the EV1's range, but not as dramatically as expected, and came with their own set of problems; a less-efficient charging algorithm had to be used (lengthening charge times), and the batteries heated up more quickly than the lead-acid packs (requiring use of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> to cool them down, wasting power). The automaker also cited the elimination of the CARB zero-emissions mandate as a factor in the program's cancellation, though the company was widely accused of lobbying against the mandate in an act of deliberate self-sabotage. The media perspective was far less favorable; in 2006, The Wall Street Journals Detroit Bureau Chief Joe White said, [...] "The EV1 was a failure, as were other electric vehicles launched in the 1990s to placate California clean-air regulators." [...] This opinion was echoed by TIME magazine, who in 2008 placed the EV1 on their list of [...] "The 50 Worst Cars of All Time".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reveal both the {{psychosomatic}} and the physical effects of local air velocity from an <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> using biomarkers which can be collected noninvasively. Salivary α-amylase activity (SAA) and salivary cortisol were used as the indexes of psychosomatic effects. The total protein (TP) collected from stratum corneum was used as an index of the physical condition of dry skin. A continuous experiment over a 5 days period in summer was conducted using 8 healthy young male adults for 2 -types of airflow conditioners, a whole ceiling-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> (without local <b>air</b> velocity) and a normal-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> (with local <b>air</b> velocity). <b>The</b> subjects felt cool, windy, dry and uncomfortable when under <b>the</b> normal-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> as determined in a subjective evaluation. The SAA under <b>the</b> normal-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> fluctuated more widely than with <b>the</b> whole ceiling-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner.</b> <b>The</b> level of salivary cortisol decreased more in a day under <b>the</b> normal-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> than with <b>the</b> whole ceiling-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner.</b> These results showed that reducing local air velocity may provide more healthy psychosomatic conditions over the long-term. Moreover, the TP of a drying-exposed skin area showed a significant change during this experiment whereas the TP of drying-protected area was relatively unchanged. It was indicated that one week’s exposure to local air velocity conditions possibly influences the drying of facial skin. Thus, air movement at low velocity can be provides more comfortable conditions not only psychosomatically but also physically. [URL]...|$|R
2500|$|DCFEMS {{also asked}} the D.C. police to {{investigate}} whether arson {{was the cause of}} the ambulance fires. Deputy Mayor Paul Quander called two ambulance fires on the same day suspicious and asked the police to investigate to ensure that [...] "nothing untoward is happening". Quander declined to elaborate on what he meant, and the firefighters' union denounced his statement as a slur on workers. But on August 16, a preliminary investigation determined that both fires were likely accidental. Investigators discovered that DCFEMS maintenance crews (with management approval) were attempting to fix overheating vehicle air conditioners by cutting up aluminum signs and using them as heat shields. DCFEMS superiors ordered the [...] "heat shields" [...] removed after the revelation. Police arson investigators then learned that Medic 27 (which caught fire at the apartment building) had ongoing maintenance issues and that its air conditioner repeatedly failed.

5000|$|In a {{thermodynamically}} closed system, {{any power}} dissipated {{into the system}} that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires {{that the rate of}} energy removal by <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> increase.

In order to do so, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its [...] "efficiency" [...] (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system.
