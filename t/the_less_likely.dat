5|$|As the {{invasion}} began, the Germans pursued the fleeing Red Army, leaving a security vacuum. Reports surfaced of Soviet guerrilla {{activity in the}} area, with local Jews immediately suspected of collaboration. Heydrich ordered his officers to incite anti-Jewish pogroms in the newly occupied territories. Pogroms, {{some of which were}} orchestrated by the Einsatzgruppen, broke out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. Within the first few weeks of Operation Barbarossa, 40 pogroms led to the deaths of 10,000 Jews, {{and by the end of}} 1941 some 60 pogroms had taken place, claiming as many as 24,000 victims. However, SS-Brigadeführer Franz Walter Stahlecker, commander of Einsatzgruppe A, reported to his superiors in mid-October that the residents of Kaunas were not spontaneously starting pogroms, and secret assistance by the Germans was required. A similar reticence was noted by Einsatzgruppe B in Russia and Belarus and Einsatzgruppe C in Ukraine; the further east the Einsatzgruppen travelled, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> the residents were to be prompted into killing their Jewish neighbours.|$|E

25|$|The {{more time}} that has elapsed {{since the last}} civil war, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> it is that a {{conflict}} will recur. The study had two possible explanations for this: one opportunity-based and the other grievance-based.

Alternatively, elapsed time may represent the gradual process of healing of old hatreds. The {{study found that the}} presence of a diaspora substantially reduced the positive effect of time, as the funding from diasporas offsets the depreciation of rebellion-specific capital.|$|E

For example, Paleolithic shelter constructions from the Lower Paleolithic (c. 2,600,000 - 300,000 BP) and Middle Paleolithic (c. 300,000 - 45,000 BP) are generally less complete and thus subject to interpretation, while those dating to the Upper Paleolithic (c. 45,000- 10,000 BP) are both more numerous and better preserved. Paleolithic structures generally have no remaining superstructure, and must be inferred from a footprint of artifacts.|$|E
25|$|According to {{economist}} David Foot of the University of Toronto, {{the level}} of a woman's education is {{the most important factor in}} determining whether she will reproduce: the higher her level of education, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> she is to bear children (or if she does, the fewer children she is likely to have). Overall, researchers have observed childless couples to be more educated, and it is perhaps because of this that they are more likely to be employed in professional and management occupations, more likely for both spouses to earn relatively high incomes, and to live in urban areas. They are also less likely to be religious, subscribe to traditional gender roles, or subscribe to conventional roles.|$|E
25|$|Where the finder is an employee, {{most cases}} hold that the find should be {{awarded to the}} {{employer}} {{if it has a}} heightened legal obligation to take care of its customers' property, otherwise it should go to the employee. A find occurring in a bank is generally awarded to the bank as the owner is likely to have been a bank customer and the bank has a fiduciary duty to try to reunite lost property with their owners. For similar reasons, common carriers are preferred to passengers and hotels to guests (but only where finds occur in guest rooms, not common areas). The view has been taken that such a rule is suitable for recently misplaced objects as it provides the best chance for them to be reunited with their owners. However, it effectively delivers title of old artefacts to landowners, since the older an object is, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> it is that the original depositor will return to claim it. The rule is therefore of little or no relevance to objects of archaeological value.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} P. exigua foragers {{leave the}} nest around 6am and foraging stops around 7pm. Foraging activity {{has been recorded}} from 11 to 12 am. In the hot and humid season, P. exigua exhibit greater nest activity than {{in the cold and}} dry season. Although the foraging of wasps decreases in rainy weather, the delivery of food and nest material does not stop completely. The habitat temperatures directly correlate with wasp activity: as the temperature increases, so does worker foraging. Luminosity has also been reported to influence {{the beginning and the end}} of the species’ foraging activity. Luminosity seems to have a greater affect on wasp activity when temperatures are more moderate. Additionally, wind speed directly impacts wasp activity; the stronger the wind, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> wasps are to exit their nests. Silva (2002) suggests P. exigua participate in a greater amplitude of activity as the latitude of their nesting region decreases. In other words, the closer the wasps are to the Equator, the more active the colonies are. In Ribeiro Jr.’s study on P. exigua from Brazil, he proposed that the wasp develops its foraging activities more efficiently within a flight range of 75m from its nest.|$|E
25|$|Research on priming and {{practice}} use single word tests to assess {{for the presence}} of TOT states. The first letter of the target word or a similar-sounding word is given in order to prime for the target word. Evidence that comes from the usefulness of priming {{and practice}} in reducing TOT states is that most information in TOT states is low-frequency; that is, it has not been used or recalled for some time. The recency of information use can influence the retrieval process of that information. The presentation of a prime is only needed once for it to facilitate TOT state resolution. Support for priming has been found in that when individuals are given the first letter of the word they are trying to recall, {{they are more likely to}} overcome their TOT state. When the prime is a related word instead of the first letter, an interesting effect occurs: When the prime word has similar phonology to the target word, an increase in the frequency of TOT states and a higher frequency of correctly recalled words when the TOT state is resolved is observed. Incorrect words come to mind involuntarily that share similar phonological features with the target word. Thus, phonological similarity can both decrease and increase TOT states. However, it is possible to fix this problem by changing the syntactic class of the priming word. Priming words that are in the same syntactic class as the target word create no difference in TOT state resolution. The TOT state resolution was the same for priming words in the same syntactic class and unrelated priming words. If the priming word is being listed in conjunction with other unrelated priming words, then the position is of importance. The earlier in the list the priming word is, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> it is to help resolve the TOT state.|$|E

500|$|The {{two major}} ways {{thunderstorms}} move are via advection {{of the wind}} and propagation along outflow boundaries towards sources of greater heat and moisture. Many thunderstorms move with the mean wind speed through the Earth's troposphere, the lowest [...] of the Earth's atmosphere. Weaker thunderstorms are steered by winds closer to the Earth's surface than stronger thunderstorms, as the weaker thunderstorms are not as tall. Organized, long-lived thunderstorm cells and complexes move at a right angle to the direction of the vertical wind shear vector. If the gust front, or leading edge of the outflow boundary, races ahead of the thunderstorm, its motion will accelerate in tandem. This is more of a factor with thunderstorms with heavy precipitation (HP) than with thunderstorms with low precipitation (LP). When thunderstorms merge, which is most likely when numerous thunderstorms exist in proximity to each other, the motion of the stronger thunderstorm normally dictates the future motion of the merged cell. The stronger the mean wind, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> other processes will be involved in storm motion. On weather radar, storms are tracked by using a prominent feature and tracking it from scan to scan.|$|E
