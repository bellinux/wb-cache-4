5|$|An early road {{following}} the current path {{was established in}} the late 19th century for miners and loggers. As floods ravaged the road along Bear Creek through the early 20th century, measures were taken to prevent further damage. Other sites along Bear Creek, such as a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in Red Rocks Park and the Bear Creek Canyon Scenic Mountain Drive, as the section between Idledale and Morrison is called, have given the route a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. An early designation of the route number went further west than its current-day designation; <b>that</b> <b>section</b> was truncated by the late 1930s. Another eastern segment was added from Morrison east toward Denver in the 1940s, but <b>that</b> <b>section</b> too was removed. Newer improvements to the road include widening the Evergreen Parkway segment to four lanes and constructing an interchange with I-70.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} it was {{considered}} that the two former Line E stations and tunnels {{should be used for}} Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E. However, it was eventually decided that the line should use new tunnels in <b>that</b> <b>section</b> due to its sharp curves.|$|E

5|$|If the broach {{is large}} enough the costs can be reduced by using a {{built-up}} or modular construction. This involves producing the broach in pieces and assembling it. If any portion wears out only <b>that</b> <b>section</b> has to be replaced, instead of the entire broach.|$|E
5|$|Justice Phang {{also held}} <b>that</b> <b>section</b> 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act was not {{necessarily}} determinative of the matter in the Collector's favour, as acquisitions can be challenged for having been made in bad faith.

5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, the route was {{improved}} west to Highway10 (Hurontario Street). This work was completed in early 1956. Service roads were installed and 13 intersections eliminated, resulting in a 50% reduction of the accident rate along <b>that</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

The project was completed in the summer of 2005, and fully open to traffic on August 20.|$|E

About 50% of the houses in Caye Caulker were destroyed, with reports of only five dwellings still standing after the storm. In San Pedro, about 30% of houses, or at least 50, were wrecked.

5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration <b>that</b> <b>section</b> 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional.

5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong, the {{respondent}} challenged his conviction for corruption {{on the ground}} <b>that</b> <b>section</b> 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which extends {{the effect of the}} Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens (but not non-citizens) occurring outside Singapore, discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12(1). The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.|$|E
