25|$|Masculinization {{of women}} and hypermasculinization of men has been a central theme in sexual {{orientation}} research. There are several studies suggesting that bisexuals have {{a high degree of}} masculinization. LaTorre and Wendenberg (1983) found differing personality characteristics for bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual women. Bisexuals were found to have fewer personal insecurities than heterosexuals and homosexuals. This finding defined bisexuals as self-assured and less likely to suffer from mental instabilities. The confidence of a secure identity consistently translated to more masculinity than other subjects. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> explore societal norms, prejudices, or the feminization of homosexual males.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{about the}} {{potential}} detrimental effects of antioxidants was raised by a recent meta-study {{of the effects of}} antioxidant supplements in the diet of normal subjects. The authors of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> find statistically significant evidence that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects on mortality. On the contrary, they concluded that β-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E seem to increase the risk of death. Concerns are that the antioxidants may allow rescue of cells that still sustain DNA mutations or altered genomic methylation patterns following radiation damage to DNA, which can result in genomic instability. An approach to target damaged cells for apoptosis may be advantageous for chronic exposures to GCR.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{these results}} of increased proportions of people seropositive for the parasite {{in cases of}} these neurological disorders do not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between the infection and disorder. It {{is also important to}} mention that in 2016 a population-representative birth cohort study which was done, to test a hypothesis that toxoplasmosis is related to impairment in brain and behaviour measured by a range of phenotypes including neuropsychiatric disorders, poor impulse control, personality and neurocognitive deficits. The results of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> support the results in the previously mentioned studies, more than marginally. None of the P-values showed significance for any outcome measure. Thus, according to this study, the presence of T. gondii antibodies is not correlated to increase susceptibility to any of the behaviour phenotypes (except possibly to a higher rate of unsuccessful attempted suicide). This team did not observe any significant association between T. gondii serpositivity and schizophrenia. The team notes that the null findings might be a false negative due to low statistical power because of small sample sizes, but against this weights that their set-up should avoid some possibilities for errors in the about 40 studies that did show a positive correlation. They conclude that further studies should be performed.|$|E

500|$|Some {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} to determine if video games can {{have a significant impact on}} cognitive and non cognitive skills.

500|$|The ashy-faced owl (T. glaucops) was {{for some}} time {{included}} in T. alba, and by some authors its populations from the Lesser Antilles still are. Based on DNA evidence, König, Weick & Becking (2009) recognised the American Barn Owl (T. furcata) and the Curaçao Barn Owl (T. bargei) as separate species. They also proposed that T. a. delicatula should be split off as a separate species, {{to be known as}} the eastern barn owl, which would include the subspecies T. d. sumbaensis, T. d. meeki, T. d. crassirostris and T. d. interposita. However, the International Ornithological Committee has doubts about this and states that the split of Tyto delicatula from T. alba [...] "may need to be revisited". Some island subspecies are occasionally treated as distinct species, a move which should await further research into barn owl phylogeography. According to Bruce in the Handbook of Birds of the World, Volume 5: Barn-owls to Hummingbirds, [...] "a review of the whole group [...] long overdue". Molecular analysis of mitochondrial DNA shows a separation of the species into two clades, an Old World alba and a New World furcata, but <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> include T. a. delicatula which the authors seem to have accepted as a separate species. A high amount of genetic variation was also found between the Indonesian T. a. stertens and other members of the alba clade, leading to the separation of stertens into Tyto javanica.|$|E

2500|$|As an {{alternative}} to active surveillance or definitive treatments, other therapies are also under investigation {{for the management of}} prostate cancer.

[...] However, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> compare the vegan diet to either active surveillance or definitive treatment, and thus cannot comment on the comparative efficacy of the vegan diet in treating prostate cancer.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{importance}} value, palms are highly valued by all species of capuchin. In El Tuparro National Park in Colombia, the palm Attalea regiae {{was a key}} species for this primate, the nuts being a principal food. In Manú National Park in Peru the palms Astrocaryum and Attalea {{were the most important}} palm genera, but perhaps not at the same level as Attalea in El Tuparro. Also, at Manú various species of Ficus were very important to the white-fronted capuchin; this emphasis on Ficus was not observed in the El Tuparro study, although <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> include an entire year. Nevertheless, research on other species suggests the importance of palms as [...] "key species" [...] and the lack of importance of Ficus in such habitats as gallery forests in the llanos of Colombia and Venezuela, contrasts with their high importance in more fertile habitats like Manú.|$|E
2500|$|... "Public {{concerns}} were raised {{earlier this year}} following {{the publication of a}} study by US researchers, who suggested that the levels of organic pollutants, including dioxins and PCBs, in farmed salmon could pose a health risk. Their advice to consume less than one half portion of farmed salmon (from specific areas) per month was in direct contrast to advice from food authorities to eat one portion of oily fish per week. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> however, present new data as levels of contaminants were consistent with those previously reported in smaller studies and remained within internationally accepted safety guidelines. The discrepancy arose because the authors based their advice on a method of risk analysis that is not internationally accepted by toxicologists and other food safety experts. Food safety authorities in Europe and in the USA agreed that the study did not raise new health concerns and that eating one portion of farmed salmon per week was still considered safe." ...|$|E
