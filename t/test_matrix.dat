40|$|A new {{criterion}} for A-stability of peer two-step methods is presented which is verifiable exactly in exact arithmetic by checking semi-definiteness {{of a certain}} <b>test</b> <b>matrix.</b> It depends {{on the existence of}} two positive definite weight matrices for a given method. Although the initial approach is different using properties of the numerical radius the criterion itself resembles the one from algebraic stability of General Linear Methods.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical method for topological observability {{analysis of a}} measured power system. By floating-point operations on the echelon form of a rectangular <b>test</b> <b>matrix,</b> {{which is based on}} network graph properties, observability and maximal observable islands are determined. A minimal set of pseudo measurements, which make an unobservable network barely observable, is selected in a noniterative manner.

Due to round-off errors, the zero pivots may be misclassified. The problem becomes more severe when the number of injection measurements is large, resulting in a great disparity of values in Jacobian or gain matrix. In the proposed method, the <b>test</b> <b>matrix</b> consists of + / - 1 values, it is numerically better conditioned and zero pivots are identified more accurately. By topological processing of the flow measured branches and by removing the redundant injection measured nodes that are incident only to flow measured branches or branches which form loops with flow measured branches, a reduced <b>test</b> <b>matrix</b> is created with fewer nonzero. elements than the Jacobian or the gain matrix, resulting in less computational effort.

40|$|To enable {{arriving}} {{aircraft to}} fly optimized descents computed by the flight management system (FMS) in congested airspace, ground automation must accurately predict descent trajectories. To support {{development of the}} predictor and its uncertainty models, descents from cruise to the meter fix were executed using vertical navigation in a B 737 - 700 simulator and a B 777 - 200 simulator, both with commercial FMSs. For both aircraft types, the FMS computed the intended descent path for a specified speed profile assuming idle thrust after top of descent (TOD), and then it controlled the avionics without human intervention. The <b>test</b> <b>matrix</b> varied aircraft weight, descent speed, and wind conditions. The first analysis in this paper determined {{the effect of the}} <b>test</b> <b>matrix</b> parameters on the FMS computation of TOD location, and it compared the results to those for the current ground predictor in the Efficient Descent Advisor (EDA). The second analysis was similar but considered the time to fly a specified distance to the meter fix. The effects of the <b>test</b> <b>matrix</b> variables together with the accuracy requirements for the predictor will determine the allowable error for the predictor inputs. For the B 737, the EDA prediction of meter fix crossing time agreed well with the FMS; but its prediction of TOD location probably was not sufficiently accurate to enable idle-thrust descents in congested airspace, even though the FMS and EDA gave similar shapes for TOD location {{as a function of the}} <b>test</b> <b>matrix</b> variables. For the B 777, the FMS and EDA gave different shapes for the TOD location function, and the EDA prediction of the TOD location is not accurate enough to fully enable the concept.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid topological-numerical approach for observability analysis in power system state estimation. By partitioning the network in observable areas, a reduced network is formed, where each area {{is represented by}} a supernode and each line between areas as a branch. We select as areas the flow islands, being the maximal connected components of flow-measured branches. Only boundary nodes and injections at flow islands are retained for numerical processing. Observability testing and identification of maximal observable islands are accomplished by numerical processing on the echelon form of a rectangular <b>test</b> <b>matrix,</b> {{which is based on}} the reduced network graph properties. The method uses a noniterative scheme to select a minimal set of nonredundant pseudo measurements which make an unobservable network barely observable.

40|$|Sparse matrix-vector {{multiplication}} (spMVM) is {{the most}} time-consuming kernel in many numerical algorithms and has been studied extensively on all modern processor and accelerator architectures. However, the optimal sparse matrix data storage format is highly hardware-specific, which could become an obstacle when using heterogeneous systems. Also, it is as yet unclear how the wide single instruction multiple data (SIMD) units in current multi- and many-core processors should be used most efficiently {{if there is no}} structure in the sparsity pattern of the matrix. We suggest SELL-C-sigma, a variant of Sliced ELLPACK, as a SIMD-friendly data format which combines long-standing ideas from General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) and vector computer programming.
