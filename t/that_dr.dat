40|$|The drs gene was {{originally}} isolated as a suppressor of v-src transformation. Expression of drs mRNA ismarkedly downregulated {{in a variety}} of human cancer cell lines and tissues. Ectopic expression of the Drs protein inducedapoptosis in human cancer cell lines via the novel pathway initiated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), involving thebinding to ASY, apoptosis-inducing proteins localized in ER, and activation of caspase- 12, - 9, and - 3. We generated drsknockout (KO) mice and showed that malignant tumors including lymphomas, lung adenocarcinomas and hepatomas weregenerated in about 30 % of drs KO mice. These results indicate <b>that</b> <b>drs</b> contributes to the suppression of malignant tumorformation, and this suppression is closely correlated with drs-mediated apoptosis. We also investigated the physiological rolesof drs gene by using mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells derived from drs KO mice, and found <b>that</b> <b>drs</b> is associated withRab 24, autophagy regulating protein, and regulates autophagy maturation under low serum culture conditions. Furthermore,drs suppresses viral replication via mTOR-dependent pathway. These results suggest <b>that</b> <b>drs</b> is involved in the protectiveresponses of the cells against the carcinogenesis and viral infection...|$|R

40|$|Recently, we {{have found}} that the skin {{secretions}} of the Amazonian tree frog Phyllomedusa bicolor contains molecules with antitumor and angiostatic activities and identified one of them as the antimicrobial peptide dermaseptin (Drs) B 2. In the present study we further explored the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of this molecule and investigated its mechanism of action. We showed <b>that</b> <b>Drs</b> B 2 inhibits the proliferation and colony formation of various human tumor cell types, and the proliferation and capillary formation of endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, Drs B 2 inhibited tumor growth of the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line PC 3 in a xenograft model in vivo. Research on the mechanism of action of Drs B 2 on tumor PC 3 cells demonstrated a rapid increasing amount of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase, no activation of caspase- 3, and no changes in mitochondrial membrane potential. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed <b>that</b> <b>Drs</b> B 2 can interact with the tumor cell surface, aggregate and penetrate the cells. These data together indicate <b>that</b> <b>Drs</b> B 2 does not act by apoptosis but possibly by necrosis. In conclusion, Drs B 2 could be considered as an interesting and promising pharmacological and therapeutic leader molecule for the treatment of cancer...|$|R

5|$|After {{collecting}} {{all four}} artefacts, Lara travels to Antarctica and discovers <b>that</b> <b>Dr.</b> Willard {{had been using}} the knowledge gained from the meteorite to perform experiments on his own men, turning them into horrible mutations. Angered by this revelation, she confronts Dr. Willard, who reveals that he is planning to encourage the mutations, only on a global scale, using the combined power of the artefacts and the meteorite from which they were carved. As Lara voices her opposition to his operation, Willard betrays her, steals the artefacts, and disappears into the excavation site. After fighting more mutants and navigating the treacherous ruins of the ancient city built atop the meteorite crater, Lara faces Willard, who has now used {{the power of the}} four artefacts to greatly speed up the evolutionary processes of the human body and thereby turned himself into a spider-like creature. Lara deactivates the meteorite by recovering the artefacts, kills the mutated Willard, and escapes by helicopter.|$|E
