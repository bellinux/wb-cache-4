5|$|A PC Engine port of Ninja Ryūkenden was {{produced}} in 1992, published by Hudson Soft and released only in Japan; it features more colorful and detailed graphics, along with difficulty and gameplay tweaks and a different soundtrack. This version also supports three different language settings with Japanese, English and Chinese as the available options. However, the English translation used in this version differs from the one used in the earlier NES version. To switch between the three settings, the player must press the Select + I + II buttons simultaneously at the title screen, which will change the text under the logo <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> characters.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they share with lizards. Oxygenated {{blood from the}} lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of {{the two types of}} blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.|$|E

5|$|On {{arrival at}} North or South station coffins would usually be {{unloaded}} onto a hand-drawn bier and pulled by LNC staff <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> chapel. While this {{was taking place}} the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station. On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service (third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried). For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave.|$|E

5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, sealing the VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|Croatia's county prefects, {{city and}} town mayors are elected to {{four-year}} terms {{by a majority}} of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves, based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council (as required by the constitution), adding further members to the council (who belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> minorities) by selecting them from unelected-candidate lists. Election silence, as in all other elections in Croatia, is enforced on the day of the elections and the previous day, ending at 7:00pm when the polling stations close and exit polls may be announced.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E

5|$|That afternoon, Reagan {{consulted}} with White House counsel Fred Fielding by telephone, {{debating whether to}} invoke the amendment and, if so, whether such a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: the first letter specifically invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment; the second only mentioned that Reagan was mindful of this provision. At 10:32a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its delivery <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> officers as required under the amendment. Vice President George H. W. Bush was Acting President from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan transmitted a second letter to resume the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Department {{responded by}} sending {{personnel}} {{to analyze the}} proposed route and plan. Max Brewer, an arctic expert {{in charge of the}} Naval Arctic Research Laboratory at Barrow, concluded that the plan to bury most of the pipeline was completely unfeasible because of the abundance of permafrost along the route. In a report, Brewer said the hot oil conveyed by the pipeline would melt the underlying permafrost, causing the pipeline to fail as its support turned to mud. This report was passed along <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> committees of the U.S. House and Senate, which had to approve the right-of-way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.|$|E
5|$|Wiseau {{has been}} secretive about {{exactly how he}} {{obtained}} the funding for the project, but he did tell Entertainment Weekly that he made {{some of the money}} by importing leather jackets from Korea. According to Sestero in his book The Disaster Artist, Wiseau was already independently wealthy at the time production began, having amassed a fortune over several years of entrepreneurship and real estate development in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco. The budget for The Room reached , all of which was spent on production and marketing. Wiseau has stated that the reason the film was relatively expensive was because many members of the cast and crew had to be replaced, and each of the cast members had several understudies. According to Sestero, Wiseau made numerous poor decisions during filming that unnecessarily inflated the film's budget, such as building sets for sequences that could have been filmed on location, purchasing unnecessary equipment, and filming identical scenes multiple times using different sets. Sestero further wrote that the film's budget skyrocketed as a result of minutes-long dialogue sequences taking hours or days to shoot due to Wiseau's inability to properly remember his lines or move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> place on camera.|$|E

5|$|Women {{experience}} many unique {{health issues}} related to reproduction and sexuality and these are responsible for {{a third of all}} health problems experienced by women during their reproductive years (aged 15–44), of which unsafe sex is a major risk factor, especially in developing countries. Reproductive health includes {{a wide range of issues}} including the health and function of structures and systems involved in reproduction, pregnancy, childbirth and child rearing, including antenatal and perinatal care. Global women's health has a much larger focus on reproductive health than that of developed countries alone, but also infectious diseases such as malaria in pregnancy and non-communicable diseases (NCD). Many of the issues that face women and girls in resource poor regions are relatively unknown in developed countries, such as female genital cutting, and further lack access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> diagnostic and clinical resources.|$|E
5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>appropriate</b> drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E
