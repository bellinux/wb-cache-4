40|$|Nowadays, {{treatment}} of paraproteinemic polyneuropathy is a fairly complex interdisciplinary process. The main method of therapy {{is still the}} use of chemotherapeutic drugs as means of pathogenetic {{treatment of}} the underlying disease. However, the use of chemotherapy with neurotoxicity can cause development of <b>toxic</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> which increases neurological deficit.  Any comprehensive neurorehabilitation program for patients with these forms of polyneuropathies have not been developed to date. The article presents data of clinical observations of 26  patients with paraproteinemic polyneuropathy which had undergone a course of neurorehabilitation treatment, both medical and nondrug technologies, including the methods of kinesiotherapy and physiotherapy. </p...|$|E

40|$|Neither {{clinical}} nor laboratory evaluation {{can distinguish}} occupational neuropathies from neuropathies due to other causes. A worker may suffer either from mechanical injury of individual nerves {{or from a}} <b>toxic</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> that is usually axonal in type. A thorough occupational and environmental history and the recognition of clusters of cases are important in determining the diagnosis. Electrophysiologic studies are helpful in detecting neuropathies in patients who have been occupationally exposed to neurotoxins but have no symptoms. Prevention of occupational neuropathies depends on clinical vigilance, industrial hygiene surveys, biologic monitoring and periodic examination of workers exposed to neurotoxic chemicals. The development of more sophisticated methods of prevention and early detection of peripheral nerve involvement depend on understanding the mechanisms of action of toxins and the pathophysiology of the lesions they cause...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The use of {{nucleoside}} {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors {{in the treatment}} of HIV infection is associated with antiretroviral <b>toxic</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> (ATN). Previous studies suggest that long term treatment with Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) 1. 5 gram twice daily improves symptoms and promotes nerve regeneration. It is unknown whether the drug’s pharmacokinetic profile would allow for a once daily administration. Twenty three HIV- 1 infected subjects taking AL-CAR for ATN were enrolled in a cross over trial and switched from twice to once daily dosing. Their regimen was changed from 1. 5 g twice daily to 1 g (4 patients), 2 g (7), and 3 g (12) once daily, respectively. Twelve healthy volunteers served as control. Plasma levels of ALCAR and its metabolite L-carnitine were measured. Patients receiving ALCAR had higher pre-dose levels than control subjects. Post dose levels were not significantly higher than pre dose levels in an...|$|E
40|$|The <b>toxic</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> {{observed}} {{in a group of}} shoe-industry workers in Italy was clinically characterised by a symmetrical prevalently distal motor deficit, with occasional marked weakness of pelvic girdle muscles, and frequently by only subjective sensory symptoms; non-specific disturbances usually preceded neurological signs. Subclinical cases of 'minimal' chronic neuropathy, characterised by alterations of a neurogenic type in the EMG without a reduction of motor nerve conduction velocity, were also observed. Worsening of the clinical picture, with further lowering of nerve conduction velocity, was noted in some cases up to four months after removal from the toxic environment. In the most severe cases clinical recovery took up to three years. The electromyographic and electroneurographic features were consistent with a mixed axonal neuropathy, with clear prevalence of the damage in the distal part of the nerve (dying-back neuropathy). Volatile substances, such as n-hexane and other low boiling point hydrocarbons found in high percentage in solvents and glues, are suggested as the causative agent...|$|E

Plasma levels of ALCAR and its metabolite L-carnitine were measured. Patients receiving ALCAR had higher pre-dose levels than control subjects. Post dose levels were not significantly higher than pre dose levels in any treatment group. The pre / post dose ALCAR concentrations were 7. 6  / 7. 7, 7. 1  / 6. 8, 7. 7  / 6. 8, and 7. 1  / 7. 5 µmol/l for 1. 5 g twice daily, 1 g once daily, 2 g once daily, and 3 g once daily, respectively. All values were significantly higher than the mean concentration in the control group (4. 3 µmol/l). For ALCAR and L-carnitine, measurements for once daily regimens did not differ from the twice daily regimen. Once daily dosing of ALCAR can achieve similar plasma levels as twice daily dosing but intra-mitochondrial levels remain unknown. The pharmacokinetic profile of orally administered ALCAR is complex and likely to be highly affected by endogenous concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Since 1957, {{when the}} first cases of the {{so-called}} shoe-makers' <b>toxic</b> <b>polyneuropathy</b> were reported, nearly 400 cases have been described in the Italian literature. The substance that {{was considered to be}} responsible for the disease was triorthocresylphosphate (TOCP) contained in glues, artificial leathers, and some types of paints. However numerous chemical analyses of glues and leathers taken from factories where cases of the disease occurred have shown that in almost all instances little or no TOCP was present. In addition the disease manifests itself more frequently during winter and spring and this is not consistent with the absorption of the causative agent through the skin and/or gastrointestinal tract. In order to clarify the aetiology of the disease 122 workers in the shoe industry affected by toxic polymeuropathy during the period 1971 - 74 were studied. Workplaces where cases of polyneuropathy had occurred were visited and samples of glues and solvents were taken for chemical analysis. The polyneuropathy chiefly affects workers engaged in glueing and in the cleaning process, but it also affects those who do not have direct contact with glues or solvents. The disease is more common in women (68 %) than in men (32 %) and, in its more severe form begins with overwhelming prevalence during winter and early spring regardless of the job performed. No direct relationship has been found between the severity of the disease and the number of years of work in the shoe industry or of specific exposure (that is the number of years of work in the activity performed {{at the onset of the}} disease). The polyneuropathy is found almost exclusively among workers of the artisam type in small shoe factories, where standards of hygiene are low. Chemical analysis of glues and cleaning fluids collected from five different factories, where 20 cases of polyneuropathy occurred, showed the presence of paraffin hydrocarbons with a low boiling point (pentane, 2 -methyl-pentane, 3 -methyl-pentane, n-hexane, etc.) in concentrations of more than 80 % by weight...|$|E
