5|$|According to the {{hypothesis}} that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom {{in a number of}} lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, Aipysurus eydouxii found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in <b>the</b> <b>venom</b> had undergone a deletion of two nucleotide bases which made <b>the</b> <b>venom</b> 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the selection pressure needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing <b>the</b> <b>venom</b> genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar venom degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater Dasypeltis scabra, whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had no use for its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.|$|E

5|$|The natural diets {{of snakes}} in the {{widespread}} viper genus Echis are highly varied, and include arthropods, such as scorpions, {{as well as}} vertebrates. Various Echis species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with <b>the</b> <b>venom</b> of various Echis species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to scorpions. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to arthropods was related {{to an increase in}} the proportion of arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of coevolution. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance of a change in venom composition in the species ancestral to all Echis snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of <b>the</b> <b>venom</b> of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>venom</b> is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. This pattern is also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that <b>the</b> <b>venom</b> of arthropod-consuming Echis species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.|$|E

Methods : To evaluate antibacterial activities of the test samples, gram negative E. coli and gram positive St. aureus were compared using the paper disc method. For comparison of the antioxidant effects, DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging assay and Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) assay were conducted. Results : 1. Antibacterial activity against gram negative E. coli was greater in <b>the</b> Sweet Bee <b>Venom</b> group than <b>the</b> Bee <b>Venom</b> group. 2.

5|$|There {{have been}} debates {{about whether the}} {{original}} gene duplication events occurred in a salivary gland or in body tissues themselves.

5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of <b>the</b> <b>venom</b> hypothesis.

In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>venom</b> (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl.

5|$|Gene {{duplication}} is not {{the only}} way that venom has become more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. <b>The</b> <b>venom</b> of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins.

40|$|Background: Jellyfishes {{belong to}} the phylum Cnidarians {{with a wide range}} of size, from 22 centimeters to 2. 5 meters. Jellyfishes have a {{worldwide}} distribution comprising over nine thousands species that approximately, 100 species are dangerous for humans. <b>The</b> <b>venoms</b> of these organisms contain biomolecules with extensive activities which could be used as a source of novel drugs in the future. Materials and Methods: The PubMed data bank was searched for the term “Jellyfish”. A total of 1677 papers were found. These papers were divided into three categories: medical, biomedical and biotechnological fields. The medical category was further divided into three subcategories comprising systemic manifestations, cutaneous manifestations and treatments for the stings of jellyfishes. The biomedical category was further subdivided into genomics, proteomics, and biology of venoms, mechanisms of actions and products of biomedical significance. In this part of systematic review, the biomedical and biotechnological and biotechnological fields were evaluated. Results: The genomics and proteomics of 24 species of jellyfishes had been studied in details. The mechanisms of actions of <b>the</b> <b>venoms</b> of 23 species were under investigations. The hematologic (hemolytic effects), cardiotoxic, neurotoxic, dermonecrotic, immunologic and cytotoxic presentations for <b>the</b> <b>venoms</b> were reported.
