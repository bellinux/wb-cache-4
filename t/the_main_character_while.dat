500|$|After Nintendo's announcement, a three-person team {{decided to}} create a fan {{translation}} of the game. The development process was compared by them to [...] "a Frankenstein's monster", referring to how they needed to assess the data, construct a development schedule for the translation patch, going through theories about file structure, then creating a tool to access the game's data files. The modification program was then tested on Super Smash Bros. Brawl by a dedicated tester, then sent back for refinement. They worked hard to preserve {{the atmosphere of the}} original game, along with attempting to make the translation as true as possible without being overly verbose. To help translate the text, they posted the script in segments on internet forums, then later restricted access to the work due to quality concerns. During this time, they found several competent translators who were able to do the final 20% of script translation. It took several months for the entire process of extracting text, translation, then patching in the translated text to be completed. The patch ended up being quite large as the game designers had split the game into hundreds of different data archives and suitable accommodations and adjustments needed to be made for this. The fan translation was released on January 19, 2010. The patch was designed to work on any Wii device, bypassing the console's region locking, and included a newly-made costume for <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character.</b> <b>While</b> receiving no official localized title, it has commonly been dubbed [...] "Fatal Frame / Project Zero IV" [...] or [...] "Fatal Frame / Project Zero: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse" [...] by journalists.|$|E
2500|$|Margera has written, {{produced}} {{and starred in}} three independent films. Margera co-wrote, directed and starred in [...] (2003), an independent film based on real events {{in the life of}} his friend Ryan Dunn. Dunn played himself as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character</b> <b>while</b> Margera played [...] "Valo", a character based on himself and elements of HIM singer and friend Ville Valo.|$|E
2500|$|An earlier, uncanonical Strider sequel {{has been}} {{released}} by British game publisher U.S. Gold years prior to Capcom's version of Strider 2. Titled Strider II in Europe and Journey from Darkness: Strider Returns in North America, the game was released for various European home computers in 1990 and remade for Sega consoles in 1992. In Strider II, however, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character,</b> <b>while</b> implied {{to be the same}} Strider from the original game, is addressed as [...] "Hinjo" [...] in the instruction manual for the Sega Genesis version. In this game, Hinjo must save a young woman, the leader of planet Magenta (whose name is Lexia according to the console versions) from a terrorist group (led by the Grandmaster himself in the console versions, who originally did not appear in the game's computer versions).|$|E

50|$|The {{frame is}} muted here, as the {{narrative}} draws {{back to reveal}} more of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters,</b> <b>while</b> allowing for other characters' stories to be heard.|$|R
50|$|In the 2006 movie Devil's Den, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters,</b> <b>while</b> {{being trapped}} in the strip club by female ghouls, have a fantasy {{scenario}} of how Zatoichi would deal with the ghouls himself.|$|R
2500|$|Grammer did not {{originally}} want {{to continue}} playing Frasier Crane, and Angell, Casey, and Lee {{did not want the}} new show to be compared to Cheers, which they had worked on before Wings. The three proposed that the actor play a wealthy, Malcolm Forbes-like paraplegic publisher who operated his business from his apartment. The main show featured a [...] "street smart" [...] Hispanic live-in nurse who would clash with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character.</b> <b>While</b> Grammer liked the concept, Paramount Television disliked it, and suggested that the best route would be to spin off the Frasier Crane character. Grammer ultimately agreed to star in a Cheers spin-off, but the producers set the new show as far from Boston as possible to prevent NBC from demanding that other characters from the old show make guest appearances on the new show during its first season. After first choosing Denver, Angell, Casey, and Lee ultimately chose Seattle as the setting.|$|E
50|$|The NES {{version of}} Trojan {{features}} several significant {{changes to the}} game, such as the addition of new power-ups and hidden rooms, {{as well as an}} alternative versus mode, where two players compete against each other in a first-to-three-rounds match, making it Capcom's first attempt at the fighting game genre. Player 1 controls <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character,</b> <b>while</b> Player 2 controls the enemy character, whose abilities are identical to <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character.</b> <b>While</b> the version in Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1 is a direct emulation of the original arcade game, it also allows the option to assign one of the action buttons for jumping in addition to using the directional pad or the analog stick.|$|E
50|$|It is a prequel to the {{television}} serial The Brain of Morbius from Morbius and Solon and the Sisterhood of the Flame's perspective, although it is technically also a sequel as the Fifth Doctor is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character</b> <b>while</b> The Brain of Morbius featured the Fourth as the central protagonist. Cardinal Borusa also appears.|$|E
500|$|Hardenberg's [...] "psycho-sexual powerplay" [...] against <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters</b> <b>while</b> in <b>the</b> Alps {{stands for}} what Weingartner {{considers}} [...] "a betrayal of European Left by hippie-era survivors including Joschka Fischer, Gerhard Schroder — and Tony Blair." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Kaidan Restaurant anime {{where each}} episode is broken up into three [...] "dishes" [...] (Appetizer, Main Dish, and Dessert), the [...] "Dessert" [...] is a ghost story told {{by one of}} <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters</b> <b>while</b> playing Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} into her kidnapping starts to probe secrets from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters.</b> <b>While</b> Senator Collins {{is clean and}} desperately wants his wife returned, even payment of the ransoms demanded will not get her back. He paid both $5,000,000 in cash (plus public humiliation), then voted to confirm a Supreme Court nominee he hated, because he knew the nominee seduced under-aged girls.|$|R
50|$|An {{article on}} Comicmix.com {{emphasized}} the game's focus on teamwork {{between the two}} characters: in single-player mode, the AI controls the other character aside from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character,</b> <b>while</b> the game can be played in Local Co-op with two players as both characters. The article also mentioned {{there would be no}} online Co-op mode.|$|E
5000|$|Margera has written, {{produced}} {{and starred in}} three independent films. Margera co-wrote, directed and starred in Haggard (2003), an independent film based on real events {{in the life of}} his friend Ryan Dunn. Dunn played himself as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character</b> <b>while</b> Margera played [...] "Valo", a character based on himself and elements of HIM singer and friend Ville Valo.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} Hammett {{source was}} his 1929 novel Red Harvest, which details {{the story of}} a gang war in a corrupt Prohibition-era American city, a war initiated by the machinations of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character.</b> <b>While</b> Miller's Crossing follows the plot and main characters of The Glass Key fairly closely, the film has no direct scenes, characters, or dialogue from Red Harvest.|$|E
25|$|The {{brothers}} {{first appeared}} in the 1935 Our Gang short Beginner's Luck. By the end of the year, Alfalfa was one of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters,</b> <b>while</b> Harold had been relegated to the background. Although Carl was an experienced singer and musician, his character Alfalfa was often called upon to sing off-key renditions of popular songs, most often those of Bing Crosby. Alfalfa also sported a cowlick.|$|R
50|$|Eleven {{character}} {{cards for}} the film were released in July 2013. Starting in January 2014, director Wes Ball released one image from the film once a week, {{leading up to the}} film's first trailer release on March 17, 2014. A viral marketing campaign launched by 20th Century Fox began on April 16, 2014. The campaign is a website featuring <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters</b> <b>while</b> focusing on W.C.K.D, an organization in Dashner's novel series of the same name. The website has the domain wckdisgood.com.|$|R
50|$|According to Bey Logan's audio {{commentary}} on the Region 2 DVD released by Hong Kong Legends, Edward Tang introduced Chan to Frank Capra's film Pocketful of Miracles (1961). After seeing it, Chan was influenced to produce a film with a 1930s setting. The script by Edward Tang and Jackie Chan expands the backstories of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters</b> <b>while</b> staying faithful to the source, with some comic references included and Jackie's trademark action style that sticks to {{the tone of the}} light hearted film.|$|R
50|$|The panels {{were usually}} {{realized}} by a team: Mario Cubbino for example was often {{responsible for the}} semi-nude body of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character,</b> <b>while</b> other drew the face, backgrounds, and other necessary features. The stories of Pantera Bionda, a blonde western girl raised by a Chinese woman, are set in the forests of Borneo and Sunda Islands just {{after the end of}} World War II; she fights criminals and the last Japanese Army survivors who had not surrendered to the Allies.|$|E
50|$|Regen is {{an example}} of the popular City Symphony film. City Symphonies like those created by Ruttman, Cavalcanti, and Vertov vary, evidently, in the cities featured, but also in their {{treatment}} of their subjects and the prominence of the director’s voice in the piece: Ruttman’s film made Berlin itself <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character,</b> <b>while</b> Vertov’s film is highly reflexive, often featuring the director and his brother working the camera through stunts and trick shots. These films were created in conjunction with the avant-garde movement and emergence of formalism, and accordingly focus on aesthetic properties more than content.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the double}} {{title of the}} film indicates, the {{ultimate}} purpose {{of the film is}} to analyze how a social system can restrict the freedom of people. During the Theodor Fontane's time, it was actually common to include a second title by adding an or statement. With such an arrangement, the first title was usually the name of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character,</b> <b>while</b> the second is used to describe the social stigma being critiqued. [...] However, Theodor Fontane did not include the second in the original novel Effi Briest, but was instead added by Fassbinder in his production of the film.|$|E
5000|$|A TV drama {{was created}} and aired on TV Asahi in 2002. The opening theme song was called [...] "Galaxy" [...] by Nana Katase, and the closing theme was [...] "Through the Rain" [...] by Mariah Carey. It adapted <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters</b> <b>while</b> adding new <b>characters</b> {{over the course}} of the nine-episode series. The drama also {{advances}} the romantic relationships of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters,</b> and it appears as if the producers of this drama were giving the fans what they have always wanted. Each episode ran for 45 minutes each.|$|R
5000|$|Billy Elliot the Musical {{incorporates}} {{the most famous}} section of Swan Lake in a dance number, in which <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character</b> dances <b>while</b> shadowed by his future, adult self.|$|R
50|$|The first Hebereke {{game for}} the Nintendo Entertainment System was {{released}} in the PAL region under the title of Ufouria: The Saga, which changed the names of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters,</b> <b>while</b> {{two of them had}} their looks changed. A North American release was planned, but canceled; however, the PAL region version was later added to the Wii Virtual Console in North America. A later set of games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System were also released under the Hebereke title, which retained the original names and looks from the Japanese version.|$|R
50|$|Scenes {{in several}} other movies, {{including}} Rocky II (1979) starring Sylvester Stallone, Mannequin (1987) starring Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall, In Her Shoes (2005) starring Cameron Diaz, Shirley MacLaine, and Toni Collette, and The Happening (2008) starring Mark Wahlberg, were filmed a few streets away in nearby Rittenhouse Square. The exceptional use of this one city block by the movie and TV industry relates to the history and aesthetics of Delancey Place, and cultural setting as an idyllic city street. For example, in Trading Places, {{it was used to}} convey the great wealth of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character</b> <b>while</b> in The Answer Man, the aesthetic of the street was utilized in a strolling scene, where the two main characters were interacting.|$|E
5000|$|An earlier, uncanonical Strider sequel {{has been}} {{released}} by British game publisher U.S. Gold years prior to Capcom's version of Strider 2.

5000|$|At first, Erin {{wants to}} be with Jilly more than anything, but when she met [...] "Cute Boy", a.k.a. Mark Sacks, she changes her mind. On her first day, she {{receives}} three days of detention because she punches a childhood enemy, Serena, on the nose for calling Jilly her master puppeteer. Her elder brother, Chris, becomes annoyed over the incident, because he loves Serena's older sister. After the [...] "puppet incident", Jilly signs herself and Erin up for the Thanksgiving Day play. Jilly gets the role of Goody Stanton, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character,</b> <b>while</b> Erin receives the part of an Ear of Corn, a moment of great annoyance and anger for her. Erin also signed up for the school Intranet Club (the school's Internet) without Jilly, which is very significant because it's the first time she breaks away from her friend's hold and does anything on her own. There, she meets Tyler, whom her new friend Rosie said had been crushing on Erin.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{episode is}} broken up into three [...] "dishes", namely <b>the</b> Appetizer, <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> Dish, and <b>the</b> Dessert. The [...] "Appetizer" [...] {{is a short}} story {{featuring}} something supernatural, such as ghosts, spirits, or similar. The [...] "Main Dish" [...] is a longer ghost story similar to the Appetizer, usually with a twist. The [...] "Dessert" [...] is a ghost story told by one of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters</b> <b>while</b> playing Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai (Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai). These involve characters {{not related to the}} series and end with some sort of a moral lesson. From the thirteenth episode onwards, a fourth story is told while the ending score plays, replacing the original animation; these stories have a scary picture shown when the music ends.|$|R
500|$|The film {{score was}} {{composed}} and conducted by Miklós Rózsa, who scored most of MGM's epics, although Zimbalist had previously commissioned {{and then set}} aside a score from William Walton. Rózsa researched Greek and Roman music, incorporating this work into his score for authenticity. Rózsa himself directed the 100-piece MGM Symphony Orchestra during the 12 recording sessions (which stretched over 72 hours). The soundtrack was recorded in six-channel stereo. More than three hours of music were composed for the film, and two-and-a-half hours of it were finally used, making it (...) the longest score ever composed for a motion picture. The score contains no leitmotifs for <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters.</b> <b>While</b> not a leitmotif, the score does transition from full orchestra to pipe organ whenever Jesus Christ appears.|$|R
50|$|Early on Takao Saito {{developed}} {{a system where}} he creates the page layout based on a script written by the editorial department. He also inks <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>characters</b> faces, <b>while</b> assistants provide the backgrounds and other elements. He does extensive research to provide accuracy, especially when the plot deals with technology.|$|R

5000|$|Curtis Edmonds {{is pleased}} with the {{development}} of Uhtred, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>character.</b> <b>While</b> wishing Uhtred could stop being used by so many larger forces and instead follow his own desires, Edmonds knows {{that would be the end}} of The Saxon Tales, and there are more tales to tell. [...] "It’s hard enough to write one novel, but it’s downright difficult to pen five of them consecutively with the same characters and themes and keep the writing fresh and interesting. 'Difficult' isn't even the word; 'impossible' is more like it. ... This is not to denigrate THE BURNING LAND in any way; it’s superior entertainment (if you like your entertainment blood-stained and brutal). Uhtred is a fully-realized character, capable of great bravery and great foolishness, mixed in with—as he might describe himself—the deviousness of Loki and the thunder of Thor’s hammer in battle. And Cornwell’s eye for period detail and his capacity for pulling off deft reverses are still in place, which helps to keep the narrative turning briskly along." ...|$|E
