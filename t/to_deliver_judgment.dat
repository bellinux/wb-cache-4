5|$|In 2010, the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's Office {{investigated}} Borislav Pelević, {{a former}} SDG member {{and a member}} of the Serbian National Assembly. The investigation was ultimately dropped due to lack of evidence. In 2012, former SDG member Srđan Golubović was arrested in Belgrade at the request of the Prosecutor's Office. Golubović was charged with an indictment listing the names of 78 victims. Clint Williamson, the lead prosecutor, said that other members of the SDG could not be identified because their faces had been covered with masks. As of October 2014, closing arguments had been concluded in the trial of Karadžić, the former President of Republika Srpska, for the massacre, and other crimes against humanity committed in Bijeljina, among other areas, as well as for the genocide at Srebrenica.

Needing to obtain the Tenseigan to carry out his clan's judgment, and as he was born without a Byakugan, Toneri targets Hinata as the Hyuga Clan were the only surviving members of Hamura's bloodline. But he ends up abducting Hanabi and uses her eyes to obtain the Tenseigan his clan was preparing for the world's destruction, later capturing Hinata to have as his bride. However, after being defeated by Naruto and Hinata, Toneri realizes what his ancestor's decree of observation meant and resigns himself on the moon after it returns to orbit. Many years later, Toneri sense the presence of Naruto and Hinata's son Boruto, and warned him about the dojutsu the boy used and an upcoming danger awaits them. Toneri is voiced by Jun Fukuyama in Japanese and by Robbie Daymond in English.|$|E

They could, however, enact temporary emergency laws. It was mainly through these emergency powers that the Church attempted to change Gaelic law.|$|R

50|$|There are {{concerns}} that the empathizer's own emotional background may affect or distort what emotions they perceive in others (e.g. Goleman 1996: p. 104). It is evidenced that societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy. Empathy is not {{a process that is}} likely <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> certain <b>judgments</b> about the emotional states of others. It is a skill that is gradually developed throughout life, and which improves the more contact we have with the person with whom one empathizes. Empathizers report finding it easier to take the perspective of another person when they have experienced a similar situation, as well as experience greater empathic understanding. Research regarding whether similar past experience makes the empathizer more accurate is mixed.|$|R

The moral effect of this division among the magistrates was unquestionably to cast a slur on the reputation of Widow Fontaine. She was not pronounced to be guilty--but she was also not declared to be innocent. Feeling, no doubt, that her position among her neighbors had now become unendurable, she and her daughter had left Wurzburg. The newspaper narrative added that their departure had been privately accomplished. No information could be obtained of the place of their retreat.|$|R

5000|$|The Wardens are the White Council's enforcers.

50|$|Section 44(ii) nearly {{came into}} {{operation}} in June 2017, when three federal ministers were threatened with prosecution in Victoria for contempt of court.

For each minister, a conviction could have engaged section 44(ii), resulting in their removal from the federal parliament; at that time the government did not have a majority in the Senate and had only a one-seat majority in the House of Representatives, of which all three ministers were members.|$|E

500|$|In Thio's view, {{courts should}} adopt a three-step {{proportionality}} approach when interpreting constitutional fundamental liberties.

50|$|The court {{headed by}} Justice {{set aside the}} order of the tribunal, which had {{endorsed}} the Government notification, and lifted the ban on the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. The court did this on purely technical grounds, observing that the tribunal had erred in accepting the government's plea that sensitive intelligence inputs are 'classified' and cannot be disclosed in court. Justice Verma stated that the Tribunal could not have made the necessary subjective judgment in that case as {{it may or may not}} be knowing all the facts. The learned court said that the Tribunal needed to decide whether the material in support of the ban outweighed the material against it on the basis of 'greater probabilities,' a term coined by Justice Verma and never actually explained. In this process, the requirement of natural justice had to be satisfied taking into account the public interest. This would require the tribunal to have access to all the necessary information from both sides to carry out judicial scrutiny. Since this did not happen, {{the order of the}} tribunal was set aside on technical grounds. In this way, Justice Verma managed <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a <b>judgment</b> in favor of religious minorities and in opposition to the government, even though the facts were in favour of the government, by taking recourse to technical grounds and without making any subjective assessment of the charge of sedition, which may have required him <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> exactly the converse judgment.|$|R
40|$|Resumo: Amós denuncia a opressão e a violência contra os inocentes que foram empobrecidos devido à ganância dos ricos e poderosos de Israel. Os sacerdotes, os juízes e o rei, que eram os representantes de Deus entre o povo, que deveriam proteger os mais fracos, atendendo-os em suas necessidades, eram os cúmplices daqueles que praticavam os atos opressivos e roubavam tudo o que os mais fracos possuíam {{inclusive}} suas vestes. Em seguida iam aos lugares de culto, deitando-se sobre as vestes confiscadas e bebiam o vinho proveniente de multas aplicadas. A voz profética de Amós acusa a alta sociedade de Israel de ferir o povo de Deus e, consequentemente, ferir ao próprio Deus. A falta de solidariedade de Israel demonstra a ingratidão de um povo que foi abençoado e liberto do cativeiro, mas se esqueceu. Ao invés de praticar a justiça para ser abençoado, pratica a injustiça, despertando a ira de Deus que move Amós a proferir seu juízo contra todos os inimigos da justiça. Palavras-chave: Amós. Justiça. Opressão. Pobres. Inocentes. Solidariedade. Abstract: Amos denounces {{the oppression}} and {{violence against the}} innocent people who were impoverished due to the greed {{of the rich and}} powerful of Israel. The priests, the judges and the king, who were the representatives of God among the people and who were supposed to protect the weak, serving them in their needs, were the accomplices of those who practiced the oppressive acts and would stole everything the weak had, even their clothes. Then they would go to the places of worship, lie down on the confiscated vests and drink the wine obtained from the fines levied. The prophetic voice of Amos accuses Israel's high society of hurting the people of God and consequently of injuring God himself. The lack of solidarity of Israel shows the ingratitude of a people that had been blessed and set free from bondage, but had forgotten that. Instead of practicing justice to be blessed, they practice lawlessness, arousing the wrath of God who moves Amos <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> <b>judgment</b> against all the enemies of justice.
