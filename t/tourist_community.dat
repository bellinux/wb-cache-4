40|$|Building {{numerous}} and active virtual <b>tourist</b> <b>communities</b> {{involved in the}} tourist brand, connected with product, attraction or travel destination is a significant challenge for a dynamic and competitive tourist market. The main aim of presented pilot study was the drawing up guidelines for development of users engagement of selected virtual <b>tourist</b> <b>communities</b> on the example of Facebook. For that purpose a ranking {{of the most popular}} indicators of thematic areas, around which virtual <b>tourist</b> <b>communities</b> are formed was built. Simultaneously a typology of members of virtual <b>tourist</b> <b>communities</b> was presented as well as motives for the participation in communities gathered around the definite subject matter were analysed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a cross section {{analysis}} of local compensation payments to farmers for their provision of landscape amenities in alpine <b>tourist</b> <b>communities.</b> These payments {{can be interpreted as}} the outcomes of Coasian negotiations. Based on Austrian data we empirically identify the underlying determinants of the negotiating process. The probability for a positive negotiation outcome depends on politico-economic factors such as municipal revenues per resident and the share of votes for distinct parties in parliamentary elections. Whereas benefits associated with landscape amenities also play an important role transaction costs of bargaining are of minor relevance. If the variety of the countryside seems to be endangered <b>tourist</b> <b>communities</b> start compensating their farmers for landscape-enhancing activities. Local subsidy schemes supplement European Union and national policies in support of rural areas as they internalize positive agricultural externalities.

40|$|Largely {{ignored by}} research, online travel {{communities}} have already changed the travel {{behavior of the}} younger generation. They retrieve and exchange information prior to travelling and share their experiences afterwards. This paper presents some empirical evidence {{that the quality of}} the information retrieved justifies their behavior. The evidence is embedded in a larger framework and a set of hypotheses that establish a relationship between the choice of a travel information system and attributes of information quality. The paper argues that relevant attributes of information quality are timeliness, completeness, structure and personalization. Three studies support our proposition that a traditional discussion-based online tourism community provides more timely, more complete and more personalized information than a commercial guidebook. A major deficiency is particularly their lack of structure, but also the other attributes of information quality can be improved by more advanced online tourism communities. A second section thus proposes that a) Wiki communities improve timeliness, completeness and structure of online communities b) personal spaces improve the structure and the personalization of traditional online <b>tourist</b> <b>communities</b> and c) Mobile communities provide higher quality information than traditional online <b>tourist</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Tourist</b> {{destination}} <b>communities</b> {{are often}} assumed as being {{represented by a}} loose and random combination of elites of individuals. So far, no research on {{the hierarchy of the}} informal organization of destination elites has been carried out. This paper challenges the common assumption that elites of community structured destinations are an unstructured group of individuals. The research analyzes six reputational elite networks in <b>tourist</b> destination <b>communities</b> in Europe. The application of the four graph theoretical dimensions (GTD), developed by Krackhardt (1994) indicates that there are strong hierarchical patterns. As a consequence, the identification of hierarchies, chiefs and lines of command increases effective destination management and development...|$|R

40|$|Information and {{communications}} technology (ICT) has taken centre stage {{in recent decades}} {{in the world of}} tourism.
