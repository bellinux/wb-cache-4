5|$|Newton's theorem of {{revolving}} orbits was {{his first}} attempt to understand apsidal precession quantitatively. According to this theorem, {{the addition of a}} particular type of central force—the inverse-cube force—can produce a rotating orbit; the angular speed is multiplied by a factor k, whereas the radial motion is left unchanged. However, this theorem is restricted to a specific type of force that may not be relevant; several perturbing inverse-square interactions (such as those of other planets) seem unlikely to sum exactly to an inverse-cube force. To make his theorem applicable to other types of forces, Newton found the best approximation of an arbitrary central force F(r) to an inverse-cube potential in the limit of nearly circular orbits, that is, elliptical orbits of low eccentricity, as is indeed true for most orbits in the Solar System. To find this approximation, Newton developed an infinite series that can be viewed as the forerunner of the <b>Taylor</b> <b>expansion.</b> This approximation allowed Newton to estimate the rate of precession for arbitrary central forces. Newton applied this approximation to test models of the force causing the apsidal precession of the Moon's orbit. However, the problem of the Moon's motion is dauntingly complex, and Newton never published an accurate gravitational model of the Moon's apsidal precession. After a more accurate model by Clairaut in 1747, analytical models of the Moon's motion were developed in the late 19th century by Hill, Brown, and Delaunay.|$|E

40|$|The {{solutions}} of parabolic and hyperbolic stochastic partial {{differential equations}} (SPDEs) {{driven by an}} infinite dimensional Brownian motion, which is a martingale, are in general not semi-martingales any more and therefore do not satisfy an Itô formula like the solutions of finite dimensional stochastic differential equations (SODEs). In particular, {{it is not possible}} to derive stochastic <b>Taylor</b> <b>expansions</b> as for the solutions of SODEs using an iterated application of the Itô formula. However, in this article we introduce <b>Taylor</b> <b>expansions</b> of solutions of SPDEs via an alternative approach, which avoids the need of an Itô formula. The main idea behind these <b>Taylor</b> <b>expansions</b> is to use first classical <b>Taylor</b> <b>expansions</b> for the nonlinear coefficients of the SPDE and then to insert recursively the mild presentation of the solution of the SPDE.
