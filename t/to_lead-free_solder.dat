In particular, {{in the so-called}} surface mount technology (SMT) used to connect semiconductor components mechanically and electrically to circuit boards, the resins have to withstand peak temperatures of 260 °C and more during the soldering process. This triggered {{the rapid growth of}} polymer resins based on polyamides with melting points above 300 °C, in particular PPAs and Nylon 46. The application requires the resin to pass GWIT and UL94 ratings mentioned above.

50|$|A {{solder paste}} is {{essentially}} powder metal solder suspended {{in a thick}} medium called flux. Flux is added {{to act as a}} temporary adhesive, holding the components until the soldering process melts the solder and makes a stronger physical connection. The paste is a gray, putty-like material. The composition of the solder paste varies, depending upon its intended use. For example, when soldering plastic component packages to a FR-4 glass epoxy circuit board, the solder compositions used are eutectic Sn-Pb (63 percent tin, 37 percent lead) or SAC alloys (tin/silver/copper, named for the elemental symbols Sn/Ag/Cu). If one needs high tensile and shear strength, tin-antimony (Sn/Sb) alloys might be used with such a board. Generally, solder pastes are made of a tin-lead alloy, with possibly a third metal alloyed, although environmental protection legislation is forcing a move <b>to</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder.</b>|$|E

The use in particular of noble metals and of hazardous metals in electronics together with the low collection and recovery rates drives the risk of environmental and health impacts. In parallel to the ban of lead in EEE, lead applications with a clear risk and much lower avoidance cost persist, like for instance the use of lead in lead shots for hunting. Future material restrictions and bans should take into consideration the efficiency of risk reductions sanctioning the applications with the highest risks at lowest avoidance cost first.

Solder joints provide electrical conduction and mechanical support for components and may operate over temperature extremes of - 55 oC to 125 oC or greater. These temperatures are relatively high the melting point of the solder. A mismatch between coefficients of thermal expansion of the component, solder and substrate, combined with thermal variations during service, results in thermal fatigue that is a common failure mechanism for solder joints in electronic products.

As of July 1 st of 2006, lead {{will not be allowed}} in solder pastes. This has called for evaluations of alternatives to tin-lead solders, and especially the environmental consequences of the shift from tin-lead solder paste (TL) <b>to</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> paste (LF). In 2003 a life cycle assessment (LCA) was initiated, having two aims: (i) to compare an TL (62 % tin, 36 % lead, 2 % silver) to an LF (95. 5 % tin, 3. 8 % silver, 0. 7 % copper); both pastes assumed to include 10 % flux, and (ii) to compare attributional and consequential LCA methodologies. The attributional LCA describes the environmental burdens of the solder life cycle. It describes, for example, the obvious fact that the shift from TL to LF means that lead is essentially eliminated from the solder life cycle. Our attributional LCA is largely based on literature data. Lacking environmental data for flux production, we used the economic input-output model from Carnegie Mellon to obtain approximate values. Preliminary results from the attributional LCA, indicate that LF contributes 10 % more to the global warming potential (GWP) than TL. 60 % of the difference, can be related to an increased reflow energy consumption, and 40 % to an increased tin production. The production of flux contributed to about 5 % of the total GWP results for both solders. We have recently started the consequential LCA. It aims at describing how the environmental burdens of the technosphere are affected by a shift from TL to LF. It will describe, for example, to what extent the shift means that the total use of lead is reduced, and to what extent it means that the use of lead will increase in other life cycles. We do not expect the consequential LCA to include all inputs to the solder, because, for each input in the analysis, we need to investigate the supply curve as well as the demand curve, identifying price elasticities, marginal production, and marginal consumption...|$|E

Solder is used to mount electronic parts, such as resistors and capacitors, on printed-circuit boards in almost all electronic devices. However, since {{in many cases the}} thermal expansion coefficients of electronic parts and PCBs are different, cyclic thermal stress and strain causes solder fatigue and device failure. Especially in the power electronic module and car electric module, the evaluation of thermal fatigue life is important.

The dispersion of design factors such as shape, size and material properties of solder joints is thought as one of these reasons. Moreover, in the case of chip components, it is thought that the interacting effect by the structural asymmetry due to the unbalance solder joints would influence reliability. At the same time, the changeover from eutectic Sn-Pb solder <b>to</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> has been driven by environmental concerns. Therefore, it cannot be disregard as the main factor of the reliability evaluation in the solder joints.

For instance, the performance of ACF assembly in high temperature applications is questionable. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the effect of bonding temperatures on the curing of ACFs, and their mechanical and electrical performance after high temperature ageing. Design/methodology/approach – In the work presented in this paper, the curing degree of an ACF at different bonding temperatures was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter. The adhesion strength and the contact resistance of ACF bonded chip-on-flex assembly were measured before and after thermal ageing and the results were correlated with the curing degree of ACF. The ACF was an epoxy-based adhesive in which Au-Ni coated polymer particles were randomly dispersed. Findings – The results showed that higher bonding temperatures had resulted in better ACF curing and stronger adhesion. After ageing, the adhesion strength increased for the samples bonded at lower temperatures and decreased for the samples bonded at higher temperatures. ACF assemblies with higher degrees of curing showed smaller increases in contact resistance after ageing. Conduction gaps at the bump-particle and/or particle-pad interfaces were found with the help of scanning electron microscopy and are thought to be the root cause of the increase in contact resistance. Originality/value – The present study focuses on the effect of bonding temperatures on the curing of ACFs, and their adhesion strength and electrical performances after high temperature ageing.

In particular, accidental dropping is believed to cause substantial damage to the solder joints. The increasing occurrence of drop failure of portable electronics has been traced to the failure of the solder joints that interconnect the integrated circuit (IC) components with the printed circuit board (PCB). The increasing market pressure to replace lead based solder in electronic products has resulted in research being carried out in many areas related <b>to</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder.</b> Thus, the reliability of lead-free solder joints under mechanical shock loading is a major concern. The main objective of this thesis is to study the failure mechanism and life prediction for lead-free ball grid array (BGA) solder joint subject to repetitive mechanical drop loading. The emphasis will be placed on the strain hardening effect of lead-free solder joint under repetitive mechanical drop loading. The mechanical properties of SAC lead-free solder alloy were first studied by the tensile test. The results showed that the SAC lead-free solder was strongly strain rate dependent. The constitutive model of SAC lead-free solder was built. Nanoindentation tests were employed to obtain the mechanical properties of lead-free solder and IMC. The nanoindentation hardness value for SAC lead-free solder and IMC was found to decrease with increasing aging time. The IMC layers grew in thickness during thermal aging tests, while there were no significant changes in the Young’s modulus of IMC. High speed ball pull tests were used to find the brittle fracture strength of IMC. The simulation of the high speed ball pull tests were studied and correlated with the high speed ball pull tests. Then the IMC brittle failure criterion was established. The strain hardening effects of SAC lead-free solder were found by solder wire drop test and board level drop test (BLDT). The structure stiffening effects were also found by the strain measurement during the BLDT experiment. The failure analysis after the PCBA BLDT experiment showed that all the failure modes were brittle failures. A 3 D finite element model of the PCBA was built and studied under repetitive drop loading. The dominant strain rates of the SAC lead-free solder joints were found by correlating the material properties with tensile tests. After gradually correlating the drop loading condition, PCB strain, failure location and mode, and the IMC strain rates, the drop to failure number under repetitive drop loading was found. The predicted life from the simulation model matched well with the BLDT experiments. Finally this simulation model was validated on the industrial PBGA BLDT...|$|E

However, at the core of <b>lead-free</b> assembly is <b>soldering.</b> The critical aspects of the <b>lead-free</b> wave <b>soldering</b> process can be broken into several categories: component reliability, board reliability, flux type and specifications, alloy composition and melting behavior, wave soldering equipment capacity and power requirements, profile attributes, and flexibility. The 2007 iNEMI Roadmap identified gaps in industry information and research relating <b>to</b> <b>lead-free</b> wave <b>soldering</b> processes and reliability. There have been a limited number of comprehensive investigations into <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering,</b> and there are several issues which still must be addressed. The iNEMI Pb-Free Wave Soldering Project was organized to address some of the key knowledge gaps...|$|R
40|$|The {{enforcement}} of environmental legislation is pushing electronic products <b>to</b> take <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloys as the substitute of traditional lead-tin solder alloys. Applications of such alloys require {{a better understanding}} of their mechanical behaviors. The mechanical properties of the <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> and IMC layers are affected by the thermal aging. The <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints on the pads subject to thermal aging test lead to IMC growth and cause corresponding reliability concerns. In this paper, the mechanical properties of the <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> and IMCs were characterized by nanoindentation. Both the Sn-rich phase and Ag 3 Sn + β-Sn phase in the <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint exhibit strain rate depended and aging soften effect. When <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints were subject to thermal aging, Young's modulus of the (Cu, Ni) 6 Sn 5 IMC and Cu 6 Sn 5 IMC changed in very small range. While the hardness value decreased with the increasing of the thermal aging time. Copyright© (2010) by IMAPS - International Microelectronics & Packaging Society...|$|R
40|$|Solder joints provide {{mechanical}} and electrical interconnections between electronic devices and packaging substrates in electronics applications. The different {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) between substrate, silicon device and solder imposes strains on the solder joint. Creep constitutes the primary deformation mechanism, limiting the {{low cycle fatigue}} life of solder joint. The trend toward miniaturization, higher service temperatures, and higher current densities and the transition <b>to</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders,</b> which possess higher melting points than leaded solders, aggravate the situation. Therefore, the knowledge of properties and performances is needed to be able to predict the lifetime of solders in order to assure successfully applications in electronic assemblies. This study focuses on the change of microstructure due aging in bulk and ball joints, and a preliminary analysis of the primary creep behavior of Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu. Differences in microstructure evolution between bulk and small joints are highlighted. Chilean Navy author...|$|R
50|$|A {{majority}} of the defects in circuit-board assembly are caused due to issues in the solder-paste printing process or due to defects in the solder paste. There are {{many different types of}} defects possible, i.e. too much solder, or the solder melts and connects too many wires (bridging), resulting in a short circuit. Insufficient amounts of paste result in incomplete circuits. head-on-pillow defects, or incomplete coalescence of ball grid array (BGA) sphere and solder paste deposit, is a failure mode that has seen increased frequency since the transition <b>to</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering.</b> Often missed during inspection, a head-on-pillow (HOP) defect appears like a head resting on a pillow with a visible separation in the solder joint at the interface of the BGA sphere and reflowed paste deposit. An electronics manufacturer needs experience with the printing process, specifically the paste characteristics, to avoid costly re-work on the assemblies. The paste's physical characteristics, like viscosity and flux levels, need to be monitored periodically by performing in-house tests.|$|R
40|$|Most {{machines}} {{pass the}} test, but some key changes are ahead. In the transition <b>to</b> <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering,</b> {{an area of}} concern in assembly operations is what equipment changes, if any, will be needed for lead-free electronics assembly processes. SnAgCu (or SAC), the most common <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy, has a higher melting point than SnPb solder, which increases the thermal demands on certain processing equipment. There are also concerns about mixing SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations and whether dedicated equipment is necessary to avoid contamination. Screen printers. Equipment currently used for paste printing {{can also be used}} for Pb-free printing. Older Pb-free solder paste formulations often required the use of slower printer speeds with higher print pressures because of the non-optimized flow characteristics of the pastes. However, improvements in Pb-free solders have optimized the metal content and paste viscosity, so printer settings for Pb-free pastes are now very similar to those for SnPb. Stencil cleaning may need to be monitored, at least initially, and there should be dedicated and clearly labeled squeegee blades, stencils, support pins and blocks to avoid any contamination with SnPb paste. Placement. The concern with placement machines has been whether Pb-free components (Sn-based passives, QFP, BGA, etc.) may require different component recognition and lightin...|$|R
