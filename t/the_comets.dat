5|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion was}} that <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> were all fragments {{of an earlier}} Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the Great Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably fragments of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded {{on the basis of}} this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E

5|$|After Edmund Halley {{demonstrated}} that <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> of 1531, 1607, and 1682 {{were the same}} body and successfully predicted its return in 1759 by calculating its orbit, that comet became known as Halley's Comet. Similarly, {{the second and third}} known periodic comets, Encke's Comet and Biela's Comet, were named after the astronomers who calculated their orbits rather than their original discoverers. Later, periodic comets were usually named after their discoverers, but comets that had appeared only once continued to be referred to by the year of their appearance.|$|E

For the 1905–06 season, the Quebec Hockey Club joined the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA). Over the next four years, Moran appeared in 38games, but won only 11 of them, while his lowest goals-against average in a season during that span was 6.79. In the 1909–10 season, Moran joined the Montreal All-Stars from the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) and as the league folded, he then joined the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA). In his only season with <b>the</b> <b>Comets,</b> Moran posted a 3–8 record over 11games, letting in 79goals.|$|E

5|$|Utica {{is home to}} the Utica Comets, a team {{affiliated}} with the National Hockey League's Vancouver Canucks. Formerly the Peoria Rivermen, the team moved to Utica and began playing in the American Hockey League during the 2013–14 season.

The Utica Devils played in the AHL from 1987 to 1993, and the Utica Bulldogs (1993–94), Utica Blizzard (1994–97), and Mohawk Valley Prowlers (1998–2001) were members of the United Hockey League (UHL).|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1705, Edmond Halley (1656–1742) applied Newton's {{method to}} twenty-three cometary apparitions that had {{occurred}} between 1337 and 1698. He noted that three of these, <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> of 1531, 1607, and 1682, had very similar orbital elements, and he was further able {{to account for the}} slight differences in their orbits in terms of gravitational perturbation caused by Jupiter and Saturn. Confident that these three apparitions had been three appearances of the same comet, he predicted that it would appear again in 1758–9. Halley's predicted return date was later refined by a team of three French mathematicians: Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute, who predicted the date of the comet's 1759 perihelion to within one month's accuracy. When the comet returned as predicted, it became known as Halley's Comet (with the latter-day designation of 1P/Halley). It will next appear in 2061.|$|E
5000|$|... 22P/Kopff was {{discovered}} at Königstuhl Observatory on Heidelberg, Germany. Kopff analyzed photographic plates which he exposed on August 20, 1903, against pre-discovery {{images of the}} same region. On August 23, 1903, Kopff concluded {{it to be a}} comet with an estimated apparent magnitude of 11. On mid-September 1906, the short-period nature of <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> was recognized by a team headed by Kiel Ebell of the Berkeley Astronomical Department. <b>The</b> <b>comet</b> was missed when it made a return on November 25, 1912, however on June 25, 1919, astronomers recovered <b>the</b> <b>comet.</b> <b>The</b> <b>comet</b> was located less than three days from the predicted position. Over the next several returns to Earth, none were notable until <b>the</b> 1945 <b>comet’s</b> return when <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> peaked at magnitude 8.5. The increase in brightness was a result of Jupiter altering <b>the</b> <b>comet’s</b> orbit between <b>the</b> years of 1939 to 1945. This change in orbit brought <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> closer to <b>the</b> Sun. The 1951 return was unique due to <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> being 3 magnitudes fainter than what was expected when recovered in April 1951. But <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> still reached magnitude 10.5 in October 1951. A very close pass to Jupiter in 1954 increased <b>the</b> <b>comet’s</b> perihelion distance to 1.52 AU and increased the orbital period to 6.31 years. On November 30, 1994, Carl W. Hergenrother was able to recover <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> at a stellar magnitude of 22.8 using the 1.5-m reflector at the Catalina Sky Survey. <b>The</b> <b>comet</b> reached magnitude 7 during the 1996 perihelion passage.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>comet's</b> 5.5 {{year period}} {{would mean that}} apparitions would {{alternate}} between good and poor. As expected, <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> was missed in its 1851 apparition, when <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> only came as close as 1.5 AU to Earth.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>comet</b> was {{missed in}} 1862, {{and the next}} {{recovery}} was in 1868. A close approach to Jupiter shortened the period enough to make <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> visible in 1873. A very favorable apparition followed in 1879, allowing <b>the</b> <b>comet</b> to be observed {{for the longest time}} to date - four months. <b>The</b> <b>comet</b> was missed in 1884, due to observing circumstances, but was also missed in 1890, a favorable apparition. The next favorable apparition occurred in 1901, but searches did not locate <b>the</b> <b>comet.</b>|$|R
5|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> C/1843 D1, C/1880 C1, C/1882 R1, C/1887 B1, C/1963 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1970 K1 are {{all members of}} a family known as the Kreutz Sungrazers, which are all descended from one comet. Current models {{do not support the}} frequent supposition in the prior literature that the famous comet of 372 BC is in fact the ultimate parent of the Sungrazers. The comet of 372 BC is often associated with Aristotle who, along with others from his time, described that comet in his writings. However, Aristotle was only twelve {{at the time of the}} comet's appearance and the historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, who also wrote about it was born ten years after its appearance. Consequently, their reports should not be taken as eye-witness accounts. Further, there is no mention of the comet in Chinese literature of the time. Instead either the comet of February 423 or of February 467 with orbital periods of around 700 years is now considered the likely progenitor of the Sungrazers. The fragments of the Great Comet of 1882 will return in several hundred years' time, spread out over perhaps two or three centuries.|$|E
5|$|Late in the season, reports {{began to}} surface that the Canucks would be {{purchasing}} their own AHL team and relocating it. Vancouver {{wanted to have}} more control over personnel decisions for their farm team and bought the Peoria Rivermen. The Canucks had originally hoped to move the franchise to nearby Abbotsford, British Columbia, which was home of the Calgary Flames AHL affiliate the Abbotsford Heat. Calgary indicated {{they would be willing}} to move their franchise, but a deal between the Canucks and the city of Abbotsford was unable to be reached. With the Abbotsford deal not working out, the Canucks set out to find a new home for their affiliate. They considered moving the team to Vancouver and sharing Rogers Arena, but the city was within the 50-mile territorial radius provided by the AHL. They next considered moving the team to Seattle, Washington, but were not allowed by the NHL. Seattle was a candidate to land the Phoenix Coyotes if a lease agreement could not be reached with the city of Glendale. Eventually, the Canucks decided to relocate their franchise to Utica, New York, creating <b>the</b> <b>Comets.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>comets</b> seen {{close to}} the Sun seem to have reached their current {{positions}} through gravitational perturbation of the Oort cloud by the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way. Just as the Moon's tidal force deforms Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, the galactic tide also distorts the orbits of bodies in the outer Solar System. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to {{the gravity of the}} Sun, but in the outer reaches of the system, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field has substantial effects. Galactic tidal forces stretch the cloud along an axis directed toward the galactic centre and compress it along the other two axes; these small perturbations can shift orbits in the Oort cloud to bring objects {{close to the}} Sun. The point at which the Sun's gravity concedes its influence to the galactic tide is called the tidal truncation radius. It lies at a radius of 100,000 to 200,000 AU, and marks the outer boundary of the Oort cloud.|$|E

Members of <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> were commissioned to work as session musicians on many of these recordings, many of which were written or co-written by Haley and members of <b>the</b> <b>Comets.</b> The Clymax experiment only lasted about a year. In 1959, Haley's relationship with Decca collapsed; after a final set of instrumental-only recordings in the fall, Haley announced he was leaving Decca for the new Warner Bros. Records label, which released two more albums in 1960, which were moderately successful. In 1960 Franny Beecher and Rudi Pompilli left <b>the</b> <b>Comets</b> to start their own record label.
