40|$|The peptide {{transmitter}} neurotensin (NT) exerts diverse neurochemical {{effects that}} resemble those seen after acute administration of antipsychotic drugs (APDs). These drugs also induce NT {{expression in the}} striatum; this and other convergent findings {{have led to the}} suggestion that NT may mediate some APD effects. Here, we demonstrate that the ability of the typical APD haloperidol to induce Fos expression in the dorsolateral striatum is markedly attenuated in NT-null mutant mice. The induction of Fos and NT in the dorsolateral striatum in response to typical, but not atypical, APDs has led to the hypothesis that the increased expression of these proteins is mechanistically related to the production of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). However, we found that catalepsy, which is thought to reflect the EPS of typical APDs, is unaffected in NT-null mutant mice, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> not contribute to the generation of EPS. We conclude that NT is required for haloperidol-elicited activation of a specific population of striatal neurons but not haloperidol-induced catalepsy. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that endogenous NT mediates a specific subset of APD actions...|$|R

This permits the insertion of larger fragments and the retrieval of larger 2 inserts, as well as the use of a simplified PCR-based cloning protocol which utilizes annealing rather than ligation to create recombinants in pMAD 3 [Nisson et al., PCR Methods and Applications 1 (1991) 120 - 123]...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} differences between neural plasticity in auditory cortex (AC) {{of animals that}} developed subjective tinnitus (group T) after {{noise induced hearing loss}} (NIHL) compared to those <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not (group <b>NT).</b> To this end, our analysis focuses on the input activity of cortical neurons based on the temporal and spectral analysis of local field potential recordings (LFP) and an in-depth analysis of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) in the same animals. In response to NIHL in NT animals we find a significant general reduction in overall cortical activity and spectral power as well as changes in all ABR wave amplitudes as a function of loudness. In contrast, T animals show no significant change in overall cortical activity as assessed by root mean square analysis of LFP amplitudes, but a specific increase in LFP spectral power and in the amplitude of ABR wave V reflecting activity in the inferior colliculus (IC). Based on these results we put forward a refined model of tinnitus prevention after NIHL that acts via a top-down global (i. e. frequency-unspecific) inhibition reducing overall neuronal activity in AC and IC, thereby counteracting NIHL induced bottom-up frequency-specific neuroplasticity suggested in current models of tinnitus development...|$|R
40|$|Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are {{characterized}} by an unsatisfactory inflammatory and migratory response. Skin inflammation involves the participation of many cells and particularly macrophages. Macrophage function can be modulated by neuropeptides; however, little is known regarding the role of neurotensin (NT) as a modulator of macrophages under inflammatory and hyperglycemic conditions. RAW 264. 7 cells were maintained at 10 / 30 [*]mM glucose, stimulated with/without LPS (1 [*]μg/mL), and treated with/without NT(10 [*]nM). The results show <b>that</b> <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not affect macrophage viability. However, NT reverted the hyperglycemia-induced impair in the migration of macrophages. The expression of IL- 6 and IL- 1 β was significantly increased under 10 [*]mM glucose {{in the presence of}} NT, while IL- 1 β and IL- 12 expression significantly decreased under inflammatory and hyperglycemic conditions. More importantly, high glucose modulates NT and NT receptor expression under normal and inflammatory conditions. These results highlight the effect of NT on cell migration, which is strongly impaired under hyperglycemic conditions, as well as its effect in decreasing the proinflammatory status of macrophages under hyperglycemic and inflammatory conditions. These findings provide new insights into the potential therapeutic role of NT in chronic wounds, such as in DFU, characterized by a deficit in the migratory properties of cells and a chronic proinflammatory status...|$|R

Therefore, soil organic carbon research is gaining momentum in the Mediterranean basin. Our objective is to quantify effects of no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon stock (SOCs) in three soil types (Vertisol, Cambisol, and Luvisol) within Central Morocco. Chemical analyses {{were used to determine}} how tillage affected various humic substances. Our results showed that, after 5 years, surface horizon (0 – 30 [*]cm) SOC stocks varied between tillage systems and with soil type. The SOCs was significantly higher in NT compared to CT (10 % more in Vertisol and 8 % more in Cambisol), but no significant difference was observed in the Luvisol. Average SOCs within the 0 – 30 [*]cm depth was 29. 35 and 27. 36 [*]Mg ha− 1 under NT and CT, respectively. The highest SOCs (31. 89 [*]Mg ha− 1) was found in Vertisols under NT.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the preliminary {{results of an}} international research project undertaken in Brazil, India, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand and Venezuela on whether {{and to what extent}} flexible automation and associated organizational techniques have diffused to developing countries, and what their impact has been on product, plant and firm scale and scope. It shows that while diffusion has been rapid in the countries under study, particularly in the case of computer-numerically-controlled (CNC) machine tools, it was far slower than in developed countries. Diffusion of new organizational techniques was also slow. The paper analyses the data on product scale, and concludes <b>that</b> <b>NT</b> <b>do</b> not necessarily lead to reductions in product scale, product variety or scope. On the contrary, the data show significant increases in variety and availability of sizes of the products on offer, not because of new products, but due to vertical integration in the production of components. The paper concludes that the output or capacity of most firms surveyed increased {{as a result of the}} adoption of NT, due to reduction in waiting times, better factory and labor organization, increased efficiency of CNC machine tools and higher capital and marketing 'fixed' costs. Such findings imply that scale will continue to be an impediment to entry into industrial production by small developing country firms.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{determined}} {{whether the}} neurotensin gene (NT/N) {{is expressed in}} the normal adult liver and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) and confirmed NT/N expression in fibrolamellar carcinoma; whether NT/N or the neurotensin receptor is expressed in the fetal liver; and whether hepatic resection leads to expression of NT/N. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Neurotensin (NT), a gut tridecapeptide localized in the gastrointestinal tract of the adult to the small bowel, is an important hormone-regulating gut motility, secretion, and mucosal growth. Expression of the NT/N gene has been identified in fibrolamellar carcinomas, but NT/N is not known to be expressed in the normal liver. METHODS: Sensitive ribonuclease (RNase) protection assays {{were used to determine}} whether NT/N is expressed in fibrolamellar carcinoma, FNH, or healthy fetal and adult livers. The authors also determined whether the receptor for NT was present in the fetal liver and whether liver resection and subsequent regeneration could lead to re-expression of NT/N in the rat. RESULTS: Neurotensin is expressed in fibrolamellar carcinoma and in the fetal human liver, but not in the adult liver or the samples of FNH. In addition, the authors were not able to detect expression of the NT receptor in the fetal liver and did not identify NT/N gene activation in the regenerating liver of the rat. CONCLUSIONS: The NT/N gene will be a useful molecular marker to differentiate fibrolamellar carcinoma from other liver tumors. The finding of NT/N expression in the fetal liver suggests a stem cell descendant that is common to both the liver and gut. The absence of NT/N expression in the regenerating liver suggests <b>that</b> <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> not play a role in this rapid growth process...|$|R

Using consumer rejection threshold (CRT) method, this study aimed to assess whether systematic changes in the taste intensities of familiar foods would lead to earlier rejection of these products by PROP tasters than by PROP non-tasters. Subjects rated the intensity of PROP solution and were divided into tasters (Ts) and non-tasters (NTs). And Ts were further divided into medium-tasters (MTs) and super-tasters (STs). Difference thresholds and CRTs were then evaluated for caffeine in coffee, citric acid in orange juice, and for NaCl in beef soup. For each food, Ts were more sensitive to variations in tastants than NTs. Ts also rejected more bitter coffee, more sour orange juice, and less salty beef soup more readily than <b>did</b> <b>NTs.</b> Comparisons among NTs, MTs, and STs gave fewer clear differences...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{chromosomal}} test by genetic amniocentesis in 58 cases with an increased nuchal translucency (NT; ≥ 3 mm thickness) revealed 47 cases showing a normal karyotype (81 %) and 11 cases (19 %) showing an abnormal karyotype. However, the cases of a normal karyotype with increased NT also included those with fetal abnormalities. Among the 49 cases in which NT was observed during the 1 st trimester and then subsequently disappeared, chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 5 cases, and fetal abnormalities other than chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 2 cases. Meanwhile, all 9 cases in which an increased NT remained or in which NT continued to increase in size during the 2 nd trimester were diagnosed to have cystic hygroma, and chromosomal abnormalities were found in 6 cases (67 %). It {{should be noted that}} the shape of increased NT includes NT with a notch (Notched NT) and NT without a notch (Smoothed NT). Among the 20 cases of Notched NT, chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 8 cases (40 %), and cystic hygroma was observed in 9 cases (45 %). On the other hand, among the 38 cases of Smoothed NT, chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 3 cases (7. 9 %), but no cystic hygroma was observed. Our results clarified <b>that</b> increased <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> not always indicate a fetal abnormality. Whether the thickness of NT should be measured as screening of fetal abnormalities remains controversial. However, an increased NT may be detected by chance, because a maternal-fetal medical examination using ultrasonography is usually performed in Japan. It is therefore considered to be extremely important to establish a system in which cases are referred to obstetricians who are licensed clinical genetic specialists in order to obtain appropriate genetic counseling whenever an increased NT is clinically observed...|$|R

When CSF II is used to stimulate human marrow cells fractionated by sedimentation velocity, two populations of CFU-C are separated, one sedimenting at 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 7, and a second sedimenting at 6. 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 13.

40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} the process of {{automatically}} expanding image searches based on tags and the definitions of terms from public knowledge bases. To this end, {{we will try to}} extract terms related to a query. The process of finding these terms is known as feature extraction. The text collection on which we perform this feature extraction is, in this thesis, based on text retrieved from public knowledge bases using the original query. The program will in other words, first retrieve related documents. It will then pick out related terms using either Chi-Squared, or an approach I've coined "Neighbouring Terms", or NT. The latter is an approach that is much quicker to process, and may prove to give good precision to term extraction, despite not having to perform such a demanding process beforehand. This thesis will also look into different variables in these kind of processes to find the best approach to both Chi-Squared and NT. Because this automatic term extraction is set to work on a limited size of articles, there is a question of how many articles would be needed to get the best results. There are also several similarity models to consider when building something like this. For that reason, this thesis also {{looks into the}} different results obtained when working with models like the Vector Space model, Okapi BM 25 and the Language Model. Other variables that this thesis looks into is whether or not term pre-processing, like stop word removal and stemming, are beneficial or not. Also, what gives the best results between searching for abstracts based on their title or their contents, and with how many terms can a query be expanded without losing too much relatedness. To evaluate the terms suggested by these methods, this thesis looks into the P@n values for 20 queries, as well as using metrics such as MAP (Mean Average Precision) to evaluate the sum of the results for each approach. To avoid biased evaluation, we also perform a user survey. We present the results of a survey where 32 people have given their opinion on the different terms suggested by the system, and how related to a given query they are. The main conclusion in this thesis is <b>that</b> <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> run faster than Chi-Squared, but while results did vary, the precision values on an average fell in favour of Chi-Squared. <b>That</b> said, it <b>did</b> not perform better by much, and with future improvements it could prove a viable solution in automatically generating semantically related terms without having to perform heavy processing. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of growth cone (GC) and neurite retraction {{resulting from a}} rapid incrase in concentration of the trophic molecule NGF was studied. Neurite outgrowth from explants of 8 -d chick embryo dorsal root ganglia was achieved at very low NGF concentrations with heart conditioned medium during overnight culture. Quickly incrasing the NGF concentration in the growth medium dramatically affected GC and neurite morphology: the majority of GCs and neurites collapsed and retracted towards the cell body over a course of approximately 2 - 5 min. Retraction was elicited by increasing NGF levels from 0 to 0. 05 ng/ml to as little as 0. 5 ng/ml but did not occur if the NGF concentration during the initial overnight culture period exceeded 0. 8 ng/ml, regardless of how much the concentration was elevated. Similar concentration changes of cytochrome c or insulin <b>did</b> <b>nt</b> result in retraction. Neurites that had been separated from their cell bodies by cutting close to their exit from the explant still retracted when NGF levels were raised. Cytochalasin B reversible inhibits retraction, whereas colchicine allows retraction to occur. Observation of cell- substratum adhesion during retraction revealed that some adhesion points remain during retraction and that they correspond {{to the ends of}} NGF leels and that it may involve microfilaments in the neurite cytoskeleton. The NGF concentration changes that elicit neurite retraction suggest that a primary event in retraction may be increased occupancy of a high-affinity NGF receptor on neurites...|$|R
