5|$|Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art & Design {{served as}} the project's {{production}} manager. She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> and added a clear coating for protection. Painting <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> took about six weeks, and it was mostly finished by November 2013. Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in British Columbia, with Buntzen Lake {{being used as}} Lake Okobogee. Several crew members became lost in the {{surrounding}} area after the van responsible for installing signage got lost itself. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> of Ruby made up of binary code was designed by assistant art director Greg Loewen and Vivien Nishi, who hand-wrote all the numbers on <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} mural {{was completed}} on the Red Fox Vintage building by Heidi Schultz in November 2013. However, shortly after its completion, New Seasons announced {{the construction of}} a new grocery store next to <b>the</b> <b>mural.</b> The company offered to reproduce the painting on the east side of an adjacent building or the west side of the planned building. Dan Cohen and his assistant were hired to reproduce <b>the</b> <b>mural,</b> which was completed in October 2015.|$|E
30|$|Table  1 {{shows that}} the most {{hazardous}} deterioration on <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> repaired by PVA contains disruption, detachment and paint loss. The most hazardous deterioration on <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> repaired by <b>the</b> hybrid emulsion contains disruption, flaking and paint loss.

50|$|In the mid-1990s, Caltrans {{decided to}} {{retrofit}} the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge {{to make it}} earthquake safe. Fearing that <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> would be damaged or destroyed, the community mobilized to stop the project to protect <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> from what they viewed as official insensitivity to the history and culture <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> represented. Eventually, a compromise was reached whereby <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> would be boarded over with plywood to protect their surfaces from damage during the retrofitting process, and would be restored to their previous condition afterward.|$|R
50|$|American Airlines {{has donated}} <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> to Miami-Dade County and Odebrecht has {{invested}} in a project to remove, restore, transport and install <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> at Miami International Airport. When experts in New York complete the restoration process in 2009, <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> will be on permanent display at MIA’s new South Terminal, built by Odebrecht in a Joint venture.|$|R
5|$|In 2015, {{a massive}} Bob Dylan mural was {{unveiled}} in downtown Minneapolis, {{the city where}} Dylan attended university for a year. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> was designed by Brazilian street artist Eduardo Kobra.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> {{is set on}} fire by {{a mystery}} arsonist. Everyone in the school assumes Jack did it {{to get back at}} Skinner. While the police are out searching for Jack, Marge finds him hiding in the school playground. He swears to her that he did not start the fire. Marge {{believes}} him and distracts Skinner and Chief Wiggum so he can escape, but he instead sets fire to Skinner's car as he did to <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> and dances around it laughing maniacally. Jack is arrested and when he lies to her, Marge angrily orders Wiggum to take him back to prison.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>murals</b> {{were first}} {{exhibited}} at Gwangju Biennale in South Korea in 2006 and were subsequently {{exhibited at the}} Yamatane Museum in Tokyo, Japan. [...] More than fifty thousand visitors saw <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> prior to their installation at Shofuso. <b>The</b> <b>murals</b> were then shipped to their final destination in Philadelphia, arriving in March and installed in April 2007.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} station opened <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> {{were victims of}} {{graffiti}} that badly damaged the artwork. Attempts of removing the graffiti destroyed large sections of the paintings. In 2004 <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> were all removed for a restoration plan by the STM to have the artist repaint <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> and slowly have them reinstalled in the station. As of June 2010 all <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> have been repainted, and are partially reinstalled on all four platforms of the station with a protective sheet of glass to prevent any future vandalism.|$|R
2500|$|The room {{closed for}} {{remodeling}} in 2008, and <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> toured museums in Spain {{for the first}} time. [...] The Sorolla Room reopened in 2010, with <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> on permanent display.|$|R
5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing of the drawing was missing, and he could not remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E
5|$|Another tale {{from the}} {{conflict}} is of the dog of Marathon. Aelian relates that one hoplite brought his dog to the Athenian encampment. The dog followed his master to battle and attacked the Persians at his master's side. He also informs us that this dog is depicted in <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> of the Stoa Poikile.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Lazzell {{was one of}} two West Virginians who {{received}} Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration. That same year she created a mural for a court room in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled, Justice. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> took fourteen weeks to complete. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. She continued experimenting with woodprints and, in 1935, studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown. Hofmann's push/pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works. Lazzell's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens, such as Star Phlox (1931). Her 1948 floral print, Red and White Petunia, won first prize at the American Color Print Society exhibition. A collection of her prints are housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University.|$|E
50|$|After a {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> were completed, <b>the</b> Big Strike of 1934 shut down the Pacific Coast. Though it has been claimed that allusions to the event were subversively included in <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> {{by some of the}} artists, in fact <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> were largely completed before the strike began and none of those that were not completed by that time show any reference to the strike.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinguishing}} features of the building today is <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> painted during <b>the</b> 1930s by Aurelius Battaglia under a Works Progress Administration program. <b>The</b> <b>murals</b> depict a fantastical world where the animals take over the circus. With the lion as the ringmaster and the hippos as ballerinas, <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> may have served as studies for Walt Disney's Fantasia for which Battaglia worked as an illustrator years later.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 a fire {{broke out}} in the Shrine Chapel {{destroying}} <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> and damaging much of the other artwork. Happily, the windows and ceramics could be repaired, but <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> had to be replaced.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, Bancroft was {{commissioned}} {{to design a}} large mural covering the exterior of a sports centre housing two basketball courts at Tempe Reserve in Marrickville, New South Wales. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> depicts a snake, a man, and a woman, representing both biblical and Indigenous Australian creation stories. It also includes the goanna, the ancestral totem of the Marrickville area's original inhabitants, the Wangal people.|$|E
5|$|Vlad did {{not abandon}} {{his claim to}} Wallachia and settled in Transylvania. A Neo-Renaissance mural in a three-storey house in the main square of Sighișoara (which was {{uncovered}} on the 500th anniversary of the death Vlad Dracul's son, Dracula) may depict Vlad Dracul after an original painting, according to Radu Florescu. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> depicts a corpulent man with oval-shaped eyes and long moustaches wearing a white turban.|$|E
5|$|William Marwood, the 19th century hangman, {{carried out}} his first {{execution}} at Lincoln. He used the long drop, designed {{to break the}} victim's neck rather than to strangle him, to execute Fred Horry in 1872. Until 1868, prisoners were publicly hanged on <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> tower at the north-east corner of the curtain wall, overlooking the upper town.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>murals</b> in <b>the</b> temple {{were painted}} by Maligawe Sarlis(1880-1955) in 1920-21. <b>The</b> <b>murals</b> have been {{described}} as [...] "exuberant, theatrical recastings of the traditional subjects of Buddhist temple art, in a vivid realist style".|$|R
50|$|The lack of {{maintenance}} {{and protection of}} <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> was primarily due to disputes between government {{agencies such as the}} Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) and the Mexico City government as to who had the responsibility for them. In 1998, merchants in the market banded together to create an organization to restore <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> and to get the market included in the various tourism promotions of the city government. While this particular effort failed, new efforts surfaced in the 2000s. The merchant association installed acrylic screens over a number of <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> to protect them, but the city government stated that these did not let <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> “breathe” and could cause damage, so they were removed. Until 2008, efforts by merchants had mostly consisted of not letting children play ball against <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> and not leaning merchandise or other materials against them.|$|R
50|$|The {{themes of}} <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> in Wat Bowonniwet and Wat Borom Niwat {{were not only}} related to Buddhism, but also {{political}} subjects such as <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> that portray George Washington’s residence and the United States Congress.|$|R
5|$|Following Bowie's death, fans {{gathered}} at impromptu street shrines. At <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> of Bowie in his birthplace of Brixton, south London, which shows {{him in his}} Aladdin Sane character, fans laid flowers and sang his songs. Other memorial sites included Berlin, Los Angeles, and outside his apartment in New York. After news of his death, sales of his albums and singles soared. Bowie had insisted {{that he did not}} want a funeral, and according to his death certificate he was cremated in New Jersey on 12 January.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{all forms}} of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several {{complaints}} regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked {{the view of the}} coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The Italian naval ensign {{comprises}} the national flag defaced with {{the arms of}} the Marina Militare; the Marina Mercantile (and private citizens at sea) use the civil ensign, differenced by the absence of <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> crown and the lion holding open the gospel, bearing the inscription PAX TIBI MARCE EVANGELISTA MEVS, instead of a sword. The shield is quartered, symbolic of the four great thalassocracies of Italy, the repubbliche marinare of Venice (represented by the lion passant, top left), Genoa (top right), Amalfi (bottom left), and Pisa (represented by their respective crosses); the rostrata crown was proposed by Admiral Cavagnari in 1939 to acknowledge the Navy's origins in ancient Rome.|$|E
50|$|Brown's major {{achievement}} after Work was <b>The</b> Manchester <b>Murals,</b> a {{cycle of}} twelve paintings in the Great Hall of Manchester Town Hall depicting {{the history of the}} city. Brown would be 72 by the time he finished <b>the</b> <b>murals.</b> In total, he took six years perfecting <b>the</b> <b>murals,</b> which were his last major work.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>murals</b> on <b>the</b> bots {{interior}} walls were traditionally light and {{limited in their}} subject matter and style. They were painted to appear three-dimensional. Monk artist Khrua In Khong introduced Western style in <b>the</b> <b>murals</b> depicting Buddhist subjects.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>murals,</b> <b>the</b> house contains a clothing collection and many original furnishings.|$|R
5|$|In December 1982 Jarrell was {{commissioned}} by Westinghouse Electric Company to create a three-hundred-foot mural in their Athens headquarters, to boost {{the morale of the}} employees. <b>The</b> <b>mural</b> {{was the first time he}} used a bricklayer's trowel in his work, a tool introduced to him by Adger Cowans. The Apple Birds and The Return of the Apple Birds, from 1983, show his dramatic use of the trowel. The paintings were inspired by a drawing by his daughter, Jennifer, at the age of two. The Apple Birds were drawn by and talked about by Jennifer as having apple-shaped heads with stems at the top, long arms and short bodies. Zigzags, geometric shapes and layers make up the environment that the Apple Birds live in on the canvas. The trowel is used throughout to create 3-D layers and overlaps.|$|E
5|$|Medieval frescoes used {{to cover}} the {{entirety}} of the church's interior, though only some 70 fragments survive until today. Until 1961, the existence of a medieval mural layer was unknown because the walls were covered with oil paint in the 1910s. The medieval frescoes were uncovered and restored between 1970 and 1975 by a team under Dragomir Peshev. The dating of the frescoes is as controversial as that of the church itself. Bozhkov places the painting of the murals in the 12th century, while scholars Bistra Nikolova and V. Mavrodinova believe they were created in the 13th century. According to Nikolova, <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> inscriptions in Medieval Greek (as opposed to Middle Bulgarian) are evidence that the frescoes were painted during the Byzantine rule of Bulgaria (1018–1185). At the time, the region of Patalenitsa would have belonged to the Byzantine bishopric centred at Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv).|$|E
5|$|Plutarch {{mentions}} that the Athenians saw the phantom of King Theseus, the mythical hero of Athens, leading {{the army in}} full battle gear in the charge against the Persians, and indeed he was depicted in <b>the</b> <b>mural</b> of the Stoa Poikile fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes. Pausanias also tells us that: They say too that there chanced {{to be present in}} the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero.|$|E
50|$|The Society to Preserve <b>the</b> Millvale <b>Murals</b> of Maxo Vanka, {{founded in}} 1991 {{with the mission}} to {{preserve}} and maintain <b>the</b> <b>murals,</b> is leading a campaign to clean, restore and light <b>the</b> <b>murals.</b> SPMMMV also manages a docent program. Docent-led tours are available at St. Nicholas Croatian Catholic Church on Saturdays at 11:00, 12:00, and 1:00.|$|R
5000|$|El Segundo Barrio {{has many}} Chicana/o <b>murals</b> within <b>the</b> neighborhood.
