His murder led to the building being sold to Peter Blasko for $228,000. The sale helped SFLC pay off their outstanding loan. They continued to lease space as did other unions after the murder of Wilson. Blasko later sold the property to the M.K Blake Estate which held the building until 1989. By this time the building had become a community center.|$|E
25|$|At that time, the Wicking Library was the school's newest wing. The {{library in}} the parking lot did not satisfy {{educators}} who thought that a library could be the center of instructional activity. In addition, many classrooms in the school needed upgrading and the music facilities were poor. The plan to solve these problems showed a small addition on the left, a new hallway across the rear of the plant, and rooms surrounding the library. The music department would get two big practice rooms and a classroom. A large two-story structure was planned to surround the library. When the plans were revealed, everyone was happy that the definitely modern building would be around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional Georgian Facade. In September 1973, the new wing was completed. South now had first-class science labs and social studies classrooms, appropriately naming the new addition the “S-Building.” In addition to the new classrooms, South gained a new 116-seat lecture hall.|$|E
25|$|Inside the school, teacher Dave Sanders had {{successfully}} evacuated {{students from the}} cafeteria; where some of them went up a staircase leading {{to the second floor}} of the school. The stairs were located around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Library Hallway in the main South Hallway. By now, Harris and Klebold were inside the main hallway. Sanders and another student were down at the end of the hallway still trying to secure as much of the school as they could. As they ran, they encountered Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the North Hallway. Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the chest but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, to look for the student but returned to Harris up the North Hallway.|$|E

50|$|The katholikon, whose {{foundations}} survive, was a cross-in-square domed {{church with}} three semicircular apses, and sported a floor decoration by inlaid marble in geometric patterns {{very similar to}} the nearby Church of Hosios Loukas. The katholikon collapsed ca. 1890, and the narthex was transformed into the current church. The narthex is roughly octagonal, with four crosswise central vaults and niches in <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> rest of the monastery, only portions of the surrounding walls and, to the north, the foundations of the monastery baths, datable to the 13th century, survive.|$|R
500|$|Muralist Alfred Du Pont (also {{known as}} Dupont) {{was hired to}} design images to {{decorate}} the exterior. Du Pont produced two [...] high silvery figures in sgraffito, or raised plaster, on the western facade of the building, and a third on the north side. Du Pont applied colored concrete to the exterior and carved it into shape. Flanking the main street entrance are two male figures. The image on the right facing left is a Spanish explorer with a telescope raised to one eye. The image on the left facing right is a bare-chested worker holding a globe, towering above the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, with sleek aircraft flying above and below him, and ships moving in the bay. The actual bridge {{can be seen from}} the house; it had been completed the previous year when the Malloch Building was under construction. Around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main entrance, the third silvery mural shows a robed woman, the spirit of California, standing in front of California represented as a map.|$|E
500|$|Following {{several months}} of rumours {{regarding}} the restaurant, the Berkeley Hotel confirmed in May 2008 {{that it was going}} to work with Wareing to launch his only solo restaurant, and he would take on Pétrus' lease from 19 September 2008 onwards. Wareing had previously complained of interference in the kitchen by GRH, and wanted to come out from under Ramsay's shadow, but later admitted that he had engineered the situation so that he could go out on his own. The split with Ramsay and GRH resulted in a public legal battle and feud between the three parties, which when resolved resulted in Wareing stating in an interview for Waitrose Food Illustrated magazine that Ramsay left him bitter and conflicted; [...] "half of me thinks he’s a sad bastard and the other half still adores him." [...] He went on to describe Ramsay as a celebrity chef who wasn't involved in the industry anymore. The legal dispute was resolved with Ramsay gaining the rights to the Pétrus name, and Wareing signing a gag order regarding the situation but continuing to open his restaurant Marcus Wareing at The Berkeley. Wareing remarked of the situation, [...] "If I never speak to that guy again for the rest of my life, it wouldn't bother me one bit." [...] Ramsay later responded regarding the feud that he wishes Wareing [...] "all the best". Wareing's self-named restaurant won the Best Restaurant in London Award by Harden's guide in 2008 and 2009, was awarded two Michelin stars in 2009, and was named Time Out's restaurant of the year in 2010. The new Pétrus was opened around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Berkeley Hotel at 1 Kinnerton Street, Knightsbridge. Ramsay later joked, that with Heston Blumenthal also opening his new restaurant nearby, the three of them could [...] "all have a fight in the street at four in the morning".|$|E

2500|$|The {{recognition}} of Tim Hortons as a Canadian icon has permeated into American culture {{as the result}} of product placement efforts in conjunction with a marketing agency.

2500|$|The {{restaurant}} was first threatened with demolition in 1962. [...] Around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> restaurant on 15th Street NW (and {{across the street}} from the U.S. Treasury Building) stood the nearly block-long Keith-Albee Building (designed by noted architect Jules Henri de Sibour) and Rhodes' Tavern (the first polling place in the city, the first city town hall, and the place where citizens of the District of Columbia first petitioned Congress for the right to vote). Developer Morris Cafritz, who purchased the Keith-Albee Building and Rhodes' Tavern in 1956, wanted to tear down the entire half-block to construct a new office building.|$|E

In the 1920s – during prohibition – the downstairs of the Swedish-American Hall served as a speak-easy, one of many in the area. [...] "Unlicensed saloons" [...] were known as speak-easies, according to an 1889 newspaper. [...] They were [...] "so called because of the practice of speaking quietly about such a place in public, or when inside it, so as not to alert the police or neighbors".|$|E

Courses began in November under the directorship of Jules Romain, author and graduate of the École Normale Supérieure. Among the teaching staff were Copeau himself who would teach a course on {{the theory of the}} theatre and Greek tragedy, and [...] Jouvet who taught a complementary course on the Greek theatre {{from the point of view}} of its architecture. Bing taught the beginning course on reading and diction and along with Copeau a course on the formation of the dramatic instinct. Copeau's daughter Marie-Hélène was in charge of a workshop on the use of different materials, on geometric design, on costume design and production.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the funds}} of the Dean Colet Foundation had {{increased}} {{to such an extent that}} the Trustees decided to build a school for girls, and in 1904, St Paul's Girls' School was opened in Brook Green, Hammersmith, just around <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> then site of the boys' school in Hammersmith Road. Unlike the boys', the girls' school remains in its original position, although it has expanded and constructed new buildings and facilities alongside the old. In 1881, a boys' preparatory school was founded which later became Colet Court, now St Paul's Juniors. St Paul's Juniors is now on the same site as the main school and most of its pupils are expected to pass into St Paul's School when they reach the age of 13. [...] It thus serves as a junior school for the main establishment.|$|E

Haye started his ambition and passion for boxing at old-school boxing gym Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in Lambeth, South London, where he quickly impressed and confidently won his first amateur bouts. Mick Carney, who ran the gym where David began training from 10 years old, said of Haye: [...] "He could whack as a kid. I think he chinned about three kids. But that made it really hard to get him matches. When you've got three first-round knockouts on your card everybody runs for the hills." [...] Of his upbringing, he described Haye as [...] "a lovely kid. He comes from a beautiful, loving family. He wasn't on the streets. He went to school, came to the gym, went home. His family bestowed love and affection on him. Bermondsey might have been bad, but he, his brother and his sister were nice people from a nice family." ...|$|E
