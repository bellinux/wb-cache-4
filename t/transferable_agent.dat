40|$|Rotylenchulus reniformis is a {{major problem}} confronting cotton {{production}} in {{the central part of the}} cotton belt of the United States of America. In this study, the hypothesis that natural antagonists in some cases are responsible for unusually low densities of the nematode in certain fields was tested by assaying soils from 22 selected fields for the presence of <b>transferable</b> <b>agents</b> in pots containing cotton plants. In one field, soil from four different depth ranges was tested. In the first of two types of assays, 1 part nematode infested soil was added to 9 parts test soil that was left untreated or autoclaved before mixing; this mixture was used to fill pots. In the second type of assay, 1 part test soil was added to 9 or 19 parts pasteurized fine sand, and nematodes were introduced in aqueous suspension. In three experiments representing both types of assay, <b>transferable</b> or autoclavable <b>agent(s)</b> from four fields in South Texas suppressed nematode populations by 48, 78, 90 and 95 %. In one experiment, <b>transferable</b> <b>agents</b> in five fields in Louisiana suppressed populations from 37 to 66 %. Identification and evaluation of these agents for biological control of R. reniformis merits further study...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{matching}} patterns among agents who are heterogeneous in productivity, in a labor market characterized by frictions. Utility from matching is fully <b>transferable.</b> <b>Agents</b> {{have to choose}} which type of partners to match with. There is a possibility of multiple equilibria. The general characteristics of a matching equilibrium are reviewed. Conditions for existence of {{the different types of}} equilibria are laid out. Conditions on the production function are given, restricting the number of possible equilibria. An application is studied. It is found that wage dispersion is higher when agents match with a larger set of productivity types, also resulting in lower unemployment. Some evidence is provided to support the notion that Europe may be in the type of matching equilibrium that would result in higher unemployment and lower wage dispersion than in the U. S., as empirically observed. This emphasizes that studying the matching behavior of heterogeneous agents {{is an important part of}} the cross-country study of labor markets. ...|$|R
40|$|We study a two-sided {{matching}} {{model with}} {{a finite number of}} <b>agents</b> and with <b>transferable</b> utility: <b>agents</b> {{on both sides of the}} market are privately informed about multi-dimensional attributes that determine the match value of each pair. Utility functions are assumed to be quasi-linear, and monetary transfers among agents are feasible. We ask the following question: what divisions of surplus among matched pairs are compatible with information revelation leading to an efficient matching? Our main result shows that the only robust rules compatible with effi cient matching are those that divide the achieved surplus in a fixed proportion, independently of the attributes of the pair’s members. In other words, for effi cient matching it is necessary that all agents expect to get the same fixed proportion of surplus in every conceivable match. A more permissive result is obtained for one-dimensional attributes and supermodular value functions...|$|R
40|$|We {{join the}} goals of two giant and related fields of {{research}} in group decision-making that have historically had little contact: fair division, and efficient mechanism design with monetary payments. To do this we adopt the standard mechanism design paradigm where utility {{is assumed to be}} quasilinear and thus <b>transferable</b> across <b>agents.</b> We generalize the traditional binary criteria of envy-freeness, proportionality, and efficiency (welfare) to measures of degree that range between 0 and 1. We demonstrate that in the canonical fair division settings under any allocatively-efficient mechanism the worst-case welfare rate is 0 and disproportionality rate is 1; in other words, the worst-case results are as bad as possible. This strongly motivates an average-case analysis. We then set as the goal identification of a mechanism that achieves high welfare, low envy, and low disproportionality in expectation across a spectrum of fair division settings. We establish that the VCG mechanism is not a satisfactory candidate, but the redistribution mechanism of [Bailey, 1997; Cavallo, 2006] is. ...|$|R

40|$|We study a two-sided {{matching}} {{model with}} <b>transferable</b> utility where <b>agents</b> {{are characterized by}} privately known, multi-dimensional attributes that jointly determine the surplus of each potential partnership.

Our main result shows that the only robust rules compatible with efficient matching are those that divide realized surplus in a fixed proportion, independently of the attributes of the pair’s members: each agent must expect to get the same fixed percentage of surplus in every conceivable match.

40|$|Background: Antibiotic {{resistance}} in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, {{as one of}} the most important pathogens commonly implicated in nosocomial infections, has been increased in recent years, moreover the presence of integrons and the associated resistance gene cassettes is well established.. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to ascertain the presence and spread of class 1 integrons amongst environmental isolates of P. aeruginosa from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as well as its association with drug resistance [...] Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 33 P. aeruginosa, isolated from different places and devices used in ICU at Shahid Beheshti Hospital in Babol, north of Iran, from 2008 to 2009. Antibiotic susceptibility profiles and minimum inhibitory concentration against 12 antibacterial agents were performed by micro dilution and disk diffusion methods. The detection of class 1 integron was performed by the PCR method. The demographic and microbiological data between the integron positive and negative isolates were compared with SPSS software [...] Results: Thirteen of 33 (39. 4 %) of P. aeruginosa had intl gene, among which 24. 2 % were characterized as multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA) on the other hand, 15. 2 % showed intermediate or complete sensitivity. No significant differences were seen between the presence of integron gene and resistance to the antibiotics except for ofloxacin. Most resistance was observed in cefepime (100 %) and the lowest to ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin (42. 5 %) [...] Conclusions: The result of this study showed a high prevalence of class 1 integron gene in most P. aeruginosa strains isolated from different parts of the environment and equipment used in ICU. The role of these <b>transferable</b> genetic <b>agents</b> has been proven in the creation of resistance. So, the environmental bacteria represent a reservoir for dissemination of clinically relevant multidrug-resistant antibiotics and should be taken under control to reduce the appearance or distribution of these antibiotic resistant agents...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 {{develops}} {{a model of}} the labor market that can account for the following facts. The duration of unemployment is higher for lesser skilled workers in all countries. The probability of becoming unemployed is also higher for lesser skilled workers in countries with low fixed firing costs, i. e. costs that are not proportional to wage. However, lesser skilled workers actually become unemployed less frequently than their higher skilled counterparts in countries with high fixed firing costs. These facts are established for a sample of young workers. The model, which is based on matching frictions, only relies on different firing regulations to explain the diverging patterns. Its main implications is {{that it is necessary to}} differentiate between the various types of firing costs, such as severance payments or fixed administrative costs, when looking at their effect of labor market outcomes. This is generally not done in the theoretical or empirical literature. Chapter 2 deals with matching patterns among agents of different skill levels, when search is costly. In order to replicate a labor market setting, utility from the match is assumed to be <b>transferable</b> between <b>agents.</b> The model incorporates a decision of which skill levels any individual is willing to match with. Because this decision determines the distribution of searching agents, several different matching patterns may arise in equilibrium, as well as the possibility of multiple equilibria. The conditions for existence of a particular equilibrium are laid out, as well as conditions on the production function restricting the number of possible equilibrium matching patterns. One implication of the model is that equilibria with infrequent matching, and hence high unemployment exhibit low wage dispersion and vice versa, replicating what is observed in the U. S. and European economies. A second implication is that a technology shock rendering high skill workers more productive, relative to low skill workers would result in matching by type, hence increasing unemployment. Chapter 3 investigates the effects of a minimum wage regulation on labor market outcomes, when the market is characterized by information imperfections. The presence of a minimum wage restricts the possible outcomes of the bargain between the firm and the worker, and hence, may lead to privately inefficient match breakdowns. Also, the regulation reduces firms 2 ̆ 7 incentive to engage in costly search. The two effects result in higher unemployment duration and higher probability of becoming unemployed for those skill levels affected by the regulation. ...|$|R
