People hear the song all the <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> [...] if it [...] an original song." [...] West defended the song's sample, stating that the idea came to him after listening to a friend's Makaveli album one night. Roc-A-Fella Records' Co-CEO responded to Braxton's claims: ...|$|E
500|$|Julian {{began to}} see his father more regularly. Lennon bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and a drum machine for Christmas in 1973, and {{encouraged}} Julian's interest in music by showing him some chords. [...] "Dad and I got on a great deal better then," [...] recalls Julian. [...] "We {{had a lot of}} fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general when he was with May Pang. My memories of that time with Dad and May are very clear—they were the happiest <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember with them." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Jugband Blues" [...] {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as [...] "Vegetable Man". Both songs contain the same cynical humour, but while on [...] "Vegetable Man" [...] Barrett focuses his humour on himself, on [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] it is {{directed}} towards those around him. [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] was recorded on 19 October 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios. Barrett wanted a Salvation Army band to play on the track. He told them he wanted them to simply [...] "play whatever they want" [...] regardless {{of the rest of the}} group, while Norman Smith insisted on recorded parts. Eventually both versions were recorded and used. About The Salvation Army, band manager Andrew King said that Barrett [...] "wanted a massive Salvation Army freak-out, but that's the only <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember Norman [...] putting his foot down." [...] The song features a distinctive three-tiered structure: starting off in 3/4 meter, then into 2/4 and finishing off in 4/4.|$|E

6000|$|... "There was {{no doubt}} about it," [...] Lacroix declared, smiling. [...] "My Indian guide, who knew {{every inch of the}} country, told me so many <b>times.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> assure you that Lord Arranmore, whom I am very pleased to meet again, was a very {{different}} person in those days." ...|$|R
500|$|Also seeing {{improvement}} was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting [...] "Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, {{and this is}} the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> really say I'm looking forward to the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onions A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember, an extreme-sports game {{actually}} has a real story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft {{had the guts to}} try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know works so well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic. By contrast, Game Informers Justin Leeper thought that [...] "it serves to make some of the less-entertaining goals tolerable, because there’s a reason for doing them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{visits to}} Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and {{ultimately}} settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band {{and joined the}} Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so {{he was able to}} play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that it was {{getting in the way of}} his musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that [...] "I'm traveling 90 percent of the <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> live anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport". A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in The New Yorker, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking a couple of years before that; Farmer [...] "used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.|$|E
