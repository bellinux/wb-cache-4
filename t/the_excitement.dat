5|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> {{generated}} by Pac-Mans home release prompted retail stores {{to expand their}} inventory to sell video games. Drugstores began stocking video game cartridges, and toy retailers vied for new releases. Kmart and J. C. Penney competed against Sears to become the largest vendor of video games. The game's release also led {{to an increase in}} sales of the Atari 2600 console.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} which ended the war, Baker's engagement with Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancee and <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of the war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back to work in an office and considered himself a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.|$|E
5|$|Beese {{introduced}} Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head {{shared his}} enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse {{had started to}} build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told HitQuarters that he felt the reason behind <b>the</b> <b>excitement,</b> over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, {{real-time}} strategy games began outselling turn-based games. As they surged in popularity, major 4X developers fell into difficulties. Sid Meier's Firaxis Games released Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in 1999 to critical acclaim, {{but the game}} fell short of commercial expectations. Civilization III encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001. Despite <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> over Master of Orion III, its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack of player control, poor interface, and weak AI. Game publishers eventually became risk-averse to financing the development of 4X games.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> {{surrounding}} Lester's and King's performances, the Americans did not {{fare well}} overall. Fifteen matches were played, {{but only two}} were won, while the team lost nine and earned a draw in four. The other win came against Warwickshire. During this match at Edgbaston, Lester scored 35 runs in the first innings and 67 in the second. Lester was the best batsmen on the Philadelphian side; beginning with 72 not out in his first match, he kept up his form all through the tour, scoring 891 runs for an average 37.12. Several counties offered him contracts to play in England.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's book {{follows a}} venerable {{tradition}} of travel literature that blends <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of journeys to foreign places with utopian reflection; More's Utopia is {{cited as a}} forerunner, as is the account of Amerigo Vespucci. Godwin could fall back on an extensive body of work describing the voyages undertaken by his protagonist, including books by Hakluyt and Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, and the narratives deriving from the Jesuit mission in Beijing.|$|E

5|$|Jim Dawson devoted {{an entire}} chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged {{flatulence}} in Mind Meld, which he compares {{to the sound}} of someone stepping on a tribble.

5|$|McGivney {{traveled}} to Boston {{to examine the}} Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to Brooklyn, New York {{to learn about the}} recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of which offered insurance benefits. He found the latter to be lacking <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> he thought was needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day. He explored establishing a New Haven Court of the Foresters, but the group's charter in Massachusetts limited them to operating within the Commonwealth. McGivney's committee of St. Mary's parishioners decided to form a new club.|$|E

5|$|According to The Washington Times writer Rick Snyder, Vogel did {{not know}} the horse racing {{business}} and made mistakes that negatively affected the industry in Maryland. The year-round racing Rosecroft was awarded lowered <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> for the locals. Rosecroft was not capable of attracting a new market, and attendance figures declined. He never focused on marketing or daily operations of Rosecroft. Instead, Vogel focused more on his real estate business. As a result, the attendance dropped. Vogel took out money from the betting pools to help his real estate business. Lower betting pools mean smaller payouts for the bettors and less profit for the racetrack owners. Vogel never formed political ties to help pass legislation used to help harness racing, more specially to allow off-track betting and to lower the state tax on betting pools.|$|E
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later in the year, <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> that surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E
5|$|At the Post's home, Hal Dunton {{sits down}} with his love {{interest}} Sue Post, cautiously {{checking to see if}} they are alone. Hal then proposes to Sue and in <b>the</b> <b>excitement,</b> her father comes into the room. He is outraged and believes his daughter is too young to be married and promptly makes Hal leave before scolding his daughter. Before departing, Hal meets and pleads with the father as he takes the daughter away by car. The father refuses and Hal is knocked down before the father and daughter depart to a boarding school. The father meets with the mistress and leaves Sue in her care, much to Sue's distress.|$|E
5000|$|The primal {{scene is}} inseparable from the sexual {{theories}} of childhood that it serves to create. This disturbing representation, which at once acknowledges and denies the familiar quality of the parents, excludes the child even as it concerns them, as witness <b>the</b> libidinal <b>excitement</b> <b>the</b> child feels in response. Otto Fenichel has stressed the traumatic nature of <b>the</b> excess <b>excitement</b> felt by <b>the</b> child, which {{they are unable to}} process — what he called the [...] "overwhelming unknown".|$|R

5000|$|The band {{evolved from}} an earlier group called <b>The</b> <b>Excitements,</b> {{initially}} including Phil Stephenson on bass guitar, Neil (Cad) Campbell on drums, Grimes on guitar and Thomas (the band's dancer). They became The Farm after Martin Dunbar (vocals) left and Peter Hooton joined, although they did play several gigs as <b>The</b> <b>Excitements</b> with Hooton on vocals. In 1984, they released the single, [...] "Hearts and Minds", produced by Graham [...] "Suggs" [...] McPherson, lead vocalist with Madness. In 1986, after McVann's death, Melvin left the band to pursue a varied career {{as the director of}} his own construction firm, but he eventually returned to music in 1990 under the guise of Mr. Smith, a two-piece band that toured frequently, but did not release anything of note. In 1987, the band supported The Housemartins on their UK tour.|$|R
5|$|Ballhaus, at Finerman and Frankel's suggestion, {{composed}} as many shots as possible, whether interiors or exteriors, to {{at least}} partially take in busy New York street scenes in the background, to convey <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of working in a glamorous industry in New York. He also used a handheld camera during some of the busier meeting scenes in Miranda's office, to better convey the flow of action, and slow motion for Andrea's entrance into the office following her makeover. A few process shots were necessary, mainly to put exterior views behind windows on sets and in the Mercedes where Miranda and Andrea are having their climactic conversation.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> {{surrounding}} King's performance, the Americans did not {{fare well}} overall, {{and the results}} may have been worse than hoped for by the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, King proved himself {{to be the best}} bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs, more {{than anyone else in the}} team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman at a batting average of just over 20.|$|E
5|$|Helmuth Raithel (9 April 190712 September 1990) was a German {{officer who}} held the rank of SS-Standartenführer (colonel) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. While still at school, Raithel was swept up in <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923 led by Adolf Hitler, and was {{subsequently}} awarded the coveted Blood Order, {{even though he was}} {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. He joined the Reichswehr (interwar German Army) in 1926. After World War II broke out he fought in the invasion of Greece in summer 1941, then against the Soviet Red Army in northern Finland before transferring to the Waffen-SS in 1943.|$|E

5|$|Many {{different}} versions of the events were set down and distributed due to <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> around the trial and the public demand for entertainments based on the murder, making it hard for modern readers to discern fact from melodramatic embellishment. Good official records exist from the trial, and the best record of the events surrounding the case is generally considered to be that of James Curtis, a journalist who spent time with Corder and two weeks in Polstead interviewing those concerned. He was apparently so connected with the case that a newspaper artist who was asked to produce a picture of the accused man drew a likeness of Curtis instead of Corder.|$|E
5|$|McBride {{was a fan}} {{of boxing}} and baseball, but knew little about football. He only grew {{interested}} in the sport in 1940, when his son Arthur Jr. was a student the University of Notre Dame and he attended Notre Dame Fighting Irish football games in South Bend, Indiana. He was drawn by <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> that surrounded football and thought a professional team could be profitable. In 1942, McBride made overtures to supermarket heir Dan Reeves about buying his Cleveland Rams, a National Football League team, but Reeves rebuffed him. In 1944, however, Chicago Tribune sports editor Arch Ward proposed a new professional league called the All-America Football Conference. McBride, who knew Ward from his days in the newspaper business, eagerly signed on {{as the owner of}} the eight-team circuit's Cleveland franchise.|$|E
5|$|One morning, after Tod's {{escape from}} the greyhounds, the Master sends Copper on the hunt. After {{he picks up the}} fox's trail, Copper relentlessly pursues him {{throughout}} the day and into the next morning. Tod finally drops dead of exhaustion, and Copper collapses on top of him, close to death himself. The Master nurses Copper back to health, and both enjoy their new popularity, but after a few months <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> over Copper's accomplishment dies down. The Master is left alone again, and returns to drinking. He is once again asked to consider living in a nursing home, and this time he agrees. Crying, he takes his shotgun from the wall, leads Copper outside, and pets him gently before ordering him to lie down. He covers the dog's eyes as Copper licks his hand trustingly.|$|E
