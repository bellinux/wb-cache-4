5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{property}} deeds, a quitclaim deed contains no <b>title</b> <b>covenant</b> and thus offers the grantee no warranty {{as to the}} status of the property title; the grantee is entitled only to whatever interest the grantor actually possesses at the time the transfer occurs. This means that the grantor does not guarantee that he or she actually owns any interest in the property {{at the time of the}} transfer, or if he or she does own an interest, that the title is free and clear. It is, therefore, possible for a grantee to receive no actual interest, and [...] - [...] because a quitclaim deed offers no warranty [...] - [...] have no legal recourse to recover any losses. Further, if the grantor should acquire the property at a later date, the grantee is not entitled to take possession, because the grantee can only receive the interest the grantor held at the time the transfer occurred. In contrast, other deeds often used for real estate sales (called grant deeds or warranty deeds, depending on the jurisdiction) contain warranties from the grantor to the grantee that the title is clear or that the grantor has not placed any encumbrance against the title.|$|E
5000|$|The Choctaw Indians of Alabama some of whom, {{but not all}} {{are known}} at the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians is {{composed}} of Choctaw who refused removal to the Indian Territory in 1830. By their treaty, {{they were allowed to}} stay as state (and US) residents and retain their Sovereignty as Choctaw Citizens but if they should ever remove to take a 640-acre reservation in Oklahoma, then they would never be allowed to take part of the financial incentive. The Treaty of (D)Oaks Stand in 1820 traded the lands East of the Tombigbee River in the OLD Choctaw lands called the [...] "OLD FIELDS" [...] for the State of Oklahoma and was later attempted to be corrected in the Treaty of 1825 when 5 million acres were taken from the Choctaw Nation from the lands ceded by the United States to the Choctaw Nation. The Treaty of 1820 was Treaty which conveyed or ceded the lands West of the Mississippi to the Choctaw Nation from the United States and this act was done in 1820, not 1830 as is commonly misunderstood to the case. The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, in fact, guaranteed the Sovereignty of those who would remove to those lands in the West such as Oklahoma to the Choctaw Nation forever but did not convey <b>title,</b> <b>covenant</b> or any other term that was intended to diminish from the Right of Possession, Usage, and Occupancy of the Choctaw Nation of Indians in Alabama near their own sacred mound at Indian Graves Creek and Indian Springs at what is today known as Cedar Creek behind the old Jackson's Barracks which is called the Mount Vernon Arsenal or Barracks and was last known as the Searcy Hospital for the Insane. It was also once known for the Battle of the Horseshoe - which an aerial view will reveal {{the true nature of the}} heavily stockaded fort which was said to be encountered by Jackson during the Creek War of 1814-1815. The Horseshoe was surrounded by cannons which were used to attack the fortification which is situated on a higher elevation and was virtually impregnable. In 1835 the state government built the Weaver Indian school at Mount Vernon, Alabama, with labor supplied by the Choctaw. Before the American Civil War, the Choctaw were at risk in periodic [...] "Indian roundups" [...] by the federal government.. During these decades they sometimes but rarely intermarried with European Americans. John Johnston Jr. testified in 1842 to being threatened for his property rights before the Congress of the United States, he is a progenitor of some of the Choctaw Indians of Alabama (known as the MOWA - Choctaws Indians of Mobile and Washington County) today and a road named after him is one of the main roads in McIntosh as a legacy to his leadership of the Choctaw Indians of the East ...|$|E

5000|$|Cabaret Voltaire {{struggled}} with several censorship issues with Some Bizarre Virgin Records upon {{the release of}} this album. The original <b>title,</b> The <b>Covenant,</b> The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, was forced to be shortened in America to avoid reference to the US white supremacist organisation. Musically, the album featured a more abrasive, sample-heavy sound than its predecessor and contained many sexual innuendos in the lyrics which Virgin Records took objection to. Several speeches by Charles Manson were also mixed in between songs. Cabaret Voltaire were warned by their record label that {{they were required to}} have a charting single or face getting dropped, so the group subversively released a music video for the track [...] "I Want You" [...] which Richard H.

40|$|The law {{relevant}} to covenants {{has been described}} as a 2 ̆ 2 blundering conceptualist jungle full of semantic swamps 2 ̆ 2 which this chapter will attempt as far as possible to avoid. Covenants have always occupied an uncomfortable space in Australia based upon the limited ability to register these interests under the relevant Torrens <b>title</b> statutes. <b>Covenants</b> have been accommodated in many jurisdictions by permitting the notification of covenants. This situation has most likely resulted from the fact that the Torrens system was first developed at a time when the concept of covenants began to take shape after the impetus provided by Tulk v Moxhay in 1848. This has resulted in varied responses from different jurisdictions but generally these provisions have not adequately dealt with the difficulties that arise in the application of covenants under the Torrens system. These problems have in Queensland recently been made worse by the intrusion of concepts {{relevant to}} sustainable housing in relation to covenants which has not only cast further doubt on the already doubtful role of covenants in Queensland but has raised the level of complexity applying to these interests...|$|R

While Captain Jacob Branson and his wife Daniels prepare the ship, Security chief Dan Lopé signs a key member of his team, and together they seek to stop the technologically advanced saboteurs before anyone else is killed, and the ship itself is destroyed in orbit." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{land was}} {{sold by the}} company to George W. Miller, to whom a {{certificate}} of sale was given, which afterwards was assigned to Lewis Dunmeyer, to whom the company made a deed purporting to convey a good <b>title.</b> On this <b>covenant</b> for good <b>title</b> Dunmeyer brought the present action, alleging that the railroad company never had any title, and that the covenant was therefore broken. On this issue the case was tried. Several other defenses were set up, among them that the covenant was not broken, because Dunmeyer was in possession when he bought the certificate issued to Miller and when he took his deed, {{and has never been}} disturbed or ousted; that Miller was in possession when he bought of the company and transferred possession to Dunmeyer, and that this has been held ever since, and that Miller's purchase was a compromise of disputed rights, and he and Dunmeyer are therefore estopped to maintain this action. But these and perhaps other points, decided against plaintiff in error, do not present questions of federal law which this Court can review in a judgment of a state court.|$|R
5000|$|Before 1948, these {{covenants}} were legally {{used for}} segregationist purposes.In the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, covenants that restricted the sale or occupation of real property {{on the basis}} of race, ethnicity, religion or social class were common in the United States, where the primary intent was to keep [...] "white" [...] neighbourhoods [...] "white". Such covenants were employed by many real estate developers to [...] "protect" [...] entire subdivisions. The purpose of an exclusionary covenant was to prohibit a buyer of property from reselling, leasing or transferring the property to members of a given race, ethnic origin and/ or religion as specified in the <b>title</b> deed. Some <b>covenants,</b> such as those tied to properties in Forest Hills Gardens, New York, also sought to exclude working class people however this type of social segregation was more commonly achieved through the use of high property prices, minimum cost requirements and application reference checks. In practice, exclusionary covenants were most typically concerned with keeping out African-Americans, however restrictions against Asian-Americans, Jews and Catholics were not uncommon. For example, the Lake Shore Club District in Pennsylvania, sought to exclude various minorities including Negro, Mongolian, Hungarian, Mexican, Greek and various European immigrants. Cities known for their widespread use of racial covenants include Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles, and St. Louis.|$|R
