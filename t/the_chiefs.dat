5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>chiefs</b> {{respected}} Atangana {{as their}} spokesman and leader, and the Beti at large deferred to him prestige and power. A {{new system of}} status had evolved under his rule: a cadre of minor bureaucrats, envoys, interpreters, and office staff worked for Atangana and the other chiefs independent of the French government and were completely dependent on <b>the</b> <b>chiefs.</b> Atangana set up a private police force, for example, known as the fulus in Ewondo. The entire class recognised its reliance on <b>the</b> <b>chiefs</b> and gave them loyalty in exchange for protection and pay, and <b>the</b> <b>chiefs</b> relied on these functionaries to swiftly fulfill their duties to the French regime.|$|E
