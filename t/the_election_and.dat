40|$|The written work {{deals with}} <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>and</b> electoral system in {{communist}} Czechoslovakia after 1968. The work compares <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>and</b> electoral system, {{on the one}} hand, how it was proclaimed by the Communist Party {{and on the other}} hand, how <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> were done in reality. It shows that <b>the</b> democratic <b>elections</b> in Czechoslovakia, generally known as a democratic symbol of the people's will, had no right on this title. The first part describes the Representative bodies, the parties and the party system of communist regime. The main part is focused on <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>and</b> electoral system, on the principles of electoral system and how these principles were broken. The final part describes the extinction of mandate, <b>the</b> complementary <b>elections</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> polling programs. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} best to keep his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, won <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E

5|$|As a {{young lawyer}} Chelvanayakam was not {{involved}} in politics but when the ACTC was established in 1944 he became one of its principal organisers. Ponnambalam was the ACTC's president and Chelvanayakam was effectively his deputy. Chelvanayakam was part of the delegation, led by Ponnambalam, to the Soulbury Commission which argued unsuccessfully for balanced representation. Chelvanayakam stood as the ACTC candidate for Kankesanthurai in the 1947 parliamentary election. He won <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>and</b> entered Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Born near Glasgow, Reid {{worked a}} number of jobs as a young adult—including wholesaler, army medic (during the Second Boer War), farmhand, lumberjack, and dentist—and immigrated to Canada in 1903. He {{involved}} himself in local politics and joined the recently formed UFA, which nominated him {{to run in the}} 1921 provincial election as its candidate in Vermilion. The UFA won <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> Reid served in several capacities in the cabinets of Premiers Herbert Greenfield and John Edward Brownlee, where he established a reputation for competence and fiscal conservatism. When a sex scandal forced Brownlee from office in 1934, Reid was the caucus' unanimous choice to succeed him as Premier.|$|E

He also co-founded the Kentucky Statesman, a semi-weekly Democratic newspaper, and visited his cousin, Mary Todd, where he met her husband, Abraham Lincoln, for the first time; despite their political differences, they became friends.|$|E

On 6 April 2010 Brown went to Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament on 12 April in preparation for a general election. In a live press conference at Downing Street, Brown announced the election would be held on 6 May. The time between the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>and</b> the dissolution of Parliament, known as wash-up, was to allow for the handling of any unfinished legislative business before the Parliamentary session's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{chose not}} to stand for the House of Commons in the 1930 federal election, citing health reasons. The Conservatives gained a {{majority}} in <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> party leader R. B. Bennett became Prime Minister. Diefenbaker continued a high-profile legal practice, and in 1933, ran for mayor of Prince Albert. He was defeated by 48 votes in an election in which over 2,000 ballots were cast.|$|E
5|$|Facts were {{overwhelmed}} with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped {{up to the}} bursting point. But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of <b>the</b> <b>election...</b> <b>and</b> many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic fervour... Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E

Tracy and People ex rel. Waldron v. Soper, and his successor, Seth Wakeman (18501855) filed the complaint in New York ex rel. Cutler v. Dibble. Although Martindale was district attorney when the complaint in Tracy was filed, he lost <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>and</b> attempted to litigate the mandamus issue as a private attorney.|$|E

Facing the possibility of jail and the overall humiliation and disgrace, she pours herself a glass of wine (in the original series, her favorite tipple was Vodka). Yet, before she can drink it J.R. and John Ross arrive, with J.R. vowing to make things right by her and reminding her that she is a strong woman. After they leave she dumps out the wine and instead seeks comfort in Ann. J.R. through means of blackmail is able to get the charges dropped and after thanking him, Sue Ellen invites him in for tea, a spark of their past romance being seemingly reignited. Later she comes to the aid of John Ross and helps him in securing control of the newly established Ewing Energies, by pushing his ex-girlfriend Elena Ramos out of the company. Despite pleas from Bobby, Ann, and Christopher she does so.|$|E

5|$|Long was {{promoted}} {{as a potential}} vice presidential candidate by the Massachusetts delegation to the 1900 Republican National Convention, and was a personal favorite of McKinley's for the position. However, party leaders objected to him on geographic grounds, and Lodge (with whom Long continued to feud) disingenuously wore a Long banner, even though he supported Roosevelt, who easily won the nomination. The McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> Long decided to stay on for McKinley's second term.|$|E
5|$|Low {{challenged}} the Prime Minister over the Suez issue, {{accusing him of}} sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to back off the invasion and so gave the Soviets {{the opportunity for a}} military buildup in Egypt. St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence to any of the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth. Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge, and selected the only living former Prime Minister, Tory Arthur Meighen, but the matter was not resolved before <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> <b>and</b> Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election's aftermath.|$|E
