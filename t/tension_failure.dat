40|$|The {{concept of}} G 2 c {{as a measure}} of the interlaminar shear {{fracture}} toughness of a composite material is critically examined. In particular, it is argued that the apparent G 2 c as typically measured is inconsistent with the original definition of shear fracture. It is shown that interlaminar shear failure actually consists of <b>tension</b> <b>failures</b> in the resin rich layers between plies followed by the coalescence of ligaments created by these failures and not the sliding of two planes relative to one another that is assumed in fracture mechanics theory. Several strain energy release rate solutions are reviewed for delamination in composite laminates and structural components where failures have been experimentally documented. Failures typically occur at a location where the mode 1 component accounts for at least one half of the total G at failure. Hence, it is the mode I and mixed-mode interlaminar fracture toughness data that will be most useful in predicting delamination failure in composite components in service. Although apparent G 2 c measurements may prove useful for completeness of generating mixed-mode criteria, the accuracy of these measurements may have very little influence on the prediction of mixed-mode failures in most structural components...|$|R

40|$|The rock {{masses in}} a {{construction}} site of underground cavern are generally not continuum due {{to the presence of}} discontinuities, such as bedding, joints, faults and fractures. The performance of an underground cavern is principally ruled by the mechanical behaviors of the discontinuities {{in the vicinity of the}} cavern. A number of experimental and numerical investigations have demonstrated the significant influences of discontinuities on the mechanical, thermal and hydraulic behaviors of discontinuous rock masses, indicating that the deformation mechanism and stability of rock structures in the discontinuous rock masses depend not only on the existing discontinuities but also the new cracks generated and thereafter keep propagating due mainly to the stress redistribution induced by excavation. In this study, an Expanded Distinct Element Method (EDEM) was developed for simulating the crack generation and propagation due to the shear and <b>tension</b> <b>failures</b> in the matrix rock blocks. Using this method, excavation simulations of deep underground caverns have been carried out on the models with differing depths of cavern and differing geometrical distributions of the existing discontinuities.

40|$|How to quantitatively {{evaluate}} the permeability change of coalbed subjected to liquid nitrogen cooling {{is a key}} issue of enhanced-permeability technology of coalbed. To analyze the evolution process of permeability of coupled coal deformation, failure and liquid introgen cooling, the coal is supposed as elastic, brittle and plastic material. Its deformation process includes elastic deformation stage, brittle strength degradation stage and residual plastic flow stage. Combined with strength degradation index, dilatancy index of the element and Mohr-Column strength criterion, the element scale constitutive model {{with the effects of}} confining pressure on peak-post mechanical behaviors is built. Based on the deformation process of coal rock, there exist two stages of permeability evolution of the element including decrease of permeability due to elastic contraction and increase due to coal rock element's failure. The relationships between the permeability and elastic deformation, shear failure and <b>tension</b> <b>failure</b> for coal are studied. The permeability will be influenced by the change of pore space due to elastic contraction or tension of element. Conjugate shear zones appear during the shear failure of the element, in which the flow follows so-called cubic law between smooth parallel plates. The calculation formulas of the permeability and the aperture of the fractures are given out based on the volumetric strain. When <b>tension</b> <b>failure</b> criterion is satisfied with the rock element fails and two orthogonal fractures appear. The calculation formulas of the permeability and the width of the fractures are given out based on the volumetric strain. Further, combined with the thermal conduction theory the permeability evolution model of coupled coal deformation, failure and liquid nitrogen cooling is presented. Then Fish function method in FLAC is employed to perform the model. The permeability's evolution process for coal bed cryogenically stimulated by flowing liquid nitrogen through gas production well in Wangyingzi mine, Liaoning province, is simulated and the results include: 1) When liquid nitrogen(LN 2) is injected into a rock at warm reservoir temperature, heat from the rock will quickly transfer to the liquid nitrogen resulting in rapid cooling and contraction of coal bed. The nearer the position is to bore hole, the bigger the shrinkage deformation and thermal stress and coal fail when tension stress sufficiently built up. In this paper the <b>tension</b> <b>failure</b> band after 10 days' LN 2 cooling is 0. 65 m. 2) In <b>tension</b> <b>failure</b> area the cracks from cooling stimulation lead to the significant growth of permeability. The maximum permeability for element is 1. 97 × 105 times more than that before cooling. 3) Apart from the bore hole, the thermal tensile stress leads to the growth of permeability at a rate of 1 %~ 14 %, far less than that in the <b>tension</b> <b>failure</b> area. 4) With increasing time the failure area gradually slowly grows up. It indicates that the longer cooling time does not mean better effects. 5) The cooling fracturing area is found to have a 1. 0 m band. In practical engineering the pressure in hole bore and phase transition of water also influences the deformation and failure of coal, which leads to much more failure zone of cooling. 6) The evolution process of permeability of coupled coal deformation, failure and liquid introgen cooling can be better reflected by the model in this paper. This study is hoped to provide a simple but reasonable description of the permeability evolution of rocks subject to liquid nitrogen cooling...|$|E

Failure of ACL reconstruction by recurrent laxity can be attributed to a variety of factors, including traumatic rein-jury, technical (surgical) error, unrecognized ligamentous injuries, or biologic factors. In addition, although stability may be restored, the reconstruction can still be termed a failure because the knee is stiff (defined by Johnson and Fu 17 as range of motion from 10 ° through 120 °) and painful. Subsequent deterioration of the meniscus and cartilage also can result in persistent complaints and an unsatisfactory outcome.
