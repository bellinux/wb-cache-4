5|$|Some {{animals of}} <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>north,</b> like the showshoe and Arctic hares, Arctic fox, stoat, and rock {{ptarmigan}} change their coat colour (by moulting and growing new fur or feathers) from brown or grey summer camouflage to {{white in the}} winter; the Arctic fox is the only species in the dog family to do so. However, Arctic hares which live in <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>north</b> of Canada, where summer is very short, remain white year-round. Since these animals in widely separated groups have evolved separately, the similarity of coloration is due to convergent evolution, on the presumption that natural selection favours a particular coloration in a particular environment.|$|E
5|$|The mounted {{police also}} {{purchased}} various boats for work along Canada's coasts and rivers. The Keewatin, a sailing vessel, was bought in 1890 {{for use on}} Lake Winnipeg, but it capsized later the same year. In 1902, the steamboat Vidette was acquired to transport the police along the Yukon River, supported by three launches. Redwing, a small steamer, was purchased for transport on Lake Winnipeg in 1905. The police had the Rouville steamer specially constructed for patrolling in <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>north</b> in 1906, but tests demonstrated it burnt through too much fuel, and it was never deployed. By 1919, however, the Victory, Duncan, Lady Borden and Chakawana motor vessels were patrolling <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>north</b> and the west coast.|$|E

5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax community in <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>north</b> {{of the northern}} hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>north</b> is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
