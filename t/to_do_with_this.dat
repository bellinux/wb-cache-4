What they intended <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> force is somewhat difficult for modern readers to determine. Since the Third Servile War was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion, no firsthand account of the slaves' motives and goals exists, and historians writing about the war propose contradictory theories.|$|E

In {{a review of the}} book, Dagbladet noted that because the author was writing both as a private individual and as a physician, [...] "he is trained to look at the familiar and intimate with professionalism and distance." [...] Upon the book's publication, representative Matthias Fosse of the Church of Scientology stated, [...] "Church of Scientology had absolutely nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> young woman's decision to take her own life.

A polygraph test on Guandique, administered on February 4, 2002, returned inconclusive results that were officially ruled [...] "not deceptive". Because neither {{the informant}} nor Guandique was fluent in English, D.C. chief detective Jack Barrett {{said that he}} would have preferred polygraph tests to have been administered by bilingual examiners, who were unavailable at the time. When Judge Noel Anketell Kramer was asked about Guandique's potential connection to the Levy homicide, she responded, [...] "This is such a satellite issue. To me it doesn't have anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> case." [...] Kramer sentenced Guandique to 10 years in prison for his attacks on two other women at Rock Creek Park. Guandique was sent to the U.S. Penitentiary, Big Sandy near Inez, Kentucky, and was later transferred to the U.S. Penitentiary at Victorville, California.|$|E

He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' {{for the last six}} months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Cruise himself addressed the allegations in an interview on ABC's Primetime in mid-April. When asked about whether he had been involved with stopping the rebroadcast on Comedy Central, Cruise stated, [...] "First of all, could you ever imagine sitting down with anyone? I would never sit down with someone and question them on their beliefs. Here's the thing: I'm really not even going to dignify this. I honestly didn't really even know about it. I'm working, making my movie, I've got my family. I'm busy. I don't spend my days going, 'What are people saying about me?'"

500|$|Crews began hanging {{the sign}} in May 2014. When Chicago Tribune {{architecture}} critic Kamin warned Trump that {{his review of}} the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded [...] "As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign", but architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying [...] "Just for the record, I had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> sign!". The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, [...] "Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign". Kamin has noted {{that part of the}} problem is the architectural traditions of the city: [...] "If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward". Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior Chicago Sun-Times building signage was via Twitter. As a result of the fiasco, Emanuel initiated a study on how to alter the rules to avert similar signage controversies in the future.|$|E

500|$|Music critic Henry Pleasants {{observes that}} [...] "Presley has been {{described}} variously as a baritone and a tenor. [...] An extraordinary compass... and a very wide range of vocal color have something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> divergence of opinion." [...] He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two octaves and a third, [...] "from the baritone low G to the tenor high B, with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a D-flat. [...] Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down." [...] In Pleasants' view, his voice was [...] "variable and unpredictable" [...] at the bottom, [...] "often brilliant" [...] at the top, with the capacity for [...] "full-voiced high Gs and As that an opera baritone might envy". [...] Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as 2¼ octaves, emphasizes that [...] "his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear." [...] Presley was always [...] "able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers," [...] writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.|$|E
500|$|... "Trapped in the Closet" [...] {{generated}} significant controversy. Tom Cruise, who {{is portrayed}} in the episode, reportedly threatened {{to back out of}} his promotional obligations for the Paramount Pictures film [...] if Viacom, the owner of both Comedy Central and Paramount, allowed a repeat of the episode to air. A publicist of Cruise denied this, saying [...] "Tom had nothing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> matter. He's been promoting 'Mission: Impossible III' for the last six months. We have no clue where this came from." [...] Though the episode was originally scheduled for rebroadcast on March 15, 2006, the episode [...] "Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls" [...] was shown instead. Comedy Central representatives stated this change was made as a tribute to Isaac Hayes, but South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone thought otherwise; they issued a satirical statement saying they (Parker and Stone) were [...] "servants of the dark lord Xenu". Hayes, the voice of staple character Chef, asked to be released from his contract shortly {{before the start of the}} tenth season. The reason for his departure, as reported by Stone, was due to his membership in Scientology and this episode, which Hayes—despite initially supporting the show's satirical take on several talk shows—claimed was very offensive. The episode has since been rebroadcast on Comedy Central multiple times.|$|E
500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest thing to happen to me in my life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it would work out great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If someone asked me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, I would tell them Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had.
