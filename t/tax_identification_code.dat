30|$|Since {{the rental}} market is {{predominantly}} informal and {{the purchase of}} housing in attractive areas is usually too expensive, migrants most often do not have grounds to officially register at the new location. Individuals actually living at a particular address but {{who are unable to}} register may be prevented from access to public services. Although legally, residency is not a requirement for basic public services such as education and health care, many people still think this is the case, maybe due to the discretionary enforcement of the law or simple misinformation. However, this is a serious barrier for private entrepreneurs, voters, applicants to social assistance and housing subsidy, citizens willing to get some official document such as a driver license, <b>tax</b> <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> certificate, and so on because all procedures are tied to the official place of residence according to registration and the respective local office (tax administration, voting district, social assistance department, traffic police etc.).|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{ordinary}} <b>identification</b> <b>coding,</b> a code is devised to identify a single object among $N$ objects. But, in this paper, we consider an <b>identification</b> <b>coding</b> problem to identify $K$ objects at once among $N$ objects in the both cases that $K$ objects are ranked or not ranked. By combining Kurosawa-Yoshida scheme with Moulin-Koetter scheme, an efficient <b>identification</b> <b>coding</b> scheme is proposed, which can attain high coding rate and error exponents compared with the case that an ordinary <b>identification</b> <b>code</b> is used $K$ times. Furthermore, the achievable triplet of rate and error exponents of type I and type II decoding error probabilities are derived for the proposed coding scheme.
