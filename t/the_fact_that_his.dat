5|$|Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen {{created his}} own version of the TV show with a collie named Bessy in 1954. Apart from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> comic strip starred the same dog breed with a similar name it {{had little to do with}} the series overall, since the comic was a western comic.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi's {{exposure}} to motorsport started at around 3 {{years of age}} through karting and was facilitated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> father owned a kart track. Since age 17, Bianchi was professionally managed by Nicolas Todt.|$|E
5|$|Corzine {{campaigned for}} state {{government}} programs including universal health care, universal gun registration, mandatory public preschool, and more taxpayer funding for college education. He pushed {{affirmative action and}} same-sex marriage. David Brooks opined that Corzine was so liberal that his election, although <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> predecessor was also a Democrat, helped push the Senate to the left.|$|E
50|$|Ulrich III {{was born}} around 1310, as {{the eldest son}} of Ulrich II of Hanau and his wife, Agnes of Hohenlohe-Weikersheim. The year of his birth is {{inferred}} from <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> parents married in 1310, and that Ulrich III was considered old enough to marry in 1327.|$|R

5|$|Finally, {{yet another}} brother, {{possibly}} younger than Nyuserre {{has also been}} proposed: Iryenre, a prince Iry-pat whose relationship is suggested by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having {{taken place in the}} temple of Khentkaus II.|$|E
5|$|Lisa Kudrow as Karen Burton (Will's {{single parent}} mother). She is {{concerned}} with Will's involvement with other kids at school because they pick on him due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> dad was sent to prison. She is a good mom and tries {{to protect him from}} the likes of Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|Quentin Tarantino as Himself (Extended version): In a short {{appearance}} with Kermit the Frog, Tarantino discusses violent {{ideas on}} how to stop the Wicked Witch of the West. Despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> role is small, his name is still mentioned in the movie trailer and listed on the cover of both the Video and DVD.|$|E
50|$|Falstaff here is lamenting <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> because <b>his</b> name is so terrifying, enemies avoid {{fighting}} him. This {{is obviously}} bomphiologia on Falstaff's part.|$|R
60|$|Teddy {{almost forgot}} <b>the</b> terrible <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> Uncle Nathan might yet have him arrested, and Sam {{acted as if}} such a thing had never been possible.|$|R
50|$|During the 19th century, Nietzsche was {{frequently}} associated with anarchist movements, {{in spite of}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> writings he definitely holds a negative view of egalitarian anarchists.|$|R
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of the year 2012, Nostradamus's prophecies started to be co-opted (especially by the History Channel) as {{evidence}} suggesting {{that the end of the}} world was imminent, notwithstanding <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> book never mentions the end of the world, let alone the year 2012.|$|E
5|$|According to Taylor, Russell {{discounted}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{career was}} facilitated by white {{people who were}} proven anti-racists, namely his white high school coach George Powles (the person who encouraged him to play basketball), his white college coach Phil Woolpert (who integrated USF basketball), white Celtics coach Red Auerbach (who is regarded as an anti-racist pioneer and made him the first black NBA coach), and white Celtics owner Walter A. Brown, who gave him a high $24,000 rookie contract, just $1,000 shy of the top earning veteran Bob Cousy.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Colorado, McDonald {{found himself}} at the centre of another power struggle. Sympathetic to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> wife was {{less than two weeks}} away from giving birth, head coach Don Cherry gave McDonald {{permission}} to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager Ray Miron, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season. On the ice, McDonald scored 35goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} Chester had grasped <b>the</b> {{wonderful}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> troubles were ended--for a while, at least. He raised {{himself up on}} one arm and looked gratefully at Miss Salome.|$|R
25|$|Kim was {{tortured}} {{and sentenced to}} death. According to 'Baekbeom Ilji', however, many Korean people were sympathetic and admired him for his patriotism and bravery, as shown by <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> execution was suspended by order of Emperor Gwangmu, that Korean judicial officials behaved politely to him despite Japanese pressure to execute him promptly, and that influential Koreans at the time (including major merchants of Incheon) made efforts to rescue him by repeated petitions to Korean Justice Department Officials and by collecting money for his ransom before his scheduled execution date.|$|R
60|$|Belllounds {{stroked his}} grizzled beard and {{regarded}} his son with mingled pride and doubt. Not at this moment, most assuredly, could he {{get away from}} <b>the</b> wonderful <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> only son was home.|$|R
5|$|As word {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> {{eight years as}} governor may be nullified by its distance in time and that his visibility in the Senate was low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may {{be more inclined to}} line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|At Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy grows {{jealous of}} Tyrion after his {{favorite}} prostitute Ros taunts {{him with the}} judgment that Tyrion is a better lover and from a richer family.

To cheer him up, Maester Luwin decides to teach Bran the Dothraki art of horseback archery.|$|E
5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941â€“ August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> killers were acquitted {{drew attention to the}} long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} abruptly, to conceal <b>the</b> too-revealing <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> limbs were shaking. He pulled a {{handkerchief}} {{from his pocket}} to mop his brow, which had grown damp. And then, quite suddenly, he found himself weeping.|$|R
60|$|Captain Sellers {{left with}} flags flying and drums beating three days later. To friends and {{neighbours}} generally he confided <b>the</b> interesting <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> departure was hastened by a nightly recurring {{dream of being}} bitten by sharks.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, in a Brooklyn apartment, Vietnam veteran Henry Willig is {{approached}} by a fellow ex-Marine, Augustus Cole. Suddenly a group of wounded Vietnamese appear and gun him down. Examining his corpse, Mulder and Krycek find a scar on his neck and realize {{he was in the}} Special Forces stationed in Vietnam in 1970, and one of only two survivors, the other being Cole. They head to the VHA hospital in New Jersey where they discover that Cole was discharged, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> doctor does not remember doing so.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was born}} in Hemel Hempstead, but {{grew up in the}} Monkwick {{district}} of Colchester, where his family still lived as of 2004. He attended The Stanway School in the town. At the age of 17 he joined Ipswich Town as a trainee. At around the same time he was called up to represent Northern Ireland at under-18 level, qualifying by virtue of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> maternal grandfather {{was born in}} the country.|$|E
5|$|Six of {{the dead}} were not wearing seat belts, while a seventh was not {{properly}} restrained. Greg Sypher, a collision analyst and principal Transport Canada investigator, later suggested that seat belts most likely would not have saved all the victims' lives. Randy Arseneau credits <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> son, Bradd Arseneau, was not wearing his seatbelt for Bradd's survival, saying that if Bradd had not been thrown to the floor just before the collision he may also have died.|$|E
5000|$|His {{position}} as patriarch of Venice was unique in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> both <b>his</b> predecessor {{and his successor}} became pope. His successor as patriarch was Albino Luciani, who was elected Pope John Paul I in August 1978.|$|R
50|$|Also {{unusual is}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Sullivan {{includes}} <b>his</b> {{name in the}} tile mosaic over the front door.|$|R
2500|$|Miller {{was elected}} Governor of Delaware in 1912 by {{defeating}} Thomas M. Monaghan, the Democratic Party candidate. 1912 was a Democratic sweep, except for Miller's narrow victory, perhaps attributed to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Monaghan, <b>his</b> opponent, was a Roman Catholic.|$|R
5|$|Some sources {{assert that}} Mickiewicz's mother was descended from a converted, Frankist Jewish family. Others {{view this as}} improbable. Polish {{historian}} Kazimierz Wyka, in his biographic entry in Polski SÅ‚ownik Biograficzny (1975) writes that this hypothesis, based on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> mother's maiden name, Majewska, was popular among Frankist Jews, has not been proven. Wyka states that poet's mother {{was the daughter of}} a noble (szlachta) family of StarykoÅ„ coat of arms, living on an estate at CzombrÃ³w in NowogrÃ³dek Voivodeship (Navahrudak Voivodeship).|$|E
5|$|The {{democratic}} party gradually became dominant in Athenian politics, and Pericles seemed willing {{to follow a}} populist policy in order to cajole the public. According to Aristotle, Pericles' stance {{can be explained by}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> principal political opponent, Cimon, was both rich and generous, and was able to gain public favor by lavishly handing out portions of his sizable personal fortune. The historian Loren J. Samons II argues, however, that Pericles had enough resources to make a political mark by private means, had he so chosen.|$|E
5|$|United Abominations was {{recorded}} in 2006 at SARM Hook End Studios, London, England; the Steakhouse, Studio City, California; Big Fish Encinitas, California and Backstage Productions. Additional overdubs were recorded at S.I.R. rehearsal studio, Hollywood, California and Mustaine Music, Fallbrook, California. Most of the record was tracked in England because Mustaine admired <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> favorite band, Led Zeppelin, previously recorded there many times. Mustaine produced the album, with additional production handled by Jeff Balding and Andy Sneap.|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} {{of the name of}} Jesus in the New Testament is underscored by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in <b>his</b> Nativity account Matthew pays more attention to the name of the child and its theological implications than the actual birth event itself.|$|R

5000|$|Just {{three days}} after the events of Messiah Complex, Nezhno decided to head back to his homeland, Wakanda. He was {{relieved}} to be free of the pestering of his former classmates, saying that they [...] "nearly destroyed him with their insanity". During his return however, he found himself ostracized not only by his fellow Wakandans, but also by his own mother - due to <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>his</b> biological father was Russian, and therefore he is only seen as an outsider to his people. He then reflects that the only people who accepted him were the New X-Men, and he regrets having pushed them away.|$|R
