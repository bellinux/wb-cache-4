They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
2500|$|Lucas rarely {{spoke to}} the actors, who felt that he {{expected}} too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words [...] "faster" [...] and [...] "more intense". Kurtz stated that [...] "it happened a lot where he would just say, 'Let's try it again a little bit faster.' That was about the only instruction he'd give anybody. A lot of actors don't mind—they don't care, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> on with it. But some actors really {{need a lot of}} pampering and a lot of feedback, and if they don't get it, they get paranoid that they might not be doing a good job." [...] Kurtz has said that Lucas [...] "wasn't gregarious, he's very much a loner and very shy, so he didn't like large groups of people, he didn't like working with a large crew, he didn't like working with a lot of actors." ...|$|E

Perhaps he will tell me more than he would you; he knows what poor creatures men are. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> frighted out of what wits they've got, if you let on any one's bad; but I will get it out of him.

The Indians told me he gave poor Four Eyes an awful talking to. Then there were Tristan and Iseult--two Iseults. It was very sad. But I should like to love that way. Do all the young {{men and women in the}} world do that? They do not here. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>get</b> married. They do not seem to have time. I am English, and I will never marry an Indian--would you? That is why I have not lighted my maiden's fire. Some of the young men are bothering father to make me do it. Libash is one of them. He is a great hunter. And Mahkook comes around singing songs. He is funny. To-night, if you come by my tent after dark, you will hear him singing out in the cold. But father says I can do as I please, and so I shall not light my fire. You see, when a girl makes up her mind to get married, that is the way she lets young men know. Four Eyes always said it was a fine custom. But I noticed he never took a wife. Maybe he was too old. He did not have much hair, but I do not think he was really very old. And how do you know when you are in love?--like Paolo and Francesca, I mean." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{like their}} chaotic {{acceptance}} of life, {{and the fact}} that they don't do what they are told by authority if they think it is wrong.

They are remarkably accepting of other people, I think because they are so strong as a unit. They are also a family which becomes separated by circumstances- and I wanted to show that families can still be close to each other and care for each other even though they live apart. The family relationships develop as the books progress, and are central to the story.|$|E

5000|$|How {{and where}} the band {{launched}} their career in earnest {{is an important part}} of their story. They initially took their music outside the USA, as part of a strategy conceived by legendary manager Doc McGhee. [...] "If you look at the history of people like Amy Winehouse, Duffy, or James Blunt, they came America first and didn't make it. Then, they went back over to England, and blew up. We just decided to go to Europe first, and when they were accepted there, we would have a story to share here. That's basically what happened."McGhee wanted to get them in front of as many people as possible, and the strategy worked. [...] "It was pretty simple.
