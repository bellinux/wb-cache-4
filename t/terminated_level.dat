40|$|Distributed {{temperature}} sensing {{based on}} time-correlated two-photon excited fluorescence (TPF) in doped fibre is described. Counter-propagating laser pulses generate a TPF flash {{at the position}} of overlap which is scanned along the fibre by a variable relative time delay. The flash is detected and analysed at one end. With the fluorescence power being completely independent of excitation pulse duration and temporal profile, the sensor does not require ultrashort excitation pulses for operation.

TPF is reported in bulk glass doped with rare earths and in doped single-mode fibre.

40|$|In {{performing}} neuraxial procedures, {{knowledge of}} {{the location of the}} conus medullaris in patients of all ages is important. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the location of conus medullaris in a sample of newborn/infant cadavers and sagittal MRIs of children, adolescents and young adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects of both the samples were subdivided into four developmental stages. No statistical difference was seen between the three older age groups (p> 0. 05). A significant difference was evident when the newborn/infant stage was compared with the other, older stages (p< 0. 001 for all comparisons). RESULTS: In the newborn/infant group the spinal cord terminated most frequently at the level of L 2 /L 3 (16 %). In the childhood stage, the spinal cord <b>terminated</b> at the <b>levels</b> of T 12 /L 1 and the lower third of L 1 (21 %). In the adolescent population, it was most often found at the level of the middle third of L 1 and L 1 /L 2 (19 %). Finally, in the young adult group, the spinal cord <b>terminated</b> at the <b>level</b> of L 1 /L 2 (25 %). This study confirmed the different level of spinal cord termination between newborns/infants less than one year old and subjects older than one year. In this sample the conus medullaris was not found caudal to the L 3 vertebral body, which is more cranial than the prescribed level of needle insertion recommended for lumbar neuraxial procedures. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that the exact level of spinal cord termination should be determined prior to attempting lumbar neuraxial procedures in newborns or infants. [URL]...|$|R
