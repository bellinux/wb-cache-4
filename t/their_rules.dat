5|$|By the 1850s {{there were}} several {{versions}} of football played in public schools and clubs throughout England. Each school played by their own code despite an attempt by Cambridge University to unify them in 1848. <b>Their</b> <b>rules</b> were generally inaccessible outside of the schools. There the football tended to be unorganised and fairly lawless games known as mob football. Although there are matches between small, equal numbered teams it remained a minority sport until the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose about whether the blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed <b>their</b> <b>rules</b> to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E
50|$|During the Kadambas reign, {{the rule}} of Mayurasharma (325-345 A.D.) and that of Kakusthavarma (405-430 A.D.) were prominent. <b>Their</b> <b>rule</b> was {{confined}} up to {{the southern part of}} Bidar district. Kadambas extended their patronage to Shaiva, Vaishnava and Jaina dharmas. <b>Their</b> <b>rule</b> lasted for over 200 years.|$|R

5|$|Verified status {{does not}} imply that Twitter {{continuously}} checks whether such accounts have been hacked. The account of Tesla Motors, for example, was impersonated briefly in 2015. Some users have tried to impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images. Twitter referred to this as a breach of <b>their</b> <b>rules</b> and introduced a design update to make this more difficult. In July 2016, Twitter began allowing anyone to apply for a verified account. The company announced that they will disable the verification progress in response to an outlash after white nationalist Jason Kessler got verified on Twitter.|$|E
5|$|With the victory, the White Sox {{earned their}} first playoff berth since their {{win in the}} 2005 World Series. However, they lost to the {{eventual}} pennant-winning Tampa Bay Rays, 3 games to 1. Statistically, the game counted as the 163rd regular season game. Thome's home run, for example, was his 34th of the season. This total brought him a tie for fourth most in the league. Danks lowered his earned run average from 3.47 to 3.32 in the game, which moved him from a tie for tenth-best in the league with Zack Greinke to fifth place. Mauer, Morneau, and White Sox outfielder Carlos Quentin won Silver Slugger Awards for their offensive performances in the 2008 regular season. Mauer also won a Rawlings Gold Glove Award that year. This was the last tie-breaker with home field determined by a coin flip. Following the 2008 season MLB amended <b>their</b> <b>rules,</b> leaving future tie-breaker sites to be determined {{on a series of}} performance-based criteria beginning with the head-to-head record between the teams.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the clues}} had changes to <b>their</b> <b>rules.</b> The Detour and Roadblock retain <b>their</b> <b>rules,</b> {{although}} there is no limit on individual Roadblocks. Fast Forwards appear in the race, but they are not optional. Instead, the team that completes it fastest gets a two-hour time credit. Also featured alongside the Detour and Roadblock is the Intersection. However, the Intersection's rules are drastically different. It is a task that all teams complete, similar to an additional task on the real race.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary writers {{observed}} that the Greeks {{were among the most}} temperate of ancient peoples. This appears to result from <b>their</b> <b>rules</b> stressing moderate drinking, their praise of temperance, and their avoidance of excess in general.

25|$|There {{are other}} aspects as well which they share: the {{similarities}} of <b>their</b> <b>rules</b> of life, a missionary commitment, an insistence on certain human virtues (openness, simplicity, warmth), {{a balance of}} the three constitutive elements of religious life (prayer, community, and apostolate), emphasis on co-responsibility in governance, collaboration with the laity, {{and the importance of}} belonging to an international family.|$|E

To both neutralize threats to <b>their</b> <b>rule</b> and solicit cooperation, some dictators coopt potential domestic opposition by providing rents and policy concessions within nominally-democratic institutions, such as legislatures and political parties. These institutions, designed as instruments of cooptation, facilitate cooperation between the regime and outside groups which promotes economic growth...|$|R

25|$|In the end, after {{a number}} of large demutualisations, and {{pressure}} from carpetbaggers moving from one building society to another to cream off the windfalls, most of the societies whose management wished to keep them mutual modified <b>their</b> <b>rules</b> of membership in the late 1990s. The method usually adopted were membership rules to ensure that anyone newly joining a society would, for the first few years, be unable to get any profit out of a demutualisation.
