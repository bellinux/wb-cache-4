5|$|On Earth, thorium {{is not a}} rare element as was {{previously}} thought, having a crustal abundance {{comparable to that of}} lead and molybdenum, <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> arsenic, and three times that of tin. Thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals. Soil normally contains about 6 ppm of thorium.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of deuterium in comet Hale–Bopp {{in the form}} of heavy water was found to be about <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Earth's oceans. If Hale–Bopp's deuterium abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth, they cannot be the only source.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} {{relatively}} large, seating 850. It is {{built in the}} Venetian Gothic style, and divided into a five-bay nave, transepts, chancel, morning chapel and organ chamber. Although Plumbe's original design envisaged a tower, none was ever built. By 1900, St Mark's was reported as having a congregation <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> any other church in Wood Green.|$|E

5|$|As of 2007, the brewing {{industry}} is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. As of 2006, more than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons), {{the equivalent of a}} cube 510 metres on a side, of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion). In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectolitres (45 billion litres), or nearly <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the United States, but only 5 per cent sold were premium draught beers, compared with 50 per cent in France and Germany.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E
5|$|England's bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling at speeds of around 150km/h at the heads and torsoes of the Australian batsmen—including Woodfull—and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended {{away from the}} upper body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. England devised the tactics {{in an attempt to}} curb Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman, whose average hovered around 100, around <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> all other world-class batsman. However, they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen, Woodfull among them, through such means.|$|E

5|$|Following Malvern's new-found fame as a spa {{and area}} of natural beauty, and fully {{exploiting}} its new rail connections, factories {{from as far}} as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> other lines– that were exploiting the tourism industry, and demanded a limitation {{to the number of}} excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E
5|$|Lead's {{close-packed}} face-centered cubic {{structure and}} high atomic weight {{result in a}} density of 11.34g/cm3, which is {{greater than that of}} common metals such as iron (7.87g/cm3), copper (8.93g/cm3), and zinc (7.14g/cm3). This density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon. Some rarer metals are denser: tungsten and gold are both 19.3g/cm3, and osmium—the densest metal known—has a density of 22.59g/cm3, almost <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> lead.|$|E
5|$|Lithium's {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion is <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> aluminium and almost {{four times that}} of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E

50|$|Overall, however, {{engineering}} {{is said to}} remain a highly gender-stratified occupation. Among the engineers currently employed, men substantially outnumber women. On average, men are also said to hold higher supervisory and management positions than females, whose promotion prospects are usually more limited. This reason, family and child obligations, and layoffs combined to account for a drop-out rate of approximately 20% among all female engineers from 1982-1990—a statistic over <b>twice</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> men.|$|R
5|$|Osmium {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in the ultraviolet {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å osmium has a reflectivity <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but {{it soon became clear}} that the oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E
5|$|Some 110,000 {{people live}} in the Saw Mill River's watershed, in {{communities}} varying from small villages to Yonkers, New York's fourth-largest city. This is 12% of the county's total, on 6% of its area. The watershed's population density varies from 1,000 per square mile around the headwaters at Chappaqua to 10,000 around the mouth. It averages to 4,151 per square mile, <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the county and ten times the density for the state.|$|E
5|$|The Australian cricket team toured England in 1930. Australia won the five-Test series 2–1, and Donald Bradman scored 974 runs at a {{batting average}} of 139.14, an {{aggregate}} record that still stands in 2017. By {{the time of}} the next Ashes series of 1932–33, Bradman's average hovered around 100, approximately <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> all other world-class batsmen. The English cricket authorities felt that new tactics would be required to prevent Bradman being even more successful on Australian pitches; some critics believed that Bradman could be dismissed by leg-spin as Walter Robins and Ian Peebles had supposedly caused him problems; two leg-spinners were included in the English touring party of 1932–33.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women {{are far more likely}} to be the primary caregivers of adult family members with depression, so that they bear both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E
5|$|Through {{most of the}} Archean Eon, the Earth had a heat {{production}} at least <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the present, which caused tectonic processes to be more active. As a result, plates and continents were smaller. No broad blocks as old as 3Ga are found in Precambrian shields. Toward {{the end of the}} Archean, however, some of these blocks or terranes came together to form larger blocks welded together by greenstone belts.|$|E
5|$|WASP-43b is a transiting {{planet in}} orbit around the young, active, and low-mass star WASP-43 in the {{constellation}} Sextans. The planet is a Hot Jupiter with a mass <b>twice</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, but with a roughly equal radius. WASP-43b was flagged as a candidate by the SuperWASP program before they conducted follow-ups using instruments at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which confirmed its existence and provided orbital and physical characteristics. The planet's discovery was published on April 14, 2011.|$|E
