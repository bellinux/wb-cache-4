In this study, the authors determined {{the reliability and validity of}} <b>time</b> <b>use</b> <b>surveys</b> for assessing sedentary and physical activity behavior. In 2006 and 2007, participants (n = 134) were recruited from work sites in the Australian state of New South Wales. Participants completed a 2 -day <b>time</b> <b>use</b> diary twice, 7 days apart, and wore an accelerometer. The 2 diaries were compared for test-retest reliability, and comparison with the accelerometer determined concurrent validity. Participants with similar activity patterns during the 2 diary periods showed reliability intraclass correlations of 0. 74 and 0. 73 for nonoccupational sedentary behavior and moderate/vigorous physical activity, respectively. Comparison of the diary with the accelerometer showed Spearman correlations of 0. 57 - 0. 59 and 0. 45 - 0. 69 for nonoccupational sedentary behavior and moderate/vigorous physical activity, respectively. <b>Time</b> <b>use</b> <b>surveys</b> appear to be more valid for population surveillance of nonoccupational sedentary behavior and health-enhancing physical activity than more traditional surveillance systems.

How do their contributions {{relate to the}} <b>time</b> <b>use</b> of their mothers and fathers and the tasks that need to get done? How do young people&# 039;s notions of duty and entitlement affect social divisions of labour, the viability of particular demographic strategies, and theorisations of what counts as &# 039;work&# 039; more generally? Large and sophisticated <b>time</b> <b>use</b> <b>surveys,</b> such as those conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) in 1992, 1997 and 2006, provide an invaluable source of quantitative information regarding these issues. In this paper, we present some of the findings they provide about three samples of 15 - 19 year olds living in single-family households.

50|$|Gross {{household}} {{product is}} a specific estimation of the economic value added by the unpaid work and capital of households. It does not include many of the additional factors typically included in GPI determinations but focuses specifically on the “household economy.” Duncan Ironmonger defines a country's Gross Economic Product as comprising both the Gross Market Product (typically defined as GDP) and Gross Household Product. Using one of the same time use surveys as the BEA study referenced above (the American <b>Time</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Survey),</b> Ironmonger estimates the USA's 2011 GHP at 11.6 trillion dollars (as compared to a GDP of 13.3 trillion).|$|E

She expanded coverage of the prices of services in the Producer Price Index; instituted improvements in the Current Employment Statistics, including the substitution of a probability sample for the quota sample; accelerated delivery of employment and wage statistics; and took steps toward expanding coverage of wages and salaries in the Occupational Employment Statistics program.|$|E

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used method for measuring unpaid domestic labor is through the collection of time-use surveys. These surveys attempt to evaluate how much time is spent providing different services, such as {{time spent in the}} workforce versus time spent on unpaid domestic work, such as cooking. Sarah Gammage conducted time use surveys in Guatemala to measure time spent doing unpaid domestic work within households and between family members. In this study, Gammage found women completed approximately 70% of all unpaid domestic work within a household. Similarly, Debbie Budlenger conducted time use surveys across six different countries and found women in each country conducted the majority of the unpaid domestic work each day. The results of her findings are summarized in the chart below: In a different <b>time</b> <b>use</b> <b>survey,</b> Liangshu Qi and Xiao-yuan Dong found that, in China men complete an average of 58 minutes of unpaid work a day compared to the 139 minutes of unpaid work a day that women complete.|$|E

30|$|Typically, <b>time</b> <b>use</b> <b>surveys</b> {{are based}} on daily diaries of individuals. <b>Time</b> <b>use</b> diaries refer to a  24 -hour period of a specific day in the week. Respondents are asked to record all their {{activities}} (usually in 10  minutes time intervals), possibly distinguishing between primary and secondary activities when they are carried out contemporaneously. If an activity is not reported because the respondent did not carry it out, that activity is assigned a  0  minute time interval. Some activities are imputed by national statistical offices {{but there is no}} harmonised imputation procedure. As in labour force surveys, people are required to report their activities independently of whether they are carried out in the regular or hidden economy. The under-reporting of irregular activities is common to all surveys which ask people to report what they do. However, in <b>time</b> <b>use</b> <b>surveys</b> the under-reporting might be possibly lower than in labour force surveys, because of the detailed recording of the time spent in various activities (Hirway and Jose 2011) or because respondents may be less afraid that their answers could be used for administrative controls by tax or social security authorities.|$|R

50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>use</b> <b>surveys</b> {{show that}} women spend far more time doing unpaid work than men. With women {{spending}} more time providing unpaid domestic work than men, women are also spending less time in the workforce and, therefore, bringing in lower incomes to the household. Because women are traditionally believed to bring in less income than men, women are discouraged from investing in education and skills. This further entrenches women into domestic unpaid work, creating a cycle of social norms {{that is difficult to}} break and exacerbates gender inequality.|$|R
