5|$|There was no {{need for}} the Mint to produce any pennies in 1933 because they was no {{commercial}} demand, and it possessed ample stocks from prior years in storage. There was a custom at that time for the King to place a set of coins of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year</b> under the foundation stone of important new buildings, and the Mint struck three 1933 pennies for this purpose, also one each for its own museum and for the British Museum, and at least two others. The result was a rarity that people thought might turn up in their pocket change, and that is probably the best-known British rare coin.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year.</b> In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{compared}} the timing of formation of networks of earlywood vessels with <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year’s</b> leaf phenology in two deciduous ring-porous hardwoods, Quercus serrata and R. pseudoacacia, in early spring. We examined {{the timing of the}} differentiation of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year’s</b> earlywood vessels at different heights on the main stem since the maturation of earlywood vessels progresses basipetally down the stem in ring-porous hardwoods [9]. We also introduced a dye to determine the time at which water conduction through the network of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year’s</b> earlywood vessels began.|$|R
40|$|For an {{examination}} of the progression of cavitation in large-diameter earlywood vessels of a deciduous ring-porous tree, potted saplings of Fraxinus mandshurica var japonica Maxim. were frozen and then thawed. The changes in the amount and distribution of water in the lumina of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year's</b> earlywood vessels {{during the course of the}} freezing and thawing were visualized by cryo-scanning electron microscopy. When samples were frozen, most of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year's</b> earlywood vessels were filled with water. After the subsequent thawing, the percentage of cavitated current-year earlywood vessels gradually increased with time. All of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year's</b> earlywood vessels were cavitated within 24 h, and only limited amounts of water remained in the lumina of earlywood vessels. Similar cavitation of earlywood vessels was observed after thawing of frozen, excised stem pieces. In contrast, many vessels of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year's</b> latewood retained water in the lumina during freezing and thawing. These observations indicate that the cavitation of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year's</b> earlywood vessels is not produced during freezing but progresses during rewarming after freezing in F. mandshurica var japonica...|$|R

25|$|Flowering and fruiting- Hickories are {{monoecious}} {{and flower}} {{in the spring}} (3). The staminate catkins of pignut hickory are 8 to 18cm (3 to 7 in) long and develop from axils of leaves of the previous season or from inner scales of the terminal buds {{at the base of}} the current growth. The pistillate flowers appear in spikes about 6mm (0.25in) long on peduncles terminating in shoots of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year.</b> Flowers open from the middle of March in the southeast part of the range to early June in New England.

25|$|Following Tibet's {{unexpected}} offer, the Mount Everest Committee {{decided on}} an {{attempt on the}} summit for 1936 but preceded by a reconnaissance in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year.</b> Tom Longstaff had been very praising of the Nanda Devi trek and so this approach {{would be used for}} 1935 on Everest. The reconnaissance could be mounted quickly and paid for out of the existing funds of £1,400 so that all the new funds raised could be allocated to the 1936 bid for the summit. Shipton was offered the leadership of the 1935 slot with Ruttledge's approval. He {{would not be able to}} reach the region before July which was expected to be after the start of the monsoon but this would allow the team to find out whether the monsoon snow had sufficiently consolidated.|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that Ol' Dirty Bastard gained notoriety when, as he was being {{profiled}} for an MTV biography, he took two of his seven children by limousine to a New York State welfare office to cash a $375 welfare check and receive food stamps; his latest album {{was still in the}} top ten of the US charts. The entire incident was filmed by an MTV camera crew and was broadcast nationwide. Although he had recently received a $45,000 cash advance for his first solo album and was earning a cut of the profits from the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, Ol' Dirty Bastard was still listed as eligible for welfare and food stamps {{due to the fact that}} he had not yet filed his taxes for <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year.</b> His caseworker revoked his eligibility after seeing the MTV segment, and the incident was viewed as an example of the welfare abuses that led to the significant welfare reforms enacted in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Retrospectively rated {{insurance}} {{is a method}} of establishing a premium on large commercial accounts.

25|$|Dionysius {{copied the}} last decennovenal {{cycle of the}} Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with {{numbered}} Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi (Years of our Lord Jesus Christ) because, as he explained to Petronius, he {{did not wish to}} continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year</b> he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did not realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle × cycle of leap years × days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years, otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact.|$|E
25|$|In May, 2010, the new Coalition {{government}} {{said that the}} 'Labour's 13-year war on the motorist is over' and that the new government 'pledged to scrap public funding for speed cameras' In July Mike Penning, the Road safety minister reduced the Road Safety Grant for <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>year</b> to Local Authorities from £95 million to £57 million, saying that local authorities had relied too heavily on safety cameras {{for far too long}} and that he was pleased that some councils were now focusing on other road safety measures. It is estimated that as a result the Treasury is now distributing £40 million less in Road Safety Grant than is raised from fines in the year. Dorset and Essex announced plans to review camera provision with a view to possibly ending the scheme in their counties, however Dorset strongly affirmed its support for the scheme, albeit reducing financial contributions in line with the reduction in government grant. Seven counties also announced plans to turn off some or all of their cameras, amidst warnings from the country's most senior traffic policeman that this would result in an increase in deaths and injuries. Gloucestershire cancelled plans to update cameras and has reduced or cancelled maintenance contracts.|$|E
