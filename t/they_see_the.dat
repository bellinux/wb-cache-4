5|$|Benjamin finds {{and brings}} his cousin Peter Rabbit into the rescue venture, {{and the two}} {{discover}} Tommy has invaded one of Mr. Tod's homes. Mr. Tod, a fox, has multiple homes but keeps moving. Often Tommy lodges in his homes. Peeping through the bedroom window, the rabbits see Tommy asleep in Mr. Tod's bed, and, peeping through the kitchen window, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> table set for a meal. They realise the bunnies are alive, but shut in the oven. They try to dig a tunnel into the house but hide when Mr. Tod suddenly arrives in a very bad temper, which has caused him to move house.|$|E
5|$|Riders enter a plaza with an arched entrance, where <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Batman logo {{covering}} {{the ground with}} Gotham theming. Lockers rental is also in this area. Riders then wind through either the Flash Pass Que directly to the station or standby line. The standby line leads through gates and leads upstairs into the Transit-style station. A switchback with Six Flags FunTVs is used during busy times about halfway through the standby line.|$|E
5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E

5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide {{they want to help}} the sick crew. They think about getting the crew soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E
5|$|High-school student Wendy Christensen visits an {{amusement}} park with boyfriend Jason Wise, her best friend Carrie Dreyer and Carrie's boyfriend Kevin Fischer for their senior-class field trip. As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that the hydraulics securing the seat belts and coaster cars will fail during the ride and kill everyone on board. She panics, a fight breaks out and several people leave or are forced off the ride. They include Kevin; best friends Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin; alumnus Frankie Cheeks; athlete Lewis Romero; and goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer. <b>They</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> roller coaster derail, killing the remaining passengers, including Jason and Carrie, leaving Wendy and Kevin devastated.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set two million years ago. The {{inhabitants}} of the planet Krikkit built a race of androids called the Krikkitmen to wipe out all life in the universe. They were stopped by the Time Lords, who trapped Krikkit within a temporal prison. A group of Krikkitmen which escaped the Time Lords' sentence are trying to reassemble the components of a key which can free Krikkitâ€”components which happen to resemble elements of the Earth game of cricket, itself actually {{a reflection of the}} ancient war. The Doctor and Sarah stumble upon this plot when <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Krikkitmen steal the Ashes during a test match at Lords. They then travel to the planet Bethselamin to foil {{the next step in the}} Krikkitmen's quest.|$|E

5|$|The story {{followed}} an unnamed warrior {{who became the}} player's character in the multiplayer mode. The warrior {{was a native of}} Kirra whose father was killed by a cruel general who poisoned the water supply of the village, killing many people. Before dying, the warrior's father beckoned him to honor the gods and swear to never let harm come to their family. The warrior swore his father's oath and was met by a cloaked figure, The Giver, who guided him and followed him throughout his journey. Soon after, the warrior called upon Ares to save his people from the poisonous water; the god destroyed the aqueduct and water wheel that supplied water to the village. The warrior then encountered the surviving soldiers who had been under his father's command. One soldier told the warrior that swords alone could not defeat the general. The warrior and his men traveled to the land of Aeaea and recruited the witch Circe, who seemingly also sought revenge against the general. Circe granted the soldiers magical weapons to aid them on their journey, and suggested that <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Oracle of Delphi to discover whether the general had any weaknesses. During this time, the warrior vowed loyalty to Poseidon and to protect his men.|$|E

25|$|Narcissistic parents demand certain {{behavior}} {{from their children}} because <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> children as extensions of themselves, and need the children to represent them {{in the world in}} ways that meet the parents' emotional needs. This parenting 'style' most often results in estranged relationships with the children, coupled with feelings of resentment and self-destructive tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Environmental groups make large {{efforts to}} help shape {{legislation}} in New York because <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> strategy as {{an efficient way to}} influence national programs. New York City's economy is larger than Switzerland's, a size that means the city has potential to set new de facto standards. Manufacturers are also attuned to the latest trends and needs in the city because the market is simply too big to ignore.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{scholarly}} consensus {{regarding the}} date, origin, author or authors, or {{its relationship to}} the Qumran community. Some scholars attribute the Temple Scroll to the isolated Qumran community, while others see no connection with the Qumran community; instead <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> work as a priestly (possible Zadokite) document that was hidden in a cave by Zealots during their flight from Jerusalem in 70 CE before the Roman destruction of the Temple.|$|E

Therefore, the instinct of Christian civilisation has most wisely declared that into their judgments there shall upon every occasion be infused fresh blood and fresh thoughts from the streets. Men shall come in who can <b>see</b> <b>the</b> court and the crowd, and coarse faces of the policeman and the professional criminals, the wasted faces of the wastrels, the unreal faces of the gesticulating counsel, and see it all as one sees a new picture or a play hitherto unvisited.|$|R

25|$|For example, if two musicians, one {{standing}} on the front sideline of the football field {{and one on the}} back sideline, begin playing exactly when <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> beat of the conductor's baton or hand, the sound produced by the musician on the front sideline reaches listeners in the stands noticeably before the sound played by the back musician, and the musicians is seen to move before the sound reaches the stands.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with early}} Parkinson's disease suffer {{a large enough}} amount of {{prospective}} memory impairment to be affected in everyday life. These patients show impairment {{in the use of}} internal attentional strategies which are required for intention retrieval. Parkinson's disease leads to poorer performance on time-based but not event-based prospective memory tasks. For example, patients may forget to take medication at certain times of the day, but forgetting is less likely if <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> medicine bottle.|$|E

25|$|The Bank of America's website is one {{of several}} that ask users to select a {{personal}} image (marketed as SiteKey), and display this user-selected image with any forms that request a password. Users of the bank's online services are instructed to enter a password only when <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> image they selected. However, several studies suggest that few users refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent. In addition, this feature (like other forms of two-factor authentication) is susceptible to other attacks, such as those suffered by Scandinavian bank Nordea in late 2005, and Citibank in 2006.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} the Earth was not only {{discussed}} in scholarly works written in Latin; it was also treated in works written in vernacular languages or dialects and intended for wider audiences. The Norwegian book Konungs SkuggsjÃ¡, from around 1250, states clearly that the Earth is sphericalâ€”and that there is night {{on the opposite side}} of the Earth when there is daytime in Norway. The author also discusses the existence of antipodesâ€”and he notes that (if they exist) <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Sun in the north of the middle of the day, and that they experience seasons opposite those of people in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
