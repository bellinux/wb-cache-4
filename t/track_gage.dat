50|$|Track gauge or {{rail gauge}} (also known as <b>track</b> <b>gage</b> in the United States) is the {{distance}} between the inner sides (gauge sides) of the heads of the two load bearing rails that make up a single railway line. Each country uses different gauges for different types of trains. However, the 1435 mm (4 ft 8½ in) gauge was the basis of 60% of the world's railways.|$|E

50|$|In 1911, {{a narrow}} gauge railway {{connected}} Lakeview with Reno, Nevada. The Nevada-California-Oregon Railway operated the line until 1927, {{when it was}} sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad. Southern Pacific converted the <b>track</b> to standard <b>gage.</b> The new standard rail connection prompted several sawmills to begin operating in Lakeview, expanding the town's economic base.|$|R
40|$|Vehicle/Track dynamic {{simulation}} {{programs are}} now used routinely in the rail industry {{in areas such}} as vehicle and track design, derailment investigation, and prediction of vehicle/track behavior under a variety of conditions. In these investigations the accuracy and validity of the simulation highly depends on information input into the program pertaining to both the vehicle and the track. Track geometry cars provide a variety of track measurements which are used to characterize the <b>track</b> (e. g. <b>gage,</b> cross level, profile, curvature, etc.) but these measurements do not include track stiffness information. For lack of better data these simulations generally assume constant track stiffness and this can lead to significant inaccuracy. The University of Nebraska (UNL), under sponsorship fro...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} reduce the wheel profile wear of {{high-speed}} trains and extend the service life of wheels, a dynamic model for a high-speed vehicle was set up, in which the wheelset was regarded as flexible body, and the actual measured track irregularities and line conditions were considered. The wear depth of the wheel profile was calculated by the well-known Archard wear law. Through this model, the influence of the wheel profile, primary suspension stiffness, <b>track</b> <b>gage,</b> and rail cant on the wear of wheel profile were studied through multiple iterative calculations. Numerical simulation results show that the type XP 55 wheel profile has the smallest cumulative wear depth, and the type LM wheel profile has the largest wear depth. To reduce the wear of the wheel profile, the equivalent conicity of the wheel should not be too large or too small. On the other hand, a small primary vertical stiffness, a <b>track</b> <b>gage</b> around 1, 435 – 1, 438 mm, and a rail cant around 1 : 35 – 1 : 40 are beneficial for dynamic performance improvement and wheel wear alleviation.|$|E

5000|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music gave a mixed {{review of}} the album, noting the {{repetitive}} structure of the group's previous hits, and that listening to the album felt [...] "strange". Despite this, he praised the album's last three <b>tracks.</b> Simon <b>Gage</b> of Daily Express said that the compilation [...] "needs no introduction with big key-change numbers like [...] "Flying Without Wings" [...] and [...] "You Raise Me Up" [...] telling their own story." [...] Star Magazine UK called the group's formula [...] "annoyingly, irresistibly effective" [...] and that [...] "it's the ballads they’ll be remembered for." [...] Jon O'Brien of Rovi Music gave the album a borderline {{two and a half}} out of five stars, saying, [...] "while this collection contains a few pop gems, it's a samey and uninspiring listen that suggests their split has been well overdue." [...] He also noted that numerous uptempo songs and four #1 hits ("Seasons in the Sun", [...] "Fool Again", [...] "Unbreakable" [...] and [...] "The Rose") were excluded from the album's standard edition. Pip Ellwood of Entertainment Focus gave the album a negative review, saying that listening to the album was like [...] "listening to one song for just over an hour." [...] While Allmusic only gave 2.5 of 5 stars.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a recent five year cooperative research study looking at the use of lateral track strength measurement (GRMS) technology to optimize tie replacement practices on main line railroad track. The study was a collaborative effort between the Federal Railroad Administration, the Railway Tie Association, CSX Transportation, and ZETA-TECH Associates, Inc. The specific focus {{of this study was to}} compare tie replacement strategies based on conventional, visual inspection with one based on track strength measurements taken from Gage Restraint Measurement System (GRMS) inspection data. The study consisted of four test miles, with several miles having tie replacement based exclusively on track strength (GRMS) based condition measurement and others on conventional tie replacement decisions using railroad tie inspectors. A total of 4, 209 crossties were installed in this study which spanned approximately five years. The results of the study showed that GRMS maintained miles outperformed the conventional mile in the effectiveness of the tie replacement/upgrade as defined by its <b>track</b> strength (<b>Gage</b> Widening Ratio) degradation behavior. The track strength based tie replacement generated a stronger track structure, with a lower rate of lateral track strength degradation than conventional techniques, while using fewer ties for targeted tie replacement. Projection of the track strength degradation rates over time showed that the track strength approach provided a 9 % extension in tie life...|$|R
