5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed {{the death penalty for}} hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite the risk to <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first references in The New York Times, in 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news.|$|E

5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he saw people killing <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was {{surprised}} to see this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E

25|$|Helping Jews was {{extremely}} dangerous because people involved exposed <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> to a Nazi punishment by death.

Right-wing {{organizations such as the}} National Radical Camp (ONR) and the National Armed Forces (NSZ) remained virulently antisemitic throughout the occupation period and some people preyed on the Jewish victims.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis of the Jerusalem Talmud created {{rules to}} impose {{order on the}} {{harvesting}} process including a rule limiting harvesters working on others' land to taking only enough to feed <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> They also devised a system, called otzar beit din, under which a rabbinical court supervised a communal harvesting process by hiring workers who harvested the fields, stored it in communal storage facilities, and distributed it to the community.|$|E

25|$|Some poor Latin American {{women are}} {{involved}} in illegal activities such as prostitution and gang criminality from their childhood, {{in order to support}} <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> As a result, it is argued that many such women in the region curse the social injustices that have led them to live under such conditions. Child prostitution continues to be a serious social problem in the region today, and many of the human rights organizations have criticized the fact that this problem has not been properly addressed by most Latin American governments.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{believed}} {{this approach was}} militarily counterproductive, as it encouraged the Taipings {{to fight to the}} death, which Gordon felt to be very unwise as the Taiping leader Hong Xiuquan had become murderously paranoid, conducting bloody purges of his followers. Many Taipings were only willing to surrender if the Imperial government would spare the lives of <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Even more importantly, Gordon had given his word of honour that all of the Taipings who surrendered would be well treated, and regarded the massacre as a stain on his honour.|$|E

In addition to many other endeavors, UNODC works to broadcast these announcements on local television and radio stations across the world.

25|$|By Biblical law, Jews who {{own land}} are {{required}} to make their land available during the Shmita to anyone who wishes {{to come in and}} harvest. If the land is fenced etc., gates must be left open to enable entrance. These rules apply to all outdoor agriculture, including private gardens and even outdoor potted plants. Plants inside a building are exempt. However, the Rabbis of the Mishna and Jerusalem Talmud imposed rabbinic ordinances on harvesters to ensure an orderly and equitable process and to prevent a few individuals from taking everything. Harvesters on others' land are permitted to take only enough to feed <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Reconstruction-era United States, {{sharecropping}} {{was one of}} {{few options}} for penniless freedmen to support <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Other solutions included the crop-lien system (where the farmer was extended credit for seed and other supplies by the merchant), a rent labor system (where the former slave rents his land but keeps his entire crop), and the wage system (worker earns a fixed wage, but keeps none of their crop). Sharecropping {{was by far the}} most economically efficient, as it provided incentives for workers to produce a bigger harvest. It was a stage beyond simple hired labor, because the sharecropper had an annual contract. During Reconstruction, the federal Freedmen's Bureau ordered the arrangements and wrote and enforced the contracts.|$|E

Even though many barmaids loved the job because it offered better pay and greater freedom than typical female occupations like household servants, barmaids remained the object of scorn by 'proper' society.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} Japanese characteristics of attitude to {{disclosure of information}} to cancer patients, {{in order to find}} Japanese style of informed consent, comparing it with those of Germans. Ordinary people and students in Japan and Germany answered a questionnaire about <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family.</b> Results are as follows: 1) Though most Germans and Japanese demanded disclosure to both <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family,</b> some Japanese demanded disclosure to themselves but it to <b>their</b> <b>family.</b> 2) German students think of family as the same as German ordinary people, but Japanese do not. 3) The reason of disclosure for themselves is 2 ̆ 2 I have to prepare to death 2 ̆ 2 in the case of Japanese, and 2 ̆ 2 reliance 2 ̆ 2 in the case of Germans. 4) Reasons of closure to family in Japanese were 2 ̆ 2 considering family 2 ̆ 7 s shock 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 their mental suffering over <b>their</b> <b>family</b> 2 ̆ 2.

25|$|Norsk Luftambulanse {{carried out}} a trial {{operation}} in Arendal {{during the summer of}} 1986. The south coast filled with holiday-goers during the summer months, increasing the demand for medical treatment.

They found a suitable natural helipad at the former director mansion of Arendal Smelteverk, situated on the island of Buøya in the then municipality of Moland. NLA lacked sufficient funding for the project, so they made an agreement where the employees could bring <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> for a free vacation at the mansion in exchange for duty time.

25|$|For those Japanese Canadians {{living in}} the {{internment}} camps, the forced sale of their properties meant they now had less cash and resources. They were not receiving any rental income from their properties, and the Custodian of Enemy Property {{took control of the}} funds resulting from property sales. The Custodian did not provide interest on the funds, and restricted withdrawals from the funds held in their possession. What funds Japanese Canadians were able to receive went to supporting <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> in the camps, often helping those who could not work or were not able to live off of the inadequate government subsidies. As a result, many families and single men began leaving BC in search of employment elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The {{distress}} of the King's loyal American {{subjects who}} have been driven from their habitations and deprived of their property by the rebels has been an object of attention with His Majesty and Parliament from the first appearance of the rebellion; and very considerable sums have been expended in furnishing them with a temporary support. But, as their number is daily increasing and is much to be apprehended (if a reconciliation does not soon take place) that scarcely any who retain their principles will be suffered {{to remain in the}} revolted provinces, it is judged proper in that event that a permanent provision should be made by which they may be enabled to support <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> without being a continual burden upon the revenue of Great Britain.|$|E
