40|$|A {{saddle clamp}} {{assembly}} is presented. The assembly {{is comprised of}} a hollow cylindrical body centered about a longitudinal axis and being diametrically split into semicircular top and bottom sections. Each section has a pair of connection flanges, at opposite ends, that project radially outward. A pair of bolts are retained on the top section flanges and are threadable into nuts retained on the bottom section flanges. A base member is anchored to a central underside portion of the bottom clamp body section and has a pair of connection tabs positioned beneath the bottom clamp body section connection flanges {{on opposite sides of}} the clamp axis. A pair of bolts are retained on the base member connection tabs and are threadable into a pair of nuts retainable on a support structure. The connection tab and connection flanges on each side of the clamp body are axially offset in a manner permitting downward installation/removable tool access to the lower bolts past the connection flanges. An elongated retention tether is used to connect the <b>top</b> <b>clamp</b> body section to the balance of the clamp assembly. This prevents loss of the <b>top</b> <b>clamp</b> body section when it is removed from the bottom clamp body section...|$|E
40|$|Joint schemes {{are very}} {{important}} {{in the design of}} bolted joints in huge composite structures. This article describes the scheme, manufacturing method, performance testing and simulation of a novel bolted joint configuration for top-hat stiffened composite plates. Firstly, a bolted joint scheme is proposed for use in top-hat stiffened composite plates, after which the manufacturing method of the joint scheme is presented, as is the fabrication of test specimens and their bending performance are tested. Then, a numerical method is proposed to analyze the performance of these specimens. Drawing on experimental and simulated results, seven failure modes are summarized with varied geometrical parameter. We change the angle of <b>top</b> <b>clamp</b> θ and the length of the foam block Lx, and discuss the relationship between the mutative design parameters and bending performance. Suitable design parameters are obtained and suggestions for the joint scheme are offered. It is found that good mechanical performances can be achieved with the proposed scheme through suitable parameter design, and it is also found the simulated result agrees the experiment well, which provides a useful method for the bolted joint design of foam inserted top-hat stiffened composite plates.

40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} {{miniature}} cantilever-type anemometer {{that has been}} developed as a prototype of compact, relatively nonintrusive anemometers that can function at temperatures up to 600 C {{and that can be}} expected to be commercially mass-producible at low cost. The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline SiC clamping plates, all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The clamping plates are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one clamping plate. Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this clamping plate. Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other clamping plate. Piezoresistive single-crystal SiC thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two clamping plates are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the bottom clamping plate. The top clamping plate is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the <b>top</b> <b>clamp</b> plate aligns with the metal contact pads on the cantilever. When the parts are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone bridge to external circuitry for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|E
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, {{manually operated}} tool enables precise bending (typically, within 1 / 2 of the specified bend angle) of a metal tube {{located in a}} confined space, {{with a minimum of}} flattening of the tube and without significant gouging of the tube surface. The tool is designed for use in {{a situation in which the}} tube cannot be removed from the confined space for placement in a conventional benchmounted tube bender. The tool is also designed for use in a situation in which previously available hand-held tube benders do not afford the required precision, do not support the tube wall sufficiently to prevent flattening or gouging, and/or do not fit within the confined space. The tool is designed and fabricated for the specific outer diameter and bend radius of the tube to be bent. The tool (see figure) includes a clamping/radius block and a <b>top</b> <b>clamping</b> block that contain mating straight channels of semicircular cross section that fit snugly around the tube. The mating portions of the clamping/radius block and the <b>top</b> <b>clamping</b> block are clamped around a length of the tube that is adjacent to the bend and that is intended to remain straight. The clamping/radius block is so named because beyond the straight clamping section, its semicircular channel extends to a non-clamping section that is curved at the specified bend radius. A pivot hole is located in the clamping/radius block at the center of the bend circle. The tool includes a bending block that, like the other blocks, contains a straight semicircular channel that fits around the outside of the tube. The bending block contains a pivot hole to be aligned with the pivot hole in the clamping/radius block. Once the tube has been clamped between the clamping/ radius and <b>top</b> <b>clamping</b> blocks, the bending block is placed around the tube, the pivot holes are aligned, and a pivot pin is inserted through the pivot holes...|$|R

For the class of fixtures that are considered, the algorithm is guaranteed to find the global optimum design that satisfies these and other pragmatic conditions. The authors present the results of the algorithm applied to several practical manufacturing problems. For these complex problems the algorithm typically returns initial high-quality fixture designs in less than a minute, and identifies the global optimum design in just over an hour.

40|$|In eukaryotes, DNA topoisomerase I (Top 1) catalyzes the {{relaxation}} of supercoiled DNA by a conserved mechanism of transient DNA strand breakage, rotation, and religation. The unusual {{architecture of the}} monomeric human enzyme comprises a conserved protein clamp, which is tightly wrapped about duplex DNA, and an extended coiled-coil linker domain that appropriately positions the C-terminal active site tyrosine domain against the Top 1 core to form the catalytic pocket. A structurally undefined N-terminal domain, dispensable for enzyme activity, mediates protein-protein interactions. Previously, reversible disulfide bonds were designed to assess whether locking the <b>Top</b> 1 <b>clamp</b> around duplex DNA would restrict DNA strand rotation within the covalent Top 1 -DNA intermediate. The active site proximal disulfide bond in full-length Top 1 -clamp 534 restricted DNA rotation (Woo, M. H., Losasso, C., Guo, H., Pattarello, L., Benedetti, P., and Bjornsti, M. A. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 13767 – 13772), whereas the more distal disulfide bond of the N-terminally truncated Topo 70 -clamp 499 did not (Carey, J. F., Schultz, S. J., Sisson, L., Fazzio, T.

40|$|Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I (Top 1) is a monomeric protein clamp that {{functions}} in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. Opposable "lip" domains form a salt bridge to complete <b>Top</b> 1 protein <b>clamping</b> of duplex DNA. Changes in DNA topology are catalyzed by {{the formation of}} a transient phosphotyrosyl linkage between the active-site Tyr- 723 and a single DNA strand. Substantial protein domain movements are required for DNA binding, whereas the tight packing of DNA within the covalent Top 1 -DNA complex necessitates some DNA distortion to allow rotation. To investigate the effects of Top 1 -clamp closure on enzyme catalysis, molecular modeling was used to design a disulfide bond between residues Gly- 365 and Ser- 534, to crosslink protein loops more proximal to the active-site tyrosine than the protein loops held by the Lys- 369 -Glu- 497 salt bridge. In reducing environments, Top 1 -Clamp was catalytically active. However, contrary to crosslinking the salt-bridge loops [Carey, J. F., Schultz, S. J., Sission, L., Fazzio, T. G. & Champoux, J. J. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 5640 - 5645], crosslinking the active-site proximal loops inhibited DNA rotation. Apparently, subtle alterations in <b>Top</b> 1 <b>clamp</b> flexibility impact enzyme catalysis in vitro. Yet, the catalytically active Top 1 -Clamp was cytotoxic, even in the reducing environment of yeast cells. Remarkably, a shift in redox potential in glr 1 Delta cells converted the catalytically inactive Top 1 Y 723 F mutant clamp into a cellular toxin, which failed to induce an S-phase terminal phenotype. This cytotoxic mechanism is distinct from that of camptothecin chemotherapeutics, which stabilize covalent Top 1 -DNA complexes, and it suggests that the development of novel therapeutics that promote Top 1 -clamp closure is possible...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the topoisomerase II (TOP 2) β–DNA covalent complex arrests transcription and triggers 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation of TOP 2 β. It is unclear whether the initial trigger for proteasomal degradation is due to DNA damage or transcriptional arrest. In the current study we show that the TOP 2 catalytic inhibitor 4, 4 -(2, 3 -butanediyl) -bis(2, 6 -piperazinedione) (ICRF- 193), which traps TOP 2 into a circular clamp rather than the TOP 2 –DNA covalent complex, can also arrest transcription. Arrest of transcription, which is TOP 2 β-dependent, is accompanied by proteasomal degradation of TOP 2 β. Different from TOP 2 poisons and other DNA-damaging agents, ICRF- 193 did not induce proteasomal degradation of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. These results suggest that proteasomal degradation of TOP 2 β induced by the TOP 2 –DNA covalent complex or the <b>TOP</b> 2 circular <b>clamp</b> is due to transcriptional arrest but not DNA damage.

50|$|Hide glue regains its working {{properties}} after cooling {{if it is}} reheated. This property can be {{used when}} the glue's open time does not allow the joint to be glued normally. For example, a cello maker {{may not be able}} to glue and <b>clamp</b> a <b>top</b> to the instrument's ribs in the short one-minute open time available. Instead, the builder will lay a bead of glue along the ribs, and allow it to cool. The <b>top</b> is then <b>clamped</b> to the ribs. Moving a few inches at a time, the maker inserts a heated palette knife into the joint, heating the glue. When the glue is liquefied, the palette knife is removed, and the glue cools, creating a bond. A similar process can be used to glue veneers to a substrate. The veneer and/or the substrate is coated with hot hide glue. Once the glue is cold, the veneer is positioned on the substrate. A hot object such as a clothes iron is applied to the veneer, liquefying the underlying glue. When the iron is removed, the glue cools, bonding the veneer to the substrate.|$|R
40|$|The decatenation {{activity}} of topoisomerase II (Top 2), which is widely conserved within the eukaryotic domain, {{is essential for}} chromosomal segregation in mitosis. It is less clear, however, whether Top 2 performs the same function uniformly across the whole genome, and whether all its functions rely on decatenation. In the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, telomeres are bound by Taz 1, which promotes smooth replication fork progression through the repetitive telomeric sequences. Hence, replication forks stall at taz 1 Δ telomeres. This leads to telomeric entanglements at low temperatures (⩽ 20 °C) that cause chromosomal segregation defects and loss of viability. Here, we show that the appearance of entanglements, and the resulting cold sensitivity of taz 1 Δ cells, is suppressed by mutated alleles of Top 2 that confer slower catalytic turnover. This suppression does not rely on the decatenation {{activity of}} Top 2. Rather, the enhanced presence of reaction intermediates in which <b>Top</b> 2 is <b>clamped</b> around DNA, promotes the removal of telomeric entanglements in vivo, independently of catalytic cycle completion.
