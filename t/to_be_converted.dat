5|$|The Tupolev Tu-73 jet-engined bomber {{project was}} {{suffering}} delays in early 1947 and Tupolev suggested re-engining the Tu-2 medium bomber with imported British Rolls-Royce Nene jet engines {{to produce a}} jet bomber as quickly as possible. Design work began well before official approval was received on 31 May 1947 for one Tu-2S <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> in the OKB's workshop and another five <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> at Zavod (Factory) Nr. 23, but construction of the prototype had already begun in early May under the bureau designation Tu-77.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of the}} {{original}} Class A1 locomotives were eventually rebuilt to Class A3 specifications, it was a drawn-out process that lasted until 1949; 60068 Sir Visto was the last locomotive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted.</b> The changeover to left-hand drive took longer, and continued into the Fifties.|$|E
5|$|TfL {{has also}} {{suggested}} {{there may be}} potential for the turnback siding adjacent to Milkwood Road <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> for passenger use. This would require substantial changes to the station {{as there is no}} direct access to the platforms from Milkwood Road and the current subway for accessing the platforms does not extend east of the southbound platform.|$|E

5|$|Although every {{university}} in Australia accepts the IB diploma, entry criteria differ from university to university. Some universities accept students on their IB point count, whereas others require the points <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted.</b> In most states, this {{is based on}} the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR). In Queensland, IBDP scores are converted to a QTAC scale to determine selection rank.|$|E
5|$|Binondo, {{the oldest}} {{and one of the}} largest Chinatowns in the world, was the center of {{commerce}} and business activities in the city. Numerous residential and office skyscrapers are found within its medieval streets.

5|$|Centre Point, {{just beyond}} {{the eastern end of}} Oxford Street next to Tottenham Court Road station, was {{designed}} by property developer Harry Hyams and opened in 1966. It failed to find a suitable tenant and sat empty for many years, eventually being occupied by squatters who used it as a centre of protest against the lack of suitable accommodation in Central London. In 2015, the building began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into residential flats, with development expected to finish in 2017.|$|E
5|$|In May 2001, Oslo City Council {{voted to}} sell their {{properties}} at Fornebu to Fornebu Boligspar (FB), which again had agreements to sell {{a lot for the}} stadium to Stabæk. In November 2002, Borgarting Court of Appeal concluded that Norrønafly had the right to continue leasing a hangar—located at the planned location of the venue—until 2014.

5|$|In October 2015, , a {{container}} ship, {{was acquired by}} Davie Shipyards <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into an auxiliary vessel, to be leased to the RCN as a temporary bridge between the Protecteur class until the new AOR class becomes available. However, no contract has yet been signed. On 10 March 2017, ex-Protecteur caught fire while being dismantled in Liverpool, Nova Scotia. Residual fuel caught fire during demolition of the vessel.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the period}} 1983 to 1985, D vans 301 <b>to</b> 321 <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> from the VBPY fleet, except VPY6 which became VBAY79.

5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of oxaloacetate to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into cytosolic oxaloacetate, which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Limitations {{imposed by}} the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty {{prevented}} the class from being completed as designed. However, the treaty had a limited allowance for hulls already under construction <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into aircraft carriers. Amagi and Akagi were both intended for conversion, but an earthquake damaged the hull of Amagi so extensively that the ship was scrapped. Akagi was reconstructed as an aircraft carrier and served with distinction {{as part of the}} Kido Butai during the Second World War, participating in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor before being sunk at the Battle of Midway.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak, {{named for}} the English oak tree within which King Charles II hid to escape after his defeat at Battle of Worcester in 1651, was laid down on 1 May 1860 at Chatham Dockyard as a 90-gun Bulwark-class ship of the line.

5|$|Stuttgart and Stettin {{remained}} in German waters during the war, and both saw {{action at the}} Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The two cruisers engaged in close-range night fighting with the British fleet, but neither was significantly damaged. Both ships were withdrawn from service later in the war, Stettin {{to serve as a}} training ship, and Stuttgart <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> into a seaplane tender in 1918. They both survived the war, and were surrendered to Britain as war prizes; they were dismantled in the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The Lexington-class {{aircraft}} carriers were {{a pair of}} {{aircraft carriers}} built for the United States Navy (USN) during the 1920s. The ships were built on hulls originally laid down as battlecruisers after World War I, but under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, all U.S. battleship and battlecruiser construction was cancelled. The Treaty, however, allowed two of the unfinished ships <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b> to carriers. They were the first operational aircraft carriers in the USN and were used to develop carrier aviation tactics and procedures before World War II {{in a series of}} annual exercises.|$|E
