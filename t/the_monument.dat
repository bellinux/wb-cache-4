5|$|In 1985, Hurricane Gloria {{blew out}} a window of <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> In 1986, the State of Connecticut spent $6250 to re-mortar <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> <b>The</b> <b>monument</b> was closed until 1989 for the repair work. In 2007, Carol Kimball of The Day wrote that the State of Connecticut has not funding repairs to the {{historic}} site, {{but it would be}} required if <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> were to continue to survive. Kimball also referenced a New York Times article on the neglected monument and that the bond commission has yet to issue the approved $350,000 for its preservation. Other costs including sidewalks surrounding the entrance, and Memorial Gate itself, would require another $150,000 to repair.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of <b>the</b> <b>monument,</b> or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from <b>the</b> <b>Monument</b> Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> After exiting <b>the</b> <b>monument,</b> they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal frame, was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2004 <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> {{closed for}} a $15 million renovation, which {{included}} numerous security upgrades and redesign of <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> grounds by landscape architect Laurie Olin.

5|$|<b>The</b> {{diversity}} of <b>monuments</b> falling within <b>the</b> potbelly sculptural {{tradition and the}} individuality of <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> support <b>the</b> argument that <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> represent individual rulers. <b>The</b> <b>monuments</b> may have been viewed by the ancient peoples of {{the region as a}} depiction of both rulership and their ancestors.|$|R
5|$|Ranger-led {{events at}} <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> have {{historically}} included {{indoor and outdoor}} talks, showings of an 18-minute orientation film, hikes in Blue Basin, Cant Ranch walking tours, and astronomy programs at the Painted Hills Unit.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>monuments</b> {{were chosen}} {{for the quality of}} their {{architecture}} or their European symbolism. Most of <b>the</b> <b>monuments</b> were made using moulds.

A computer-assisted milling procedure was used for two of the models.|$|R

5|$|An ossuary and a {{mausoleum}} {{were built}} {{on the site of}} the massacre in 1955. A monument called Gudovac—Before the Firing Squad, by the Serb sculptor Vojin Bakić, was erected on the same spot. In 1991, amid inter-ethnic violence caused by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars, <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> and mausoleum were destroyed by Croatian nationalists. Also destroyed was one of Bakić's most famous monuments, Bjelovarac (The Man from Bjelovar). Bakić had dedicated <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> to his brothers, who were killed by the Ustaše. What remained of the ossuary was removed by the local authorities in 2002. That year, residents signed a petition to have a replica of Bjelovarac erected at the same spot. The local government promised to supply half the amount needed to restore <b>the</b> <b>monument.</b> In 2005, the Croatian Ministry of Culture advised the petitioners to apply for a tender in order to pay the other half. The restored monument was unveiled in December 2010.|$|E

5|$|Five {{days after}} the British surrendered, Congress passed a {{resolution}} agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating {{those who participated in}} the battle. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> was delayed, however, as the federal government had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature. The battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the resolution and prompted the government to begin building <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> in 1881 amid national support. The structure was formally erected in 1884 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.|$|E
5|$|Following the Soviet {{occupation}} of Latvia in 1940 Latvia was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor Vera Mukhina is sometimes credited for rescuing <b>the</b> <b>monument,</b> because she considered {{it to be}} of high artistic value. Soviet propaganda attempted to alter the symbolic meaning of <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> to better fit with Communist ideology, but it remained a symbol of national independence to the general public. Indeed, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people gathered at <b>the</b> <b>monument</b> to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Soviet regime and to lay flowers. This rally renewed the national independence movement, which culminated three years later in the re-establishment of Latvian sovereignty {{after the fall of the}} Soviet regime.|$|E
