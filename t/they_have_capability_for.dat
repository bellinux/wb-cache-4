To achieve this, a multi-stage market clearing procedure is formulated. At the first stage, the market is cleared based on generation cost minimization, without considering network constraints. Market clearing formulation for the second stage is developed considering congestion, in which FACTS device (Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC)), and time-based DR programs (Time of Use (TOU)) are optimally coordinated with GR {{in the presence of}} network constraints, to manage congestion at minimum costs.

40|$|Arsenic {{pollution}} in aquatic environments is a worldwide concern {{due to its}} toxicity and chronic effects on human health. This concern has generated increasing interest {{in the use of}} different treatment technologies to remove arsenic from contaminated water. Constructed wetlands are a cost-effective natural system successfully used for removing various pollutants, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> shown <b>capability</b> <b>for</b> removing arsenic. This paper reviews current understanding of the removal processes for arsenic, discusses implications for treatment wetlands, and identifies critical knowledge gaps and areas worthy of future research. The reactivity of arsenic means that different arsenic species may be found in wetlands, influenced by vegetation, supporting medium and microorganisms. Despite the fact that sorption, precipitation and coprecipitation are the principal processes responsible for the removal of arsenic, bacteria can mediate these processes and can play a significant role under favourable environmental conditions. The most important factors affecting the speciation of arsenic are pH, alkalinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, the presence of other chemical species – iron, sulphur, phosphate –, a source of carbon, and the wetland substrate. Studies of the microbial communities and the speciation of arsenic in the solid phase using advanced techniques could provide further insights on the removal of arsenic. Limited data and understanding of the interaction of the different processes involved in the removal of arsenic explain the rudimentary guidelines available for the design of wetlands systems...|$|R

Marked Point Process (MPP) models incorporate global information, such as shape, as a prior, but local constraints, such as pixel-wise interaction, are not easily modeled. ^ To address the problem, we first propose a hybrid MRF/MPP model to incorporate both local and global constraints within one single energy function for image analysis. Optimization using this model is performed using simulation schemes, including reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ MCMC) and multiple birth and death algorithms. ^ Secondly, we propose a two-pass multiple birth and death algorithm.

In our algorithm, we add a rebirth step after the death step to solve this problem. ^ Finally, we propose a joint MRF/MPP model. Unlike the hybrid model, where the MRF is interpreted as an energy term within the MPP framework, this model combines the MRF and the MPP into a joint probability distribution. We show experiments to demonstrate the comparison of this model and the hybrid model. ...|$|R

Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) based on group III-Nitrides materials are of interest due to potential <b>capabilities</b> <b>for</b> low dark current densities, high sensitivities and high optical gains in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region.

The AIN-free full-vertical GaN p-i-n rectifiers on n - type 6 H-SiC substrates by employing a conducting AIGaN:Si buffer layer provides the advantages of the reduction of sidewall damage from plasma etching and lower forward resistance due to the reduction of current crowding at the bottom n -type layer.

Simultaneously, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> lost their <b>capability</b> <b>for</b> autotrophic growth. The mutants grew, but slower than the wild type, on fructose or gluconate. Growth retardation on gluconate was more pronounced. The mutants lacked phosphoglycerate mutase activity, and spontaneous revertants of normal growth phenotype had regained the activity. The physiological characteristics of the mutants indicate the role of phosphoglycerate mutase in heterotrophic and autotrophic carbon metabolism of A. eutrophus. Although the enzyme is necessary for gluconeogenesis during heterotrophic growth on three- or four-carbon substrates, its glycolytic function is not essential for the catabolism of fructose or gluconate via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. The enzyme is required during autotrophic growth as a catalyst in the biosynthetic route leading from glycerate 3 -phosphate to pyruvate. It is suggested that the mutants accomplish the complete degradation of fructose and gluconate mutase lesion. The catabolically produced triose phosphates are converted to fructose 6 -phosphate which is rechanneled into the Entner-Doudoroff pathway.

40|$|Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) {{devices are}} key {{components}} in RF and IF stages of many electronic systems. A Surface Acoustic wave is a mechanical wave, which is excited {{on the surface}} of a piezoelectric substrate, when an alternating electric voltage is applied through a comb-like interdigital transducer (electrodes) patterned on it. Most SAW applications to date have been in the sub- 2 GHz region, but emerging applications require SAW devices at higher frequencies. The traditional models are inadequate to account for pronounced second order effects at the GHz range and also new microfabrication techniques are required to obtain quality devices as the critical dimensions shrink into the nano-scale range at these frequencies. The finite element method (a numerical method of solving differential equations) has the potential to account for these effects and ever increasing sub-micron processing capabilities of LIGA (X-ray lithography) present a promising outlook for high frequency SAW device modeling and fabrication respectively. A finite element model has been developed using commercial software ANSYS for one port SAW resonators and is presented in this thesis. The one port SAW resonators are generally connected in form of ladder networks to form low-loss SAW filters. The spacing between the electrodes and the velocity of the SAW determine the frequency of operation of these devices. A finite element model has been developed for three different types of SAWdevices namely Rayleigh, leaky and longitudinal leaky SAW (LLSAW). The LLSAW has higher velocity as compared to other two types and hence considered in this work as a good prospect for high frequency SAW devices. A full finite element model could not be solved due to high computing requirements and hence some assumptions were made and the results were validated against published results in the literature. The results indicate that even with simplifying assumptions and approximations FE model provides reasonably accurate results, {{that can be used in}} device design.

Recently, highly reduced genomes from the co-resident intracellular symbionts of sharpshooters {{were shown to}} exhibit a striking level of metabolic interdependence. One symbiont, called Sulcia muelleri (Bacteroidetes), can produce eight of the 10 essential amino acids, despite having a genome of only 245 kb. The other, Baumannia cicadellinicola (γ-Proteobacteria), can produce the remaining two essential amino acids {{as well as many}} vitamins. Cicadas also contain the symbiont Sulcia, but lack Baumannia and instead contain the co-resident symbiont Hodgkinia cicadicola (α-Proteobacteria). Here we report that, despite at least 200 million years of divergence, the two Sulcia genomes have nearly identical gene content and gene order.

One hundred-forty diet-fecal pair samples were generated from two independent in vivo feeding trials conducted in the United States (N = 100) and Africa (N = 40). At each site, ten female donkeys were fed mixed diets blended from 25 forage and crop residues. The modified partial least square model (MPLS) was used to develop calibration equations for crude protein (CP), digestible organic matter (DOM), dry matter digestibility (DDM) and organic matter digestibility (OMD), for the US, Africa and US/Africa combined datasets, and dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) intake calibrations from the US datasets. Crude protein (CP) equations were developed with standard error of calibration (SEC) 0. 90, (SEL = 0. 5). The US, US/Africa and Africa CP equations had SEC value of 0. 77, 0. 97 and 0. 88 with corresponding R 2 of 0. 97, 0. 95 and 0. 88, respectively. Validation of the US CP equation resulted in a standard error of prediction (SEP) of 1. 79 with corresponding coefficient of correlation (r 2) of 0. 82 and slope of 0. 84 indicating high accuracy of prediction. In vivo derived DOM equations were also developed for the US, Africa and US/Africa datasets with SEC values of 2. 58, 4. 91 and 3. 52, and R 2 of 0. 60, 0. 81 and 0. 84, respectively. In addition, the SEC and R 2 values were 3. 25 and 0. 72 for US OMD, 3. 28 and 0. 79 for US DDM, and 4. 2 and 0. 85 for US/Africa OMD, and 4. 3 and 0. 87 for US/Africa DDM equation, respectively. Calibration equations for predicting DMI and OMI have resulted in SEC values of 3. 45 and 3. 21 (g/kgw 0. 75) and R 2 values of 0. 89 and 0. 84, respectively.

Both calibration and validation results have indicated that the present donkey equations were comparable to previously developed equations <b>for</b> ruminants; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the <b>capability</b> <b>for</b> accurate prediction of diet quality and intake, and can be a useful tool for monitoring the nutritional well-being of donkeys with acceptable accuracy. Research works to further expand the present calibration equations with additional diet-fecal samples particularly from Africa that did not meet the required accuracy level is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experiences}} indicate {{there are}} limitations to the surveillance capability of high-value long-distance standoff ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) platforms {{such as the}} latest observation satellites and unmanned aircraft. The high-tech systems in the platforms are often influenced by weather conditions or defeated by low-tech adversaries such as foliage, caves and concealment. These limitations indicate that close-in, on-the-ground sensor networks are essential parts <b>for</b> powerful ISR <b>capability.</b> However, {{it is hard to}} place ground sensors at planned specific locations. For example, certain sensor nodes may be required to be located on rooftops or tree canopies. Therefore, it is critical to deliver the sensors with high precision and reliability. The current UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) technologies may give a key solution to sensor deployment because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> shown the <b>capability</b> <b>for</b> delivering a variety of payloads. The delivery utilizing UAVs may also minimize cost and complexity which are critical factors in real missions where sensor networks may consist of hundreds of sensors. In this thesis, A way of utilizing UAVs for precision delivery of sensor nodes is suggested, a prototype of a precision airdrop vehicle (PDV) is suggested, and a vision-based estimation and control system design, using both an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and a vision system to achieve precision airdrop deployment is described. The design was also tested in a hardware-in-the-loop-simulation (HILSIM) framework. Good performance and reliability of the design were demonstrated in HILSIM tests. From HILSIM tests, it was shown that the PDV launched from a carrier UAV at a speed of about 20 m/sec and at an altitude of about 350 meters, could be guided(cont.) to a target point with a maximum error of 5 meters, if the launching position could be estimated to within a maximum error of 50 meters from the ideal launching position. This implies that the exact target position and the exact launching position are not necessary for precision node delivery. by Hyungil Ahn. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to develop global/local finite element models using partial hybrid stress finite {{elements}} for stress analysis of laminated composite structures. Based on the composite variational principle, the general formulations of partial hybrid single-layer finite element and multilayer finite element are presented. These formulations {{can be used to}} develop a series of partial hybrid finite elements. A 4 -node degenerated plate element, an 8 -node degenerated plate element, a 3 -D, 8 -node solid element, a 3 -D, 20 -node solid element, a 6 -node transition element, a 15 -node transition element, a multilayer solid element, and a multilayer transition element are presented. The elements developed in this thesis are examined by the, eigenvalue test to detect zero-energy deformation modes and the absence of rigid-body motion capability. The results show that the elements do not have any kinematic deformation modes, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a desired <b>capability</b> <b>for</b> rigid-body displacement. In addition, the non-zero eigenvalues of the element stiffness matrices are real and positive. In order to determine the optimal partial stress fields for the partial hybrid elements, a classification method of stress modes is presented. The method can be used to classify stress modes, select optimal stress modes, and set up an assumed stress matrix for a hybrid element. Also, the necessary and sufficient condition for avoiding spurious kinematic deformation mode is proposed and the optimal condition of an assumed stress field is presented. A computer program COMSA is developed to implement the partial hybrid finite element method. The Global/Local finite element models are established using plate element, solid element, and transition element. In the thesis, a few numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the finite element models. It has been shown that the global/local models using partial hybrid element are efficient and accurate for stress analysis of laminated composites {{due to the fact that}} they take advantage of the capacity of both 3 -D elements and 2 -D elements...|$|R
