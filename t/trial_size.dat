DESIGN: A systematic computerised literature search of Medline and Embase, supplemented with citation tracking, for relevant trials with random allocation published before 1996. SUBJECTS: Patients treated with physiotherapy for disorders of soft tissue of the shoulder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Success rates, mobility, pain, functional status. RESULTS: Six of the 20 assessed trials satisfied at least five of eight validity criteria. Assessment of methods was often hampered by insufficient information on various validity criteria, and trials were often flawed by lack of blinding, high proportions of withdrawals from treatment, and high proportions of missing values. <b>Trial</b> <b>sizes</b> were small: only six trials included intervention groups of more than 25 patients.

Most clinical trials are small, and small trials are often associated with larger effect sizes. We empirically evaluated whether there is also a relationship between <b>trial</b> <b>size</b> and heterogeneity (tau). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We selected the first meta-analysis per intervention review of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issues 2009 - 2013 with a dichotomous (n = 2, 009) or continuous (n = 1, 254) outcome. The association between estimated tau and <b>trial</b> <b>size</b> was evaluated across meta-analyses using regression and within meta-analyses using a Bayesian approach. Small trials were predefined as those having standard errors (SEs) over 0. 2 standardized effects. RESULTS: Most meta-analyses were based on few (median 4) trials. Within the same meta-analysis, the small study tauS(2) was larger than the large-study tauL(2) [average ratio 2. 11; 95 % credible interval (1. 05, 3. 87) for dichotomous and 3. 11 (2. 00, 4. 78) for continuous meta-analyses]. The imprecision of tauS was larger than of tauL: median SE 0. 39 vs. 0. 20 for dichotomous and 0. 22 vs. 0. 13 for continuous small-study and large-study meta-analyses. CONCLUSION: Heterogeneity between small studies is larger than between larger studies. The large imprecision with which tau is estimated in a typical small-studies' meta-analysis is another reason for concern, and sensitivity analyses are recommended...|$|E

We assessed the effectiveness, tolerability {{and safety of}} nonantibiotic prophylaxis in adults with recurrent urinary tract infections. MEDLINE®, EMBASE™, the Cochrane Library and reference lists of relevant reviews were searched to April 2013 for relevant English language citations. Two reviewers selected randomized controlled trials that met the predefined criteria for population, interventions and outcomes. The difference in the proportions of patients with at least 1 urinary tract infection was calculated for individual studies, and pooled risk ratios were calculated using random and fixed effects models. Adverse event rates were also extracted. The Jadad score {{was used to assess}} risk of bias (0 to 2 -high risk and 3 to 5 -low risk). We identified 5, 413 records and included 17 studies with data for 2, 165 patients. The oral immunostimulant OM- 89 decreased the rate of urinary tract infection recurrence (4 <b>trials,</b> sample <b>size</b> 891, median Jadad score 3, RR 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 48 - 0. 78) and had a good safety profile. The vaginal vaccine Urovac® slightly reduced urinary tract infection recurrence (3 <b>trials,</b> sample <b>size</b> 220, Jadad score 3, RR 0. 81, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 0. 96) and primary immunization followed by booster immunization increased the time to reinfection. Vaginal estrogens showed a trend toward preventing urinary tract infection recurrence (2 <b>trials,</b> sample <b>size</b> 201, Jadad score 2. 5, RR 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 16 - 1. 10) but vaginal irritation occurred in 6 % to 20 % of women. Cranberries decreased urinary tract infection recurrence (2 <b>trials,</b> sample <b>size</b> 250, Jadad score 4, RR 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 33 - 0. 83) as did acupuncture (2 open label <b>trials,</b> sample <b>size</b> 165, Jadad score 2, RR 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 29 - 0. 79).

40|$|Sample size {{justification}} is {{an important}} consideration when planning a clinical trial, {{not only for the}} main trial but also for any preliminary pilot trial. When the outcome is a continuous variable, the sample size calculation requires an accurate estimate of the standard deviation of the outcome measure. A pilot trial can be used to get an estimate of the standard deviation, which could then be used to anticipate what may be observed in the main trial. However, an important consideration is that pilot trials often estimate the standard deviation parameter imprecisely. This paper looks at how we can choose an external pilot <b>trial</b> sample <b>size</b> in order to minimise the sample size of the overall clinical trial programme, that is, the pilot and the main trial together. We produce a method of calculating the optimal solution to the required pilot <b>trial</b> sample <b>size</b> when the standardised effect size for the main trial is known.

Data sources 93 meta-analyses (735 randomised controlled trials) assessing therapeutic interventions with binary outcomes, published in the 10 leading journals of each medical subject category of the Journal Citation Reports or in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Data extraction Sample size, outcome data, and risk of bias extracted from each trial. Data synthesis Trials within each meta-analysis were sorted by their sample size: using quarters within each meta-analysis (from quarter 1 with 25 % of the smallest trials, to quarter 4 with 25 % of the largest <b>trials),</b> and using <b>size</b> groups across meta-analyses (ranging from < 50 to ≥ 1000 patients). Treatment effects were compared within each meta-analysis between quarters or between size groups by average ratios of odds ratios (where a ratio of odds ratios less than 1 indicates larger effects in smaller trials). Results Treatment effect estimates were significantly larger in smaller trials, regardless of sample size. Compared with quarter 4 (which included the largest trials), treatment effects were, on average, 32 % larger in trials in quarter 1 (which included the smallest trials; ratio of odds ratios 0. 68, 95 % confidence interval 0. 57 to 0. 82), 17 % larger in trials in quarter 2 (0. 83, 0. 75 to 0. 91), and 12 % larger in trials in quarter 3 (0. 88, 0. 82 to 0. 95).

40|$|A well {{designed}} clinical trial can provide beneficial results with minimal costs and minimal numbers of patients. One {{of the greatest}} hurdles in conducting a clinical trial is defining the entry criteria. Entry criteria that are too broad allow for an increased number of potential non-responders in the trial population. Entry criteria that are too narrow can exclude many potential responders. Implementing a screening test that can identify patients for targeted therapies who are likely responders {{on the basis of}} genetics, anatomy or biology allows researchers to better optimize the trial population. Finding the right trial population becomes an optimization problem that can be solved by implementing a mathematical and quantitative approach to predict the effects of the strictness or looseness of entry criteria. This thesis tests such a model based approach using realistic clinical data reconstructed from a published clinical trial of targeted drug therapy for lung cancer. An optimal set of inclusion criteria is defined based upon patient characteristics that can be determined from a pre-trial screening test. A mathematical model of the responsiveness of the trial population, based on available preliminary data, together with a mathematical model of the statistical analysis of trial data are combined to estimate the number of patients that must be screened and the number of patients accepted into the trial for each of many possible sets of inclusion criteria. These predictions of <b>trial</b> <b>size</b> are combined with realistic cost factors to estimate the total cost of the trial. The test scenario for the lung cancer study demonstrates that differing inclusion criteria can have a dramatic effect on <b>trial</b> <b>size,</b> duration, and cost and even success or failure of the trial at any cost. Model based analysis can impact the design of a clinical trial by decreasing the number of patients needed to show a statistical significant result as well as reducing the total cost of the trial. ...|$|E
40|$|In most {{randomised}} controlled trials (RCTs), a {{large number}} of patients need to be followed over many years, for the clinical benefit of the drug to be accurately quantified (1). Using an early proxy, or a surrogate endpoint, in place of the direct endpoint of overall survival (OS) could theoretically shorten the duration of RCTs and minimise the exposure of patients to ineffective or toxic treatments (2, 3). This thesis examined the relationship between surrogate endpoints and OS in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). A review of the literature identified 144 RCTs in metastatic CRC, 189 in advanced NSCLC and 133 in MBC. The publications were generally of poor quality with incomplete reporting on many key variables, making comparisons between studies difficult. The introduction of the CONSORT statement was associated with improvements in the quality of reporting. For CRC (337 arms), NSCLC (429 arms) and MBC (290 arms) there were strong relationships between OS and progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), disease control rate (DCR), response rate (RR) and partial response (PR). Correlation was also demonstrated between OS and complete response (CR) in CRC and duration of response (DOR) in MBC. However, while strong relationships were found, the proportion of variance explained by the models was small. Prediction bands constructed to determine the surrogate threshold effect size indicated that large improvements in the surrogate endpoints were needed to predict overall survival gains. PFS and TTP showed the most promise as surrogates. The gain in PFS and TTP required to predict a significant gain in overall survival was between 1. 2 and 7. 0 months and 1. 8 and 7. 7 months respectively, depending on <b>trial</b> <b>size</b> and tumour type.

The networks show that DIA authors tend to have greater reach in the networks and collaborate more often with non-DIA authors despite a preference toward their own group. Potential confounders include publication bias, <b>trial</b> <b>sizes,</b> and conclusions. Conclusions: Industry-based authors are more central in their networks and are deeply embedded within highly connected drug research communities. As a consequence, they {{have the potential to}} influence information flow in the production of evidence. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Back pain is {{a common}} concern amongst a growing {{population}} across the world today. Depending on the severity of a patient’s condition, and after conservative treatment options have been exhausted, total disc replacement (TDR) surgery may be prescribed as a corrective treatment. Several existing artificial disc implants {{are available on the}} market and are manufactured in standard sizes by means of conventional manufacturing processes – which typically involves machining operations. During surgery, surgeons try to select the most suitable implant size to match the patient’s anatomy by pushing various <b>trial</b> <b>sizes</b> into the vertebral space before placing the final implant. This trial-and-error technique relies heavily on the level of experience of the surgeon and could lead to TDR device under sizing and inaccurate positioning of the implant, which could lead to implant subsidence and bone fracture. As various imaging, software and manufacturing technologies have developed, the option for patient-specific implants by means of Rapid Manufacturing is becoming a realistic alternative. Patient-specific implants offer several potential clinical benefits to the patient, {{but it is important to}} investigate its cost implications. This paper discusses a cost model for patient-specific disc implants, and the potential advantages as well as challenges of using customized implants within the South African context...|$|R
