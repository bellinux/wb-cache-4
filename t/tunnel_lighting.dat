5000|$|In December 2007 it was {{announced}} that Tangara trains would not be running on the line due to steepness of the tunnel. The line owner, RailCorp, has denied that this is an engineering bungle, saying [...] "The Tangara trains, because they are not ideally suited to that steep gradient, will not be allocated to that line even though they can operate." [...] (In fact this restriction related solely to the initial shuttle service from Epping to Chatswood, planned for the opening of the line, which would have required the Tangara trains to be re-geared so that the motor cooling fans would run faster. The Tangara trains are running the through-service now (2017) as this allows the motors to cool at the higher track speeds outside the tunnel. S sets trains were also excluded, due to concerns over possible problems performing [...] "push-out" [...] duty (a loaded train pushing out another loaded train) on the gradients. In February 2008 it was revealed that mats, connected to the rail tracks and concrete slabs to reduce noise, have separated and needed to be replaced, with {{at least half of the}} 14 km of track to be re-laid. [...] On 23 October 2008 it was also confirmed during testing that sound levels on the train were 90 decibels, as loud as a 737 plane coming into land. Plans to rectify this would come at a cost that has already blown out from $1.4bn to $2.3bn.In July 2009 it was reported that drivers were being restricted to two return shuttle runs through the tunnel before taking a break as well being instructed to keep the lights on in the driver's cabin and lower the side window blinds in order to avoid a possible stroboscopic effect caused by the <b>tunnel</b> <b>lighting,</b> with claims it may have caused headaches, dizziness, fatigue and nausea.|$|E
