25|$|Many of Equitable's with-profits {{policies}} {{were designed to}} provide a pension for the policyholder on retirement, and the lump sum available to buy an annuity depended on the sum assured, the reversionary bonuses and the larger <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus.</b> Both types of bonus were allocated at the discretion of the directors in accordance with Article 65 of the Articles of Association, the total being intended to reflect the investment return earned over the lifetime of the policy, subject to smoothing.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, in Christopher Andrews v Barnett Waddingham LLP and RAJ Waddingham (2006) EWCA Civ 93, the {{claimant}} transferred from a [...] "safe" [...] employer's pension scheme {{to a commercial}} scheme {{on the advice of}} a firm of financial advisers. The breach of duty alleged was confined to advice about the protection afforded by the Policyholders Protection Act 1975 to [...] "with-profits" [...] annuities, and this duty was found to be breached by the first instance judge. The claimant would not have chosen the Equitable Life with-profits annuity if he had been given correct advice, but that did not entitle him to recover the loss he had sustained {{as a result of his}} acquiring the annuity. The 1975 Act would have applied if Equitable Life had become insolvent. That was not the case. The real cause of the loss was that the <b>terminal</b> <b>bonuses</b> were not guaranteed and were adversely affected by the downturn in Equitable Life's fortunes. So the negligence as pleaded and as found by the judge did not relate to the fact that the <b>terminal</b> <b>bonuses</b> were not guaranteed.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, Lloyds TSB {{agreed to}} buy the society for £7 billion. The society demutualised on 3 March 2000 {{as part of the}} acquisition. At the time of its takeover, Scottish Widows set up an [...] "additional account" [...] to hold £1.7 billion of the {{proceeds}} from the sale. This fund was to be used to enhance <b>terminal</b> <b>bonuses</b> across the company, but was eventually used to compensate guaranteed annuity rate options (GARs) holders.|$|R
25|$|Following a July 2000 House of Lords ruling, and {{the failure}} of {{attempts}} to find a buyer for the business, it closed to new business in December 2000 and reduced payouts to existing members. Lord Penrose's 2004 Equitable Life Inquiry found that the company had made over-generous payouts leading it to be under-funded. A 2007 European report concluded that regulators had focused on solvency margins and failed to consider the increasing risk of accrued <b>terminal</b> <b>bonuses.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On 20 July 2000 the House of Lords {{upheld the}} Appeal Court ruling. They {{concluded}} that GAR policies {{required that the}} guaranteed rate was applied to calculate the contractual annuity; and {{that the effect of}} the differential <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> rates was that the annuity was calculated at current annuity rates, not at the guaranteed rate, and was not lawful. [...] "The self-evident commercial object of the inclusion of guaranteed rates in the policy is to protect the policyholder against a fall in market annuity rates ... The supposition of the parties must be presumed to have been that the directors would not exercise their discretion [...] in conflict with contractual rights." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1998, {{because the}} GAR policyholders {{received}} a lower <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> than they expected (they expected the higher <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> and, in addition, the GAR rate) certain GAR policyholders complained. Mr Hyman was a representative policyholder. At no point, however, were the GAR policyholders ever paid less per annum (and {{nor was there}} ever any intention by the directors of Equitable Life to pay them less) than their guaranteed fund (i.e. excluding the non-contractual <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus)</b> times guaranteed annuity rate.|$|E
5000|$|Thus {{there is}} {{evidence}} that the House of Lords judges in the Hyman case had not been properly informed. If they had been, they might have concluded (as did Lord Scott in the High Court) that the lower <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus,</b> combined with the GAR rate, was within the directors' discretion, provided that the lower <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> rate was never negative (i.e. the minimum lower <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> rate was zero) thus ensuring that the GARs had the substantial benefit of a floor pension, a benefit which the non-GARs did not have.|$|E
5000|$|The {{directors}} of Equitable Life decided they {{would reduce the}} level of terminal bonuses for GAR policyholders, from the higher figure shown on the GAR policyholders' annual bonus notices, to a lower figure (if necessary to zero) so as to equalise the benefits so far as possible i.e. the policy proceeds with the higher <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> times the CAR rate equalled the policy proceeds with lower <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> times the GAR rate (the Differential <b>Terminal</b> <b>Bonus</b> Policy - DTBP). The Equitable's Annual Regulatory Returns, submitted each year to the regulatory authorities (the Department of Trade and Industry - DTI) had set out this practice since the 1993 (when the current annuity rate first fell below the guaranteed annuity rate). The Equitable's Annual Regulatory Returns had been scrutinized each year by the regulatory authorities and nothing adverse had been said by the regulatory authorities about the Equitable's Differential <b>Terminal</b> <b>Bonus</b> Policy (which had been introduced in 1993).|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} suggests that the regulator focused exclusively on solvency margins, and took little or no account of accrued terminal bonuses in its overall analysis of the financial health of the company. It quotes Penrose as saying that the Policyholders Reasonable Expectations (PRE) would have included <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> even if the amount was not defined; however the Government Actuary's Department (GAD) and the Treasury deny PRE existed as the <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> was not guaranteed.|$|E
50|$|The House of Lords {{unanimously}} {{agreed that}} there was an implied term in the Articles of Association such that the directors of Equitable Life could not exercise their discretion in the way they had because it defeated the reasonable expectations of the GAR policyholders as exemplified by Equitable having quoted the higher <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> on each GAR policyholders' annual bonus notice (no other life office had quoted <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> in its annual bonus notices to policyholders as <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> can only be determined at policy maturity because of the volatility of financial markets). Although there was no express term in Equitable Life's constitution that constrained the discretion of the directors, it was necessary to imply such a term to uphold the policyholders' reasonable expectations. Lord Steyn gave the leading judgment.|$|E
50|$|The <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> {{is awarded}} and paid at the {{maturity}} {{and sometimes the}} surrender of the policy. Thus, it is unknown before the maturity of contract. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the final bonus. The <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> represents the member's entitlement to a proportion of the fund that has been held back for the purpose of smoothing. In certain circumstances a Market Value Adjustor may be applied to reduce the overall policy value to limit the payout to a reasonable multiple of the member's fair share.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 Equitable {{exercised}} its discretion {{under that}} Article {{to reduce the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> of those policies with Guaranteed Annuity Rates, negating the benefit from the guarantee but preserving the assets of non-GAR policyholders.|$|E
50|$|The {{insurance}} company has some freedom {{to decide what}} mix of bonuses to pay. An {{insurance company}} may decide to pay low annual bonuses and a high <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus.</b> Such a policy will protect the insurance company from falls in the investment markets because annual bonuses cannot be taken away once given. However, this policy might be unattractive to investors {{because it does not}} contain many guarantees and offers a low rate of return (until the maturity of the policy).|$|E
5000|$|Thus {{the floor}} pension would {{therefore}} have been £9,376 p.a. (80,000 x 0.1172) whereas the corresponding non-GAR pension {{would have been}} only £6,035 p.a. (85,000 x [...]071). Thus, as 9,376/6,035=1.55, the advantage of having a GAR {{would have been a}} 55% increase in the pension payable (as opposed to the corresponding non-GAR policy) and therefore a substantial increase. Thus, in this example, realistic {{at the time of the}} Hyman judgement, it was not true that the differential <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> policy (DTBP) had deprived the GAR [...] "....of substantial value" [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{lesson that}} can be drawn {{is that if you}} have un-hedgeable {{guarantees}} in a with-profits fund any life company (because the financial market is incomplete) must have built up an Estate (spare money set aside for a rainy day) as the 'rainy day' may arrive (as it did with the collapse of interest rates and annuity rates). But, as Lord Penrose discovered, {{at the time of the}} Hyman judgment, Equitable Life had no Estate - indeed Equitable's Estate was negative i.e. Equitable's liabilities, even with the differential <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> policy (DTBP) being a lawful use of director's discretion, exceeded its assets.|$|E

5000|$|... secondly, as Lord Steyn (who {{gave the}} leading {{judgement}} in the House of Lords) stated [...] "..the {{directors of the}} Society resolved upon a differential policy {{which was designed to}} deprive the relevant guarantees of any substantial value". However, one substantial value of the guaranteed annuity rates was to create a floor pension (the guaranteed fund multiplied by the guaranteed annuity rate) for the GARs which those policies without GARs (non-GARs) did not have. In the case, for example, of market annuity rates at age 65 being 7.1% p.a. - not untypical of market annuity rates the time of the Hyman judgement (as opposed to a guaranteed annuity rate at 65 of 11.72% p.a. as stated in the GAR policy document) - a typical guaranteed fund might have been £80,000 and a typical <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> might have been £5,000 (thus total pension fund of £85,000=80,000+5,000).|$|E
50|$|Many of Equitable's with-profits {{policies}} {{were designed to}} provide a pension for the policyholder on retirement, and the lump sum available to buy an annuity depended on the sum assured, the reversionary bonuses and the larger <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus.</b> Both types of bonus were allocated at the discretion of the directors in accordance with Article 65 of the Articles of Association, the total being intended to reflect the investment return earned over the lifetime of the policy, subject to smoothing.Between 1956 and the advent of Personal Pension Schemes in July 1988, Equitable sold policies with an option to choose at the retirement date between a fixed Guaranteed Annuity Rate (GAR) or the Current Annuity Rate (i.e. the market annuity rate at that time) (CAR). The latter reflected the anticipated investment return on the lump sum over the annuity holder's lifetime and often changed depending on long-term interest yields and views on future longevity. No additional premium was charged in respect of the guarantee.|$|E
50|$|There is {{an amount}} {{guaranteed}} to be paid out called the sum assured and this can be increased {{on the basis of}} investment performance through the addition of periodic (for example annual) bonuses. Regular bonuses (sometimes referred to as reversionary bonuses) are guaranteed at maturity and a further non-guarantee bonus may be paid at the end known as a <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus.</b> During adverse investment conditions, the encashment value or surrender value may be reduced by a 'Market Value Reduction' or MVR (It is sometime referred to as a market value adjustment but this is a term in decline through pressure from the Financial Conduct Authority to use clearer terms). The idea of such a measure is to protect the investors who remain in the fund from others withdrawing funds with notional values that are, or risk being, in excess of the value of underlying assets at a time when stock markets are low. If an MVA applies an early surrender would be reduced according to the policies adopted by the funds managers at the time.|$|E
40|$|An actuarial {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to reveal the}} intrinsic nature of participating life insurance. The basic safe-side criterion is examined. It is established how the first order prospective net premium reserve includes safety margins or bonus loadings, and it is demonstrated how the bonus loadings are currently released. It is demonstrated how surplus may be distributed and accumulated as a <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> in an equitable way. The level premium is divided into a variable recurrent single premium and a variable natural premium, and {{an alternative to the}} prospective net premium reserve is examined. A capitalization of future safety margins or bonus loadings, which are related to past premiums and the paid-up benefit, may allow the insurance company a considerable increase in investment freedom. The theory is illustrated by numerical results.

40|$|Participating life {{insurance}} contracts {{are characterized by}} a minimum interest rate guarantee and pay dividends to its policyholder based on how well the issuing company is doing. These contracts are endowments that contain implicit options-like features such as minimum interest rate guarantees, stochastic annual surplus participation, <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> and a surrender option. The stable returns are obtained through the combination of guaranteed benefits and non-guaranteed bonuses that are paid to the policyholders. In the existing literature the options are priced under strong assumptions, such as constant interest rates, and only take univariate risk factors, such as stochastic stock prices, into account. In this thesis, we investigate {{the impact of the}} term structure, the long-term investment, the price inflation, the mortality, the surrender behavior and the implication of multivariate risk on the fair pricing of the single premium {{life insurance}} policy.

40|$|We {{construct}} the contingent claims models that price participating policies with rate guarantees and default risk. These policies {{are characterized by}} the sharing of profits from an investment portfolio between the insurer and the policyholders. A certain reserve distribution mechanism is employed to credit interest at or above certain specified guaranteed rate periodically to the policyholders. Besides the reversionary reserve distribution, <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> is also paid to the policyholders if the terminal surplus is positive. However, the insurer may default at maturity and the policyholders can only receive the residual assets. By neglecting market frictions, mortality risk and surrender option, and under certain assumptions on the interest rate crediting mechanism, {{we are able to}} find analytic approximation solution to the pricing model using perturbation techniques. We also develop effective finite difference algorithms for the numerical solution of the contingent claims models.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} the pricing models of several equity-linked insurance products and LIBOR exotic derivatives. Some analytic approximations and numerical methods {{are applied to}} value those products if the closed-form solution does not exist. Pricing behaviours are also explored. I first analyze the dynamic fund protection which entitles the investor the right to reset his investment fund value to a reference stock index value. With embedded early withdrawal right, the valuation of these protected funds can be modeled as a free boundary value problem. Next I construct the contingent claims models that price participating poli-cies with interest rate crediting mechanism, sharing profits from an investment portfolio. Usually the interest is credited to the policy holder at or above cer-tain specified guaranteed rate periodically. The policy holder may also receive a <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus.</b> However the insurer may default at maturity. Under certain assumptions, the perturbation technique is used to approximate the solution. The guaranteed annuity option provides the holder the right to either receive at retirement an assured accumulated fund or a life annuity at a fixed rate. I propose three analytic approximation methods including stochastic duration approach, Edgeworth expansion and analytic approximation in affine diffusions to value this option under a multi-factor interest rate model. The target redemption note is an index linked note that provides a guar-anteed sum of coupons (target cap) with possibility of early termination. In a typical structure, the first coupon payment is fixed. The subsequent coupons are calculated based on an inverse floating LIBOR / Euribor formula. Once the accumulated coupon has reached the pre-specified target cap, the note will be terminated with final payment of the par.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop more realistic long term asset models based on L´evy processes and discuss their applications to risk management of unitised with-profits policies. We investigate the behaviour of long-term returns of the UK total share return index by testing the common statistical properties for financial data, so-called “stylised facts”. We show that for the monthly U. K. share total return indices, the Gaussian return hypothesis is rejected in series of tests. The local distribution of the returns has higher kurtosis and heavier tails than the Gaussian. In addition, the returns series show significant nonlinear autocorrelation, extreme returns appear in clusters. The first long term asset model purposed in this thesis is the exponential L´evy model with non-Gaussian increment. We describe the Generalised Hyperbolic distributions with their subclasses. They are considered as candidate distributions for the increments of the driving L´evy processes. We estimate model parameters to the UK share gross total return index using two approaches, maximum likelihood (MLE) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit tests demonstrate that these L´evy driven models give more accurate fits to the historical equity index returns data. For the liability model we consider long term participating life insurance products specifically unitised with-profits contracts. The payouts of unitised with-profits policies are simulated {{under a variety of}} asset models driven by L´evy processes. At first a basic model policy is considered with limited insurer operations and no risk controls. We look into various risk measures of the maturity loss for the insurer xiii and compare the statistical properties for different non-Gaussian increment L´evy models. It is found that the classical Gaussian model substantially underestimates the risk measures in unitised with-profits policies. The L´evy driven models which have semi-heavy tailed increments are aggregate to normal distributions in the long run. Then we consider different retrospective bonus mechanisms by varying the participating rate and the smoothing period. As a comparison we use a bonus earning power method with deterministic projected maturity asset share and 25 percent <b>terminal</b> <b>bonus</b> cushion. We study the joint distributions of the maturity asset shares and guarantees under these two bonus mechanism. With similar risk measures, there are larger expected maturity guarantees under bonus earning power method than retrospective bonus. Declaring bonuses on a more frequent basis is then tested, which has the desired effect of reducing the risk measures when declaring monthly bonuses using bonus earning power mechanism. We make observations on two different investment strategies, a diversified investment strategy and a hedging based investment strategy. The former method tries to reduce the variance of the invest return distribution while the hedging investment strategy, on the other hand, narrows the left tail of the maturity loss distribution by paying an extra amount of expenses. Finally, the L´evy models are extended by using GARCH(1, 1) -m type volatility. Both maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators using Markov Chain Monte Carlo are presented. The statistical tests on the devolatilised data show that the GARCH model reduces the non-linear autocorrelation in the conditional return processes and furthermore improve the fitting of the asset models. Also, multi-variable models are considered. Stochastic bridges driven by L´evy processes are constructed while the yearly returns follow the Wilkie model.
