30|$|Secondly, {{transfer}} payment {{from the central}} government <b>is</b> <b>bias</b> towards large and medium cities, and such bias of {{transfer payment}}s <b>is</b> likely <b>to</b> increase the difference between cities and countryside, which will obstruct the goal of achieving unified urban and rural development.

If the transfer payment system continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bias</b> towards large and medium cities, the gap between Western China and other parts of China in terms of overall level of urbanization will continue to increase, as the less urbanized region gets less governmental support.|$|R

25|$|Total {{recorded}} doses {{to individual}} workers in Chernobyl recovery operations {{during the period}} through 1990 ranged from less than 10 millisieverts (less than 1 rem) to more than 1 sievert (100 rems), due primarily to external radiation.

In contrast, appropriate checkerboard detection <b>is</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bias</b> free.

25|$|One form of imputed bias {{is based}} on the {{decision-maker}} being a party to a suit, or having a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of the decision. Once this fact has been established, the bias is irrebuttable and disqualification is automatic – the decision-maker will be barred from adjudicating the matter without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. A classic case is Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), which involved an action between Dimes, a local landowner, and the proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, had affirmed decrees made to the proprietors. However, it was discovered by Dimes that Lord Cottenham in fact owned several pounds worth of shares in the Grand Junction Canal. This eventually led to the judge being disqualified from deciding the case. There was no inquiry as to whether a reasonable person would consider Lord Cottenham <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>biased,</b> or as to the circumstances which led Lord Cottenham to hear the case.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{source for the}} period is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals in Old English narrating {{the history of the}} Anglo-Saxons. [...] The Chronicle was a West Saxon production, however, and is sometimes thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> in favour of Wessex. Charters dating from Beorhtwulf's reign have survived; these were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by the kings who had the authority to grant the land. [...] A charter might record the names of both a subject king and his overlord on the witness list appended to the grant. [...] Such a witness list can be seen on the Ismere Diploma, for example, where Æthelric, son of king Oshere of the Hwicce, is described as a [...] "subregulus", or subking, of Æthelbald of Mercia.|$|E

There seems no logical basis, to the eliminativist, for making an exception just because folk psychology has lasted longer and is more intuitive or instinctively plausible than the other folk theories. Indeed, the eliminativists warn, considerations of intuitive plausibility may be precisely the result of the deeply entrenched nature in society of folk psychology itself. It may be that people's beliefs and other such states are as theory-laden as external perceptions and hence intuitions will tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>biased</b> in favor of them.|$|E
