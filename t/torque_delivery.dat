40|$|In {{domestic}} {{automotive industry}} {{the need for}} transition from transmission with manual control to automatic gearboxes (GB) emerged long ago. Regarding the leading foreign manufacturers (Allison, ZF, Eaton, etc.), an experience in design of automatic transmissions {{and the level of}} technological development is incomparably small. Thus, to have an informed choice of the gearbox structure types and control system is a relevant problem. Application efficiency of this or other gearbox depends both on its adaptability to the actual operating conditions and on the quality of transition refinement. This paper analyzes the special features of the gear change process in the most common types of automatic gearboxes. Constructive feasibilities of an "ideal" gear change (without power loss) and strategies for gear shifting are compared. The paper offers an overview of common problems when achieving these goals and the ways to solve them. An automatic transmission of the particular type used in the wheeled vehicles under off-road conditions determines the probability of maintaining their mobility. This is due to the phenomenon of wheel`s breakdown to slipping caused by sharp increase of torque on the wheel. Planetary hydromechanical transmissions (AT) provide continuous input torque to the wheels, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture and use. Besides, to provide a high number of density ratios in them is more complicated than in the automated and manual transmissions (AMT). This is important when moving long in the lower gears under difficult conditions. Compared with AT dual clutch transmissions due to design features require even more precise and fast control system of actuators and engine. Automation of constant-mesh or synchromesh transmissions provides a significant reduction in the duration of interruption in <b>torque</b> <b>delivery.</b> If {{it is not enough to}} increase mobility in the harsh conditions, a rational choice is to use a transmission type of TCCT (torque converter – clutch – (constant-mesh or synchromesh) transmission). Adding the torque converter to AMT increases the durability of clutch and synchronizers. It reduces the amount of gear changes and duration of interruption in <b>torque</b> <b>delivery.</b> Thus, the cost and repair complexity of such a transmission is much lower than those of AT.

40|$|Engine {{downsizing}} is {{a proven}} approach to reduce CO 2 emissions and improve fuel economy, but {{the approach is}} predicated on achieving high specific power without compromising reliability, drivability, or cost. One approach to engine downsizing is advanced pressure charging, placing challenging demands upon the pressure charging system. This paper addresses engine downsizing in the embodiment of a high performance and high specific power 2. 0 L gasoline engine simulated using Ricardo WAVE software. With best available conventional, single-stage turbocharger technology, the boosting system requires augmentation to maintain the same steady-state torque profile as a naturally aspirated engine of the same power and also to maintain an acceptable transient response, particularly at lower engine speeds.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{research}} {{intended to}} integrate robots into the anthropic domains {{has introduced a}} new set of challenges with regard to design and control of such robots. Among these challenges, human safety is perhaps one the most predominant issues. While, existing solution relies on highly specialized and high cost actuation mechanisms, a new generation of intrinsically safe robots (manipulators) that use alternative technologies is yet to prevail. There is however a general consensus that the conventional actuation mechanisms are not capable of providing intrinsic safety while maintaining the high performance of the robot. On these premisses, a new Magneto-Rheological (MR) based actuation mechanism was developed in our research group. The actuator uses a magnetic field to precisely control its output <b>torque</b> <b>delivery.</b> The actuator demonstrates remarkable mass to torque ratio and low output inertia, at the same time, its bandwidth is comparable, if not better, than current leading actuators. The output torque of the actuator however, is hysterically related to its input current which makes its control challenging. The objective of the current work is to obtain a precise open-loop model that relates the output torque to the applied input current. The advantages of the obtained model are twofold. While such a model enables accurate control of the actuator, hence the actuated mechanism; in our case a robotic arm, it also eliminates the need for a force/torque sensor for performing high fidelity force/torque control tasks. To validate the accuracy of the constructed model simulation results for the output torques are presented and compared to those measured experimentally using the prototyped actuation mechanism. Results agreements attest to the validity of the presented model...|$|E

The paper is in closed access until 1 st March 2016. A 2 -stroke combustion cycle has higher power output densities {{compared to a}} 4 -stroke cycle counterpart. The modern down-sized 4 -stroke engine design can greatly benefit from this attribute of the 2 -stroke cycle. By using appropriate variable valvetrain, boosting, and direct fuel injection systems, both cycles can be feasibly implemented on the same engine platform. In this research study, two valve strategies for achieving a two-stroke cycle in a four-stroke engine have been studied. The first strategy is based on balanced compression and expansion strokes, while the gas exchange is done through two different strokes. The second approach is a novel 2 -stroke combustion strategy - here referred to as 2 -stroke Miller - which maintains the expansion as achieved in a 4 -stroke cycle but suppresses the gas exchange into the compression stroke. The first 2 -stroke cycle generated a torque increment of 63 % at 1000 rpm on a supercharged 4 -stroke engine without increasing the maximum cylinder pressures. The second 2 -stroke strategy - which uses the Miller cycle concept - generated a torque increase of 51. 5 % at 1000 rpm and higher thermal efficiencies than the first valve strategy. The 2 -stroke Miller cycle has been proposed {{as a means of}} transitioning from 4 to 2 -stroke with progressive <b>torque</b> <b>delivery</b> and without requiring a throttled intake. The 2 -stroke cycle appears to be a potential solution to overcome some of the difficulties faced by downsized gasoline engines during high load operations. In particular this cycle will be beneficial in a condition where the engine is already operating at peak cylinder pressures and additional torque output is not easily achievable...|$|E
40|$|Tremor, {{characterized}} by involuntary and rhythmical movements, {{is the most}} common movement disorder. Tremors can have peripheral and central oscillatory components which properly assessed and separated may improve diagnostics. An MR-safe haptic wrist manipulator enables simultaneous measurement of proprioceptive reflexes (peripheral components) and brain activations (central components) through fMRI. For such a MR-safe manipulator, this study determined the design criteria, created the design and presented its prototype. The prototype is divided into an MR-safe and MR-unsafe part. The hydraulic MR-safe vane motor (end effector) and optical sensors in the MR-environment are connected to the MR-unsafe part in the control room via hydraulic tubes and optical fibers. As a result, the fMRI quality is ensured and the manipulator is suited for safe use in any MR-environment. During a test in an MR-scanner (AMC, Amsterdam) no distortions in the MR-image or sensor signal were observed. The vane motor has a range of motion of 134 ° with a designed <b>torque</b> <b>delivery</b> of 8 Nm at a 3 bar pressure difference. The achieved accuracy for the torque sensor is ± 2 % full scale (F. S. = 14. 3 Nm) and for the absolute position sensor ± 1 % full scale (F. S. = 70 = 1. 22 rad). The prototype vane motor had some leakage along the axis, this prevented the use of pre-pressure and consequently reduced the bandwidth and maximum torque. However the maximum achieved torque of 1. 5 Nm was still enough to met the requirement of 1. 2 Nm. A PI controller was used to control the system, however this controller could not cope with the inherent non-linearities of hydraulics over the intended bandwidth (20 Hz). Despite the fact that the controller was not optimal, typical responses were obtained with impedance FRFs of two inertial loads. For future research it is recommended to remedy the axis leakage and implement a model-based controller. The open-loop FRF of the commanded velocity to the measured vane velocity was determined to characterize the system. Even with leakage and without pre-pressure, the measured bandwidth (- 3 dB) was approximately 5 Hz and the - 180 ° phase is passed at 7 Hz. Although the bandwidth does not fulfill the requirement for proprioceptive reflex identification it does allow for various motor control experiments. With the recommendations carried out, it is expected that the next prototype will be suited for proprioceptive reflex identification during fMRI.

The equations are applied to model Motor X using symbolically-oriented methods with the computer tool Mathematica to determine: (1) the values of current-phase angle and voltage-phase angle that are uniquely determined once a base speed has been selected; (2) the attainable current in the voltage-limited region above base speed as a function of terminal voltage, speed, and current-phase angle; (3) the attainable current in the voltage-limited region above base speed as a function of terminal voltage, speed, and voltage-phase angle; (4) the maximum-power output in the voltage-limited region above base speed as a function of speed; (5) the optimal voltage-phase angle in the voltage-limited region above base speed required to obtain maximum-power output; (6) the maximum-power speed curve which was linear from rest to base speed in the current limited region below base speed; (7) the current angle as a function of saliency ratio in the current-limited region below base speed; and (8) the torque as a function of saliency ratio which is almost linear in the current-limited region below base speed. The equations were applied to model Motor X using numerically-oriented methods with the computer tool LabVIEW. The equations were solved iteratively to find optimal current and voltage angles that yield maximum power and maximum efficiency from rest through the current-limited region to base speed and then through the voltage-limited region to high-rotational speeds. Currents, voltages, and reluctance factors were all calculated and external loops were employed to perform additional optimization with respect to PM pitch angle (magnet fraction) and with respect to magnet strength. The conclusion was that the optimal-magnet fraction for Motor X is 0. 72 which corresponds to a PM pitch angle of 130 {sup o}, a value close to the maximum-saliency ratio in a plot of saliency ratio versus PM pitch angle. Further, the strength of Motor X magnets may be lowered to 80 % of full strength without significantly impacting motor performance for PM pitch angles between the peak saliency (130 {sup o}) and peak-characteristic current (160 {sup o}). It is recommended that future research involve maximizing a driving-cycle-weighted efficiency based on the Federal Urban Driving Cycle and the Federal Highway Driving Cycle as criteria for selecting the final optimal-PM fraction and magnet strength for this inset PM motor. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the reduction in PM torque due to reduced-magnet fraction will be more than compensated by the reluctance torque resulting from the higher saliency ratio. It seems likely that the best overall performance will require saliency; consequently, we think the best motor will be a reluctance-assisted PM motor.

40|$|Engine DesignThis {{project was}} aimed at {{developing}} an orbital internal combustion engine (ICE) technology that is able to combust {{a wide range of}} fuels that can be converted into useable energy that currently are not being utilized. The key difference that sets this engine apart from all other internal combustion engine’s is that the combustion chambers themselves rotate with the output shaft around a fixed cam. Similar orbital engine’s were used earlier in the 20 th century predominantly in aircrafts. These engine’s faded out of production in the 1950 ’s due to high maintenance demands due to worn cams and lubrication issues. With the today’s technologic improvements, the shortfalls of the engine can now be mitigated with advances in material science lubricants and manufacturing. These engine’s offer comparatively high outputs and never before have they been modeled to explore their true potential. The concept engine being investigated operates at a very slow speed and has the advantage of being able to alter the piston trajectory by altering the cam geometry. This level of customization is impossible in traditional crank slider configurations. The slower rpm allows the combustion of very low grade fuels that are currently not being utilized commercially as an energy source while producing good output when compared to current internal combustion technologies. Conventional engine simulation software was used to explore the performance potential for this engine configuration. An initial simulation model was verified against an existing prototype and a second model was created to aid in a second generation engine that is currently being developed. These models were used to explore the engine’s capability and optimal configuration. The results of a multitude of simulations were used to create a calculator for industry that uses Microsoft excel to access and interpolate from the data to predict performance for possible variants and to aid in future prototype designs without the need for the software package. The primary focus of the research was to investigate how engine performance was affected by manipulating the piston trajectory, velocity and dwell time near TDC and BDC by adjusting the cam profile. This has proven to have very large implications concerning the engine’s output. It was discovered that by prolonging the time the piston spent at the extremities of its stroke (relative to crank rotation, or in this case, engine rotation) greatly improved combustion and engine performance. Prolonging the time the piston spends near bottom dead centre (BDC) allowed more time for air and fuel to enter the combustion chamber. With the addition of a highly pressurized crankcase, this proved to highly successful in improving performance at higher RPM. Prolonging the time the piston spends near top dead centre (TDC) after ignition lead too much higher pressure being developed during the power stroke, which is advantageous for volumetric efficiency and combusting slower burning fuels. Increasing the dwell time at TDC had the most benefit to performance predominantly at lower RPM. These tuning capabilities make the engine very versatile and highly desirable. The results of tuning the piston trajectories using Ricardo Wave software has lead to a potential 60 % increase in peak torque on the engine as well as raising the <b>torque</b> <b>delivery</b> over the entire RPM spectrum. This analysis also provided critical information to aid {{in the development of the}} 2 nd generation engine in respect to breathing and the forces acting on each of the engine components. This research into the influence of dwell and how it can be manipulated to improve the efficiency of combustion is likely to have influences in other ICE applications and development and help push the envelope for better efficiencies and the use of alternative fuels...|$|E
