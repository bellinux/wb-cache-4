5|$|In 1985, Dallas {{electrician}} and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) {{is diagnosed}} with AIDS and given 30 days to live. He initially refuses {{to accept the}} diagnosis, but remembers having unprotected sex {{with a woman who}} was an intravenous drug user. He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as this is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> determine if the drug is working.|$|E
25|$|I can't talk {{fellowship}} to you who {{are gathered}} here. Too much blood has been spilled. I know from my experience {{it is up to}} the working people to save themselves. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{recirculation}} {{would significantly}} improve {{the function of}} these machines. It {{has been argued that}} efficient recirculation is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be viable. Electrons or ions move through the device without striking a surface, reducing conduction losses. Bussard stressed this; specifically emphasizing that electrons need to move through all cusps of the machine.|$|E

25|$|Large sharks {{species are}} apex predators in their environment, {{and thus have}} little fear of any {{creature}} (other than orcas) with which they cross paths. Like most sophisticated hunters, they are curious when they encounter something unusual in their territories. Lacking any limbs with sensitive digits such as hands or feet, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> explore an object or organism is to bite it; these bites are known as test bites. Generally, shark bites are exploratory, and the animal will swim away after one bite. For example, exploratory bites on surfers {{are thought to be}} caused by the shark mistaking the surfer and surfboard for the shape of prey. Nonetheless, a single bite can grievously injure a human if the animal involved is a powerful predator such as a great white or tiger shark.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{what the}} Dragon means, Henry leads {{everyone}} {{back to the}} fountain, where he proceeds to wish for his family to be brought back, encouraging Emma, Regina, Gold, and Violet to do the same. Suddenly, the crystal starts to pulsate. Henry then climbs a statue and convinces the citizens of New York City to help them return magic to the world. The portal opens in the Bethesda fountain, and Gold walks through it. Hook, Snow, David, Jekyll and Zelena appear {{in front of the}} others. Regina, Henry, Emma, and Violet see them in the Bethesda fountain as they reunited. Unfortunately, Henry is left saddened that the crowd believed that the rescue was simply an illusion; Emma consoles him, explaining that it's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> understand it. She was much like them until his near-death experience forced her to believe in magic.|$|E
25|$|Social class {{mobility}} {{could be}} low because of housing inequality. People who live or {{were born in}} the housing inequality, they have more problems to solve instead of making money. And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does our next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but this is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get into higher class in the future. Not so many of people can make it.|$|E

5000|$|Reading for the Future (RFF) is an {{international}} group which encourages literacy and reading {{through the use of}} speculative fiction. Some regional groups collect new and used books which are then distributed free of charge to schools and libraries.

25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives and she might take him away and kill him. He still went to the Peepul tree and she called out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E
500|$|Gus decides {{they need}} to see the safe; however, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> access it is through the {{ventilation}} shafts. When opening a panel to access the shaft system, they discover Manheim's dead body. Shawn [...] "psychically" [...] reveals this to the police, using {{it as a way to}} distract them while he watches the security footage for the vault. After viewing the footage, they hold a bachelor party where Shawn questions all of the attendees. Shawn talks with Lacey Maxwell (Christine Chatelain), the sister of the groom, who asks him to get her bouquet from a locked cooler, but he can't. Before the wedding, the bouquets are passed out, and Lacey panics when hers isn't there. Lacey reveals she is a magician when she helps to calm down the flower girl. Shawn realizes who stole the ring and killed Manheim, but his realization occurs in the middle of the ceremony. Shawn interrupts the wedding with a [...] "psychic episode", and exposes Lacey to everyone.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E

Peacekeepers were originally bodyguards working for the [...] "Peacemakers", but after they left, the Peacekeepers maintained order <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> knew: with weaponry. This eventually turned the Peacekeepers into a military empire. The Peacekeepers {{are known to be}} ruthless, but extremely effective.|$|R
25|$|Like fellow South African {{jazz musicians}} Dollar Brand and Hugh Masekela, <b>they</b> {{understood}} that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> could play freely was by escaping the oppressive {{social and political}} climate of their home country. As a mixed-race band (McGregor the sole white member), they were especially prone to police harassment. In mid-1964, they left South Africa.|$|R

A charity, the June Hancock Mesothelioma Research Fund, was {{established}} shortly after her death to support victims of mesothelioma and mesothelioma research projects.|$|E

5000|$|The team {{originated}} from students {{but was not}} [...] "officially" [...] affiliated with the school until it joined the EPRU in 1988/89, as the affiliation with a school was required even for NCAA club sports and it was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> could schedule games against other colleges.

50|$|During that time, Salomon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} throughout the NHL as the top players' owner.
