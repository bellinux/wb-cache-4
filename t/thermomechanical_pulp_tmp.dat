40|$|Chips from pine wood were {{subjected}} to <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (<b>TMP)</b> at 140 and 180 degrees C for 5 minutes, whereas the cooked chips were defibrated using a single disk pressurized refiner at the same temperatures (140 and 180 degrees C). The fibres were tested for some of their morphological properties including fibre length, fibre width, cell-wall thickness. Moreover, the fine fibre fraction (zero fibres) {{and the content of}} splinters were also estimated. The results reveal, that increasing the temperature during <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> decreases the fibre length, the cell width and the fibre wall thickness.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} measure the wettability of <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (<b>TMP)</b> from wood. Handsheets were made from pine TMP produced at different pulping temperatures (140 °C, 160 °C and 175 °C). A coloured waterdrop (0. 1 % aniline-blue solution) is added {{on the surface of}} a handsheet. The wettability is defined by the time elapsed from applying the waterdrop on the handsheet until its total penetration. The results reveal that pulping temperature influences the wettability of the TMP. The wettability of the TMP decreases with increasing pulping temperatures during the refining process...|$|R
40|$|For the <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (<b>TMP)</b> process both {{wood chip}} {{quality and the}} {{refining}} process have important effects on the resulting pulp and paper quality. Properties of wood raw material give a framework for final <b>pulp</b> properties. During <b>TMP</b> refining the specific energy consumption and refining intensity strongly impact fibre and pulp qualities. Increasing specific energy consumption benefits the development of fibres and improves their properties. However, high intensity refining tends to shorten the fibres and produces more fines content when compared with low intensity refining. This review focuses {{on the influence of}} key variables of chip qualities and the refining process on <b>TMP</b> <b>pulp</b> and paper qualities...|$|R

40|$|Medium density fibreboards (MDF) from pine wood {{were made}} using fibres {{generated}} by the conventional <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (<b>TMP)</b> and chemo-thermomechanical <b>pulping</b> (CTMP). As binders alkaline curing phenolformaldehyde resin (PF-resin), tanninformaldehyde resin (TF-resin) and a binder based on polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (PMDI) were used. The results reveal that boards prepared from CTMP are superior in bending strength, transverse tensile strength and transverse tensile strength after boil test (V 100 value) compared to boards from TMP. However, boards prepared from CTMP are slightly higher in thickness swelling and water absorption, the degree depends on the used resin. Further, {{the results indicate that}} using the blender gluing technique leads to better physical-mechanical properties of the boards than the conventional blowline gluing technique...|$|R

40|$|Fibre {{flexibility}} is often anticipated {{to play a}} role in fibre flocculation phenomena. In this study, 3 <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (<b>TMPs)</b> were sampled along a post-refining line. The only fibre morphological property that varied was fibre flexibility. These TMP samples were then tested for fibre flocculation and sheet formation tendency. The measurements clearly showed that fibre flocculation decreased and sheet formation uniformity increased with increasing fibre flexibility. The beneficial effect of fibre flexibility was larger at high consistency. These results support the elastic energy storage theory within flocs, which states that the more rigid the fibre, the stronger the flocs. Papermakers may take advantage of the beneficial effect of fibre flexibility on sheet formation through a careful tuning of post-refining...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphological}} {{changes of}} jack pine (Pinus banksiama) earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW) in <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (<b>TMP)</b> were studied by light microscopy and scanning electronic microscopy. The results indicate that: under the mechanical forces in refining, the EW fibres tend to separate in the P/S 1 interface, while {{separation of the}} LW fibres takes place commonly in the P/S 1 and S 1 /S 2 regions. The thick-walled LW fibres exhibit much more external fibrillation than the thin-walled EW. As a result, the LW fines contain more fibrillar component than EW fines. The EW fibers suffer more fiber cutting and splitting than the LW fibers. In addition, the thin-walled EW fibres show higher collapsibility and conformability than the LW counterparts...|$|R
40|$|<b>Thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (<b>TMP)</b> is {{a highly}} energy {{intensive}} process {{where most of the}} energy is used in therefining of chips to fibres. Various ways of reducing the energy consumption have earlier been studied, for examplechange of refiner pattern, addition of various chemicals, and also some biochemical implementation in the form of fungus and enzymes. This study includes pre-trials with the enzymes pectin lyase and pectin esterase,multipectinase, xylanase, and mannanase. The results are studied via a reducing sugar assay, an enzymatic assayusing spectrophotometry, and capillary zone electrophoresis. The study also includes results from a pilot scalerefining with multipectinase, xylanase, and mannanase, performed with a wing refiner at Helsinki University.

50|$|The mill {{was renamed}} Norske Skog Parenco. As of 2005 it {{produced}} 419,000 tonnes of newsprint and magazine paper. Fiber was sourced 75 percent from deinked pulp and 25 percent for woodpulp processed as <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>TMP),</b> imported from Germany and Belgium. Due {{to the global}} decline in newsprint demand, Norske Skog shut down PM2 in June 2009. This resulted {{in the number of}} employees being reduced from 425 to 255. Meanwhile the TMP production and one of the deinking lines was terminated.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} {{mechanical}} pulps: <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>TMP)</b> and groundwood pulp (GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed into steam heated refiners, where the chips are squeezed and converted to fibres between two steel discs. In the groundwood process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres. Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, >95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time. Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres, thus producing weak paper. Although large amounts of electrical energy are required to produce mechanical pulp, it costs less than the chemical kind.|$|E
5000|$|Manufactured {{grindstones}} with embedded {{silicon carbide}} or aluminum oxide {{can be used}} to grind small wood logs called [...] "bolts" [...] to make stone pulp (SGW). If the wood is steamed prior to grinding it is known as pressure ground wood pulp (PGW). Most modern mills use chips rather than logs and ridged metal discs called refiner plates instead of grindstones. If the chips are just ground up with the plates, the pulp is called refiner mechanical pulp (RMP) and if the chips are steamed while being refined the pulp is called <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> (<b>TMP).</b> Steam treatment significantly reduces the total energy needed to make the pulp and decreases the damage (cutting) to fibres. Mechanical pulps are used for products that require less strength, such as newsprint and paperboards.|$|E
50|$|Chemical pulping {{achieves}} this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules {{which can}} be washed away from the cellulose fibres without depolymerizing the cellulose fibres (chemically depolymerizing the cellulose weakens the fibres). The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical (RMP) pulping, physically tear the cellulose fibres one from another. Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres. Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. Related hybrid pulping methods {{use a combination of}} chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres. These hybrid methods include <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (<b>TMP)</b> and chemithermomechanical <b>pulping</b> (CTMP). The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.|$|R
40|$|Using FT (Fourier-transform) Raman and FT {{infrared}} (IR) spectroscopies, a new {{band was}} detected at 1675 cm- 1; this {{was most likely}} to have come from the yellow chromophores in photoexposed <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (<b>TMPs).</b> On the basis of spectroscopic studies that involved both o- and p-quinone models and Fremy’s salt-oxidized TMP, the 1675 cm- 1 band is assigned to the p-quinone functional group. Moreover, in the presence of known photoyellowing inhibitors, the photoyellowing behavior of methyl hydroquinone was similar to that of TMPs. Another important finding was that the molecular oxygen sensitivity of the laser-induced fluorescence (excited at 514. 5 nm) of p-quinone and hydroquinone models was similar to what had been previously observed for yellowed and unyellowed TMPs. Taken together, these results provide strong support for a previously suggested yellowing hypothesis in which a hydroquinone/p-quinone couple was seen as an important leucochromophore/ chromophore system in mechanical pulps...|$|R

40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{a new type}} of recoverable complexing agent (chelating surfactant) has been compared with a conventional complexing agent; diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), in the metal ion sequestering of <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (<b>TMP)</b> to be hydrogen peroxide bleached. After different degrees of washing of the pulps, bleaching experiments at different total alkali charges were performed with and without sodium silicate additions, and the ISO brightness of hand-made sheets was measured. The residual hydrogen peroxide in the bleaching liquor was also determined. No significant difference in either the brightness development or the residual hydrogen peroxide content could be detected between the pulps treated with equivalent molar ratios of the different complexing agents. Furthermore, the recovery of the chelating surfactant-manganese complexes from laboratory made white water by froth flotation was also studied. Two different foaming agents; sodium dodecyl sulphonate (SDS) and dimethyldodecylamine oxide (DDAO), were tested in the froth generation. After an addition of 160 ppm of DDAO, more than 80 % of the manganese chelates could be recovered in the foam, containing 3 % of the initial water mass...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research work was to study the wettability of <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (<b>TMP)</b> prepared from heart- and sapwood of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris [L. ]). The TMP were prepared at different pulping temperatures (150 °C, 180 °C). Furthermore, <b>thermomechanical</b> (<b>TMP)</b> and chemo-thermomechanical <b>pulps</b> (CTMP) from Norway spruce (Picea abies [Karst. ]) were also investigated. In this case both TMP and CTMP were prepared at 140 °C and 180 °C. Sheets of all pulps were prepared according to a method developed by Roffael et al. (2002). Sheets of <b>TMP</b> <b>pulps</b> from pine sapwood showed much better wettability compared with their counterparts from heartwoods. Pulps from heartwood experienced a dramatic decrease in their wettability when increasing the pulping temperature from 150 °C to 180 °C. In contrast increasing the temperature from 150 ° to 180 °C {{seems to have no}} deleterious effect on the wettability of pulps prepared from sapwood. This phenomenon has been explained by the higher extractive content in pine wood. Comparing <b>TMP</b> and CTMP <b>pulps</b> from Norway spruce leads to the result that in general CTMP pulps are of higher wettability. This {{can be attributed to the}} high hydrophobic extractive content in <b>TMP</b> <b>pulps</b> on the one hand and to the higher alkalinity of CTMP pulps on the other hand...|$|R
40|$|Paper is {{comprised}} of quasi-randomly distributed fibres, fines and different additives. The properties of paper depend {{on the type of}} fibres used, their uniformity of distribution, the amount and type of fines and fillers. It is difficult to predict how a particular component will behave in a mixture. This will depend on the form of material introduced (flocculated or dispersed) and on what kind of interactions will take place. These factors can be controlled by various wet-end strategies based on known colloidal behaviour of various additives. Thus, applying this knowledge to papermaking, one should be able to predict and control final structures of paper, which will be reflected in optical and mechanical properties. A thorough understanding of the effects of different materials, such as fines and fillers, on optical and mechanical properties of paper can only be obtained from a systematic study. Therefore, this research focused on elucidating the relationship between the nature and amount of fines and fillers and paper properties. The studies were mainly limited to papers made from <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (<b>TMP),</b> although occasionally comparisons with other pulps were made as well...|$|R

Protein isolated from TMP was analyzed for amino acid composition. There was about twice the amount of acidic amino acid material compared with basic amino acids, {{and the presence of}} glucosamine indicated that the isolated polypeptides also contained glycoproteins.

40|$|The work {{is related}} to the use of <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (<b>TMP)</b> {{prepared}} from recycling UF-bonded particle- and fibreboards as a partial substitute for TMP made directly from wood in MDF. The results reveal that TMP from recycling boards show striking differences in their morphological characteristics and chemical properties compared to TMP prepared directly from wood. TMP from recycling boards are of shorter fibre length and higher content of fine fraction. Moreover, their cold water extractives are of higher pH-value and contain appreciably higher amounts of acetate and formate ions. TMP from recycling boards releases also more formaldehyde compared to TMP made directly from wood. Moreover, the results clearly show that TMP from recycling boards can be used up to 30 % as a partial substitute for TMP from wood in making UF-bonded MDF without any noteworthy deterioration of the physical-mechanical board properties. Also, the formaldehyde release of the boards made using TMP from recycling boards experiences no negative change. Only small differences were found in the content of formate and acetate ions {{as well as in the}} release of volatile acids from MDF made from recycling fibre- and particleboards on the one side and boards directly made from wood on the other side.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between the fibre flexibility and cross-sectional area moment of inertia of <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulp</b> fibres was investigated. The main effects of refining {{were found to be}} internal fibrillation, external fibrillation, and fibre shortening. Internal fibrillation increases fibre flexibility and fibre collapsibility, improving fibre-to-fibre contact in a paper sheet. The raw materials used were pulps produced from six different Norway spruce logs and six different Scots pine logs, chosen in a manner that allowed variation of fibre wall thickness and fibril angle independently. Each wood sample was refined in four stages using a pressurized 12 " Sprout Waldron single disc refiner. Fibre flexibility was assessed by FiberMaster bendability measurements. Fibre bendability was measured on the + 48 Bauer McNett fractions of the twelve 2 nd, 3 rd, and 4 th stage <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulps</b> (<b>TMP).</b> The fibre cross-sectional samples were imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An image analysis method to calculate the area moment of inertia of each fibre using numerical integration was developed. Fiber bendability increased with specific energy consumption for both wood species (spruce and pine) from the 2 nd refining stage to the fourth refining stage. Spruce had a higher rate of bendability increase than pine upon refining. It was expected that fibres with a low area moment of inertia would result in higher bendability, but no such correlation was found for either spruce or pine. Fibre bendability increased with internal fibrillation, as assessed from Simons staining. These results imply that local damage of the fibre wall such as delaminations, kinks, and compressions was the main effect in increasing the flexibility through refining of TMP...|$|R
40|$|Lipophilic extractives in {{wood and}} other {{lignocellulosic}} materials exert a highly negative impact in {{pulp and paper}} manufacturing causing the so-called pitch deposits. As an alternative to physicochemical methods, lipases have been successfully applied to softwood mechanical pulping. 1 However, the enzymes and microbial inocula available till present are only effective on some raw materials and processes. Recently, we have shown {{for the first time}} the effectiveness of the laccase-mediator system (LMS) in removing pulp lipids regardless the pulping process and raw material used. 2, 3, 4 In these studies, pulp samples from eucalypt kraft <b>pulping,</b> spruce <b>thermomechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> (<b>TMP),</b> and flax soda-anthraquinone (AQ) pulping were treated with laccase in the presence of 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole as redox mediator. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses of the extracts from the enzymatically-treated pulps revealed that most of the lipophilic compounds were efficiently removed by the LMS treatment. Free and conjugated sitosterol, the main responsible for pitch deposits in eucalypt kraft pulp manufacturing, was completely removed. In spruce <b>TMP</b> <b>pulp,</b> LMS degraded most of the resin acids, sterol esters and triglycerides. In the flax soda-AQ pulp, sterols and long-chain fatty alcohols were almost completely removed. Small amounts of oxidation products (including 7 -oxositosterol and stigmasta- 3, 5 -dien- 7 -one mainly derived from free and esterified sitosterol, respectively) were identified. Pulp and papermaking properties of the enzymatically-treated pulps were also evaluated. It is possible to conclude that LMS treatment is an efficient method to remove pitch-causing lipophilic compounds from hardwood, softwood and nonwood paper pulps, at the same time that their lignin content is reduced.
