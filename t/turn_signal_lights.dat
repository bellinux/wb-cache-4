25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from rear position lights and <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.|$|E
25|$|The 1952 Volkswagen Bus was {{equipped}} with only one stop lamp, mounted centrally and higher than {{the left and right}} rear lamps which did not produce a stop lamp function. The 1968–1971 Ford Thunderbird could be ordered with optional supplemental high-mounted stop and <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> integrated into the left and right interior trim surrounding the backglass. The Oldsmobile Toronado from 1971 to 1978, and the Buick Riviera from 1974 to 1976 had similar dual high-mounted supplemental stop/turn lights as standard equipment; these were located {{on the outside of the}} vehicle below the bottom of the backglass. This type of configuration was not widely adopted at the time. Auto and lamp manufacturers in Germany experimented with dual high-mount supplemental stop lamps in the early 1980s, but this effort, too, failed to gain wide popular or regulatory support.|$|E
50|$|Midway through 2010, {{features}} including side mirrors with integrated <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> footwell <b>lighting,</b> {{and power}} seat memory functions were removed.|$|R
5000|$|Rear disc brakes, {{side view}} mirrors with <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> {{indicator}} <b>lights</b> & push button start with i-Key now standard on SR models.|$|R
50|$|In Hong Kong, the Right-handed drive Civic (FA1) {{is made in}} Japan but shares its {{exterior}} {{with the}} North American-market Civic. Two models (1.8 Deluxe and 1.8 VTi) are sold, sharing the same engine (R18A) with minor differences in appearance and equipment, e.g. side mirror <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>light,</b> side airbags and cruise control. In the facelift model, the more expensive VTi model comes with paddle shifters.|$|R
2500|$|All R/Ts {{were built}} in Mexico. A total of 1,208 were sold in the U.S. in 1991 [...] 774 in red and 434 in white. An {{additional}} 191 were sold in the U.S. in 1992 [...] 92 red, 68 white, and 31 silver. The only discernible changes for 1992 were a lower first gear ratio for reduced turbo lag, woodgrain dashboard trim as used on the Chrysler LeBaron sedan, blacked out upper and lower grille inserts, clear rather than amber lenses for the front parking and <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights,</b> and a speedometer calibrated to [...] rather than [...]|$|E
2500|$|... 1976 {{brought about}} a few changes on the Electra. The {{front-end}} was reworked, including the grille and bumper. The new plastic grille featured 17 vertical bars and covered much of the radiator. The grille did not extend under the headlights in 1976, but instead Buick moved the running lights and <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> underneath the headlights, where the 1975 grille had once been. The bumper no longer housed running lights. [...] There were also some minor interior differences. The brake release handle was black instead of chrome, the seat material was slightly different, on the limited, notch-back diamond pattern seating. The 1975 material appeared in a [...] "corduroy" [...] form, but the actual material was not corduroy. The 1976 diamond pattern seating material did not have this appearance. [...] The engine air cleaner {{did not have a}} [...] "cold-air" [...] ram air intake hose like the 1975 model did, and there were some carburetor changes and camshaft changes to meet EPA standards. The rear end ratio also was higher than the 1975 standard, at 2.56:1 instead of 2.73:1. The Park Avenue and leather seating in 1975 and 1976 were the same. Once again, there was the base 225, the Limited, and the luxurious Park Avenue. The Park Avenue Deluxe vanished for 1976 due to poor sales. The 1976 Electra is about {{the same size as the}} 1975 at , making them among the biggest Buicks ever.|$|E
50|$|The K-series has {{additional}} refinements including aluminium fuel tanks,, adjustable headlights, {{high capacity}} 460 watt alternators, Hella accessory plug-in, and self-cancelling <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Turn</b> <b>signals</b> are {{required}} to blink on and off, or [...] "flash", at a steady rate of between 60 and 120 blinks per minute (1–2Hz). International UN Regulations require that all <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> flash in simultaneous phase; US regulations permit side marker lights wired for side <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> functionality to flash in opposite-phase. An audio and/or visual tell-tale indicator is required, to advise the driver when the <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> are activated and operating. This usually {{takes the form of}} one or two green indicator lights on the vehicle's instrument cluster, and a cyclical [...] "tick-tock" [...] noise generated electromechanically or electronically. It is also required that the vehicle operator be alerted by much faster- or slower-than-normal flashing in the event a <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> fails.|$|R
5000|$|Accessories: this {{includes}} cigarette lighter outlet, radio/CD player, ignition switch, cabin fan and heater, speedometer, horn, <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> automotive <b>lighting</b> (headlamps, taillamps and backup lamps), door switch, seat belt, brake alarms, power windows and windshield wiper.|$|R
50|$|Logos, scripts, <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> <b>light</b> lens colors, door handles, trunk locks, window vents {{and window}} trim are all {{accurately}} painted or have realistic tampos. For example, the Falcon XC Cobra has realistic blue paint stripes with the Cobra snake logo {{on the side}} of each front fender. Headlights and other lenses are often made realistically using clear plastic. The Valiant Charger has multi-hued rear tail lights, that blend from orange out to red. Body proportions of Trax Models are spot-on. Model wheel designs match those of the actual cars and tires are made of rubber.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{front is}} {{redesigned}} to follow Hongqi design style; {{a pair of}} <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> are added on fenders to meet Chinese standard ...|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Hero Honda {{launched}} the upgraded {{version of the}} Splendor, the Splendor+. This version features multi-reflector headlight, tail light and <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights,</b> and new graphics.|$|E
50|$|Minor {{changes were}} made in September 1971 with a new grille, <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights,</b> and tail lights, along with similar {{treatment}} to the Sprinter. A further facelift was done in August 1972.|$|E
50|$|It has a rigid rear suspension, and a leading-link front suspension. Some models {{include a}} sprung seat-post. The engine and {{drive-train}} are cleanly enclosed, similar to Piaggio's scooters. The Ciao uses a belt drive, unlike most other mopeds which are chain driven. Some models have an automatic continuously variable transmission. Braking is by {{front and rear}} drums. Power for the lamps, horn, and ignition is from a magneto; there is no battery. However, models with <b>turning</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> were equipped with a 6-volt battery for the blinkers to function. On newer models, the plastic fuel cap {{also serves as a}} measuring cup for the 2% oil-fuel mixture.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: 1995 Eagle Talon TSi. Amber <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> {{integrated}} reverse <b>lights,</b> and {{bumper cap}} comprise the rear fascia that {{is unique to}} the Eagle Talon.|$|R
50|$|The Hummer was {{as basic}} {{as it could}} have been. It had magneto {{ignition}} and was sold without battery, electric horn, <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> or brake <b>light.</b>|$|R
50|$|Standard {{equipment}} included power windows, cruise control, air conditioning, keyless entry, mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights,</b> four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, a 160-watt Pioneer {{sound system}} with CD player, 17-inch alloy wheels, and a panoramic moonroof.|$|E
5000|$|Dutch Army {{variants}} {{are easily}} identified by their diesel engines and <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> positioned on {{the tops of}} the wings instead of on the front by headlights. These also had modified tail and brake lights ...|$|E
50|$|Finally, in 2007 for {{the model}} year 2008, the GX 470 {{received}} styling updates, including a dark metallic grille, liquid graphite wheels, added exterior and interior chrome, revised <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights,</b> and added wood and body color options.|$|E
5000|$|Minor {{changes were}} made in 2006. Mirror-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> replaces the fender-mounted <b>turn</b> <b>signal,</b> rear <b>lights</b> were revised and a {{redesigned}} grille. Mark X with all black interior deleted the wood trim {{in favor of the}} brushed aluminum trim. A formal introduction of the [...] "S package" [...] which gain the three-spoke steering wheel and changes to the exterior lip piece.|$|R
50|$|The first-generation LHS, sold in Europe {{with the}} New Yorker {{nameplate}} during the 1995-1997 model years, featured rear amber <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> rear fog <b>lights,</b> side <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> repeaters, lack of side markers, and headlamps that incorporated different lens geometry and bulbs.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{glass was}} {{introduced}} in 1919 as were <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> and stop <b>lights.</b> Carpenter changed the company's motto from The Foreign Car Made in America to America's Representative Among the World's Finest Cars. The company also introduced an innovative six-cylinder engine in 1919.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{produced}} between 1965 - 1979 were {{equipped with}} old-style lights: <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> were colorless (white), rear lights were round, {{and the back}} of the body was rounder. Subsequent post-1979 models got amber (yellow) signal lights, and rear lights were slightly bigger and rectangular.|$|E
50|$|For 1998 the Tercel's styling was updated, {{highlighted}} by multi-reflector headlights, a revised grille and front fascia design and clear lens <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> {{for the front}} and rear. The facelift occurred in December 1997 for the Japanese market, and covered all three lines (Tercel, Corsa, Corolla II).|$|E

50|$|Aside {{from the}} fact that it was right hand drive, the Toyota Cavalier also {{featured}} a leather-wrapped shift knob, steering wheel and park brake lever, wider front fenders, amber <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> for Japanese regulations, power folding side mirrors, side <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> repeater <b>lights</b> on the front fenders, and carpeting on the inside of the trunk lid. Interior seats were often flecked with color, and the rear seat had a fold-down armrest. Vehicles produced from February through December 1998 were available with a leather interior equipped with an automatic transmission only.|$|R
50|$|The turn {{indicator}} stalk or <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> lever is the control lever which operates the <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> or indicator <b>lights</b> on the front, sides and {{rear of the}} vehicle. It is usually operated by lifting or lowering the lever, the direction being commensurate with the clockwise or anticlockwise direction in which the steering wheel {{is about to be}} turned.|$|R
50|$|The rider could pedal unaided by the motors, {{or could}} {{activate}} {{them with a}} thumb switch on the handle bar. That smoothly, quietly and quickly takes the bike to 20 mph if the rider pedals, or to 15 mph with no pedaling before it needed a charge. Among the special features were high-tech <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> and brake <b>lights</b> on the two rear-view mirrors.|$|R
5000|$|Firenza was {{launched}} with a 2.0-liter pushrod inline four-cylinder engine {{as the sole}} powerplant, but an overhead-cam 1.8-liter engine was added during the model year. Wraparound amber <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> were added immediately outboard of the headlights for 1984. In 1985 the 2.8 L LB6 V6 was added as an option, {{as well as a}} new GT package. The GT, with the V6 standard, became a separate trim level for 1986.|$|E
50|$|Cosmetic {{exterior}} and interior changes included a sweeping front end and a new dashboard. Maroon and blue leather seats were first offered in 1991 (1992 model year) {{through the end of}} production. Power mirrors were again offered from 1991, and from 1995, the Bronco became the first vehicle to incorporate <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> in its side mirrors. All 1994-1996 Eddie Bauers have an overhead console. Some 1994-1996 XLTs and Eddie Bauers have lighted sun visors and a dimming rear-view mirror.|$|E
5000|$|... 1973 - An {{upmarket}} R16 TX {{model is}} introduced at the Paris Motor Show, {{equipped with a}} 1647cc engine (an enlarged version of the TS engine) and a five-speed manual transmission. The TX was distinguishable from other R16s on the exterior by its four rectangular headlights with large <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>lights</b> underneath. Among the other features available on the TX were Gordini wheels, a rear spoiler, a rear windscreen wiper, a laminated windscreen, automatic seatbelts, power windows, central locking and optional air conditioning.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, most front <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> {{worldwide}} emitted white light and most rear <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> emitted red. The auto {{industry in the}} USA voluntarily adopted amber front-turn signals for most vehicles beginning in the 1963 model year, though the advent of amber signals was accompanied by legal stumbles in some states and front <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> were still legally permitted to emit white light until FMVSS 108 took effect for the 1968 model year, whereupon amber became the only permissible front <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> colour. Presently, most countries outside of the United States and Canada require that all front, side and rear <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> produce amber <b>light.</b> Exceptions include Switzerland and New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|The {{electrical}} system in all {{six years of}} the XL175 was a six volt system and included a battery, headlight with high/low beam, <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> brake/taillight, instrumentation <b>lights,</b> and a horn. A warning light panel was also included on models 1976 through 1978 which displayed lights for 'High Beam' (blue light), 'Turn Signal' (orange light) and 'Neutral' (green light). Models from 1973 through 1975 incorporated warning lights for neutral and <b>turn</b> <b>signals</b> into the tachometer face, and a high beam indicator light {{on the top of}} the headlight housing.|$|R
5000|$|The ease of {{registration}} {{will vary}} by state. Some states require safety inspections, usually to ensure body integrity in areas subject to severe corrosion from winter road de-icing materials. In any case, for general registration all functional safety equipment should be operating - <b>turn</b> <b>signals,</b> brake <b>lights,</b> headlights, horn, etc. The windshield {{should have no}} running cracks (small stone chips and [...] "stars" [...] may be acceptable if not in the driver's principal line of vision). If the vehicle has been reconstructed from a salvage vehicle (a vehicle whose registration has been forfeited) inspection may be more severe to ensure compliance and the legitimacy of sources of salvage components by presentation of proper purchase receipts.|$|R
