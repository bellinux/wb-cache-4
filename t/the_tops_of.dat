5|$|In {{stories from}} the 13th century, tengu began to abduct young boys {{as well as the}} priests they had always targeted. The boys were often returned, while the priests would be found tied to <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> trees or other high places. All of the tengu's victims, however, would come back in a state of near death or madness, {{sometimes}} after having been tricked into eating animal dung.|$|E
5|$|Millennium Park {{is built}} {{on top of a}} large {{underground}} parking garage. Construction started before the park's design was completed, and in January 2000, 17 additional caissons had {{to be added to the}} partially built garage to support the weight of Gehry's pavilion. In April <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> all these caissons had to be rebuilt for changes in the pavilion's foundation.|$|E

5|$|Angkor Wat is {{decorated}} with depictions of apsaras and devata; {{there are more than}} 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (–) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately –) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.|$|E
5|$|At the age of16, Buxton was illiterate, {{but with}} the aid of The Common Spelling Book he taught himself to read. He was unable to {{understand}} or pronounce all words correctly and so procured a copy of Jones Pronouncing Dictionary. He read more books, such as A History of England and Goldsmith's History of Greece and Rome. Reading occupied all his spare time, although when trade was good he had to work from 6:00am until 9:00pm. He earned about 14 to 15 shillings (70p-75p) a week, a good wage for the time, but as cloth was superseding leather in making <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> children shoes, this did not last.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain walls and <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of}} a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections {{on top of a}} wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E

5|$|Damage totals in the United States are {{not fully}} known, {{although}} media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, {{and at least one}} study places the figure at $150–200 million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30–40 million (1997 USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> large trees.|$|E
5|$|Despite Canterbury's walls, a Viking army {{successfully}} {{attacked the}} city in 835, killing many of the inhabitants. Scandinavian raids recommenced from 991 onwards and in 1011 a Danish army demanded fresh tribute from the city. The city walls were used to defend the city during an 11-day siege, and the chronicler Roger of Hoveden recounts how the attacking Danes were thrown off <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the walls to their deaths by the citizens. Roger's account may be an exaggeration, but the story shows that the city walls were in sufficiently good condition for such a story to be considered plausible at the time. After a fire {{broke out in the}} city, however, the Danes entered and pillaged Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E

5|$|Grisedale Tarn is the {{starting}} point for the south ridge of Helvellyn, and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale, or from Dunmail Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck. Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the fellside, and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags {{on the side of the}} ridge, and avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a more interesting and scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags as closely as possible, over <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s the {{dovecote}} was inspected {{as part of}} {{an investigation}} into an outbreak of psittacosis (also known as parrot disease or parrot fever), a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, at the adjoining King's School. No cause was found for the infection. In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the walls; these are exposed as the building no longer has a roof. Wall ties were used on the south west corner where the masonry was bulging. In addition, car parking and educational signage was provided. This was partially funded by South Somerset council, Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of £105,000.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat has a brief {{activity}} period, leaving its roost {{for only}} 30 {{minutes in the}} evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies (Chloropidae, Agromyzidae, and Anthomyiidae), hymenopterans, and psocopterans.|$|E

5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the agricultural industry. The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees on <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November 1966, a B-52G AF Ser.

5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E

In the year 1819, the nine-story pavilion was constructed adjacent to the cliff to aid people in getting to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. Prior to the construction of the pavilion, visitors to the temple were hoisted to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> using a system of chains.

5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the tallest trees {{in the park and}} feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could be seen from <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of}} the Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac.|$|E
