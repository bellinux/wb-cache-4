40|$|The ~ 260 -Ma Emeishan large igneous {{province}} in SW China and northern Vietnam contains low-Ti tholeiitic basalts, high-Ti alkaline basalts and minor peralkaline volcanic rocks. The flood basalts in Longzhoushan, Sichuan Province, SW China, comprise four units, {{each of which}} has volcanic breccia at the base. From the base upward, rocks of Units 1 and 2 are high-Ti basalts with relatively high MgO (7. 6 - 11. 0  wt. %), TiO 2 (1. 7 - 4. 5  wt. %) and Ti/Y ratios (420 - 790). Unit 3 is composed of <b>tephrites</b> with lower MgO (0. 87 - 6. 2  wt. %), TiO 2 (0. 96 - 2. 14  wt. %) and Ti/Y ratios (190 - 530), whereas Unit 4 consists of basaltic andesites with moderate MgO (3. 5 - 4. 8  wt. %), TiO 2 (2. 2 - 3. 1  wt. %) and Ti/Y ratios (383 - 606). The high-Ti basalts may have been derived from an OIB-like mantle source and the basaltic andesites were probably generated by crustal contamination and fractionation of high-Ti basaltic magmas. The <b>tephrites</b> show high Nb/Y (1. 2 to 2. 7) and Th/Y (0. 31 to 0. 55) ratios, variable Zr/Hf ratios (40 to 49) and relatively low εNd(t) (- 0. 7 to + 0. 28) values, suggesting an asthenospheric mantle contribution modified by carbonate-rich fluids. The high-Ti basalts contain relatively high and variable PGE and their Cu/Pd ratios are relatively constant (compared to the <b>tephrites)</b> and vary from 8, 500 to 86, 000. We attribute such relative constancy of the Cu/Pd ratios to the presence of residual sulphide in the source of the high-Ti rocks and subsequent crystallization from S-undersaturated melts. The basaltic andesites have relatively high and constant Cu/Pd ratios (130, 000 - 370, 492) and the lowest PGE contents (average 0. 12  ppb for Pd, 0. 20  ppb for Pt), suggesting an earlier removal of sulfide due to crustal contamination before emplacement. The <b>tephrites</b> have PGE abundances (0. 057 to 1. 89  ppb for Pt and 0. 11 to 2. 10  ppb for Pd) higher than those for basaltic andesites, however, the Cu/Pd ratios (33, 300 to 429, 000) of the rocks are more variable than those for the basaltic andesites, suggesting that the <b>tephrites</b> may have undergone both S-saturated fractionation during emplacement of the magmas and weak removal of sulfides from the source magmas. Early fractionation of chromite together with removal of laurite and/or Os-Ir-Ru alloys from the parental magmas may be responsible for the negative Ru anomalies of the <b>tephrites,</b> high-Ti basalts and basaltic andesites. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|The Montefiascone Volcanic Complex {{belongs to}} the Roman Magmatic Province of Central Italy; the {{volcanic}} activity took place in an extensional, post-collisional setting during Late Pleistocene, giving rise to lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. The extrusive products consist of moderately to strongly undersaturated K-rich lavas ranging in composition from trachybasalts through leucite basanites and leucititic <b>tephrites</b> to tephritic leucitites. They show the typical geochemical and isotopic characters of the Roman potassic magmas, i. e., low TiO 2, low K 2 O/Al 2 O 3 strong enrichment in LILE, high LILE/HFSE ratios, highly radiogenic Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratios (0. 71005 - 0. 71112) and unradiogenic Nd- 143 /Nd- 144 (0. 51209 - 0. 51229, corresponding to epsilon(Nd) = - 10. 7 to - 6. 8). Large chemical variations have been recognized within the Montefiascone volcanics, resulting both from the occurrence of different primary magmas and shallow-level fractionation processes. The differentiation mainly took place by means of closed-system fractional crystallisation with local influence of crustal assimilation. The leucite basanites represent primary mantle magmas which did not yield derivative products, whereas the leucititic <b>tephrites,</b> tephritic leucitites and trachybasalts comprise highly differentiated rocks strongly depleted in compatible elements and enriched in LILE. Fractional crystallisation dominated respectively by clinopyroxene + leucite and clinopyroxene + plagioclase yielded the most evolved tephritic leucitites and trachybasalts. In contrast, assimilation of metamorphic basement rocks characterized by highly radiogenic Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 is needed to explain the moderate increase of the Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratio within the leucititic <b>tephrites.</b> The geochemical and isotopic signatures shown by the Montefiascone primary magmas require a clinopyroxene- and phlogopite-rich mantle source; in particular, partial melting of a veined lithospheric mantle can account for the occurrence of different primary magmas characterized by relatively constant Sr- and Nd-isotopic compositions. Depleted mantle Nd-model ages (1. 1 - 1. 5 Ga) suggest that the mantle enrichment may be a very old event, unrelated to the subduction that preceded the Roman magmatism. This hypothesis is further supported by the strong similarity in age and isotopic composition between the Montefiascone volcanics and the kamafugitic and carbonatitic rocks of the adjoining ultra-alkaline Umbria-Latium district.

40|$|Vesteris Seamount is {{a solitary}} {{alkaline}} volcano in the Greenland Basin some 280 km NW of Jan Mayen. Topographic and geophysical {{studies have shown}} no sign of an associated plume trace. Evidence from ash layers in sediment cores around the volcano and dating of dredged samples show {{that it has been}} active in Quaternary times. The lavas from Vesteris studied here consist of basanites, <b>tephrites,</b> mugearite, and alkali basalts. Crystal fractionation models are consistent with the generation of the <b>tephrites</b> and mugearite from a basanitic parent. Extensive kaersutite fractionation is required late in the fractionation sequence to produce the extreme mugearite composition. Na-Al-Fe-rich green cores to many clinopyroxene phenocrysts at Vesteris suggest a fractionation history beginning at high pressure in the mantle. Differences between Vesteris and Jan Mayen in the ratios of highly incompatible trace elements such as Ce/Pb and Rb/Cs, which will not normally be fractionated from one another during mantle melting, suggest that the two are not derived from the same source. Relatively unradiogenic Sr isotope ratios (compared with Bulk Earth), and highly incompatible trace element patterns similar to those for St. Helena, suggest that Vesteris magmas are derived from a depleted, asthenospheric source. We propose that the Vesteris basanites are very low degree partial melts (˜ 1 %) of this source, most probably those which give rise to the seismic low-velocity zone (LVZ). Such small-degree melts may preferentially tap small-scale heterogeneities in the asthenosphere. Vesteris lies at the intersection of two major structural trends in the Greenland Basin—(1) a zone of major reorientation of spreading direction on the Mohns Ridge north of Jan Mayen and (2) the extension of the Kolbeinsey Ridge axis. We propose that a combination of the extensional stress fields related to these two lineaments produces sufficient dilation of the lithosphere at Vesteris to allow magmas from the LVZ to reach the surface...|$|R

40|$|Individual volcanoes of {{continental}} monogenetic volcanic {{fields are}} generally presumed to erupt single magma batches during brief eruptions. Nevertheless, in two unrelated volcanic fields (the Waipiata volcanic field, New Zealand, and the Miocene-Pliocene volcanic field in western Hungary), {{we have identified}} pronounced and systematic compositional differences among products of individual volcanoes. We infer that this indicates a two-stage process of magma supply for these volcanoes. Each volcano records: (1) intrusion of a basanitic parent magma to lower- to mid-crustal levels and its subsequent fractionation to form a tephritic residual melt;, (2) subsequent transection of this reservoir by a second batch of basanitic melt, with <b>tephrite</b> rising to the surface {{at the head of}} the propagating basanite dyke. Eruption at the surface then yields initial <b>tephrite,</b> typically erupted as pyroclasts, followed by eruption and shallow intrusion of basanite from deeper in the dyke. By analogy with similar tephrite-basanite eruptions along rift zones of intraplate ocean-island volcanoes, we infer that fractionation to <b>tephrite</b> would have required decades to centuries. We conclude that the two studied continental monogenetic volcanic fields demonstrate a consistent history of early magmatic injections that fail to reach the surface, followed by capture and partial eruption of their evolved residues in the course of separate and significantly later injections of basanite that extend to the surface and erupt. This systematic behaviour probably reflects the difficulty of bringing small volumes of dense, primitive magma to the surface from mantle source regions. Ascent through continental crust is aided by the presence in the dyke head of buoyant <b>tephrite</b> captured during transection of the earlier-emplaced melt bodies...|$|E
40|$|The 1949 {{rift zone}} {{eruption}} along the Cumbre Vieja ridge on La Palma involved three eruptive centers, 3 km spaced apart, and was chemically and mineralogically zoned.

Hoyo Negro crater opened 4 days later and erupted basanite, <b>tephrite,</b> and phonotephrite, while Llano del Banco continued to issue basanite. The eruption ended with Duraznero erupting basanite with abundant crustal and mantle xenoliths. The tephrites and basanites from Duraznero and Llano del Banco show narrow compositional ranges and define a bimodal suite. Each batch ascended and evolved separately without significant intermixing, as did the Hoyo Negro basanite, which formed at lower degrees of melting. The magmas fractionated clinopyroxene +olivine±kaersutite±Ti-magnetite at 600 – 800 MPa and possibly 800 – 1100 MPa. Abundant reversely zoned phenocrysts reflect mixing with evolved melts at mantle depths. Probably as early as 1936, Hoyo Negro basanite entered the deep rift system at 200 – 350 MPa. Some shallower pockets of this basanite evolved to phonotephrite through differentiation and assimilation of wall rock. A few months prior to eruption, a mixing event in the mantle may have triggered the final ascent of the magmas. Most of the erupted <b>tephrite</b> and basanite ascended from mantle depths within hours to days without prolonged storage in crustal reservoirs.

Nyiragongo is a stratovolcano (3469 a. s. l.) characterized by rock types such as melilitite, melilite nephelinite, pyroxene nephelinite, leucite nephelinite, leucitite and leucite <b>tephrite.</b> Samples include parasitic cones and lava fields of the volcanic complexes from 1938 products until now, and products of 2002 eruption sampled from the proximal vent area to the distal outcrops. Nyamuragira basanites and tephrites are porphyritic with phenocrysts of olivine and clinopyroxene. Basanites have MgO (12. 05 - 13. 60 wt. ...|$|E
40|$|Holocene volcanoes in the Jingpohu {{region are}} {{situated}} in the “Crater Forest ” and “Frog Pool ” areas along the northwest side of Jingpohu Lake, northeastern China. Dating of three charcoal samples from {{the first and second}} volcanic cycles shows that the ages of the first and second cycles are 3430 ~ 3490 and 2470 years respectively. The lavas from the Jingpohu area consist of basanites (BSN), alkali olivine basalts (AOB) and <b>tephrites</b> (TP). Crystal fractionation models are consistent with the generation of AOB and TP from a basanitic parent. Minor fractionation of olivine, augite, magnetite and Cr-spinel is required to produce AOB compositions whereas the generation of TP requires extensive fractionation of kaersutite, phlogopite and anorthoclase with minor olivine, augite, magnetite and leucite. The presence of kaersutite, phlogopite and anorthoclase megacrysts and mantle xenoliths suggest a fractionation history occurring at high pressure in the mantle. Although all basaltic rocks contain many granitic xenoliths, their geochemical characteristics show that they have not undergone any contamination of upper crust en route to the sur-face, but some alkali basalts were suffered from the contamination of lower crust. Relatively unradiogenic isotope ratio (compared with Bulk Earth), steep chondrite-normalized REE patterns and strong incompat-ible element enriched patterns suggest that the magmas are derived from a mixture of an incompatible element depleted anhydrous lherzolite asthenospheric mantle source and an enriched, amphibole-phologite...|$|R
50|$|Those leucite rocks {{which contain}} {{abundant}} essential plagioclase feldspar {{are known as}} leucite <b>tephrites</b> and leucite basanites. The former consist mainly of plagioclase, leucite and augite, while the latter contain olivine in addition. The leucite is often present in two sets of crystals, both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the ground mass. It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines. The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase, being usually a variety of labradorite; orthoclase is scarce. The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and optical character, being green, brown or violet (suggesting high Na and Ti content), but it is rarely high enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine-augite or aegirine. Among the accessory minerals biotite, brown hornblende, hauyne, iron oxides and apatite are the commonest; melanite and nepheline may also occur. The ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass. The leucite-tephrites and leucite-basanites of Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks. They are black or ashy-grey in color, often vesicular, and may contain many large grey phenocysts of leucite. Their black augite and yellow green olivine are also easily observed in hand specimens. From Volcan Ello, Sardinia and Roccamonfina similar rocks are obtained; they occur also in Bohemia, in Java, Celebes, Kilimanjaro (Africa) and near Trebizond in Asia Minor.|$|R
40|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks of}} the Rhön area (Central European Volcanic Province, Germany) {{belong to a}} moderately alkali basaltic suite {{that is associated with}} minor tephriphonolites, phonotephrites, <b>tephrites,</b> phonolites and trachytes. Based on isotope sytematics (87 Sr/ 86 Sr: 0. 7033 – 0. 7042; 143 Nd/ 144 Nd: 0. 51279 – 0. 51287; 206 Pb/ 204 Pb: 19. 1 – 19. 5), the inferred parental magmas formed by variable degrees of partial melting of a common asthenospheric mantle source (EAR: European Asthenospheric Reservoir of Cebriá and Wilson, 1995). <b>Tephrites,</b> tephriphonolites, phonotephrites, phonolites and trachytes show depletions and enrichments in some trace elements (Sr, Ba, Nb, Zr, Y) indicating that they were generated by broadly similar differentiation processes that were dominated by fractionation of olivine, clinopyroxene, amphibole, apatite and titaniferous magnetite ± plagioclase ± alkalifeldspar. The fractionated samples seem to have evolved by two distinct processes. One is characterized by pure fractional crystallization indicated by increasing Nb (and other incompatible trace element) concentrations at virtually constant 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ~ 0. 51280 and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ~ 0. 7035. The other process involved an assimilation–fractional crystallization (AFC) process where moderate assimilation to crystallization rates produced evolved magmas characterized by higher Nb concentrations at slightly lower 143 Nd/ 144 Nd down to 0. 51275. Literature data for some of the evolved rocks show more variable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ranging from 0. 7037 to 0. 7089 at constant 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ~ 0. 51280. These features may result from assimilation of upper crustal rocks by highly differentiated low-Sr (< 100 ppm Sr) lavas. However, based on the displacement of the differentiated rocks from this study towards lower 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios and modeled AFC processes in 143 Nd/ 144 Nd vs. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 207 Pb/ 204 Pb vs. 143 Nd/ 144 Nd space assimilation of lower crustal rocks seems more likely. The view that assimilation of lower crustal rocks played a role is confirmed by high-precision double-spike Pb isotope data that reveal higher 207 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios (15. 62 – 15. 63) in the differentiated rocks than in the primitive basanites (15. 58 – 15. 61). This is compatible with incorporation of radiogenic Pb from lower crustal xenoliths (207 Pb/ 204 Pb: 15. 63 – 15. 69) into the melt. However, 206 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios are similar for the differentiated rocks (19. 13 – 19. 35) and the primitive basanites (19. 12 – 19. 55) implying that assimilation involved an ancient crustal end member with a higher U/Pb ratio than the mantle source of the basanites. In addition, alteration-corrected δ 18 O values of the differentiated rocks range from c. 5 to 7 ‰ which is the same range as observed in the primitive alkaline rocks. This study confirms previous interpretations that highlighted the role of AFC processes in the evolution of alkaline volcanic rocks in the Rhön area of the Central European Volcanic Province...|$|R
