40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} whether long-lasting, recurrent <b>tethering</b> of <b>sows</b> leads to enduring effects on measures that may be indicative of chronic stress. Sows that had experienced tethering for about 1. 5 or 4. 5 years and age-matched sows kept in a social housing system (loose sows) were compared. Immediately after slaughter, blood samples were taken to measure plasma cortisol levels, and the brain, spleen, and adrenals were dissected and weighed. Gene expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was analyzed. Plasma cortisol levels {{were higher in the}} <b>tethered</b> <b>sows</b> than in the loose sows. The older, but not the younger, <b>tethered</b> <b>sows</b> had heavier adrenal glands than their loose counterparts. The weight of the spleen was not affected by the housing conditions, but the pituitary gland was lighter in <b>tethered</b> <b>sows</b> than in loose sows. Microarray analyses revealed an increased expression of ß-globin mRNA in the hippocampus {{and to a lesser extent}} in the frontal cortex of the older <b>tethered</b> <b>sows,</b> compared with the older loose sows. Taken together, the findings indicate that chronically stressed pigs develop depression-like symptoms. However, it can be questioned whether the pig subjected to repeated, long-term stress can be regarded an animal model of major depression...|$|R
2500|$|Stereotypies may be coping {{mechanisms}} as results suggest from study on <b>tethered</b> and stalled <b>sows.</b> <b>Sows</b> that are <b>tethered</b> and stalled exhibited more stereotypies like licking and rubbing than sows {{that are in}} groups outdoors. This abnormal behavior seems {{to be related to}} opioid (related to the reward system) receptor density. [...] In sows, prolonged confinement, being tethered or being in gestation crates, results in abnormal behaviors and stereotypies. Mu and Kappa receptors are associated with aversion behaviors and Mu receptor density is greater in <b>tethered</b> <b>sows</b> than sows that are in groups outdoors. However, sows with stereotypy behaviors experienced a decrease both in Mu and Kappa receptor density in the brain suggesting that inactivity increases Mu receptor density and stereotypy development decrease both kappa and Mu receptor density.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tethered</b> <b>sows</b> {{continuously}} performed stereotypies {{during a}} substantial part of the day time. A single subcutaneous injection with naloxone significantly decreased the profound stereotypies, while explorative behaviours of pigs were not affected by naloxone. In addition a long-term effect of naloxone was noticed. It is suggested that performing the seemingly purposeless stereotypies may function as an effective strategy in order to cope with the conflict-inducing housing conditions. The present data implicate endorphins in this strategy. The involvement of endorphins in the stereotypies of the sows {{may be related to the}} calming, rewarding and dependency-inducing effects of the endorphins...|$|R

40|$|Thirty <b>tethered</b> <b>sows</b> were {{observed}} for 5 min every half-hour for 9 h spanning the two feeding periods. Activity, consisting largely of food searching behaviour and drinking, was largely restricted to two 2 -h periods following each feed. Three categories of stereotyped behaviour {{were observed}} {{and these were}} {{closely tied to the}} feeding periods. Short-duration bouts of rubbing, head-waving and bar-biting occurred during food delivery, while long-duration bouts of highly stereotyped and idiosyncratic sequences of rubbing and drinking were shown by older sows immediately after feeding. Vaccuum chewing tended to occur slightly later. I suggest that frustration of feeding motivation rather than under-stimulation underlies stereotypies in pigs, and that the different forms may represent stereotype of the appetitive and consummatory phases. Aggression was rare and was not closely related to the feeding periods or to stereotypies...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of 25 <b>tethered</b> <b>sows</b> in {{an intensive}} piggery was observed for 1 h before and 1 h after {{the delivery of}} food to determine if behavioural stereotypies appeared as adjunctive behaviours. The different components of behavioural stereotypies {{were found to have}} different associations with the feeding period. Head-waving, bar-biting, and rubbing the snout against the cage were most common before feeding, and were shown particularly by the older sows. Manipulating the drinker and, for some sows, rubbing were most common after. There was some evidence of polydipsia. Vacuum chewing, playing with the chain, and aggressive behaviours, however, {{did not appear to be}} associated with the feeding period. The last two behaviours occurred only rarely. Seven sows showed stereotyped sequences of rapid rubbing or rapid drinking after the delivery of food, and these sows showed more excitement before food was delivered. Rooting was common for the full hour after all food had been consumed, and occurred in conjunction with long duration drinking. I suggest that the occurrence of adjunctive drinking by sows results from the persistence of feeding motivation, perhaps because concentrated food does not provide sufficient stomach distension, combined with the knowledge that food will definitely not be forthcoming. Stereotyped sequences of behaviour may be a means of reducing the arousal generated by the expectation of food...|$|R

40|$|Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF) signaling has {{been implicated in}} the onset of depression and in antidepressant efficacy, although the exact role of this neurotrophin in the pathophysiology of depression remains to be elucidated. Also, the interaction between chronic stress, which may precede depression, corticosteroids and BDNF is not fully understood. The present study aimed at investigating whether long-lasting, recurrent <b>tethering</b> of <b>sows</b> {{during a period of}} 1. 5 or 4. 5 years leads to enduring effects on measures that may be indicative of chronic stress, compared with animals kept in a group housing system (‘loose’ sows). Immediately after slaughter, the frontal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus were dissected and protein levels of BDNF and its receptors were analyzed and compared with plasma cortisol levels and adrenal weights. Results indicate that tethering stress reduced BDNF protein levels in the dorsal hippocampus and the frontal cortex, but not in the ventral hippocampus. In addition, levels of TrkB, the high affinity receptor for BDNF, were increased in the dorsal hippocampus. Plasma cortisol levels and adrenal weight were increased after tethering. These stress effects on BDNF levels were more pronounced after 4. 5 years of recurrent tethering and negatively correlated in particular in the frontal cortex with cortisol levels and adrenal weight. This suggests that the stress effect of tethered housing on neurotrophin levels may be mediated via cortisol. Taken together, these data indicate that recurrent <b>tethering</b> stress in <b>sows</b> over 4. 5 years results in a loss of neurotrophic support by BDNF, mediated by an overactive neuroendocrine system...|$|R

40|$|Intensive {{methods of}} sow housing {{and their effects}} on health and welfare have become a topic of intense debate. In the EU the use of <b>tethers</b> for {{pregnant}} <b>sows</b> must be phased out by 2006. At pre s e n t {{there are no plans}} to ban stalls for pregnant sows. In 1997 the EU released a report on sow housing which was critical of stalls but did not recommend a ban (SVC, 1997). Some member countries have introduced more stringent legislation. The UK government has banned the use of both stalls and <b>tethers</b> for pregnant <b>sows</b> fro m January 1, 1999. Sweden has also imposed a ban on both stalls and tethers, and the Netherlands and De n m a rk have announced restrictions on when individual penning may be used. • This study included a comparison of pregnant gilts in loose housing (groups of 4) and in individual stalls from early pregnancy. Behaviour and skin lesions were monitored both during pregnancy and in the farrowing house. Stalled gilts tended to have higher skin lesion scores. Salivary cortisol levels in stalled gilts showed evidence of a chronic stress response. Loose gilts showed more distress when confined in the farrowing crate pre - f a r rowing than did gilts which had been housed in stalls in pregnancy. • Comparison of two group housing systems namely, groups of four with 3. 0 m 2 per sow and groups of eight with 2. 2 m 2 per sow showed a higher level of aggression in the larger group.

40|$| {{uncertainty}} {{for those}} animals, thereby {{contributing to the}} stress experienced by the animals. As has been discussed in Chapter 1, low predictability or uncertainty is generally recognized as a characteristic of stressful situations. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that lack of social interactions with conspecifics may affect stress responses, especially {{with respect to the}} HPA axis. Thus, both reduced visual control and social restriction are likely to be important factors contributing to the changes in adrenocortical function observed earlier. These findings underscore the notion that psychological factors are important activators of the HPA axis. Sensitivity of the PituitarySo far, effects of chronic stress on adrenocortical function have been emphasized. Studies in rats have provided evidence that chronic stress may also lead to changes in the sensitivity of the pituitary for hypothalamic peptides regulating ACTH secretion, possibly as a consequence of changes in expression and secretion of these secretagogues. Repeated activation of the HPA system may lead to plastic changes in hypothalamic CRH neurons, resulting in increased expression of vasopressin in CRH- containing neurons and increased vasopressinergic stores in vesicles in the median eminence, leading to an increased ratio of vasopressin/CRH that is secreted. Hashimoto et al. found that the pituitary-adrenocortical response to vasopressin was enhanced in rats that were chronically immobilized as compared with unstressed controls, whereas responses to exogenous CRH remained unaltered in these animals. They suggested that chronic stress caused a hypersensitivity of the pituitary to vasopressin. In pigs tethered for a 10 to 13 week period, the absolute ACTH and cortisol responses to exogenous CRH, vasopressin, or a combination of these two peptides (Chapter 6) are not significantly altered, as compared with loose housed control animals. The cortisol/ACTH ratio after CRH treatment, however, is significantly higher in tethered than in loose pigs. In summary, chronic stress leads to an increase in the sensitivity and capacity of the adrenal cortex to circulating ACTH, whereas the sensitivity of the pituitary to stimulation with CRH and/or vasopressin in pigs remains unaltered. These findings again point to adaptive changes in adrenocortical function as a consequence of stress, possibly mediated by mechanisms modulating adrenocortical sensitivity to ACTH. Adaptation to Chronic StressActivation of stress systems results in behavioural and physiological changes which allow the organism to adapt. In general, adaptive responses to stress involve a redirection of both behaviour and energy. Simultaneously, digestion and anabolic processes, such as growth, reproduction and immune function are suppressed. It appears that the ability to regulate the stress response appropriately may be as important as the ability to initiate it. Containment of the stress response is crucial to avoid detrimental consequences of excessive mobilization of resources and behavioural responses. As stated earlier, chronically stressed pigs develop changes in adrenocortical function so that further responsiveness of the adrenal system is maintained, despite elevated glucocorticoid levels. The hypersecretion of cortisol -is maintained for at least three complete oestrous cycles after tethering (approximately 9 weeks) and thereafter it gradually disappears (Chapter 3). This suggests that adaptive changes occur during chronic stress affecting HPA-activity and leading to normalization of adrenocortical output. Nevertheless, the fact that both the sensitivity and the capacity of the adrenal cortex are increased during the same period (Chapters 4, 5, and 6), suggests that adrenocortical function has chronically changed. Moreover, the apparent adaptation of cortisol levels during chronic stress does not imply normalization of brain mechanisms controlling cortisol concentrations in response to challenges or stressors (Chapter 5). Presumably, adaptation consists in changing certain "set-points" {{in order to meet the}} new demands. The mechanisms responsible for these adaptive changes during chronic stress likely include an increase in the activity of endogenous opioid systems. It has been demonstrated that <b>tethered</b> <b>sows</b> may develop stereotypies associated with and dependent on the activation of opioid systems. Administration of naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist, has shown to block or reduce the occurrence of this invariant behaviour. Although we did not quantify behaviour in our experiments, we also observed performance of stereotypies such as bar or chain biting and sham chewing in tethered gilts. Brain opioid systems, however, are not only involved in the neurochemical control of behaviour, e. g., of stereotypies, but have also been implicated in the regulation of the activity of several hormonal systems, including the HPA axis. Thus, chronic stress of tethered housing leads to increased activity of endogenous opioid systems and may therefore affect the HPA axis by means of opioids. In view of this hypothesis, we subjected both tethered and loose housed female pigs to an acute nose-sling challenge. The enhanced and prolonged ACTH and cortisol responses to nose-sling challenge after pretreatment with naloxone (Chapter 5) point to an activation of both the HPA system and the endogenous opioid systems. This naloxone-dependent increment in ACTH and the cortisol responses are significantly greater in animals tethered for a 10 to 11 -week period than in loose animals, indicating that the opioidmediated suppression of the pituitary-adrenocortical response is increased during chronic stress (Chapter 5). It may be speculated that the gradual reduction of the hypercortisolaemia, observed during the same period of tethered housing is also a consequence of an increase in the impact of endogenous opioid systems. Based on our findings and on literature data, we postulate the hypothalamus to be a key central site for the mediation of this effect of opioids (Chapter 5). All in all, these data indicate that chronic stress of tethered housing leads to adaptive changes in opioid systems modifying behavioural as well as endocrine reactions. Individual Differences in Pituitary-Adrenocortical ResponsesA major focus of the stress and coping literature has been on individual differences in reactivity to stressors under challenging conditions. There is ample evidence that not all individuals of the same species experience the same situation as stressful, and, vice versa, that the same stressors do not necessarily result in identical behavioural and peripheral responses. As mentioned in the general introduction, differences between individuals in coping with stressful situations appear to be related to genetic constitution, as well as to prior (particularly: early life) experiences, and the actual physiological and psychological state of the organism. Important in this respect is the way in which an individual estimates the situation and its possibilities to cope with the situation. In the present project, we obtained evidence that pigs express individual variability in the (re) activity of the pituitary-adrenocortical system in adapting to the chronic stress of tethered housing. There are, for example, great differences in. basal cortisol levels between individual pigs during tethered housing (Chapter 3), particularly with respect to the moment of disappearance of the stress-induced hypercortisolaemia. In addition, as described in the experiment in Chapter 4, considerable differences are found between individual animals in their cortisol responses to challenge with exogenous ACTH. Within the same pigs, however, the cortisol response to repeated challenge with ACTH (measured in the loose housed control groups) is consistent during an 18 -week period of loose housing. This is in good agreement with findings of others in pigs, indicating that the adrenocortical reactivity is an individual characteristic that remains stable in time. The interanimal differences in the adrenocortical reactivity pattern are particularly evident during exposure to chronic stress (Chapter 4). It is noteworthy, that the greatest individual differences are observed in animals that are tethered housed under the most restricted conditions (i. e. lacking possibilities for visual and tactile contacts with conspecifics and with very limited visual control over the environment). It may be argued that variability among individuals in their ability to adapt to conditions inducing stress responses reflects differences in neuroendocrine susceptibility to the stressful situation and the degree of control sensed by the individuals. Hessing demonstrated that types of pigs can be identified based on individual behavioural characteristics and that those characteristics are related to different physiological strategies displayed in response to stressors. In addition, Schouten and collaborators not only showed individual differences in performance of stress-induced stereotypies between tethered pigs, but also in feeding- induced cardiovascular responses during prolonged tethered housing. It has been suggested that these differences in behavioural and physiological reactions may represent individual coping characteristics of the animals involved. Practical ImplicationsConsequences of Chronic Stress and HypercortisolaemiaIn the present study, prolonged tethered housing of female pigs was used as a chronic stress paradigm. Although this husbandry system, which is used in intensive pig farming, may be advantageous from an economical point of view, the well-being of the animals is lost sight of. Tethered pigs are housed in a barren environment with physical restraint and social restriction, which may have consequences for the animal's behavioural and physiological performance. We showed that tethered pigs develop a hypercortisolaemia. Chronic elevation of cortisol levels may have profound physiological consequences. As has been discussed in Chapter 1, chronic activation of the catabolic stress response may ultimately lead to various pathophysiological states. The systems responsible for reproduction, growth and immunity are directly linked to the stress system, and each is profoundly influenced by the effectors of the stress response. It has been reported that tethered housing of pigs may induce reproductive disorders, such as a reduced rate of oestrous detection (e. g., occurrence of silent oestrus) and a reduced pregnancy rate. The present findings show that 3 - 6 weeks of tethered housing results in significantly decreased levels of plasma progesterone throughout the oestrous cycle (Chapter 2). No effects of 3 - 6 weeks of chronic stress were found on plasma LH concentrations, oestrous behaviour or on the length of the oestrous cycle. Nonetheless, it is well possible that more prolonged tethered housing may disrupt LH secretion or ovarian function and thereby adversely affect reproductive performance in the pig. Indeed, Helmond, Soede and Kemp recently showed that in <b>tethered</b> <b>sows</b> the duration of oestrous behaviour was significantly shorter as compared with loose housed sows (to be published). Moreover, the pulsatile LH release in that study seemed to be more "chaotic" in the tethered an...|$|R
