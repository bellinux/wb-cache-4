This incapability is attributed to capacity coverage issues in densely populated areas for satellites and lack of infrastructure in rural areas for <b>terrestrial</b> <b>networks.</b> Therefore, we consider a hybrid terrestrial-satellite mobile system based on frequency reuse. However, this frequency reuse introduces severe co-channel interference (CCI) at the satellite end. To mitigate CCI, we propose an OFDM based adaptive beamformer implemented on-board the satellite with pilot reallocation at the transmitter side. Results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional approach...|$|R
