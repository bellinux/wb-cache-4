40|$|Up to a {{conjecture}} in Riemannian geometry, we significantly strengthen {{a recent}} theorem of Eardley by proving that a compact region in an initial data surface that is collapsing sufficiently fast {{in comparison to}} its surface-to-volume ratio must contain a future <b>trapped</b> <b>region.</b> In addition to establishing this stronger result, the geometrical argument used does not require any asymptotic or energy conditions on the initial data. It follows that if such a region {{can be found in}} an asymptotically flat Cauchy surface of a spacetime satisfying the null-convergence condition, the spacetime must contain a black hole with the future <b>trapped</b> <b>region</b> therein. Further, up to another conjecture, we prove a strengthened version of our theorem by arguing that if a certain function (defined on the collection of compact subsets of the initial data surface that are themselves three-dimensional manifolds with boundary) is not strictly positive, then the initial data surface must contain a future <b>trapped</b> <b>region.</b> As a byproduct of this work, we offer a slightly generalized notion of a future <b>trapped</b> <b>region</b> as well as a new proof that future <b>trapped</b> <b>regions</b> lie within the black hole region.

5000|$|The {{quadrupole}} is {{the simplest}} electric field geometry used in such traps, though more complicated geometries are possible for specialized devices. The electric fields are generated from electric potentials on metal electrodes. A pure quadrupole is created from hyperbolic electrodes, though cylindrical electrodes {{are often used}} for ease of fabrication. Microfabricated ion traps exist where the electrodes lie in a plane with the <b>trapping</b> <b>region</b> above the plane. There are two main classes of traps, {{depending on whether the}} oscillating field provides confinement in three or two dimensions. In the two-dimension case (a so-called [...] "linear RF trap"), confinement in the third direction is provided by static electric fields.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} Silas Doty in St. Albans (city), Vermont. His parents were David Doty (1778-1855) and Martha Wilson (1781-1875). Silas was a 4th Great Grandson of Mayflower {{passenger}} Edward Doty (c.1599-1655) and Faith Clarke (1619-1675). As a child, he stole toys from his siblings, a pen knife from his teacher, and a horseshoe from a blacksmith, {{not because he}} needed or wanted these things, but for the excitement and pleasure he took from evading detection. When Doty was about nine years old, his family moved west to Bangor, New York, a fur <b>trapping</b> <b>region,</b> where he began a lucrative three-year career of stealing animals from traps and selling their furs. About 1815, Doty joined a band of thieves and counterfeiters operating in the Bangor area. In a few years, Doty became {{the leader of this}} gang, whose depredations now extended throughout New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.|$|E
40|$|Permanent magnets {{are used}} to {{selectively}} remove the fast atoms from an atomic beam and to guide the remaining slow atoms into a <b>trapping</b> <b>region.</b> The permanent magnets establish a quadrupole field which extends along the axis of a bent vacuum nipple. A threshold velocity is set by the radius of curvature of the bent nipple {{and the strength of}} the magnets. Only those atoms which are slower than the threshold are transmitted to the <b>trapping</b> <b>region.</b> For a 30 cm radius of curvature and a Maxwellian velocity distribution at the atomic beam source, a flux of 109 atoms/s is expected to be delivered to the <b>trapping</b> <b>region.</b> Experimentally, a flux of only 106 atoms/s is observed. The flux deficit is attributed to an attenuation of slow atoms resulting from collisions within the nozzle of the recirculating oven which is used to produce the atomic beam...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of noised induced phase {{transitions}} is proposed. It occurs in noisy systems with dynamical traps. Dynamical <b>traps</b> are <b>regions</b> in the phase space where the regular “forces” are depressed substantially. By way of an example, a simple oscillatory system {x,v=ẋ} with additive white noise is considered and its dynamics is analyzed numerically. The dynamical <b>trap</b> <b>region</b> {{is assumed to be}} located near the x-axis where the “velocity” v of the system becomes sufficiently low. The meaning of this assumption is discussed. The observed phase transition is caused by the asymmetry in the residence time distribution in the vicinity of zero value “velocity”. This asymmetry is due to a cooperative effect of the random Langevin “force” in the <b>trap</b> <b>region</b> and the regular “force” not changing the direction of action when crossing the <b>trap</b> <b>region.</b> Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin/Heidelberg 2003...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAstrophysical {{processes}} in vicinity of black holes involve a coupling of spacetime geometry and the quantum effects. Using the quantum potential approach we investigate the quantum dynamics {{of a massive}} particle around a Schwarzschild black hole. The analysis shows the existence of typical quantum effects near the black hole region. In particular the R-amplitude variation leads {{to the formation of}} fringe-like <b>trapping</b> <b>regions</b> around the black hole where the particle {{is more likely to be}} located. However due to the energy loss, which gains a local maxima in the <b>trapping</b> <b>regions,</b> the particle in-fall eventually occurs. The energy loss during such a process will show up in frequency and amplitude modulation in X-ray signals from accreting black holes and may confirm the existence of such <b>trapping</b> <b>regions...</b>|$|R
40|$|A recent {{experimental}} study of a double-delta-kicked atomic system revealed a new regime of strong chaotic diffusion coupled with long-range correlations. New types of momentum diffusion correlations, appearing in families coupling all kicks, were found to control transport of atoms through <b>trapping</b> <b>regions</b> in momentum space. Here we present an analytical derivation of the classical diffusion rate including all important correlations. Possible applications are also discussed: the correlations and momentum <b>trapping</b> <b>regions</b> provide for a strong velocity selective filter effect in the atomic system...|$|R

If we parameterize the sterile neutrino production cross-section by a parameter A as σ (ν_e X→ν_S X) = A σ(ν_e X→ν_e X), where X is an electron, neutron or proton, we show that A is constrained by limits to the conversion of ν_e to ν_S in the region between the sterile-neutrino <b>trapping</b> <b>region</b> and the electron-neutrino <b>trapping</b> <b>region.</b> This consideration excludes values of A in the range between 10 ^- 4 A 10 ^- 1.

30|$|A set {{of driving}} electrodes, marked as E-drive in Figs.  2 and 3, offers an {{electric}} {{field in the}} desired direction to drive target particles in the microchannel. When the target particles move into the <b>trapping</b> <b>region</b> (the region between two outer parallel metallic electrodes in one electrostatic trap, marked by the blue box in the inset of Fig.  3), an external static voltage is supplied to the electrode stripes, which activates the trap and keeps the particles captured. Turning off of the external static voltage deactivates the trap and the target particles will be driven out of the <b>trapping</b> <b>region</b> quickly under the driving field.|$|E

40|$|Fast ion orbits for helical {{magnetic}} axis configurations in LHD (Large Helical Device) are analyzed and {{compared with the}} standard circular axis case. Boundaries between passing and helically <b>trapped</b> particle <b>regions</b> show clear differences: in the non-planar axis case the helically <b>trapped</b> <b>region</b> spreads, near the {{magnetic axis}}, over a much wider band across the 90 degree pitch angle value and shows a very marked asymmetry. The locally <b>trapped</b> particle <b>region</b> is also wider than in the standard case.

40|$|The {{question}} of whether an observer can escape from a black hole is addressed, using a recent general definition {{of a black hole}} {{in the form of a}} future outer trapping horizon. An observer on a future outer trapping horizon must enter the neighbouring <b>trapped</b> <b>region.</b> It is possible for the observer to subsequently escape from the <b>trapped</b> <b>region.</b> However, if the horizon separates the space-time into two disjoint components, inside and outside the horizon, then an observer inside a future outer trapping horizon cannot get outside, assuming the null energy condition. A similar confinement property holds for trapped, locally area-preserving cylinders, as suggested by Israel. Comment: 5 pages. Figures not include...|$|R
40|$|A {{microfluidic}} {{evanescent field}} optical tweezer system was tested and developed for sample delivery of micro- and nanocrystals in serial crystallography. The fluid line was enforced, and the setup changed from vacuum pump-driven to syringe pump-driven. The pressure tolerance {{was found to}} be 6 to 10 bar through repeated tests. Experiments with 1 to 2 μm polystyrene spheres and protein crystals showed that the system was able to trap micrometer-sized particles but that there were problems with sticking of especially protein crystals {{to the surface of the}} <b>trapping</b> <b>region</b> in the channel. Surface coating studies using cytop, poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were conducted. Cytop increased the cleanliness within the <b>trapping</b> <b>region</b> but did not change trapping behavior. PAH decreased cleanliness in the <b>trapping</b> <b>region</b> and promoted sticking. BSA adhered to the <b>trapping</b> <b>region</b> in a thin layer instead of the charged spheres tested and increased the ability of a charged sphere to move in the trap. However, the coatings did not provide a significant increase in trapping efficiency or the mobility of protein crystals (lysozyme, I 3 C, and thaumatin) tested. Decreasing the adhesion to the surface of the trap by modifying the crystallization protocol was also attempted but without success. The optical tweezers system tested in this thesis can not be directly applied in sample delivery in crystallography. Further studies and alterations are suggested, such as implementing a split waveguide with counter-propagating beams which can lift the particles some micrometers from the surface as demonstrated by Helle et al...|$|E

40|$|We {{survey the}} few exact {{results on the}} Stormer problem {{describing}} the dynamics of charged particles in the Earth magnetosphere.

40|$|Extent: 20 p. During the Tropical Warm Pool International Cloud Experiment (TWPICE) {{an intense}} {{tropical}} low was situated between Darwin and Alice Springs, Australia. Observations made on 31 January 2006 by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder instrument on the NASA Aqua satellite imaged {{the presence of}} atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs), at approximately 40 km altitude, with horizontal wavelengths between 200 and 400 km that were originating from {{the region of the}} storm. Airglow images obtained from Alice Springs (about 600 km {{from the center of the}} low) showed the presence of similar waves with observed periods of 1 to 2 h. The images also revealed the presence of 30 - to 45 -km-horizontal-wavelength AGWs with shorter observed periods of near 15 to 25 min. Ray tracing calculations show that (1) some of the long wavelength waves traveled on rays, without ducting, to the altitudes where the observations were obtained, and (2) shorter-period waves rapidly reached 85 km altitude at a horizontal distance close to the storm, thus occurring over Alice Springs only if they were trapped or ducted. The mesospheric inversion layer seen in the measured temperature data almost forms such a <b>trapped</b> <b>region.</b> The winds therefore critically control the formation of the <b>trapped</b> <b>region.</b> Wind profiles deduced from the available data show the plausibility for the formation of such a <b>trapped</b> <b>region.</b> Variations in the wind, however, would make ideal <b>trapped</b> <b>region</b> conditions short-lived, and this may account for the sporadic nature of the short-period wave observations.

The exterior geometry {{is shown to}} be similar to that of a long-lived transient black hole, with a few subtle differences. The large-scale global structure of the geometry is examined through the construction of a conformal diagram, which exhibits no event horizon and bears resemblance to that of a Minkowski spacetime.

Numerical simulations carried out on the tested structure by introducing a <b>trapping</b> <b>region</b> at the gate edge of the device barrier confirm the experimentally observed device degradation.
