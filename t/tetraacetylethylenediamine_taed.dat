50|$|Sodium {{perborate}} releases oxygen rapidly {{at temperatures}} over 60 °C. To make it active at lower temperatures (40-60 °C), {{it has to}} be mixed with a suitable activator, typically <b>tetraacetylethylenediamine</b> (<b>TAED).</b>|$|E
50|$|Peracetic acid is {{generated}} in situ by some laundry detergents. This route involves {{the reaction of}} <b>tetraacetylethylenediamine</b> (<b>TAED)</b> {{in the presence of}} an alkaline hydrogen peroxide solution The peracetic acid is a more effective bleaching agent than hydrogen peroxide itself. PAA is also formed naturally in the environment through a series of photochemical reactions involving formaldehyde and photo-oxidant radicals.|$|E
50|$|Bleach {{activators}} are {{compounds that}} react with hydrogen peroxide {{in aqueous solution}} to form peroxy acids. Peroxy acids are more active bleaches than hydrogen peroxide at lower temperatures (<60 °C). Bleach activators are a component of most laundry detergents. The most common bleach activators used commercially are <b>tetraacetylethylenediamine</b> (<b>TAED)</b> and sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (NOBS). NOBS is the main activator used in the U.S.A. and Japan. TAED is the main activator used in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main targets}} of bleaches are oxidisible organic stains; {{which are usually}} of {{vegetable}} origin (e.g. chlorophyll, anthocyanin dyes, tannins, humic acids, andcarotenoid pigments). Despite the name, modern beaching agents do not include household bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Laundry bleaches are typically stable adducts of hydrogen peroxide, such as sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate, these are inactive as solids but will react with water to release hydrogen peroxide which performs the bleaching action. [...] "Bleach activators" [...] such as <b>tetraacetylethylenediamine</b> (<b>TAED)</b> may also be used, these react with hydrogen peroxide to produce peracetic acid, which is an even more effective bleach.|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{and water}} react with <b>tetraacetylethylenediamine</b> (<b>TAED)</b> to form consecutively triacetylethylenediamine and diacetylethylenediamine {{with the release}} of two molecules of peracetic acid or acetic acid. The effect of pH, specific buffers and temperature on the rates of hydrolysis and perhydrolysis are compared. Peracetic acid reacts with TAED very slowly. The ratio of the second-order rate constants for the reaction of TAED with hydroperoxide and peracetate anions is exceptionally large after taking into account the difference in pKa values of their conjugate acids. The relative reactivity of various nucleophiles with TAED is discussed in terms of its performance as a bleach activator...|$|E
40|$|International audienceComplexation {{properties}} of two phosphonic acids: nitrilotris (methylenephosphonic acid) and 1 -hydroxyethane- 1, 10 -diphosphonic acid, with Cu(II) and Ca(II) have been previously determined by pH and ionic selective electrode titrations. These phosphonic acids are commonly added to washing powders as polyphosphate substitutes and are here {{studied in the}} presence of another detergent compound: <b>tetraacetylethylenediamine</b> (<b>TAED),</b> a bleaching activator. Product concentrations were chosen in order to correspond to component concentration ratios encountered in washing powders. Potentiometric titrations were carried out to determine the possible TAED interferences; they indicate that TAED and its by-products have no action on phosphonic acid complexing behaviour. Under our experimental conditions, the action of TAED was modelled with acetic acid and ethylenediamine, the final by-products of TAED hydrolysis. If we take into account both phosphonic and acetic acids, speciation diagrams corresponding to representative fresh water systems showed that the acetic acid does not influence cation speciation...|$|E
40|$|Segregation in {{particulate}} {{systems may}} be caused by particle size, density and shape distributions leading to negative effects on product quality as well as the production costs. Quantifying powder segregation using a reliable and robust method is challenging, particularly for low content level ingredients. In this paper, we evaluate the application of NIR spectral analysis for detecting the extent of segregation of components in a multi-component mixture. As a model system, a typical laundry detergent formulation, comprising spray-dried powder, known as Blown Powder (BP), <b>Tetraacetylethylenediamine</b> (<b>TAED)</b> and enzyme placebo granules, is used. The effect of using different pre-processing methods on the measured component fractions is analysed. These are scatter correction using Standard Normal Variate (SNV) as well as derivative correction using first, second, Norris-Williams and Savitzky-Golay derivatives. The results from the NIR technique are compared to those obtained by image analysis. Concepts of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used to evaluate the accuracy of different pre-processing methods. The second derivative of Norris-Williams method shows the best pre-processing method for the quantification of low content level enzyme placebo granules in the ternary mixture of detergent powder. Using the proposed NIR technique and the optimum pre-processing method, the segregation index of a low content level ingredient, such as enzyme placebo granules, is estimated to be 0. 71 for a ternary heap of washing powders...|$|E
