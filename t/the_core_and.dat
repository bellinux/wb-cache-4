5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from <b>the</b> <b>core,</b> <b>and</b> the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. A comparable quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received. This is typically larger than the core radius.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{temperature}} difference between <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>and</b> the surface, or photosphere, energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are radiation and convection. A radiation zone, where energy is transported by radiation, is stable against convection and {{there is very little}} mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a convection zone the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>and</b> limits core collapse.|$|E

5|$|The current view among astronomers who model Type Ia {{supernova}} explosions, however, is {{that this}} limit is never actually attained and collapse is never initiated. Instead, the increase in pressure and density due to the increasing weight raises the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>core,</b> <b>and</b> as the white dwarf approaches about 99% of the limit, a period of convection ensues, lasting approximately 1,000years. At some point in this simmering phase, a deflagration flame front is born, powered by carbon fusion. The details of the ignition are still unknown, including the location and number of points where the flame begins. Oxygen fusion is initiated shortly thereafter, but this fuel is not consumed as completely as carbon.|$|E

5|$|Maya {{cities were}} not {{formally}} planned, and {{were subject to}} irregular expansion, with the haphazard addition of palaces, temples and other buildings. Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from <b>the</b> <b>core,</b> <b>and</b> upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture. Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes. The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls. These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes. Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty. City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools. Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city. Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages. The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages. The largest and richest of these elite compounds sometimes possessed sculpture and art of craftsmanship {{equal to that of}} royal art.|$|E
5|$|Fluctuations in {{the orbits}} of the moons {{indicate}} that their mean density decreases with distance from Jupiter. Callisto, the outermost and least dense of the four, has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas Io, the innermost and densest moon, has a density intermediate between rock and iron. Callisto has an ancient, heavily cratered and unaltered ice surface {{and the way it}} rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed, suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice. This may well have been the original structure of all the moons. The rotation of the three inner moons, in contrast, indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>and</b> lighter matter above. They also reveal significant alteration of the surface. Ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers. Europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature, suggesting a thinner ice crust. Finally, Io, the innermost moon, has a sulfur surface, active volcanism and no sign of ice. All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior. The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating {{as a result of the}} gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet. In all but Callisto this will have melted the interior ice, allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface. In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed. In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed. In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space.|$|E
