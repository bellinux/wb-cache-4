[...] Among public figures whose recent behavior fit the [...] "corncob" [...] archetype, Knibbs listed Donald Trump, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, actress Louise Linton, Kim Kardashian's friend Jonathan Cheban, Kanye West (noting his numerous outbursts and 2016 song [...] "Famous"), and Taylor Swift (noting her 2017 song [...] "Look What You Made Me Do").|$|E
