25|$|Sister Abhaya was {{reported}} missing {{on the morning of}} 27 March 1992. She had woken at 4:00am to study for exams, and was last known to have gone to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drink. The refrigerator door was left ajar, a bottle of water was spilled on the floor and a single slipper sat under the fridge – its pair was found beside the convent hostel’s well. After a brief search, Sister Abhaya’s body was found in the convent hostel’s well {{in the early hours of}} the same day. Kottayam West Police Station upgraded their investigation to that of an unnatural death.|$|E
25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} that when we saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen at the door to the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to the bedroom to put her to bed.|$|E
500|$|When {{the station}} {{initially}} opened, entrances from 14th Street opened into a large, octagonal rotunda where ticket offices, checked baggage, and a newsstand were located. As {{the railroad tracks}} are grade separated behind Union Station, the platforms are accessed by a pedestrian tunnel under the tracks with stairs {{that lead to the}} platforms. The tunnel entrance is directly across the rotunda from the street entrancea portion of which is now used as <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brewpub housed inside the station. The concourse, off the rotunda, led to the Peach Street entrances, and contained space for a soda fountain, a barber shop, and telegraph offices, as well as access to the station's [...] waiting room. Facing Peach Street, a dining room and lunch counter run by the Union News Company, which operated the majority of the dining services in New York Central stations, were {{at the opposite end of}} Union Station from the rotunda. The entire ground floor was laid with terrazzo featuring a mosaic border and Botticino marble paneling along the plaster walls. A green and tan color scheme was originally used throughout the entire building. Superintendents for both the New York Central and Pennsylvania railroads, as well as other railroad officials, had offices on the second floor of Union Station.|$|E
3000|$|The [...] "kitchen party" [...] {{scenario}} generically {{describes a}} get-together {{of a number}} of people in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> informal gathering, usually accompanied by food and drinks. Such informal gatherings benefit social networking and the quick exchange of ideas. This scenario is detected from the same sensor types like the [...] "prepare coffee" [...] event. However, in this case, there have to be detected two or more persons based on video data and data from the tactile floor sensors and motion detectors. Additionally, food and drinks on the table have to be identified from the video data and voices from the microphone.|$|R

60|$|There was a merry clatter in <b>the</b> big <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour; then Aunt Plumy and her {{daughter}} shut themselves up in the pantry to perform some culinary rites, and the young ladies went to inspect certain antique costumes laid forth in Sophie's room.|$|R
60|$|He {{took a big}} shawl, {{folded her}} round, and went out into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lantern.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Blythe {{walked up}} and down <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment or two while the baby stared at the white walls of the soup tureen and Susan showed signs of {{returning}} animation.|$|E
60|$|Whilst Pat {{walked into}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lighted piece of turf (Hibernice, coal) to kindle his patron's pipe, Thady stuck the said pipe in his jaw, and {{continued}} poring over the unsatisfactory {{figures of the}} Ballycloran rent-book.|$|E
50|$|Although Zhang Dan (San Yow) {{has been}} deitified as <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen</b> God <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few {{thousand}} years, his mortal former wife remains his lasting regret. Thus, he peeks at her {{every time she}} is reincarnated, going to her rescue whenever she needs help.|$|R
60|$|Dink searched about <b>the</b> summer <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ax or hatchet; but {{failing to}} find either rummaged through a table drawer {{until he came}} upon a large carving knife. This would do the job nicely. He thumbed the edge as he carried {{it back into the}} parlor to Crumb.|$|R
6000|$|... "No: I wish I did." [...] And mamma sighed; {{for baby}} was poorly, piles of sewing lay waiting for her, Biddy was turning things topsy-turvy in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> want of <b>a</b> {{word from the}} mistress, and Polly was looking sullen.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned to}} a small writing-table, and {{with an air of}} preoccupation, assumed for Miss Hartley’s benefit, began to try a pen on his thumb-nail. Hartley, going to the door, sent the {{boatswain}} off to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> glass of ale.|$|E
60|$|But McAllister did not confine {{his efforts}} {{solely to the}} region of mind. While he was earnestly {{administering}} doses of the wisdom of Stewart and Locke to the agitated lady in the parlour, Dan and Hugh, with several others, were, by his orders, arming themselves in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> regular search.|$|E
60|$|Matilda {{heard and}} understood. 'So that's your big idea, is it, my little man,' {{she said to}} herself. She had always said of Hadrian {{that he had no}} proper respect for anybody or anything, that he was sly and common. She went down to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sotto voce confab with Emmie.|$|E
50|$|Lore {{finds it}} {{difficult}} to adjust and refuses to cheerfully dance to American music with Liesel in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> She goes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{walk in the woods}} and looks at the identity papers and family pictures of Thomas Weil in Thomas's wallet.|$|R
50|$|Washington allowed Hercules' son Richmond to work {{alongside}} {{his father in}} <b>the</b> Philadelphia <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> about <b>a</b> year, before returning him to Virginia. In November 1796, Richmond was implicated in a theft of money at Mount Vernon. Washington had suspicions that {{the father and son}} were planning a joint escape.|$|R
50|$|They have channeled their fantastical and sci-fi leanings {{into their}} shows. Prepping for past gigs {{included}} dressing {{as if they}} were starring in the Ice Capades, crafting massive Native American headresses, and making vats of theatrical blood in <b>the</b> Dompe family <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Carrie-themed summertime barbecue at The Echo in Echo Park.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{some time}} after that Vahna used to fluster up {{whenever}} she saw me. Then she took to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> spell. But after a long time she began hanging around the big room again. She was still mighty shy, but she'd keep on following me about with those big eyes of hers--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mrs. Dr. dear, I {{beg your}} pardon. I {{ought not to}} have said {{anything}} like that out loud. I sometimes forget that I resolved to be a heroine. This--this has shaken me a little. But I will not forget myself again. Only if things do not go as smoothly in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days I hope you will make due allowance for me. At least," [...] said poor Susan, forcing a grim smile in a desperate effort to recover lost standing, [...] "at least flying is a clean job. He will not get so dirty and messed up as he would in the trenches, and that is well, for {{he has always been}} a tidy child." ...|$|E
6000|$|But I made a {{struggle}} to take her place. Every morning Pollie would carry me off to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> discussion with Mrs Ballard over the household affairs of the day. With her fat, floury hand, she would hide her mouth and gravely nod her head at my instructions. But I knew she was concealing her amusement. [...] "Oh, these men!" [...] she once exclaimed at some new caprice of [...] "the master's," [...] "they are never happy unless they can be where they bain't." [...] With my own hand I printed out for her a list of my father's favourite dishes. I left off my black and wore bright colours again, {{so that he might}} not be constantly reminded of the past. But when after long debate I took courage one day to propose myself as his housekeeper--I shall never forget the facial expression which he quickly rubbed off with his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{was out of}} town-- {{calling on}} my mother, who is very old and quite sick. There was {{a fire in the}} pantry off <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes it looked as if the old jail would burn to the ground. Of course the guards got excited, and all they thought of was to put out the blaze-- and it's a good thing they did that. That's how the prisoners got away. I suppose you've heard that we rounded up two of them." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1979, {{due to lack}} {{of space}} and <b>the</b> need <b>for</b> <b>kitchen</b> facilities, <b>a</b> {{structural}} addition was made to the club. The addition included <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> with serving area and men’s and women’s locker rooms and some storage area on the lower level. Some remodeling was also done to the existing club.|$|R
50|$|The {{inside of}} the house is much the same design. However, a lot is still in store <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{inquisitive}} visitor. The villa also offers other verandas at the second floor and a minor rooftop and chimneys <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Not bad <b>for</b> <b>a</b> house made in 1932 at a hefty value of (reportedly) P90,000.|$|R
6000|$|The month being March {{the trees}} were {{exceptionally}} like the masts of ships, and for little Jon that was a wonderful Spring, extremely hard on his knees, suits, and the patience of [...] "Da," [...] who had the washing and reparation of his clothes. Every morning the moment his breakfast was over, he could be viewed by his mother and father, whose windows looked out that way, coming from the study, crossing the terrace, climbing the old oak tree, his face resolute and his hair bright. He began the day thus because there was not time to go far afield before his lessons. The old tree's variety never staled; it had mainmast, foremast, top-gallant mast, and he could always come down by the halyards--or ropes of the swing. After his lessons, completed by eleven, {{he would go to}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> thin piece of cheese, a biscuit and two French plums--provision enough for a jolly-boat at least--and eat it in some imaginative way; then, armed to the teeth with gun, pistols, and sword, he would begin the serious climbing of the morning, encountering by the way innumerable slavers, Indians, pirates, leopards, and bears. He was seldom seen at that hour of the day without a cutlass in his teeth (like Dick Needham) amid the rapid explosion of copper caps. And many were the gardeners he brought down with yellow peas shot out of his little gun. He lived a life of the most violent action.|$|E
50|$|In {{the city}} of Katowice, Brendan wants the Brits to {{get a taste of}} Polish life. So he leads them {{straight}} to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lesson in sausage soup and beetroot salads.|$|E
50|$|After sending Tom to bed, {{she sleeps}} herself {{and dreams of}} suffocating Tom so that she won't {{have to take care}} of him any more. While she sleeps, the front door is opened, and an unknown person {{releases}} the tiger into the house. When Kelly goes to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drink, she finds a note from John claiming that he has gone to the store. Returning upstairs, she sees the tiger cross the foyer beneath her.|$|E
60|$|When she {{had done}} that she went away to the pig-sty, but all the way as she went she wept, and was very sorrowful. Then she put on the wooden gown, {{and walked to the}} King's palace. When she got there she went into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and begged <b>for</b> <b>a</b> place, saying that her name was Kari Woodengown.|$|R
5000|$|Parloa, in her 1880 cookbook, {{took two}} pages to list all of <b>the</b> {{essential}} <b>kitchen</b> utensils <b>for</b> <b>a</b> well-furnished <b>kitchen,</b> a list running to 93 distinct sorts of item. The 1882 edition ran to 20 pages illustrating and describing the various utensils <b>for</b> <b>a</b> well-furnished <b>kitchen.</b> Sarah Tyson Rorer&#39;s 1886 Philadelphia Cook Book [...] listed more than 200 kitchen utensils that a well-furnished kitchen should have.|$|R
50|$|Also {{unique to}} this restaurant, is that <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> was created {{on the second}} level of <b>the</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> was fantastic to work in as it had rows of windows that allowed {{sunlight}} to fill <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> making <b>for</b> <b>a</b> very cherry work environment. Initially, the hope was to send the food down to the main level on an automated dumb waiter that landed in the bar area. Unfortunately, this idea proved to be less efficient than was expected and the device that was designed and built at great cost was never used for this purpose. The restaurant reverted to using person-power to run the food down the stairs on large oval trays.|$|R
5000|$|Åkerfeldt {{described}} {{the recording of}} the album as [...] "rather smooth". Soilwork was recording in the studio {{at the same time}} as Opeth. Åkerfeldt wrote that Opeth felt like [...] "a bunch of amateurs in comparison. They were working all the time. When they came into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> break, we're still there, on the same break we took 3 hours ago. We don't want this to become a 'job', or something you do because you have to. We wanna have a good time, and thus we only work when it feels right." ...|$|E
5000|$|Finally exhausted, {{and showing}} visible wear and bruises, they {{eventually}} blame the violence on TV. Peter wonders how come [...] "the government (couldn't) {{step in and}} tell us what we can and can't watch". He then [...] "shame(s) on the network (FOX) that puts this junk on the air", to which Lois nervously warns him not to badmouth the network despite that. Peter doesn't seem afraid, not thinking their budget could be cut. He says he's going into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> beer. He then exits in a very slow-transition-of-frame motion.|$|E
5000|$|Steerpike's backstory was amended for the TV series. In Titus Groan he {{had only}} been in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few weeks before making his escape, while on TV in a {{monologue}} to his monkey in episode 4, Steerpike stated that {{he was sent to}} the kitchens when he was six, suffering various abuses at the hands of Swelter. In the DVD documentary The Making of Gormenghast Jonathan Rhys-Myers (who played Steerpike) stated that the character of Steerpike had been subjected to sexual abuse in the kitchens, though this was not made explicit in any of the episodes.|$|E
50|$|The above has {{ensured that}} Surinamese cooking has spawned many dishes; the {{different}} groups {{were influenced by}} each other's dishes and ingredients; this new Surinamese cuisine included roti, nasi goreng, bakmi, pom, snesi foroe, moksi meti, and losi foroe; because of this blending of many cultures, Surinamese cuisine is a unique creation. Basic foods include rice, plants such as tayer and cassava, and roti. Usually, there is chicken on the menu in many variations of the Chinese snesi foroe, the Indian chicken masala and pom, a very popular party dish of Creole origin. Also, salted meat and stockfish (bakkeljauw) are widely used. Yardlong beans, okra, and eggplant are examples of vegetables in <b>the</b> Surinamese <b>kitchen.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> spicy taste, Madame Jeanette peppers are used.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, brother, if thou know'st not, we {{will not}} tell thee till thou art in the refectory," [...] {{answered}} the monks; [...] "suffice it that the Lord Abbot had ordered these, our zealous and faithful vassals, instantly to set forth to guard thee from imminent peril--Ye may ungirth your horses, children, and dismiss; and to-morrow, each who was at this rendezvous may send to <b>the</b> convent <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quarter of a yard of roast beef, and a black-jack full of double ale." [...] [Footnote: It {{was one of the}} few reminiscences of Old Parr, or Henry Jenkins, I forget which, that, at some convent in the veteran's neighbourhood, the community, before the dissolution, used to dole out roast-beef in the measure of feet and yards.] ...|$|R
60|$|I am perpetually {{wandering}} (in fancy) up {{and down}} the house[51] and tumbling over the workmen; when I feel that they are gone to dinner I become low, when I look forward to their total abstinence on Sunday, I am wretched. The gravy at dinner has a taste of glue in it. I smell paint in the sea. Phantom lime attends me all the day long. I dream that I am a carpenter and can't partition off the hall. I frequently dance (with a distinguished company) in the drawing-room, and fall into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>for</b> want of <b>a</b> pillar.|$|R
