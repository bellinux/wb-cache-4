5|$|Instrumentally, the {{two worlds}} {{represented}} within the opera are distinctively portrayed. The pastoral world of the fields of Thrace {{is represented by the}} strings, harpsichords, harp, organs, recorders and chitarroni. The remaining instruments, mainly brass, are associated with the Underworld, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> absolute distinction; strings appear on several occasions in the Hades scenes. Within this general ordering, specific instruments or combinations are used to accompany some of the main characters—Orpheus by harp and organ, shepherds by harpsichord and chitarrone, the Underworld gods by trombones and regal. All of these musical distinctions and characterisations were in accordance with the longstanding traditions of the Renaissance orchestra, of which the large L'Orfeo ensemble is typical.|$|E

25|$|One key {{concept in}} {{distinguishing}} secret societies from fraternities is that, on campuses that have {{both kinds of}} organizations, one can {{be a member of}} both, (that is, membership is not mutually exclusive).

25|$|When {{a number}} is {{represented}} in some format (such as a character string) {{which is not a}} native floating-point representation supported in a computer implementation, then it will require a conversion before it can be used in that implementation. If the number can be represented exactly in the floating-point format then the conversion is exact. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> exact representation then the conversion requires a choice of which floating-point number to use to represent the original value. The representation chosen will have a different value from the original, and the value thus adjusted is called the rounded value.|$|E
25|$|But {{the alleged}} {{right to a}} new trial is not a {{sufficient}} guarantee for the defendant, as clearly ruled the ECtHR {{in the case of}} Krombach v. France, application no. 29731/96, and also article 6 of ECHR, the juridical ground of Battisti's claim against extradition, doesn't prescribe a new trial. ECHR establishes that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> absolute right to a new trial, after a trial in absentia. Battisti's claim concerned the defendant's knowledge of the trial, and Battisti's lawyers argued that the defendant had not been in a position to know that in Italy there was a trial against him and so his rights had been violated.|$|E
25|$|Kelly and Hauck's {{research}} found that divisions of labor within a same-sex relationship {{can not be}} viewed as setting a precedent as to what gender roles are normal. A female partner in a same-sex relationship may perform chores that are considered feminine, like cooking, cleaning, and child rearing. However, the other female partner may perform chores that are considered masculine, like outside work and employment outside of the home. The partners’ behaviors do not support gender roles because all the roles performed are done by women. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> inherent distinction made between masculine and feminine because women are performing both types of chores. This lack of gender role discrimination would be true in same-sex relationships between two men as well.|$|E

25|$|Hotel {{operators}} in Downtown reacted favorably, predicting {{that the move}} would cause an increase in occupancy rates in their hotels. In 2008 Continental renewed its lease in the building. Before the lease renewal, rumors spread stating that the airline would relocate its headquarters to office space outside of Downtown. Steven Biegel, the {{senior vice president of}} Studley Inc. and a representative of office building tenants, said that if Continental's space went vacant, the vacancy would not have had a significant impact in the Downtown Houston submarket as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> abundance of available space, and the empty property would be likely that another potential tenant would occupy it. Jennifer Dawson of the Houston Business Journal said that if Continental Airlines left Continental Center I, the development of Brookfield Properties's new office tower would have been delayed. As of September 2011 the headquarters moved out, but Continental will continue to house employees in the building. It will have about half of the employees that it once had.|$|E

500|$|The {{derivation}} of {{the name}} is uncertain, but several ideas have been proposed. One is that the [...] "Eccles" [...] place-name {{is derived from the}} Romano-British Ecles or Eglys, itself derived from the Ancient Greek Ecclesia. [...] Following the arrival in AD613 of the invading Anglo-Saxons at Lancashire, many existing British place-names, especially rivers and hills (the River Irwell for example), survived intact. The root [...] "Ecles", found in several village names, is an exception to this. A popular theory is that the word denoted the site of a building recognised by the Anglo-Saxons as a church and feature of the landscape. Eccles appears to have been such a village, and Ecles may be the likely source of the modern name. [...] In Kenyon's Origins of Lancashire (1991), however, the author suggests that {{this may not be the}} case as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> exact correlation between [...] "Eccles" [...] place-names and pre-Domesday hundreds in south Lancashire.|$|E
