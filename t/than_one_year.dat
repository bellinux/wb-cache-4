The mechanism {{was thought to be}} a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E

5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, {{but not to}} more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year.</b> Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.|$|E

Signed as a replacement for David Burrows, Bjørnebye debuted inauspiciously on 19 December 1992 in a 5–1 defeat to Coventry City.

60|$|The lands {{held by the}} zemindars of {{that country}} are of many descriptions. The first and most general are those that pay revenue; the others are {{of the nature of}} demesne lands, which are free, and pay no rent to government. The latter are for the {{immediate}} support of the zemindars and their families,--as from the former they derive their influence, authority, and the means of upholding their dignity. The lands of the former description were immediately attached, sequestered, and sold for the most trifling consideration. The rent-free lands, the best and richest lands of the whole province, were sold,--sold for--what do your Lordships think? They were sold for less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year's</b> purchase,--at less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year's</b> purchase, at the most underrated value; so that the fee-simple of an English acre of rent-free land sold at the rate of seven or eight shillings. Such a sale, on such terms, strongly indicated the purchaser. And how did it turn out in fact? The purchaser was the very agent and instrument of Mr. Hastings, Debi Sing himself. He made the exaction; he forced the sale; he reduced the rate; and he became the purchaser at less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year's</b> purchase, and paid with the very money which he had extorted from the miserable vendors.|$|R

The Constitution does not stipulate any procedure for the removal of a member besides disqualification and the member's own resignation.|$|E
5|$|As the match-fixing scandal took centrestage, former player Manoj Prabhakar accused Kapil Dev {{of trying}} to bribe him in 1994 during a tournament in Sri Lanka.

The reports of CBI (India's premier investigating agency) and K.

5|$|Domesticated rats have {{a longer}} {{lifespan}} than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a lifespan of less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year.</b> However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers like cockroaches and fleas.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{after the}} French Fourth Republic began to {{consider}} granting independence {{to most of}} its African colonies, Boganda met with Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared {{the establishment of the}} Central African Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first President of the independent CAR. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to Bangui. Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the French secret service, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the Central African Republic attained formal independence from France.|$|E

5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adults, {{but lack}} throat hackles, and sometimes have a pink fleshy gape. The bill is shorter and shallower; its base can be pinkish and the tip can be light grey.

Eye colour varies with age, gradually lightening from juvenile to adult. Nestlings up to four months old have blue-grey irises, juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises, and immature birds have hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months. Immature birds older <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> develop hackles, while some pink remains in the gape until the bird is {{two or three years}} of age.|$|E

A bill passed in 2000 grants the Senate President the honorary title of Lieutenant Governor, but this title is rarely used in practice and the terms of the Senate President do not correspond with governorships. The same bill states that the line of succession after the Senate President will be the Speaker of the House of Delegates, followed by the state attorney general, the state auditor and former governors, in inverse order of term, that are in residence in the state {{at the time of the}} vacancy.|$|E
