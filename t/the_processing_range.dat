First, {{we carry out}} rotary bending fatigue tests and investigate the fatigue strength for smooth specimens, specimen made only using cutting work, and specimens processed using a new plastic working developed originally. Secondly, we measure the Vickers hardness values to investigate strain hardening near the processed part. Finally, we simulate stress and strain distributions of the shaft during the processing using finite element method (FEM) and calculate the stress concentration rate at the notch root of the processed part.

40|$|AbstractThe {{rheology}} {{of native}} silk protein feedstock specimens was characterised by shear and oscillatory measurements, over the temperature range from 2 to 55 °C, producing {{no evidence of}} thermally-driven phase change behaviour. All specimens exhibited flow characteristics typical of a concentrated polymer solution, with visco-elastic behaviour dominated by two main relaxation modes exhibiting time constants around 0. 44 and 0. 055 s at 25 °C. The specimens showed well-behaved temperature dependence following the Arrhenius equation, consistent with the kinetics being governed by an activation energy of flow, which ranged from 30. 9 to 55. 4 kJmol− 1 based on oscillatory data. Consequently, for the first time, {{it was possible to}} compile master-curves for native silk feedstock specimens following the principles of time-temperature superposition, using oscillatory data demonstrating visco-elastic behaviour typical of a polymer solution across a wide temperature range.

40|$|Although {{numerical}} simulation {{has proved to}} be a useful tool to predict the filling behavior of injection molding products, few applications in reaction injection mold-ing (RIM) have been reported. This is mainly due to the lack of appropriate descrip-tions of the material behavior, and to the lack of accurate material data. The analysis of the filling stage of the RIM process requires the determination of the cure kinetics and the rheological, PUT, and thermal behavior of the material, which in this study is a highly filled copolymer of ethylene and vinyl-acetate (EVA). Since this copolymer yields some viscosity anomalies, due to the amount of filler, the rheology of a similar EVA compound with low filler content was also investigated. The viscosity of this compound can be described by a Carreau model at low conversions levels (< 1 % I, whereas a conversion-dependent Power-Law model proves appropri-ate for higher conversion. Moreover, the viscosity behavior of both compositions is similar in <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> <b>range.</b> The combined Carreau / Power Law viscosity model is used for the {{numerical simulation}}s of a complex product.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Polymeric systems become increasingly complicated and multifunctional if they involve a larger level of structural complexity. In {{the last couple of}} decades the level of interest has gradually shifted from the μm-scale to the nm-scale region, for instance, systems having at least one structural size below 100 nm, e. g. nanocomposites. The physical properties of polymers such as crystallisation, tensile modulus, impact strength and viscosity are strongly influenced by the presence of additives in the polymer matrix. Semicrystalline polymers comprise nearly two-thirds of all synthetic polymers. These are processed to form films, fibers, and moulded articles using operations such as extrusion, moulding, fiber spinning, film blowing etc. During these processes, the polymer melt is subjected to complex and intense flow fields (shear or elongational) after which the polymer crystallises. The morphology of the semicrystalline polymer in the final product and subsequently its properties and quality, depend on {{the manner in which the}} polymer crystallises from the flowing melt. The subject is continuously driven by the quest to understand the molecular mechanism of flow induced crystallisation; nevertheless, the flow induced crystallisation in presence of nanofillers has received little attention. The thesis deals with the crystallisation studies of polymer molecules during shear in presence of nanofillers (viz. single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and zirconia particle) having different aspect ratio. For this purpose, the polyethylene (PE) consisting of desired molar mass and molar mass distribution within <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> <b>range</b> is utilised. The morphology of semicrystalline polymer is revealed using time resolved X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) techniques. The rheological aspects of polymer melt in presence of nanoparticles are manifested. In chapter 2, the effect of SWCNTs on the crystallisation kinetics of polymers has been studied with and without application of shear rate. The shear rate effect on the formation of shish-kebab structures in the polymer containing SWCNTs is investigated. The effect of shear rates on the stretching of long chains of PE is verified using the approach involving the use of Deborah number. The study reveals the significance of SWCNTs on crystallisation of PE. In chapter 3, the influence of zirconia nanoparticles on crystal orientation of polymers is studied. Enhanced crystallisation kinetics is observed due to presence of zirconia nanoparticles. Overall crystal orientation is improved as a result of zirconia nanoparticles in the polymer matrix. In chapter 4 of the thesis, the role of broad molecular weight distribution of PE in formation of oriented (shish-kebab) structures is demonstrated. The presence of nanoparticles of different aspect ratios and binding efficiency with polymer on the formation of highly oriented structures in the early stage crystallisation is verified. The study reveals the significant role of SWCNTs in shish-kebab structure formation as compared to zirconia nanoparticles. Further, the insight on the selective adsorption of polymer chains to the nanoparticles is provided. In chapter 5 of the thesis, the molecular interaction between polymer and nanoparticles under shear above the equilibrium point (T = 141. 2 °C) is investigated. The study reveals the major role of SWCNTs with high aspect ratio, in the stability of flow induced precursor (FIP) and formation of extended chain crystals, as a result of strong interaction with PE molecules. On contrary, the poor interaction of Zirconia particles having low aspect ratio, with PE molecules prohibits molecular chain extension...|$|E

40|$|The Saltstone Production Facility has a 10 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous}} mixer that mixes the premix dry feeds and low-level waste salt solution to make fresh (uncured) saltstone. Inspection of the mixer in January 2013 showed significant wear on the third, {{fourth and fifth}} paddle pairs after the conveying augers. A 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous mixer}} {{was used to test}} alternate paddle configurations for use in the 10 -inch mixer to decrease the wear rate on the paddles. Two wear tests were conducted to investigate a method of reducing wear on the mixer paddles. The first test (wear test 2 a) had a paddle configuration similar to the currently installed 10 -inch mixer in the SPF. This test established baseline wear. The second test (wear test 2 b) had a reconfigured paddle arrangement that replaced the flat paddles with helical paddles for paddle pairs 2 � 6 and aligned paddle pair 1 with the augers. The intent of the reconfiguration was to more effectively convey the partially wetted dry feeds through the transition region and into the liquid feed where paddle wear is reduced due to dry feeds and salt solution being mixed at the intended water to premix ratio. The design of the helical paddles provides conveyance through the transition region to the liquid feed inlet. The alignment with the auger is aimed to provide a smoother transition (minimizing the discontinuity between the auger and paddle pair 1) into the downstream paddles. A soft metal with low wear resistance (6000 series aluminum) was used for the wear testing paddles to determine wear patterns while minimizing run time and maximizing wear rate. For the two paddle configurations tested using the scaled 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto continuous mixer, with the first six paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles and the remaining paddles were stainless steel. Since the 10 -inch SPF mixer is designed with the liquid inlet centered over paddle pairs 5 and 6, the scaled 2 -inch mixer was configured the same way. The wear rate from wear test 2 a was approximately double the wear rate from wear test 2 b for paddle pairs 4 and 5. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on paddle pairs 1, 2, 3 and 6 based on mass change, indicating that the un-wetted and fully wetted premix materials cause less wear than the partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles showed more deformation on the flat paddles than the helical paddles which was consistent with the wear rates. Aligning of the auger discharge flight with paddle pair 1 resulted in a lower wear rate paddle pair 1 rather than having them misaligned with the feed augers. During the paddle wear tests, polishing wear was observed on the inside barrel of the mixer. The polishing wear is evident on the upper housing clamshell and the lower housing clamshell primarily at paddle pairs 4 and 5, which is the transition region of the mixer. Wear on the mixer barrel increases the space between the paddles and the barrel, resulting in increased grout build up on the barrel. Since the mixer barrel cannot be reconfigured or replaced in the SPF, the method for mitigating wear on the barrel is to move the more viscous grout through the transition region as quickly as possible. In addition, the location of the liquid inlet does not allow for sufficient cleaning of the mixer since residual grout remains on paddle pairs 1 � 4. As the paddles continue to wear and the self-cleaning capability of the paddles is lost, the lack of sufficient flushing would aid in grout build up between the barrel and the paddles which could eventually lead to decreased throughput capacity of the dry feeds. Changing the paddle configuration from flat to helical resulted in no change to the rheological properties of the grout mixture. Both tests produced a grout that is within <b>the</b> <b>processing</b> <b>range</b> of the SPF. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended for the currently installed SPF mixer that paddle pairs 1 through 6 be helical rather than flat, with the paddle pair 1 aligned with the feed augers in order to minimize the wear occurring in the SPF mixer. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended that the mixer be inspected and critical measurements be taken whenever the SPF processing schedule allows in order to establish a wear rate of the 10 -inch mixer paddles. 5 Based on these measurements, the lifetime of paddles in the transition region can be established in order to set up a maintenance schedule for the mixer. Since replacing the entire mixer is very expensive and time intensive, replacing the worn paddles after a specific time period would allow for planned shutdowns as well as process optimization such that the mixer throughput is not compromised. In addition, further testing should be performed to determine an alternate liquid inlet location to better flush the mixer of residual grout at the end of processing. Sufficiently cleaning the mixer will help eliminate another potential source of wear. Another potential method for reducing the wear rate in the mixer is to reduce the mixer speed without affecting the throughput capacity. Since wear rate is a function of impact velocity of the grout and mixing paddles, testing could be done using the 2 -inch mixer determine the optimum mixer speed to reduce wear but not adversely impact facility operations (e. g. throughput capacity and grout properties) ...|$|E

In particular, this paper focuses on <b>processing</b> <b>range</b> monitoring queries in the road network, where movements of the objects are constrained by a predefined set of paths. One {{of the most important}} challenges of <b>processing</b> <b>range</b> monitoring queries is how to minimize the wireless communication cost and the server computation cost, both of which are heavily dependent on the amount of location-update stream generated by moving objects. The traditional centralized methods for range monitoring queries assume that moving objects periodically send location-updates to the server. However, when the number of moving objects becomes increasingly large, such an assumption may no longer be acceptable because the amount of location-update stream becomes enormous. Recently, some distributed methods have been proposed, where moving objects utilize their available computational capabilities for sending location-updates to the server only when necessary. Unfortunately, the existing distributed methods only deal with the objects moving in Euclidean space, and thus they cannot be extended to <b>processing</b> <b>range</b> monitoring queries over the objects moving along the road network. In this paper, we propose the distributed method for <b>processing</b> <b>range</b> monitoring queries in the road network.
