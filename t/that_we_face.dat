40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{our experience}} of knowledge and technology transfer {{within the context of}} the DEPLOY project. In particular, we describe some of the challenges <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> over the course of the project and the decisions <b>that</b> <b>we</b> made, along with their justification. We also summarise the lessons learned and what we would do differently in future technology transfer projects...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{our experience}} in teaching a “partially virtual ” course {{in which the}} course is delivered partly in a traditional classroom setting and partly online. We discuss both the successful aspects of our experience and the obstacles <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>faced.</b> The greatest challenge has been to mesh emerging pedagogies of active learning with newly available technologies. ...|$|R
500|$|Brown {{personally}} clarified his position. He said, [...] "We {{will not}} allow people to separate us from the United States of America {{in dealing with the}} common challenges <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>face</b> around the world. I think people have got to remember that the relationship between Britain and America and between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual. I will continue to work, as Tony Blair did, very closely with the American administration." ...|$|E

I think people have got to remember that the special relationship between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual.

500|$|Some critics accuse Black Lives Matter {{of being}} anti-police. Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. of Milwaukee County has been {{critical}} of Black Lives Matter, stating {{that there is no}} police brutality problem in America and that [...] "there is no racism in the hearts of police officers". Sgt. Demetrick Pennie of the Dallas Police Department filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against Black Lives Matter in September 2016, which accused the group of inciting a [...] "race war." [...] Marchers using a BLM banner were recorded in a video chanting, [...] "Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon" [...] at the Minnesota State Fair. Law enforcement groups said that the chant promotes death to police. The protest organizer disputed that interpretation, saying [...] "What we are promoting is that if black people who kill police officers are going to fry, then we want police officers to face the same treatment <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>face</b> as civilians for killing officers." [...] A North Carolina police chief retired after calling BLM a terrorist group. A police officer in Oregon was removed from street duty following a social media post in which he said he would have to [...] "babysit these fools", in reference to a planned BLM event.|$|E

60|$|There is no {{necessity}} to-night {{to plunge}} {{into a discussion}} of the philosophical divergencies between Socialism and Liberalism. It is not possible to draw a hard-and-fast line between individualism and collectivism. You cannot draw it either in theory or in practice. That is where the Socialist makes a mistake. Let us not imitate that mistake. No man can be a collectivist alone or an individualist alone. He must be both an individualist and a collectivist. The nature of man is a dual nature. The character of the organisation of human society is dual. Man is at once a unique being and a gregarious animal. For some purposes he must be collectivist, for others he is, and he will for all time remain, an individualist. Collectively we have an Army and a Navy and a Civil Service; collectively we have a Post Office, and a police, and a Government; collectively we light our streets and supply ourselves with water; collectively we indulge increasingly in all the necessities of communication. But we do not make love collectively, and the ladies do not marry us collectively, and we do not eat collectively, and we do not die collectively, and it is not collectively <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>face</b> the sorrows and the hopes, the winnings and the losings of this world of accident and storm.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{polarization}} results of sensitive low frequency WSRT {{observations of the}} cluster of galaxies Abell 2255. The RM cube at 350 MHz suggests that a conspicuous contribution to the polarized signal detected {{in the field of}} the cluster is due to our Galaxy. However, there are several cluster related features showing high polarization levels. Finally, we discuss a few issues related to the polarization calibration at low frequencies, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> during the reduction of the 150 MHz observations...|$|R

Firstly, we focus on infrastructure issues <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> during our initial steps. Subsequently, we describe the most important insights of three proofing tools developed by Neurosoft, i. e. the spelling checker, the hyphenator and the thesaurus, outlining their efficiencies and inefficiencies. Finally, we discuss some improvement ideas and give our future directions. 1...|$|R
6000|$|But the {{difference}} lies precisely in this&mdash;that the Christ of Mr. Kennedy's play insists on really knowing all the souls that he loves; he declines to conquer {{by a kind}} of supernatural stupidity. He pardons evil, but he will not ignore it. In other words, he is a Christian, and not a Christian Scientist. The distinction doubtless is partly explained by the problems severally selected. Mr. Jerome practically supposes Christ to be trying to save disreputable people; and that, of course, is naturally a simple business. Mr. Kennedy supposes Him to be trying to save the reputable people, which is a much larger affair. The chief characters in The Servant in the House are a popular and strenuous vicar, universally respected, and his fashionable and forcible wife. It would have been no good to tell these people they had some good in them&mdash;for that was what they were telling themselves all day long. They had to be reminded that they had some bad in them&mdash;instinctive idolatries and silent treasons which they always tried to forget. It is in connection with these crimes of wealth and culture <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>face</b> the real problem of positive evil. The whole of Mr. Blatchford's controversy about sin was vitiated throughout by one's consciousness that whenever he wrote the word [...] "sinner" [...] he thought of a man in rags. But here, again, we can find truth merely by referring to vulgar literature&mdash;its unfailing fountain. Whoever read a detective story about poor people? The poor have crimes; but the poor have no secrets. And it is because the proud have secrets {{that they need to be}} detected before they are forgiven.|$|E

30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. Section 2 discusses the most relevant trade-offs <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> in designing the WING/WORLD toolkit. Section 3 describes the system's concept and architecture. Additional technical details on the features currently supported by the toolkit are given in Section 4, while a comparison with other academic testbeds and prototypes is provided in Section 5. Use cases are presented and discussed in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 draws the conclusions pointing out current and future research directions.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present ESIDE, an {{integrated}} development environment for component-based embedded systems. It leverages component-based software engineering principles to facilitate efficient, scalable, and robust hardware/software co-design, co-simulation, co-verification, and their seamless integration. We first describe the architecture and features of ESIDE. We then discuss several design decisions <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> in developing ESIDE and the trade-offs in making these decisions. To provide perspective, we report our experiences in re-engineering TinyOSbased networked sensor systems into complete componentbased designs that cover both hardware and software. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{empirical}} {{software engineering}} studies use students as subjects and are conducted {{as part of}} university courses. Aim: We aim at reporting our experiences with using guidelines for integrating empirical studies with our research and teaching goals. Method: We document our experience from conducting three studies with graduate students in two software architecture courses. Results: Our results show some problems <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>faced</b> when following the guidelines and deviations we made from the original guidelines. Conclusions: Based on our results we propose recommendations for empirical software engineering studies that are integrated in university courses. ...|$|R
