5|$|Efforts {{to regain}} a public {{position}} in the Orange Free State failed, and in 1888 Spruyt once more returned to the South African Republic. He was allowed to work as law agent in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts,</b> and – being well-known and popular – set up a successful law practice. Until {{the end of his}} life he kept a healthy interest in the affairs of the state, especially in land cases.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rowan, who espoused the Relief position, {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1822 {{representing}} Jefferson and Oldham counties. He immediately became the leader of the Relief faction in the House. When Relief partisans decided to appeal Williams and Lapsley to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was at the time the court of last resort in the state, Rowan was chosen to argue the appeal before the court alongside George M. Bibb and Lieutenant Governor William T. Barry. Their efforts failed, however, as the Court found the measure unconstitutional, upholding the decisions of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after he}} signed the contract, several other {{shiploads}} of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of rice to plummet to three cents a pound. Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as {{to the quality of}} rice to expect. From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts,</b> the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858 was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding house.|$|E
50|$|On February 29, 2008, the Iraqi Court of Cassation (the appeals court) vacated Munaf's {{conviction}} and death sentence, remanding it to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> and ordering Munaf {{to remain in}} custody. The Court of Cassation found numerous irregularities in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> proceedings, including that <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> failed to ascertain the role of Munaf and other defendants in the kidnapping and failed to document the statements of the kidnap victims. The Court of Cassation vacated all decisions of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> and remanded <b>the</b> case to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> for retrial, directing that Munaf and the other defendants remain in custody.|$|R
50|$|In some systems, an {{appellate court}} will only {{consider}} the written decision of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court,</b> together with any written {{evidence that was}} before that court and is relevant to the appeal.

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{attorney}} general, White {{was in charge of}} several important lawsuits, among the most prominent being the state's pursuit of tax liabilities from railroad companies. Prior to his election as attorney general, railroads had never paid taxes in the state of West Virginia. White instituted proceedings to tax all the railroads within the state. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company obtained an injunction against the levying of the taxes, leading to a judicial test case. White argued the case first in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts,</b> and then before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, which ruled in White's favor. The Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the ruling of the state supreme court, which compelled the railroads to pay taxes to the state.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 state {{constitutional}} amendments reorganized the Court. The constitution renamed the Appellate Court the Indiana Court of Appeals. With {{the formation of}} the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b> Constitutional amendments also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits {{on the size of the}} Court to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine. The method of selecting justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor. The amendment also provided for a Judicial Nominating Commission to choose candidates. Justices also became subject to a retention election. In addition, the office of chief justice became permanent. Previously the title rotated among the justices. In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration, legalizing and expanding the role of the clerks of the Court.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Franklin {{participated in}} an {{organized}} campaign to win the right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the freedom of conscience provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was {{to be part of}} an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts</b> had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating the Income Tax Act. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Supreme Court opinions for the American polity, scholars have dedicated little systematic research to investigating the {{factors that contribute to}} the content of the Court’s opinions. In this paper, we examine <b>the</b> ability of <b>lower</b> federal <b>courts</b> to shape the content of Supreme Court opinions. We argue that <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinions will influence the content of the Court’s opinions based on a number of factors, including the prestige of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinion author, <b>the</b> published or unpublished nature of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinion, <b>the</b> ideological compatibility of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinion vis-à-vis <b>the</b> Supreme Court’s decision, <b>the</b> type of <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> opinion, and <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> from which <b>the</b> opinion emanated. Utilizing plagiarism detection software to compare <b>lower</b> federal <b>court</b> opinions with the majority opinions of the Supreme Court during the 2002 - 2004 terms, we uncover support for our hypotheses, indicating that the Supreme Court systematically incorporates language from <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> federal <b>courts</b> into its majority opinions...|$|R

5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court of Indiana has {{original}} and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas, including {{the practice of}} law, discipline or disbarment of judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the state. When the Court accepts a case, it reviews the documentation of the trials in the lower court and sometimes allows oral arguments before making a decision. In some cases the justices will issue a decision without hearing arguments from either side and will base their decision solely on evidence submitted in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b> The Court can order a new trial {{to take place in}} the local court, overturn the decision of lower courts and enforce its own decision, or uphold the decision of lower courts.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts.</b> He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E
50|$|Confession {{of error}} {{is a legal}} {{practice}} whereby the United States Solicitor General {{in his or her}} role representing the federal government before the Supreme Court of the United States admits a <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> incorrectly decided a case and it is thereby sent back for reconsideration. By confessing error, the Solicitor General declares that the federal government's position, which prevailed in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court,</b> was wrong. <b>The</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> then vacates <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court's</b> judgment and remands the case to allow <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>court</b> to consider it in light of the confession of error.|$|R

5|$|According to the prosecution's theory, {{the assassin}} shot Goebel from the {{secretary}} of state's office {{on the first floor}} of a building next to the state capitol. However, much of the testimony against the accused men was conflicting, and some of it was later proven to be perjured. Most of the state's judges were Democratic supporters of Goebel and juries were packed with partisan Democrats. The appellate courts, however, were largely Republican, and the convictions returned by <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>courts</b> were often overturned, with the cases being remanded for new trials. Howard was tried and convicted in September 1900, January 1902, and April 1903; his final appeal failed, and he was sentenced to life in prison. Powers was also convicted three times—in July 1900, October 1901, and August 1903; a fourth trial in November 1907 ended in a hung jury. In 1908, Powers and Howard were pardoned by Republican governor Augustus E. Willson. Months later, Willson also issued pardons for former governor Taylor and several others still under indictment. Despite the pardon, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky; he became an insurance executive in Indiana and died there in 1928. Youtsey, the only defendant not to appeal his sentence, was paroled in 1916 and pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E
