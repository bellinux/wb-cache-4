5|$|In 1937, Parkinson {{was made}} {{commander}} of the Royal New Zealand Artillery, having been made a temporary lieutenant colonel. He was demoted to major the following year; this reduction in rank was {{as a result of}} disciplinary action after using the workshop facilities at Trentham Military Camp for personal work. In 1939, he was returned to his temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. A lot of his work as {{commander of the}} artillery involved the implementing programs for the upskilling of gunners and non-commissioned officers to perform leadership roles normally <b>the</b> <b>preserve</b> of officers.

5|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{traditional}} sports {{not solely}} <b>the</b> <b>preserve</b> of the samurai class, being popular among peasants and sake brewers. Both professions valued the manual labor of young people, and similar practices called kyokumochi also existed, which involved lifting sacks of rice or barrels of sake. The sporting aspect of stone-lifting developed in Edo around the seventeenth century, likely evolving from the sack-lifting contests of the stevedores and labourers. Historically, the lifting of strength-stones was exclusively practiced by men.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Maya merchants, {{although}} they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress. From this, {{it is known that}} at least some traders were members of the elite. During the Contact period, it is known that Maya nobility took part in long distance trading expeditions. The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious long distance trading that was <b>the</b> <b>preserve</b> of the elite. The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the underworld; the patron deities of merchants were two underworld gods carrying backpacks. When merchants travelled, they painted themselves black, like their patron gods, and went heavily armed.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by mail order {{in kit form}} or pre-assembled. In {{what was then a}} major innovation, it was the first cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than <b>the</b> <b>preserve</b> of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on {{to play a major role}} in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E

5|$|In 1889, Emma Cons, a Victorian philanthropist {{who ran the}} Old Vic theatre in {{a working-class}} area of London, began {{presenting}} regular fortnightly performances of opera excerpts. Although the theatre licensing laws of the day prevented full costumed performances, Cons presented condensed versions of well-known operas, always sung in English. Among the performers were noted singers such as Charles Santley. These operatic evenings quickly became more popular than the dramas that Cons had been staging separately. In 1898, she recruited her niece Lilian Baylis to help run the theatre. At {{the same time she}} appointed Charles Corri as the Old Vic's musical director. Baylis and Corri, despite many disagreements, shared a passionate belief in popularising opera, hitherto generally <b>the</b> <b>preserve</b> of the rich and fashionable. They worked on a tiny budget, with an amateur chorus and a professional orchestra of only 18 players, for whom Corri rescored the instrumental parts of the operas. By {{the early years of the}} 20th century, the Old Vic was able to present semi-staged versions of Wagner operas.|$|E

Many people traveling to <b>the</b> <b>preserve</b> will witness local bird species such as the red-tailed hawks(Buteo jamaicensis), swainson's hawks(Buteo swainsoni), Nuttall's woodpeckers(Picoides nuttallii). Many migratory bird species including the greater and lesser sandhill cranes(Grus canadensis), tundra swan(Cygnus columbianus), and various species of ducks also call <b>the</b> <b>preserve</b> home.
