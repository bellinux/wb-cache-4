5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and {{believed}} he was dying. Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed a conversion experience was necessary for salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal salvation. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>elders</b> <b>of</b> his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E

In mid-May, the government sent orders to release the six remaining Jewish prisoners. On May 21, they were ceremoniously called before the court (shura) and freed under the guarantees of <b>the</b> <b>elders</b> <b>of</b> the Jewish community.|$|E

5|$|The Protocols of <b>the</b> <b>Elders</b> <b>of</b> Zion is {{a notorious}} antisemitic {{literary}} forgery, probably written {{under the direction}} of the Russian secret police in Paris, that purported to reveal a conspiracy by the Jewish people to achieve global domination. It was exposed as a work of fiction in 1920 by Lucien Wolf and the following year by Philip Graves in The Times. Once exposed, it disappeared from mainstream discourse, Barkun writes, until interest in it was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s. Its use was spread further by conspiracy groups on the internet.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{administration}} of justice at village level was the responsibility of village assemblies, which usually consisted of <b>the</b> <b>elders</b> <b>of</b> the village. However, {{towards the end of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom a group of ten villages, known as dasagam, was responsible for upholding justice in that area. The laws and legal measures to be followed by them were proclaimed by the king. Several rock inscriptions that record these proclamations have been found in archaeological excavations. Punishments differed from ruler to ruler. Some kings, such as Sanghabodhi (247–249) and Voharika Tissa (209–231) were lenient in this aspect, while rulers like Ilanaga (33–43) and Jetthatissa I (263–273) were harsher. However, crimes such as treason, murder and slaughter of cattle were generally punishable by death.|$|E

5|$|Seeds of Evil {{begins with}} the new Turok, Joshua Fireseed, {{appearing}} through a portal to face a female alien named Adon. She explains he has been called by <b>the</b> <b>Elders</b> <b>of</b> the Lost Land, the Lazarus Concordance, to defeat the Primagen, a powerful alien entity that was imprisoned in the wreckage of his own Lightship after attempting to witness {{the creation of the}} universe. This incident {{led to the creation of}} the Lost Land, a bizarre and barbarian world where time has no meaning. Awakened by the events of Dinosaur Hunter, the Primagen mobilizes several races of primitive creatures from the Lost Land to destroy five Energy Totems, powerful devices that bound the Primagen to his Lightship. The destruction of these Energy Totems would allow the Primagen to escape the confines of his Lightship, and the resulting shockwave would destroy the known universe.|$|E
5|$|The Protocols of <b>the</b> <b>Elders</b> <b>of</b> Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats who support monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E
5|$|By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade {{is at an}} end, and the {{following}} 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be <b>the</b> <b>elders</b> <b>of</b> Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of a pose associated with the thallophoroi (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen in competition for their good looks alone. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107–114, N20–28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16–19 and S115–118 (conjectured) perhaps, as hydriaphoroi, the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned {{in the literature on}} the Panathenaia. N13–15, S119–121 are the skaphephoroi, the tray bearers of the honeycombs and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1–12, S122–149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion – there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.|$|E
