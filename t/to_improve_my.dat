After making his debut for York in February 2007, Dave Flett of The Press said Brodie [...] "looks a potent package of pace and power with a competitive streak that should strike fear into countless Conference defenders". Foyle's guidance while manager at York was credited as benefiting Brodie. He stated [...] "I've worked hard trying <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>my</b> game and I'm starting to score different types of goals" [...] in December 2009. He {{was described}} by the Huddersfield Daily Examiner as [...] "one of non-league football's hottest properties" [...] in January 2010.

500|$|After redshirting his {{freshman}} year in 1980–81 {{because he could not}} yet get clearance from the NCAA to play, Olajuwon played sparingly as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, and the Cougars were eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, North Carolina Tar Heels. Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to work out with local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every off season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: [...] "The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>my</b> game against the best." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{these early}} years, Mayall was finding {{it hard to}} make his way as a daguerreotypist in London. Mayall commented that at this point in his career [...] "I was a {{struggling}} artist, much devoted <b>to</b> <b>improving</b> <b>my</b> art." [...] In correspondence with George Walter Thornbury, Turner's biographer, Mayall recalled that the old artist offered encouragement when he was losing heart: [...] "When somewhat desponding on my success one day, I told him London was too large for a man with slender means to get along. He sharply turned round and said, [...] "No, no; you are sure to succeed; only wait. You are a young man yet." ...|$|R

My goal was to design 7 - 10 compositions and apply them to t-shirts and then create a photo arrangement with these t-shirts to make a strong artistic presentation. I chose to apply my images to t-shirts, because I feel that the tshirt is a perfect median to display pieces of art. My process has been very non-linear in nature. Trial and error,experimentation and my gut feeling have strongly influenced the progression of my design process and guided me to new ideas.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a {{collaborative}} action research case study with Grade 8 learners in a rural high school in Fort Beaufort District, Eastern Cape, South Africa. The goals of the case study were firstly, to understand best practices for promoting extensive reading using a classroom library, and secondly, to use these insights to put an extensive reading programme in place with a view <b>to</b> <b>improving</b> <b>my</b> practice as a language teacher and to gain better understanding of ways of enhancing my Grade 8 learners’ literacy skills. The following qualitative methods were used to collect data: observation, semi-structured interviews, class discussion, questionnaires, journal reflections and document analysis. Analysis of data involved identification of emerging themes and patterns. The {{findings suggest that the}} strategies used in the extensive reading intervention <b>improved</b> <b>my</b> learners’ levels of engagement with reading. Putting these strategies into practice, and reflecting critically on how to refine them helped enrich my own professional insight and development in relation to the implementation of extensive reading programmes. Since action research is usually designed in spirals of action, this research serves as a first spiral and a foundation upon which to build second and subsequent spirals (which do not form part of this research). The study highlighted the fact that certain challenges that emerged (for example, shortage of books at the learners’ level, and a lack of parental cooperation) need to be addressed in a second spiral of intervention. The study further suggested that the implementation of effective extensive reading programmes by teachers in the middle and upper phases of secondary schooling requires further investigation...|$|R
