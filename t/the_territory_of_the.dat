5|$|For {{at least}} 10,000years, {{a variety of}} {{indigenous}} peoples populated the Willamette Valley. These included the Kalapuya, the Chinook, and the Clackamas. <b>The</b> <b>territory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Clackamas encompassed the northeastern portion of the basin, including the Clackamas River (with which their name is shared). Although it is unclear exactly when, <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinook once extended across {{the northern part of}} the watershed, through the Columbia River valley. Indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley were further divided into groups including the Kalapuyan-speaking Yamhill and Atfalati (Tualatin) (both Northern Kalapuya), Central Kalapuya like the Santiam, Muddy Creek (Chemapho), Long Tom (Chelamela), Calapooia (Tsankupi), Marys River (Chepenafa) and Luckiamute, and the Yoncalla or Southern Kalapuya, as well other tribes such as the Chuchsney-Tufti, Siuslaw and Molala. The name Willamette is of indigenous origin, deriving from the French pronunciation of the name of a Clackamas Native American village. However, Native American languages in Oregon were very similar, so the name may also be derived from Kalapuya dialects.|$|E
