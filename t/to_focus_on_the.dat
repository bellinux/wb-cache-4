5|$|David Kinsley, {{an expert}} on Hindu goddesses and former Professor of Religion at McMaster University, agrees with the Buddhist origin theory, but sees other influences, too. Ancient Hindu goddesses, who are {{depicted}} nude and headless or faceless, may have also influenced the development of Chhinnamasta. These goddesses are mainly depicted headless <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> display of their sexual organs, thus signifying sexual vigour, {{but they do not}} explain the self-decapitation theme.|$|E

5|$|In Giants: Citizen Kabuto, players take on {{the roles}} of three {{humanoid}} races: gun-toting Meccaryns, magic-wielding Sea Reapers, and the gigantic Kabuto. Each player is assigned direct control of a single character. The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this design to encourage players <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> action {{and not to be}} burdened with micromanagement. Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.|$|E

5|$|Nadar (1820–1910), {{the son of}} a publisher, had {{previously}} had medical training in Lyon and at Hôtel-Dieu.

Criticisms tended <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game being too short, as well as lacking a multiplayer feature.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to use English-speaking actors was made early.

5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend <b>to</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E

Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
