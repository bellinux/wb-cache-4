She said she’d never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> about birthing practices until her sister introduced her to MHI executive director Rachel Zaslow. Nyong'o felt bringing attention to such important but overlooked issues is a mandate for her as an artist. She was honored for her work at 2016 Variety's Power of Women.|$|E
25|$|In July 1945, as Soviet police ranks were {{converted}} to a military uniform system, Beria's rank was officially converted to that of Marshal of the Soviet Union. Although he had never held a traditional military command, Beria made {{a significant contribution to}} the victory of the Soviet Union in World War II through his organization of wartime production and his use of partisans. Stalin personally never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> of it, and neither commented publicly on his performance nor awarded him recognition (i.e. Order of Victory) as he did for most other Soviet Marshals.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I <b>thought</b> <b>much,</b> and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

So, by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his <b>thoughts</b> <b>much</b> higher, and draw comfort down.|$|R

In one noted example, Paul Mays, a retired engineer who never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> of Reagan's politics, witnessed the motorcade leave the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base; he commented [...] "This is history". Frank Dubois, an American University professor, also {{was there for the}} motorcade, though of the laudatory praise he remarked, [...] " [...] hurt the environment; there was double-digit inflation.

500|$|Less {{than a month}} later, von Neumann, who {{had participated}} at the Congress, communicated to Gödel an {{interesting}} consequence of his theorem: that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency. However, Gödel had already discovered this consequence, now known as his second incompleteness theorem, and he sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems. Von Neumann acknowledged Gödel's priority in his next letter. He never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> of [...] "the American system of claiming personal priority for everything." ...|$|E

In his tribute to Scott {{in the preface to}} Scott's Last Expedition (1913), Markham describes Scott as [...] "among the most remarkable men of our time", and talks of the [...] "beauty" [...] of his character. As Scott lay dying [...] "there was no thought for himself, only the earnest thought to give comfort and consolation to others." [...] In one of the last letters written from his final camp, days from death, Scott wrote: [...] "Tell Sir ClementsI <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> of him, and never regretted his putting me in command of the 'Discovery'." ...|$|E
500|$|Cunningham sees A Handful of Dust as a {{forerunner of}} Waugh's later, avowedly Catholic novels. In keeping with Waugh's dismissive {{attitude}} to the Church of England, Anglicanism is shown as a farce (Mr Tendril the vicar's sermons), or a nullity (Tony's admission {{that he had}} never really <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> about God). Instead, Christianity is evoked by presenting the awfulness of life without it; according to the writer and critic Frank Kermode, [...] "he callousness of incident and the coldness of tone work by suggesting the positive and rational declaration of the Faith". The reader, Stannard says, [...] "is never allowed to forget man's primal bestiality... God is the key that has been thrown away in this purely secular world". John Raymond in the New Statesman refers to Waugh's [...] "unique type of moral vision", and calls the novel a [...] "powerful twentieth century sermon on the breakdown of a Christian marriage".|$|E

500|$|According to series {{artist and}} {{producer}} Keiji Inafune, Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge {{was the first}} Mega Man game to be outsourced by Capcom for its development. He felt the game turned out well because the project's leader was a [...] "huge Mega Man fan" [...] who appeared to understand the games better than some of Capcom's own people. Because he <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> of his artwork from the original Mega Man was not aging well, Inafune redrew many of his old illustrations {{to be used for}} the game's enemy character sprites. Beginning with Mega Man 2 for the NES, Capcom began accepting boss ideas from fans. It was not until Dr. Wily's Revenge that Inafune was able to design a boss character from scratch. To keep with the musical motif of naming characters, the new character Enker was named after the Japanese genre enka.|$|E
500|$|Attracted by its dress, secrecy, and ritual, Wilde {{petitioned the}} Apollo Masonic Lodge at Oxford, {{and was soon}} raised to the [...] "Sublime Degree of Master Mason". During a resurgent {{interest}} in Freemasonry in his third year, he commented he [...] "would be awfully sorry {{to give it up}} if I secede from the Protestant Heresy". Wilde's active involvement in Freemasonry lasted only for the time he spent at Oxford and his membership of the Apollo University Lodge lapsed after non-payment of subscriptions. He was deeply considering converting to Catholicism, discussing the possibility with clergy several times. In 1877, Wilde was left speechless after an audience with Pope PiusIX in Rome. He eagerly read Cardinal Newman's books, and became more serious in 1878, when he met the Reverend Sebastian Bowden, a priest in the Brompton Oratory who had received some high-profile converts. Neither his father, who threatened to cut off his funds, nor Mahaffy <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> of the plan; but mostly Wilde, the supreme individualist, balked at the last minute from pledging himself to any formal creed. On the appointed day of his baptism, Father Bowden received a bunch of altar lilies instead. Wilde retained a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy.|$|E

2500|$|In {{seeking to}} explain his observations, by early 1837 Darwin was speculating in his {{notebooks}} on transmutation of species and writing of [...] "my theory". His journal for 1838 records [...] "All September read a good deal on many subject: <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> upon religion. Beginning of October ditto." [...] At this time he outlined ideas of comparative anthropology, from his knowledge of different religious beliefs {{around the world as}} well as at various times in history, and came to the view that scriptures were unreliable and contradictory.|$|E

[...] Whatever sympathy Van Buren or Congress might have had for Mormon victims was canceled out by the importance of Missouri in the upcoming presidential election. Nevertheless, Smith shrewdly made Missouri a [...] "byword for oppression" [...] and [...] "saw to it that the sufferings of his people received national publicity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foote labored to {{maintain}} his objectivity in the narrative despite his Southern upbringing. He did not deliberately avoid Lost Cause mythologizing in his work. He developed new respect for such disparate figures as Ulysses Grant, William T. Sherman, Patrick Cleburne, Edwin Stanton and Jefferson Davis. By contrast, he grew to dislike such figures as Phil Sheridan and Joe Johnston. He considered United States President Abraham Lincoln and Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest to be two authentic geniuses of the war. When he stated this opinion in conversation with one of General Forrest's granddaughters, she replied after a pause, [...] "You know, we never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> of Mr. Lincoln in my family." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1903 the Collection of Poems. 1889–1903, Gippius's {{first book}} of poetry, came out; Innokenty Annensky later called {{the book the}} [...] "quintessence of fifteen years of Russian modernism." [...] Valery Bryusov was greatly {{impressed}} too, praising the [...] "insurmountable frankness with which she document the emotional progress of her enslaved soul." [...] Gippius herself never <b>thought</b> <b>much</b> of the social significance of her published poetry. In a foreword to her debut collection she wrote: [...] "It is sad to realize that one had to produce something as useless and meaningless as this book. Not that I think poetry to be useless; on the contrary, I am convinced that it is essential, natural and timeless. There were times when poetry was read everywhere and appreciated by everybody.
