5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury.

The semi-octagonal projections on either side of the gate passage are considered ornamental. Between <b>the</b> <b>projections</b> and above the gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E
5|$|The {{capsizing}} of {{the battleship}} Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad {{until the end}} of the year. The hull had to be patched, the water pumped out and all <b>the</b> <b>projections</b> removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom and pull it free. These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from the converted Sverdlov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about other tests, although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions. By the early 1960s her usefulness had come to an end and she was scrapped, possibly in 1962.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>projection</b> {{method is}} a simple way of {{constructing}} functions and filters by integrating multidimensional functions and filters along parallel superplanes in the space domain. Equivalently expressed in the frequency domain, <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> method constructs a new function by simply taking a cross-section of the Fourier transform of a multidimensional function. <b>The</b> <b>projection</b> method is linked to several areas such as box splines in approximation theory and the projection-slice theorem in image processing. In this paper, we shall systematically study and discuss <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> method in <b>the</b> area of multidimensional framelet and wavelet analysis. We shall see that <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> method not only provides a painless way for constructing new wavelets and framelets but also is a useful analysis tool for studying various optimal properties of multidimensional refinable functions and filters. Using <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> method, we shall explicitly and easily construct a tight framelet filter bank from every box spline filter having at least order one sum rule. As we shall see in this paper, <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> method is particularly suitable {{to be applied to}} frequency-based nonhomogeneous framelets and wavelets in any dimensions, and the periodization technique is a special case of <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> method for obtaining periodic wavelets and framelets from wavelets and framelets on Euclidean spaces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> {{methods for}} describing and testing {{the differences between}} pairs of continuous distributions. These methods include <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> plot, <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> spline, and <b>the</b> iter- 1 test. <b>The</b> <b>projection</b> plot displays <b>the</b> difference between corresponding quantiles against {{the average of the}} corresponding quantiles. It is analogous to an empirical quantile-quantile plot that has been rotated 45 degrees. <b>The</b> <b>projection</b> spline is a knotted linear spline iteratively fit to <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> plot so that all knots are associated with significant changes in slope. It summarizes nonrandom deviations from linearity on <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> plot, allowing classification of the highest level of difference between two distributions as a difference in shape, in spread, or in location. The iter- 1 test compares the first iteration of <b>the</b> <b>projection</b> spline with <b>the</b> line y = 0, providing a global test of difference between two distributions that is more powerful in simulations than either the chi-square test of independence or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These methods will enhance epidemiologic practice by making the comparison of full distributions an accessible tool for routine data analysis.
