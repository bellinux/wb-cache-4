The process is simply feeding a bundle of {{continuous}} filament yarns into a small jet nozzle with various amounts of slack (overfeed). High pressure air ( [...] > 100 PSI [...] ) creates a suction and a turbulent airstream which tangles any slack into a yarn with a similar hand as a spun yarn. It is the turbulent airflow that tangles the fibers. This method of yarn productions creates a yarn that is normally more even than a spun yarn and does not pill like a spun yarn.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} of this research work {{was to investigate the}} use of steam as a substitute fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing. The new substitute product holds the potential for competitive advantage, lower manufacturing costs and streamlined manufacturing capabilities. Generally high-pressure steam is known to be cheaper to produce than compressed air. An existing air-jet texturing machine was modified to supply either air or steam to the texturing nozzle. Using an identical nozzle, both air-jet and steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> were manufactured. The influence of effect-yarn parameters on the steam-jet texturing performance has been studied. Furthermore, steam-jet texturing was compared with air-jet texturing in terms of the processing parameters and the textured yarn properties. The results show that spun-like textured yarn manufactured using steam has lower loop instability, lower loop density and higher tensile properties than air at comparable fluid pressures. SEM image analysis shows that the entangled structure of the steam-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> is comparable to the air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns.</b> To verify the commercial feasibility of the new product, sewing threads were manufactured using both steam-jet and air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> and tested for sewability under commercial specifications. Sewability results indicated that the steam-jet textured sewing threads can withstand sewing at high-speeds like air-jet textured threads and are therefore suitable for manufacture of sewing threads. Therefore, it can be concluded that steam can be used as an alternative fluid for air in making spun-like <b>textured</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|E

30|$|Since air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> {{has already}} been {{established}} within the industry, {{it is vital to}} improve the yarn quality while reducing the production cost. Since the production costs have already been reduced significantly by minimising compressed air consumption and using POY etc., attention is now needed at saving costs elsewhere. One option would be to find a cheaper substitute fluid for air as a texturing medium. There is no literature regarding this so far. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop the use of high-pressure steam, as a substitute fluid for compressed air to produce spun-like <b>textured</b> <b>yarn.</b> The new product holds the potential for competitive advantage, lower manufacturing costs and streamlined manufacturing capabilities. The idea is to take the technology of air-jet texturing and to modify the process so that high-pressure steam can be used as the texturing medium. Furthermore, study of the effect of effect-yarn draw ratio and overfeed percentage is critical for the textile application perspectives since surface characteristic of the core-effect spun like <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> is mainly determined by the effect-yarn overfeed.|$|R

The most important parameters, significantly affecting yarn temperature and its uniformity and thus <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> structure and crimp properties, are texturing speed and heater temperature. Depending on these texturing parameters, the degree of crystallinity and orientation varied in the range of 24. 48 to 36. 66 % and 0. 371 to 0. 595, respectively. The crimp characteristics increase with the increase in heater temperature, and decrease with the increase in texturing speed. The effect of draw ratio and D/Y ratio on the <b>textured</b> <b>yarn</b> structure and properties is less pronounced. Obtained results show that partially oriented polyester yarn used in this study can be textured at significantly higher texturing speed (up to 1100 m/min) than the standard texturing speed (up to 700 m/min) used for the yarn count examined.

30|$|Generally {{high-pressure}} steam {{is known to}} be cheaper to produce than compressed air. This factor is critical when it is considered that the largest obstacle {{to the development of a}} successful performance air-jet textured yarn has been the energy cost involved in generating compressed air. Although the reduced cost of a pressurised fluid was of great interest on its own, high pressure steam has extra useful properties such as the in-built high energy content which could theoretically be used to thermally set the thread, thus obviating the need for separate electric heaters to achieve stabilisation. This could reduce further the energy requirement of the process and simplify the production machine design thus driving down cost further.

These parameters were evaluated by digital image processing techniques. To find trends between production criteria and evaluated parameters of cross section, three criteria of production line have been adjusted and different types of yarns were produced. These criteria are temperature, drafting ratio, and D/Y ratio. Finally the relations between production criteria and cross section parameters were considered. The results showed that the presented technique can recognize and measure the parameters of fiber cross section in acceptable accuracy.

40|$|POY yarns {{are well}} know and commercialized since 1970 s. On the other hand, air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> are very common {{due to their}} unique {{structure}} which looks like natural spun-staple yarns. In the air-jet texturing process, the yarn is textured by overfeeding into a high-pressure of air to create a looped and more natural yarn appearance and also the bulkiness level of the yarn is controlled by input speed and jet-take out speed. This process reassigns flat, continous synthetic yarns into entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun like structured yarns. They are of higher bulk, exhibits increased covering power, have a more subdued lustre and are warmer in hand. Therefore, air-jet <b>textured</b> <b>yarns</b> possess some unique properties that require investigation. Hence, in this study, first the texturing process is introduced briefly and its principle of manufacturing is illustrated, later four different types of yarns were produced with two different fibre cross-sections at the three different nozzle types and three different core yarn feeding. The produced yarn production details are given and their breaking strength, elongation and work of rupture are studied along with their morphological structures by using light microscope and SEM. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of POY fibre cross-section on air-jet textured yarn mechanical properties.

An experimental investigation of the air-jet texturing process using residual spin finish, yarn-to-yarn static and kinetic friction, filament strength, filament diameter, and on-line tension measurements and high-speed cine-photography is reported. Filament yarn motion in {{different regions of the}} texturing nozzle during dry and wet texturing is analysed. It is found that water acts as lubricant to reduce friction between the filaments in the wet texturing process as the filament yarn travels through the nozzle enabling easier relative motion of the filaments resulting in enhanced entanglement.
