30|$|The risers are {{generally}} connected {{at right angles}} to the manifold, thus forming a tee joint at each connection which leads to local disturbances. A varying local pressure drop for a flow through such a manifold results in an uneven flow distribution through the whole collector. Wang and Yu[5] developed a numerical model to calculate the isothermal flow distribution using mass and momentum equations at each branch of the header system. Wang and Wu[6] proposed a discrete numerical model and demonstrated the flow and temperature distribution in a flat-plate solar collector for U- and Z-configurations by taking into account the effects of buoyancy and longitudinal heat conduction. Jones and Lior[7] developed a discrete hydrodynamic model, and the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations were solved numerically. For negligible buoyancy effects, they investigated the effects of geometrical parameters of the collector such as the ratio of riser to manifold diameter, number of risers, and length of risers on the flow nonuniformity. Fan et al.[4] carried out CFD calculations to estimate the flow and temperature distribution in a flat-plate solar collector consisting of 16 risers connected in U-configuration, having a tilt of 40 °. The influences of flow rate, fluid properties, <b>collector</b> <b>tilt,</b> and <b>collector</b> inlet fluid temperature were investigated. Later, for the same collector, Fan and Furbo[8] studied the buoyancy effects on fluid and temperature distribution by means of CFD calculations. They found that at a certain low flow rate, buoyancy effects are of the same order as the pressure drop in the risers or even larger, which results in a more nonuniform flow distribution. The pattern of flow distribution reverses as compared to the case of high flow rate (25 l/min) with negligible buoyancy effects. Glembin et al.[2] experimentally investigated the flow distribution in a horizontally placed coaxial vacuum tube solar collector consisting of 60 parallel vacuum tubes connected in U-configuration. They adopted a procedure where flow distribution was calculated from the measured tube outlet temperatures for a range of inlet temperatures and mass flow rates.|$|R

An analytical model is developed for study {{of the effect of}} an individual reflector on the collector. Reflectors R-l, R- 2, R- 3, and R- 4 face south, north, west, and east, respectively. For a collector with two reflectors R- 1 and R- 2 on the southern and northern sides, up to 44 % enhancement is achieved in the solar gain for December (winter) and up to 14 % for May (summer). However, due to shadow-ing, two additional reflectors R- 3 and R- 4 on the eastern and western sides cause negligible additional solar gain. Without shadowing, enhancement i solar gain due to reflectors R- 3 and R- 4 is 14 - 36 % for May and 44 - 56 % for December for the Delhi climate.

However, the lack of reliable performance predictability methods for light pipes represents a major obstacle preventing their widespread use. This paper evaluates a simulation approach for performance prediction and identifies key light pipe design parameters affecting their daylight transmission performance. The study was carried out through continuous monitoring of daylight in two full-scale, identical pig stables fitted with two light pipe systems, Solatube® and Velux®. The experiment included three continuously measuring sensors in each stable and an outdoor sensor during 2013 and 2014. A forward raytracing tool, TracePro®, was used for illuminance prediction and parametric simulations. The simulation results for overcast skies indicated discrepancies between the simulated and average measurement results below 30 % in all cases. The discrepancies for clear skies were somewhat higher, i. e., below 30 % for 67 % of the cases. The higher discrepancies with clear skies were due to the overestimation of absolute sunlight levels and absence of an advanced and detailed optical characterization of the dome collector’s surface. The parametric results have shown that light pipes’ performance is better during summer time, in sunny climates, at low to mid-latitudes, which provides higher solar altitudes than during winter and cloudy climates at high latitudes.

Five years meteorological data are obtained from Baghdad Weather Bureau and the study is based on the averaged data for these five years. The total energy available is collected by a three covers flat plate collector with selective coating applied to the absorber plate surface. The parameters influencing the best year round thermal performance of the solar collector are investigated. These parameters are mainly, the <b>collector</b> <b>tilt</b> and the heat transfer media temperatures. The optimum <b>tilt</b> of the <b>collector</b> for summer operation of an air conditioning system is 200 from the horizontal facing the equator, 300 for year round performance of refrigeration system, the case under consideration, and 500 for winter operation where only heating is needed. The instantaneous efficiency of the collector varies during the day from a minimum of 0. 04 during the morning and afternoon to a maximum of 0. 55 between 9 a. m. - 4 p. m. Also the efficiency increases with a decrease in the temperature difference between the inlet fluid and the ambient air. The useful energy collected at the optimum tilt of 300 for year round performance and at different collection temperatures are then applied to an aqua ammonia absorption refrigeration system to produce a refrigeration effect. The thermal performance of the refrigeration system is investigated for different evaporator temperatures, condenser temperatures and pressures, solution concentrations and generator temperatures. The solar energy collected in excess of the immediate operating requirement is stored in liquid refrigerant for usage during the night and daytime periods of no or low solar radiation. Storage of liquid refrigerant with its potential for producing a refrigeration effect by evaporation was chosen instead of the alternative of storing energy from the flat plate collector directly. Thermal storage at medium temperatures is only practicable at present using liquid or solid storage media. The promise of using phasechange materials as a means of thermal energy storage has not yet proved practicable due to breakdown during recycling and supercooling problems. Liquid or solid storage give rise to problems because of the size of storage vessel needed and the attendant need to insulate such a vessel efficiently. These last factors have obvious implications in relation to initial capital cost.

The value of top heat loss factor (Ut) obtained from the numerical solutions of heat balance equations are compared to the values obtained by using the various correlations available in the literature. The percentage error in the {{calculation of}} top heat loss factor (and hence the useful energy) of a single glazed flat plate solar collector obtained by using different correlations of Ut as compared to the numerical solutions of heat balance equations are compared for the wide range of variables: 323 - 423 K in absorber plate temperature, 273 - 318 K for ambient temperature, 10 - 50 mm in air gap spacing, 5 - 45 W m- 2 K- 1 for wind heat transfer coefficient, 0 - 70 º <b>collector</b> <b>tilt</b> angle and absorber plate emittance 0. 1 - 0. 95. The study shows that the empirical relations of Ut predict the values close to numerical solutions only for certain assumed conditions and cause large errors in the calculation of top heat loss factor and useful energy for other range of variables...|$|R
40|$|Research {{concerning}} {{the field of}} Liquid Heating Collectors (SLHCs) cannot be directly transferred to the large area of applications for Solar Air Heating Collectors (SAHC). Larger cross sections for transporting the air are necessary. This results in rather complicated fluid distributions within the products. In this paper we combine simulation and experimental techniques providing {{a high level of}} detail. Highly resolved three dimensional fluid dynamic simulations contain all the relevant heat transfer mechanisms in a plate SAHC: Heat conduction, convection patterns and radiation are modelled in the two air gaps. In all solid materials of the collector only heat conduction has to be accounted for. For the exchange of heat between the two air zones the heat transfer through the absorber is modelled. Nevertheless careful simplification is needed to be able to concentrate on the important details. Furthermore we shed light on numerical instabilities observed in the air gap between absorber and glass in the simulated example. A consistent numerical description is given, concluding, that Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an appropriate tool for design and optimisation of SAHC concepts. The effects of <b>collector</b> <b>tilting,</b> insulation level and heat transfer surface increase have been assessed as a prove of applicability. The performance of these models will finally be compared to the experimental data obtained using a high-precision SAHC testing facility. For the experimental data base refined local measurement techniques, which meet highest accuracy requirements, are developed and employed...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{investigations}} are conducted using finite volume method {{to study the}} laminar heat transfer in a three-dimensional flat-plate solar collector. The continuity, momentum and energy equations are discretized and the SIMPLE algorithm scheme is applied to link the pressure and velocity fields inside the domain. Three nanofluid with different types of nanoparticles, Ag (silver), MWCNT (Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes) and Al 2 O 3 with 0. 5 - 2 wt% volume fraction and nanoparticle diameter of 20 - 50 nm in base fluid (water) were selected. A constant heat flux, equivalent to solar radiation absorbed by the collector, is applied at the top surface of the absorber plate. In this research, several parameters including boundary condition (different volume flow rate, fluid inlet temperature and solar irradiance on Skudai, Malaysia), types of fluids (base fluid with different type of nanoparticles), different volume fraction, different naoparticle diameter and different solar <b>collector</b> <b>tilt</b> angle are investigated to identify their effects on the heat transfer performance of FPSC. The numerical {{results indicate that the}} three types of nanofluid enhance the thermal performance of solar collector compared to pure water and FPSC with Ag nanofluid has the best thermal performance enhancement. Heat transfer performance of FPSC improves with the increase of nanoparticle volume fraction and decrease of nanoparticle diameter. For all the cases the collector efficiency increased with the increase of volume flow rate while fluid outlet temperature decreased. The results revealed that FPSC with tilt angle of 10 ° and fluid inlet temperature of 28 °C showed the best thermal performance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTranspired Solar Collectors (TSCs) are an {{increasingly}} popular technology, with over 12, 500 m 2 of TSCs integrated with buildings across Wales and England {{by the end}} of 2013. But in order for TSCs to achieve the desired low economic and embodied energy payback periods, their design, manufacture, installation and commissioning needs to be seamlessly integrated with that of the building as a whole. To facilitate the selection and integration of a TSC in the earliest stages of building design, a new feasibility tool for Transpired Solar Collectors has been developed. The new tool enables a full feasibility assessment to be carried out in less than five minutes, and its user-friendly methodology and interface allows it to be used by building designers who have little or no experience in designing solar thermal collectors. Comparative research presented in this paper demonstrates that the tool's feasibility engine provides similar energy performance results to the RETScreen® V 3. 1 Solar Air Heating Project Model. In addition, the new tool automatically calculates the building's heating demand and is able to consider the impact of internal gains (solar and occupancy), <b>collector</b> <b>tilt,</b> and low emissivity coatings. The new tool is not intended to replace the role of more sophisticated, dynamic modelling and simulation tools which the expert user and building energy assessor would be expected to use for the detailed design of a TSC. The new tool is currently being evaluated on commercial projects in the UK and is set to be available across Europe in early 2015...|$|R
