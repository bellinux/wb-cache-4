5|$|An inquest in April 2008 {{found that}} Jones had sped over a {{pedestrian}} crossing on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road, {{leading to a}} head-on collision. His death was recorded as an accident, but {{it was confirmed that}} had he survived, he would have been facing two charges of death by dangerous driving.|$|E
5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the castle, {{facing away from}} the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching {{down to the ground}} and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|Early Seventies Britain {{was a very}} {{depressing}} {{place with}} both the colour strike and the UK postal workers strike in full swing. It was completely run-down with trash on the streets, and total unemployment—just about everybody was on strike. Everybody was brought up with an education system that told you point blank that if you came from <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the tracks...then you had no hope in hell and no career prospects at all. Out of that came pretentious moi and the Sex Pistols and then {{a whole bunch of}} copycat wankers after us.|$|E
50|$|After {{months of}} {{speculation}} {{on the official}} Marillion website, the album was finally released on a 33⅓ rpm double-vinyl LP in November 2013. The track listing was {{identical to the original}} CD release, although some copies included a manufacturers mistake whereby the labels <b>of</b> <b>side</b> 3 & 4 were stamped on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual vinyl discs. In other words, side 3 was actually side 4 and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> movie <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road and soundtrack (1981) gave broad {{exposure}} to the bands Us Mob and No Fixed Address and highlighted Indigenous disadvantage in urban Australia.|$|R

5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E
5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{exploits}} {{in those}} years introduced him to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the justice system, which would become a recurring feature of his life. In one incident, {{he and his brother}} Heman went to the farm of a neighbor, some of whose pigs had escaped onto their land, and seized the pigs. The neighbor sued to have the animals returned to him; Allen pleaded his own case, and lost. Allen and Heman were fined ten shillings, and the neighbor was awarded another five shillings in damages. He was also called to court in Salisbury for inoculating himself against smallpox, a procedure that at the time required the sanction of the town selectmen.|$|E
5000|$|An earlier, stripped-down {{version of}} [...] "Is It True?" [...] {{featured}} as a B-side {{to the single}} [...] "Hips And Lips" [...] from The National Health. During the album campaign for Too Much Information, a double A-side single, [...] "Random Regrets / On The Sly", was released on 7-inch vinyl for Record Store Day 2014, consisting of two offcuts from the recording sessions for The National Health and Too Much Information respectively. An interesting feature of this release is that all copies pressed accidentally had the labels pressed onto <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record because of a factory error.|$|R
5000|$|... "We Have Survived" [...] {{is a song}} {{originally}} {{performed by}} No Fixed Address. It was composed by Bart Willoughby when he was 18. It first appear in <b>the</b> film <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road and on its soundtrack and was later included on No Fixed Address's album From My Eyes. It has since been included in The Black Arm Bands concert murundak.|$|R
50|$|The {{cab forward}} design was widely {{used by the}} Southern Pacific Railroad, which {{developed}} it {{to deal with the}} peculiar problems of its routes. The 39 long tunnels and nearly 40 mi of snow sheds of the Sierra Nevada Mountains could funnel dangerous exhaust fumes back into the crew compartment of a conventional locomotive. After a number of crews nearly asphyxiated, the locomotive was run in reverse. This meant that the tender was leading the train, which introduced new problems. The tender blocked the view ahead and put crewmen on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cab for seeing signals. The tenders were not designed to be pushed at the lead of the train, which limited speeds. Southern Pacific commissioned Baldwin Locomotive Works to build a prototype cab-forward locomotive, then ordered more units before the prototype had even arrived.|$|R
5|$|At Green Beach to the west, {{part of the}} South Saskatchewan Regiment was {{landed on}} <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Scie River, necessitating an assault over the machine gun swept bridge there so they could assault the cliffs on the west. The village of Pourville was {{captured}} but the eastern cliffs proved impossible to capture so blocking their assault on an artillery battery and a radar station. The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders were landed {{with the objective of}} moving south to attack an airfield and a divisional HQ. Neither battalion was able to achieve their objectives. As with the other three beaches, casualties among the Canadians were high with 160 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's three-year {{exploration}} of the northern coast of Canada {{in search of the}} Northwest Passage had ended in disaster amid accusations of murder and cannibalism, with 11 of the 20members of the group killed and the survivors reduced to eating lichen, their own boots, and the remains of rotten carcasses abandoned by wolves. The party had become stranded on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm; John Richardson had attempted to swim to safety and suffered severe hypothermia. A single member of the party had fashioned a small canoe from canvas and willow, and the survivors had been obliged to cross the river one at a time using the makeshift canoe.|$|E
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, {{he felt he had}} to join a faction as a hired gun, although it put him on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E
50|$|The Luxury Flats {{rented a}} house in Hudson and lived {{together}} there. They made demos and eventually self released an album called <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cap Stand and went on some self booked tours across <b>the</b> USA. <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cap Stand was produced by Kenny Siegal at Old Soul Studios, engineered by Tom Shick at Old Soul, mixed by Bryce Goggin at Trout Recordings, and mastered by Fred Kevorkian at Avatar Studios. The album art work was done by Nicky Karas and Joe Terry.|$|R
50|$|Us Mob {{appeared}} in <b>the</b> film <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road with fellow CASM band No Fixed Address The {{recording of the}} soundtrack made the two bands the first contemporary aboriginal bands to be recorded. Along with No Fixed Address they were nominated for the 1981 AFI Award for Best Original Music for the music from the film. They relocated to Sydney and broke up after their equipment was destroyed by a fire. The band were {{the subject of an}} ABC Message Stick documentary in February 2000.|$|R
50|$|The army evacuates the residents, so {{that they}} can begin {{drilling}} through the concrete floor. A boy wanders into the room where the dynamite is placed for the explosion. The boy is discovered at the last moment and safely removed before the explosion. Ernst announces that another bomb has been discovered, as a diversion to allow them to enter the hole leading to the bunker. Searching the bunker, the group finds two steel chests containing the gold behind a partition. Sly breaks the locks with a hammer and a chisel as the group admires their loot. After the gold is retrieved, Kosnikov shows up alone to intercept the group, armed with a machine gun. He tries to blackmail them and take all of the gold. As Schmidt pleads for their lives, Harry pins Kosnikov with a ladder. Kosnikov then shoots and kills Schmidt, after which Sly kills Kosnikov with Schlager's pistol. When the team returns to West Germany, they are confronted by the checkpoint guard about their flags on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car's hood. The checkpoint guard puts the flags on correctly and allows them to leave. They throw Schmidt's body into a river.|$|R
5|$|On 23 November 2003, {{near his}} home in the Warwickshire village of Meriden, West Midlands, Hughes lost control of his Mercedes CL55 AMG and went onto <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road before colliding with a Renault Scénic. A {{passenger}} in the Renault, Douglas Graham, was killed in the incident, whilst his wife Maureen and the driver Albert Frisby were severely injured. Hughes and passenger Adrian Smith left the scene, before turning themselves in to the police 36 hours later. He was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He denied the charge, though later pleaded guilty to charges of failing to stop and failing to report an accident.|$|E
5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the flag, the racer will snowplow and slow down.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War necessitated a new aerodrome for the Royal Flying Corps. The Corps had received the Royal Warrant on 13 April 1912, whereupon Major Sefton Brancker of the War Office conducted aerial surveys in 1914 of Glebe Farm in Ickenham, and Hundred Acres Farm and Down Barnes Farm in Ruislip, looking for the most effective operating base for new squadrons. He settled on a site near Northolt Junction railway station {{but it was not}} until January 1915 that the British government officially requisitioned the land. It is rumoured that the government official tasked with acquiring the land arrived at the site with his map upside down, leading to the government requisitioning and developing land on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the railway line, including the old Hill Farm.|$|E
50|$|For {{the next}} twenty years, he made money at cards. He {{returned}} to music in <b>the</b> 1990s, recording <b>Wrong</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> My Life (1998) and Sons of the Jet Age (2000). He won the W.C. Handy Award for historic {{album of the year}} in 2001 for the Otis Span album Last Call. The next year he released an album of recordings made with Norah Jones.|$|R
50|$|Condor Flugdienst Flight 3782 was an {{international}} charter flight from Stuttgart-Echterdingen Airport, West Germany to Adnan Menderes Airport, Turkey that crashed near Seferihisar, Turkey on 2 January 1988. The flight was uneventful until final approach, when the aircraft, with the co-pilot in command, was cleared for an ILS {{approach to the}} Outer Marker (Non-Directional Beacon) {{and then on to}} Runway 35. The aircraft's ILS was switched on after it had passed the NDB, therefore missing the turn. The crew, confused, then followed <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> beam <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ILS, and it struck Dümentepe Hill, 10.5 nautical miles from the airport, killing all 16 people on board.|$|R
5000|$|James Cunningham of Hardcore Gamer {{gave the}} game a 4 out of 5 saying, [...] "While {{a little more}} realism would make American Truck Simulator more fun, {{paradoxical}} as that may sound, there’s no escaping how fantastically playable it is." [...] Laura Dale from Polygon rated the game a 8/10 saying, [...] "As someone who sunk countless hours into Euro Truck Simulator 2, {{a fresh coat of}} paint, an unfamiliar set of sights and the challenge of driving on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road left me confident that I'll be sinking just as many hours into American Truck Simulator." ...|$|R
5|$|During {{the third}} attempt to relieve Mantua, Vukassovich {{participated in the}} Tyrol Corps' {{victories}} at Cembra on 2 November and the Battle of Calliano on 6–7 November. On the 17th, his troops battled {{their way out of}} the Adige River gorge to link up with Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko's column on the heights. Together they routed the French at Rivoli Veronese. After Bonaparte won the Battle of Arcole, the French army commander drove the Tyrol Corps back to Trento. During the fourth attempt to relieve Mantua, Jozsef Alvinczi directed Vukassovich to lead his 6th Column down the east bank of the Adige River. His artillery supported the attack of Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen on the west bank of the river, but he exerted little other influence on the disastrous result of the Battle of Rivoli because his troops were on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the open}} battle never took place. The 1,200-strong English landing force under Major John Walley, Phips' second-in-command, never got across the Saint Charles. Frontenac had sent strong {{detachments}} of Canadian militiamen under Jacques Le Moyne de Sainte-Hélène, {{along with some}} Indians, into the wooded areas east of the river. When the English landed on 18 October, they were immediately harassed by Canadian militia, while the ships' boats mistakenly landed the field guns on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Saint Charles. Meanwhile, Phips's four large ships, quite contrary to the plan, anchored before Quebec and began bombarding the city until 19 October, {{at which point the}} English had shot away most of their ammunition. The French shore batteries had also proved to be much more than a match, and the ships were pounded until the rigging and hulls were badly damaged; the ensign of Phips' flagship the Six Friends was cut down and fell into the river, and under a hail of musket shots, a daring group of Canadians paddled a canoe up to the ships to capture it. They triumphantly brought the ensign back to the Governor unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Negron, in a {{flashback}} tells of his war {{experiences as a}} young corporal of the segregated 92nd Infantry Division in Italy in 1944. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that he found in Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. Sam and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village, where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One Italian villager, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a love triangle with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.|$|E
5|$|Imo {{was granted}} {{clearance}} to leave Bedford Basin by {{signals from the}} guard ship HMCS Acadia at approximately 7:30 {{on the morning of}} 6 December, with Pilot William Hayes on board. The ship entered the Narrows well above the harbour's speed limit in an attempt {{to make up for the}} delay experienced in loading her cargo. Imo met American tramp steamer SS Clara being piloted up <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> (western) <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbour. The pilots agreed to pass starboard-to-starboard. Soon afterwards though, Imo was forced to head even further towards the Dartmouth shore after passing the tugboat Stella Maris, which was travelling up the harbour to Bedford Basin near mid-channel. Horatio Brannen, the captain of Stella Maris, saw Imo approaching at excessive speed and ordered his ship closer to the western shore to avoid an accident.|$|R
5000|$|Considered a liberal, Mundelein was {{a friend}} of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and {{supporter}} of the New Deal. [...] A staunch supporter of trade unions, the Cardinal once remarked, The trouble with Church in the past has been that we were too often allied or drawn into an alliance with <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side.</b> Selfish employers <b>of</b> labor have flattered the Church by calling it the great conservative force, and then called upon it to act as a police force while they paid but a pittance of wage to those who work for them.

500|$|Strong and polarised {{opinions}} about Naim amplifiers {{led to the}} NAIT being called [...] "one {{of the most controversial}} and famous integrated amps in the history of HiFi" [...] by Lucio Cadeddu. This controversy has been {{as much to do with}} the company's refusal to follow the fashion of [...] "audiophile-approved values"– such as power ratings and holographic soundstage– as its idiosyncratic preference for connectors other than RCA connectors and its eschewing of tone controls. The volume control always sits on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> (left) <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facia. However, the trade noted that the unique sound of the NAIT caused it to become [...] "an instant classic" [...] upon release. As one of the most recognisable pieces of hi-fi, the NAIT has acquired an iconic and legendary status among integrated amplifiers; Hi-fi World said: [...] "If there was ever a quintessentially British affordable audiophile amplifier, the Naim NAIT is it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Many famous Montreal {{gridiron}} {{members of}} the past, present and future have either played with or coached Garbage Bowl teams. People like Johnny Newman, Sam [...] "The Rifle" [...] Etcheverry, Red O'Quinn, Tex Coulter, Moses Denson, Terry Evanshen, Red Storey, Brodie Snyder, George Dixon and someone known only as [...] "The Shadow" [...] have all been [...] "on the field" [...] on January 1 no matter how rotten their weather to make the Garage Bowl game a memorable start to the New Year. Over the years the game has had its controversial moments. Tex Coulter had his eligibility questioned in 1957 when it was claimed that he was purposely directed to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> (North) <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracks by Combine scouts. Johnny Newman resolved the problem when he produced Tex's contract written, in true Garbage Bowl fashion, on a bread wrapper. In other years, supporters have engaged in torch light parades and even effigy hangings to rally their team to victory.|$|R
60|$|The famed {{and named}} go; the nameless, {{if they have}} an accuser. Necklace Lamotte's Husband is in these Prisons (she long since squelched on the London Pavements); but gets delivered. Gross de Morande, of the Courier de l'Europe, hobbles distractedly to and fro there: but they let him hobble out; on right nimble crutches;--his hour not being yet come. Advocate Maton de la Varenne, very weak in health, is {{snatched}} off from mother and kin; Tricolor Rossignol (journeyman goldsmith and scoundrel lately, a risen man now) remembers an old Pleading of Maton's!

In the Arsenal quarter, there are dumb hearts making wail, with signs, with wild gestures; he their miraculous healer and speech-bringer is rapt away.|$|R
5000|$|To reduce {{production}} costs, Kubrick {{had intended}} {{to make it a}} silent picture, but in the end the adding of sounds, effects and music brought the production over-budget to around $53,000, and had to be bailed out by producer Richard de Rochemont, on condition that he help in his production of a five-part television series about Abraham Lincoln on location in Hodgenville, Kentucky. Kubrick also ran into difficulty in editing a key scene where one of the soldiers throws a plate of beans to the floor and enters the frame from <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>side.</b> Kubrick's blocking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crucial scene was faulty, and his actors accidentally crossed the so-called [...] "stage line," [...] which required the negative to be flipped in the printing process to preserve continuity; this was another expense.|$|R
