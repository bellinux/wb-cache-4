The label didn't have {{the legal right}} to use the name, but I didn't want to get {{involved}} in a legal battle...Keith's my man, just trying to make a little bit of money." [...] KutMasta Kurt stated that Thornton was reluctant to perform songs from the album, because the lyrics did not fit the music. John Lindland, who coproduced the final album under the name One-Watt Sun, stated in defense of the album, [...] "People say it's a fake. We don't have that feeling. We <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> are great tracks. It wasn't about remixing anything. They were our ideas, and Keith went on grooves that we sent to LA." [...] In response to Fanatik J's criticism of the album, One Watt Sun referred to him as being disgruntled {{as a result of the}} label discarding his music. According to Lindland, [...] "If we were him, we'd have [...] beef too".|$|E
2500|$|The {{end of one}} of {{the more}} scandalous events in Versailles history during the Sun King’s reign transpired in this room. [...] In 1691, the fringe from the portieres in the Salon de Mars and part of the {{embroidered}} bed cover from the bed in the Salon de Mercure were stolen. [...] Toward the service of dessert, a bundle was thrown through one of the windows facing the cour de marbre and landed on the king’s table.

2500|$|Where I {{have taken}} {{away some of}} [...] Expressions, and cut them shorter, it may {{possibly}} be on this consideration, that what was beautiful in the Greek or Latin, would not appear so shining in the English; and where I have enlarg’d them, I desire the false Criticks would not always <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are secretly in the Poet, or may be fairly deduc’d from him; or at least, if both those considerations should fail, that my own is {{of a piece with}} his, and that if he were living, and an Englishman, they are such as he wou’d probably have written.|$|E

"Umslopogaas expects battle," [...] remarked Hans {{to me with}} a grin, [...] "otherwise {{with all}} this nice plain round us he would not have chosen to camp in a place which a few men could hold against many.

2500|$|Rowling allowed Cuarón to make {{minor changes}} to the book, on the {{condition}} that he stuck to the book's spirit. She allowed him to place a sundial on Hogwarts' grounds, but rejected a graveyard, as that would play an important part in the then unreleased sixth book. Rowling said she [...] "got goosebumps" [...] when she saw several moments in the film, as they inadvertently referred to events in the final two books, she stated [...] "people are going to look back on the film and <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> were put in deliberately as clues." [...] When filming concluded, Cuarón found that it had [...] "been the two sweetest years of my life," [...] and expressed his interest in directing one of the sequels.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his inaugural lecture, Lake published two important books on historical and exegetical matters concerning the New Testament during his time in Leiden: The Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (1907) and The Earlier Epistles of St. Paul: Their Motive and Origin (1911). [...] As Metzger explains: [...] "These studies, particularly the latter, revealed Lake's ability to analyze and evaluate complex historical and literary data and to set forth scholarly reconstructions with clarity and a certain persuasiveness." [...] In Historical Evidence Lake sets forth his approach: [...] "The first task of the historical inquirer is to collect the pieces of evidence; the second is to discuss the trustworthiness and meaning of each separate piece; {{and the third is}} to reconstruct the events to which the evidence relates" [...] (p.6). [...] As for the reconstruction, he explains: [...] "In any such attempt it is desirable to remember that the reconstruction of an original tradition from forms of later dates and of divergent contents must be guided by exactly the same principle as is the reconstruction of an original text from a number of extant MSS. [...] In each case the fundamental problem is the retracing of the line of development followed by the various authorities, and the solution depends chiefly on the ability to detect errors of transmission and to explain their existence" [...] (p.167). [...] As for The Earlier Epistles, Neill writes: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> of us who read Lake when we were young will be inclined to think {{that this is one of}} the best books on the New Testament that has ever been written in the English language. [...] This is the way it ought to be done. [...] Under Lake's skillful guidance, we feel ourselves one with those new and struggling groups of Christians, in all the perplexities of trying to discover what it means to be a Christian in a non-Christian world. [...] And there is the Apostle, so very much in working clothes and without a halo; we feel in our bones the passionate eagerness of Paul for better news from Corinth, the passionate relief when the good news arrives." [...] The book brought the conclusions of the German history of religions school to the attention of English-speaking world for the first time, and all later New Testament study has been influenced by this book.|$|E

40|$|Preserving {{the spoken}} word: six issues {{in search of}} a digital {{solution}} But isn't that the cause of all the trouble? Words!

2500|$|Moreover, he {{stresses}} that {{talk of the}} miraculous has no surface validity, for four reasons. First, he explains that in all of history {{there has never been}} a miracle which was attested to by a wide body of disinterested experts. Second, he notes that human beings delight in a sense of wonder, and this provides a villain with an opportunity to manipulate others. Third, he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> who hold onto the miraculous have tended towards barbarism. Finally, since testimonies tend to conflict with one another when it comes to the miraculous—that is, one man's religious miracle may be contradicted by another man's miracle—any testimony relating to the fantastic is self-denunciating.

We personally <b>think</b> <b>that</b> with <b>those</b> concerns being accounted for, that estimation should be more robust. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
