The collapse of the AFVG programme was considerably <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> the British position, having chosen to rely on Anglo-French collaboration and American-designed combat aircraft to meet its needs.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|News of the {{invasion}} quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on {{the invasion}} within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting {{at his home in}} Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and {{would not be able to}} hold back the invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict.|$|E

The {{pregnancy}} was difficult for his wife, and she died only sixteen days after giving birth. The death was very <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> Whitcomb, who shut himself away for several days. His daughter grew up to marry a prominent Terre Haute lawyer, Claude Matthews, who was elected governor of Indiana in 1896.|$|E
25|$|Republican leaders, however, staunchly opposed any {{attempts}} {{to modify the}} party position on slavery, appalled by what they considered a surrender of their principles when, for example, all the ninety-two Republican members of Congress voted for the Crittenden-Montgomery bill in 1858. Although this compromise measure blocked Kansas' entry into the union as a slave state, {{the fact that it}} called for popular sovereignty, rather than outright opposition to the expansion of slavery, was <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> the party leaders.|$|E
25|$|Long poem authors {{sometimes}} find {{great difficulty}} {{in making the}} entire poem coherent and/or deciding on a way to end it or wrap it up. Fear of failure is also a common concern, that perhaps the poem will not have as great an impact as intended. Since many long poems take the author's lifetime to complete, this concern is especially <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> anyone who attempts the long poem. Ezra Pound {{is an example of}} this dilemma, with his poem The Cantos. As the long poem's roots lie in the epic, authors of the long poem often feel an intense pressure to make their long poems the defining literature of the national identity or the shared identity of a large group of people. The American long poem is under pressure from its European predecessors, revealing a special variety of this anxiety. Walt Whitman tried to achieve this idea of characterizing the American identity in Song of Myself. Thus, when the author feels that their work fails to reach such a caliber or catalyze a change within the intended audience, they might consider the poem a failure as a whole.|$|E

When Poland was attacked in 1939, followed by attacks on Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Belgium and France, Kellner looked to the United States to come to Europe's aid. He could not understand why the United States acted so late to enter the war. On 25 June 1941, a few days after Operation Barbarossa and six months before Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, he wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1877, {{the work}} debuted in Brussels {{and then was}} shown at the Paris Salon. The statue's {{apparent}} lack of a theme was <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> critics– commemorating neither mythology nor a noble historical event– {{and it is not}} clear whether Rodin intended a theme. He first titled the work The Vanquished, in which form the left hand held a spear, but he removed the spear because it obstructed the torso from certain angles. After two more intermediary titles, Rodin settled on The Age of Bronze, suggesting the Bronze Age, and in Rodin's words, [...] "man arising from nature". Later, however, Rodin said that he had had in mind [...] "just a simple piece of sculpture without reference to subject".|$|E

Graphically, Orr and Zzap!64s Phil King found the game [...] "primitive", though [...] "adequate". More <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> several reviewers was the game's copy protection system.

500|$|Marcie Bianco of Quartz {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "centered around women's desire" [...] and Haynes structured {{it in a way}} that [...] "elevates the power of women's gaze". The omission of Carol from Best Picture, Bianco concluded, illustrates [...] "yet again how sexism operates in the world, and in the Academy specifically, as the refusal to see women as protagonists and agents of desire." [...] Writing for Paper magazine, Carey O'Donnell observed that gay romances are only [...] "Oscar surefires" [...] when they use the tragedy and desolation equation, and [...] "a depiction of two strong women in love with each other ... who end up being [...] " [...] with their lesbian relationship [...] "seems to still be <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> many." [...] David Ehrlich of Rolling Stone commented that the film's [...] "patience and precision" [...] did not conform to Academy tastes, but its legacy [...] "will doubtlessly survive this year's most egregious snub".|$|E
500|$|The anti-religious course {{pursued by}} Khrushchev was toned {{down by the}} Brezhnev/Kosygin leadership, with most Orthodox churches being staffed by docile clergy often tied to the KGB. State {{propaganda}} tended {{to focus more on}} promoting [...] "scientific atheism" [...] rather than active persecution of believers. Nonetheless, minority faiths continued to be harassed relentlessly by the authorities, and particularly <b>troubling</b> <b>to</b> them was the continued resilience of Islam in the Central Asian republics. This was worsened by their geographical proximity to Iran, which fell under control of a fanatical Islamic government in 1979 that professed hostility to both the United States and the Soviet Union. While official figures put the number of believers at 9-10% of the population, authorities were nonetheless baffled at the continued widespread presence of religious belief in society, especially since by the start of the 1980s, the vast majority of Soviet citizens alive had no memory of tsarist times.|$|E
500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them."

[...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E

[...] The Washington Post television reviewer Tom Shales called Homicide [...] "achingly, even painfully, brilliant. The best cop show I have ever seen." [...] David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called it the best police drama ever made for television besides Hill Street Blues. Baltimore Sun reporter David Bianculli praised the show's writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions, adding: [...] "Please watch this series; it's so good, I don't mind pleading." [...] Tom Jicha of South Florida Sun-Sentinel called it [...] "an hour about as fine as there is on the tube" [...] with great writing and camera-work. Jicha said, [...] "It would be a senseless act of violence against superb TV for those who claim to appreciate fine drama to kill this show by turning the dial." [...] Hal Boedeker, television critic with The Miami Herald, strongly praised the series, particularly [...] "Bop Gun", which he called [...] "the highest order for network TV". Boedeker called the writing, direction and acting [...] "first-rate" [...] and declared Homicide the better choice over NYPD Blue {{because it did not}} resort to gimmicks like the nudity featured in the latter show.|$|E
