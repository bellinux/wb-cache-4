5|$|The {{required}} causation may {{be quite}} oblique. As well as weaponry held in the hand, weaponry thrown is included, as is causing people to <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by creating a sense of panic. The general law on liability for omissions also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in Fagan v MPC) and of a duty of care. However, in R v Ireland the court ruled out psychological injury {{by means of a}} telephone as a form of battery, although it was not an important point in the case as other charges were brought. Poisoning is not a battery where there is no accompanying violence.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E
5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

5|$|The game tasks {{the player}} with {{navigating}} a bus through roads filled with alien potato beings. The player's bus holds female {{members of the}} alien race, and the player can shoot the females {{from the front of}} the bus in order to clear the alien potatoes. The aliens come in two colors: red and blue. Aliens are cleared from the road when two like-colored potatoes <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> but aliens begin to pile up in the road if two aliens hit each other that are not of the same color. The road is continuously scrolling downwards, forcing the player to make holes in the road wide enough to fit the bus through. The game can end prematurely if the player runs into too many aliens and loses all their lives.|$|E
5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, {{of the lower}} jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E
5|$|The main rivalry {{heading into}} New Year's Revolution was between John Cena and Umaga over the WWE Championship. The rivalry all {{began on the}} November 6 episode of Raw, one of WWE's main {{television}} programs, when Cena interfered in Umaga's match while accepting a challenge to a match by Kevin Federline. One week later, Jonathan Coachman, an on-screen authority figure of Raw, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced that a match between Cena and Umaga would take place, which ended in a no-contest due to interference. Three weeks later on the November 27 edition of Raw, Umaga (through Armando Alejandro Estrada) issued a challenge to Cena for the WWE Championship, which Cena accepted. The following week, Cena was assaulted by Umaga after his match, and both were confronted by security. Afterwards, neither of them could <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> outside of a match until New Year's Revolution. On the December 18 edition of Raw, Cena, along with D-Generation X, (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) faced off against Umaga and Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton). The match ended in a no-contest after Cena and Umaga started brawling to the backstage area. Two weeks later on the January 1 edition of Raw, Cena faced off against Federline in a No Disqualification match, a match {{where there is no}} rules {{and the only way to}} win is by pinfall or submission. During the match, Umaga came to the ring and hit Cena with the WWE championship belt, which allowed Federline to pin Cena for the win. This led to a 4-on-1 handicap match later that night between Johnny Nitro, Johnathan Coachman, Umaga, and Estrada and Cena, where Cena attacked Umaga with a folding chair, causing the disqualification.|$|E

25|$|Havens {{with the}} {{touching}} definition {{are closely related}} to brambles, families of connected subgraphs of a given graph that all <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The order of a bramble is the minimum number of vertices needed in a set of vertices that hits all of the subgraphs in the family. The set of flaps '(X) for a haven of order k (with the touching definition) forms a bramble of order at least k, because any set Y of fewer than k vertices fails to hit the subgraph '(Y). Conversely, from any bramble of order k, one may construct a haven of the same order, by defining '(X) (for each choice of X) to be the X-flap that includes all of the subgraphs in the bramble that are disjoint fromX. The requirement that the subgraphs in the bramble all <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> can be used to show that this X-flap exists, and that all of the flaps '(X) chosen in this way <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Thus, a graph has a bramble of order k if and only if it has a haven of orderk.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{characterization}} {{can also}} be made using brambles, families of connected subgraphs that all <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> (meaning either that they share a vertex or are connected by an edge). The order of a bramble is the smallest hitting set for the family of subgraphs, and the treewidth of a graph is one less than the maximum order of a bramble.|$|E

25|$|In graph theory, the treewidth of an {{undirected graph}} {{is a number}} {{associated}} with the graph.

It is played on an 8×8 grid, and includes slight variations, such as 4-player gameplay, various ship sizes and shapes, as well as the option to make the ships <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Iterations of Battleship appear as applications on numerous social networking services.|$|E
25|$|Five {{types of}} {{interactions}} between P. colobopterus wasps have been identified. Wasps may antennate, or <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with their antennae. They also demonstrate feeding behavior, where a wasp bearing food will offer {{the food to}} another wasp. Wasps may use their mandibles to request a feeding by biting the mandibles of another wasp; additionally, they may use their mandibles to groom another wasp by carefully moving them the mandibles over their nest mate’s body. Finally, wasps may use their mandibles to attack each other by biting another wasp’s body. Together, these interactions {{form the basis of}} the behavior of P. colobopterus. Research has demonstrated that queens rarely engage in interactions with workers except to request a feeding, and do not appear to regulate worker behavior.|$|E
25|$|Batteries convert {{chemical}} energy directly to electrical energy. A battery consists of some number of voltaic cells. Each cell {{consists of two}} half-cells connected in series by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One half-cell includes electrolyte and the negative electrode, the electrode to which anions (negatively charged ions) migrate; the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the positive electrode to which cations (positively charged ions) migrate. Redox reactions power the battery. Cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode during charging, while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode during charging. During discharge, the process is reversed. The electrodes do not <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> but are electrically connected by the electrolyte. Some cells use different electrolytes for each half-cell. A separator allows ions to flow between half-cells, but prevents mixing of the electrolytes.|$|E

25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, men {{and women}} who are not married and are not closely related are {{generally}} not allowed to <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Many Orthodox married couples will also not touch one another in public. A person who refrains from touching the opposite sex is said to be shomer negiah. Shmirath negiah applies to touching that is b'derech chiba (in an affectionate manner). According to some authorities, mainly of Modern Orthodox background, a quick handshake, particularly in the context of earning a living in a business setting, does not fall under this category. However, people who are stringently shomer negiah will avoid shaking hands with a member of the opposite sex, even in a business context. This is almost universally observed within the Haredi community, and somewhat observed within the Modern Orthodox community where the term originated in recent decades. Conservative and Reform Judaism do not follow these laws.|$|E
25|$|Given a {{triangle}} ABC and its three Malfatti circles, let D, E, and F be the points where {{two of the}} circles <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> opposite vertices A, B, and C respectively. Then the three lines AD, BE, and CF meet in a single triangle center known as the first Ajima–Malfatti point after the contributions of Ajima and Malfatti to the circle problem. The second Ajima–Malfatti point is the meeting point of three lines connecting the tangencies of the Malfatti circles with the centers of the excircles of the triangle. Other triangle centers also associated with the Malfatti circles include the Yff–Malfatti point, formed {{in the same way}} as the first Malfatti point from three mutually tangent circles that are all tangent to the lines through the sides of the given triangle, but that lie partially outside the triangle, and the radical center of the three Malfatti circles.|$|E
25|$|The contact graph of an {{arbitrary}} finite packing of unit balls is the graph whose vertices {{correspond to the}} packing elements and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements <b>touch</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The cardinality of the edge set of the contact graph gives the number of touching pairs, the number of 3-cycles in the contact graph gives the number of touching triplets, {{and the number of}} tetrahedrons in the contact graph gives the number of touching quadruples (in general for a contact graph associated with a sphere packing in n dimensions that the cardinality of the set of n-simplices in the contact graph gives the number of touching (n+1)-tuples in the sphere packing). In the case of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, non-trivial upper bounds on the number of touching pairs, triplets, and quadruples were proved by Karoly Bezdek and Samuel Reid at the University of Calgary.|$|E
