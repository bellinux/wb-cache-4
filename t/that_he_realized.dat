The two had been aligned since 2002, as members of Evolution, and were partners in a tag team match on the show. After they won the match, Triple H attacked Flair with a sledgehammer. The week after, Triple H explained his actions, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> Flair {{was no longer the}} legend he was, and he needed to stop Flair. Flair and Triple H met in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday, which Flair won. A Last Man Standing match was made between the two for Survivor Series.|$|E

25|$|Jacobo Arenas, on {{the other}} hand, as the FARC's main ideologue, had {{political}} and ideological education as a communist intellectual, thus it is believed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that FARC's initial status was {{not up to the}} necessary standards needed to properly fight a Colombian Army that could count on the aid of the United States from time to time.|$|E
25|$|Chen became {{involved}} in politics in 1980 when he defended the participants of the Kaohsiung Incident in a military court. While his client Huang Hsin-chieh, the leading opposition dissident, and seven co-defendants, including his future Vice President Annette Lu, were found guilty, Chen {{came to be known}} for his forceful and colorful arguments. He has stated that it was during this period <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> the unfairness of the political system in Taiwan and became politically active {{as a member of the}} Tangwai movement.|$|E
25|$|Human use of {{the brook}} began {{at the start of}} the 20th century, when The Educational Alliance (EA), a New York City Jewish {{organization}} that sought to better integrate Jews into American life, bought the land around the brook's headwaters and dammed the brook to create Surprise Lake Camp, where Jewish boys from the Lower East Side of Manhattan could get away from the city during the summer. Its early alumni included Eddie Cantor, who later said it was at the camp <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> he wanted to be an entertainer. After going through several organizational parents in its first decades, the camp assumed control of its own affairs in the late 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Rodezno’s {{motives are}} unclear; apart from {{partisan}} {{claims that he}} traded Carlist principles for a few Navarrese alcaldias, there are many conflicting interpretations offered. According to one, he feared that internal divisions within the Nationalist camp might lead to defeat in the war. According to another, {{he has never been}} a genuine Carlist and is better described as a conservative monarchist. Some scholars claim that he was a possibilist, who realized that Traditionalism was unable to seize power single-handedly and needed coalition partners; one more clue might have been that perceiving Carlism as rooted in family and regional values, he downplayed the issues of organization and structures. Others underline that he considered the emerging system largely in line with the Carlist vision and did not think it worthwhile to be marginalized for the sake of defending second-rate discrepancies. Finally, there are authors who believe <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> neither gravity of the moment nor totalitarian nature of the new party; Rodezno – the theory goes – imagined the structure either as a new incarnation of Unión Patriotica or as a loose alliance, both permitting Carlism to maintain its proper identity.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} initial {{proposal}} for [...] "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", Barrett {{felt that she}} could play the woman who went into space to find her fiance. She dyed her hair blonde {{in an attempt to}} fit the role. Barrett sought to surprise Roddenberry at his office, but he walked right past her, not recognizing who she was. It was only when he came back out give his secretary some papers <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> it was Barrett. They had the idea that it might get her past the NBC executives and back onto the show. The character of Christine Ducheaux was subsequently changed to Christine Chapel by Roddenberry, as a play on the Sistine Chapel. No other actresses were considered for the role.|$|E
500|$|This {{was quickly}} {{followed}} by [...] "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge". Manson {{said that the}} recording of the album [...] "just became a rhythm. This was something I was excited to do." [...] This is {{in stark contrast to}} the recording of The High End of Low (2009) and Born Villain, when he was frequently [...] "dragged into the studio" [...] late at night to record vocals. He credited this enthusiasm to the collaborative process between him and Bates, saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> after the first performance of [...] "Birds of Hell Awaiting" [...] that [...] " [...] just sang it. I didn't even know where the music was going to go and I just went with it and it was very organic. And then it opened up a whole different part of my mind." ...|$|E

Konstantinov and Garin fight and Garin nearly drowns in the water.|$|R
500|$|Next, Pausch {{explained}} {{his dream of}} being like Captain Kirk from the Star Trek series, with the slide showing [...] "Being like Meeting Captain Kirk". Meeting Captain Kirk”] Pausch explained <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> {{that there were some}} things he just could not do, {{and that was one of}} them. He eventually changed the goal into meeting William Shatner, the actor who played Captain Kirk. Shatner had written a book on the science of Star Trek, and had gone to Pausch for help with the virtual reality section of the book. Pausch met and worked with Shatner for this purpose. Pausch concluded the section with the story of his becoming an Imagineer at Disney, as well as his achieving the goal of [...] "being one of those guys who wins stuffed animals", which was at a carnival with his wife and children.|$|E
500|$|In March 1950, Fairchild died. Fairchild {{had been}} Saville's {{champion}} in the USAF, and Saville had used Fairchild's influence as a shield to [...] "get things done", according to Smart. In the process, Saville had made enough enemies in the Air Staff <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> Fairchild's absence would greatly limit his career advancement. He began planning his retirement, finishing ongoing projects, and first selecting then grooming his replacement: Brigadier General Laurence C. Craigie. In June 1950, Saville gave a lecture on air defense at the Air War College, Maxwell AFB, Alabama, telling the students that the optimal air defense system as he envisaged {{might be able to}} destroy 60% of an attacking bomber force, but that realistic results would be closer to 30% reduction. He emphasized the need for better intelligence regarding Soviet offensive airpower capabilities, to increase the accuracy of air defense predictions.|$|E
500|$|With this episode, Shankar {{sought to}} move the Doctor out of sickbay, {{and while he was}} looking {{generally}} to involve Vikings on the holodeck, it wasn't until later <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> he had inadvertently followed the story of the Beowulf poem, and so changed the script to include direct references. Composer Dennis McCarthy sought to increase the tempo of the music used in this episode, and included an unused piece written for The Next Generation episode [...] "Qpid"; he was nominated for Outstanding Music Composition at the Emmy Awards for his work on [...] "Heroes and Demons". A further nomination at those awards was received by Marvin V. Rush for Individual Achievement in Cinematography for a Series. Picardo's performance was praised by the crew, and the episode was received positively by critics, who compared elements to The Lord of the Rings and computer based roleplaying games. It received Nielsen ratings of 6.4/11 percent.|$|E
50|$|Not long after, Isabel {{realizes that}} she is {{attracted}} to Arkarian, but the two appear unaware of one another's feelings. At one instance, Arkarian confesses to Isabel <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would die for her, but their relationship still fails to progress. It is only when Isabel breaks into the underworld to save him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>that</b> his love is reciprocated.|$|R
50|$|Peter {{picks it}} up and announces to the {{audience}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realizes</b> <b>he</b> made a mistake and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will be sharing his reparation money with his brothers. When he sees white people partaking, <b>he</b> mentions <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was just talking to the black people. He then decides it does not matter if you are black or white, but what matters is green. Quagmire then finds Cindi still bound and gagged in the bathroom stall.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Joel Keller, from TV Squad, said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realizes</b> [...] "two {{things about}} the show: the more the show concentrates on the ensemble and less on Jules, the funnier it is" [...] and that there's gotta be more [...] "interaction between Courteney Cox and Dan Byrd," [...] praising their acting in the episode.|$|R
500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production {{opened at}} the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. [...] The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. [...] One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. [...] The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. [...] Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. [...] Sedated with morphine, he could see {{only part of the}} stage. [...] As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. [...] It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that the curtain had been met by wild applause. [...] Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow. [...] Rodgers' daughter Mary caught sight of her friend, Stephen Sondheim, both teenagers then, across several rows; both had eyes wet with tears.|$|E
500|$|When {{the trades}} {{indicated}} production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg {{and asked him}} bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where {{he had heard the}} rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was [...] "out to get him" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. In truth, Katzenberg was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt, which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release. Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the DS {{version for}} 1UP.com, Barnholt {{positively}} noted the surreal story and music, but {{felt that the}} gameplay began to falter {{during the second half}} and called the graphics [...] "perhaps even worse" [...] than the PS2 original. He concluded that the game was most suited to dedicated fans of Suda's work, and that it showed the increased quality of his work on later titles more than having its own qualities. Matthew Razak of Destructoid found the gameplay elements [...] "seriously lacking" [...] and faulted most aspects of the title, which contributed to the low score. Despite this, Razak felt that people should play it and experience its unique deconstruction of game cliches, a theme <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> ran through all of Suda's subsequent work. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh found that most of the puzzles presented to the player were forced in and distracted from the main narrative, but noted that the odd elements within the game fitted well into the story's surreal style. He was fairly negative about the graphics, despite the stylized look helping alleviate the downgrade from the PS2 original. In conclusion, he called the game's dated appearance and style [...] "a double edged sword", both entertaining and annoying players with its mechanics and styling. Game Informers Joe Juba enjoyed the bizarre characters and story, in addition to the artistic styling and music. His main complaints were focused on tedious sections within the gameplay and the [...] "blocky" [...] graphics. He said that, unless the player believed in sacrificing everything for style, Flower, Sun, and Rain could not be recommended.|$|E
5000|$|With {{mounting}} pressure, skyrocketing expenses, {{and his new}} assignment, Jim {{starts to}} wonder why he {{wanted to live in}} the country.

500|$|Janowitz and Mayer {{are said}} to have set out to write a story denouncing {{arbitrary}} authority as brutal and insane. Janowitz said it was only years after the film was released <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> exposing the [...] "authoritative power of an inhuman state" [...] was the [...] "subconscious intention" [...] of the writers. However, Hermann Warm, who designed the film's sets, said Mayer had no political intentions when he wrote the film. Film historian David Robinson noted Janowitz did not refer to anti-authority intentions in the script until many decades after Caligari was released, and he suggested Janowitz's recollection may have changed in response to later interpretations to the film. The film they wrote was entitled Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, using the English spelling [...] "Cabinet" [...] rather than the German [...] "Kabinett". The completed script contained 141 scenes. Janowitz has claimed the name [...] "Caligari", which was not settled upon until after the script was finished, was inspired by a rare book called ‘’Unknown Letters of Stendhal'’, which featured a letter from the French novelist Stendhal referring to a French officer named Caligari he met at the La Scala theatre in Milan. However, no record of any such letter exists, and film historian John D. Barlow suggested Janowitz may have fabricated the story. The physical appearance of Dr. Caligari was inspired by portraits of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. The character's name is spelled [...] "Calligaris" [...] in the only known surviving script, although in some instances the final [...] "s" [...] is removed. Other character names are also spelled differently from the final film: Cesare appears as [...] "Caesare", Alan is [...] "Allan" [...] or sometimes [...] "Alland" [...] and Dr. Olfen is [...] "Dr. Olfens". Likewise, unnamed characters in the final film have names in the script, including the town clerk ("Dr. Lüders") and the house-breaker ("Jakob Straat").|$|E
2500|$|In 1864 Meucci later claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized</b> his [...] "best device", {{using an}} iron {{diaphragm}} with optimized thickness and tightly clamped along its rim. The instrument was {{housed in a}} shaving-soap box, whose cover clamped the diaphragm.|$|E
2500|$|James Arness: An Autobiography was {{released}} in September 2001, with a foreword by Burt Reynolds (who had been a cast member of Gunsmoke for several years in the 1960s). Arness noted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realized,</b> [...] "f I was {{going to write a}} book about my life, I better do it now ... 'cause I'm not getting any younger." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{suppose the}} {{intention}} of the phrase [...] "finding salvation," [...] as religious people use it, is very much this experience. If it {{is not the same thing}} it is something very closely akin. It is as if someone were scrambling out of a pit into a largeness--a largeness that is attainable by every man just in the measure <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realizes</b> it is there.|$|R
5000|$|Wilhelm The Tinkerer: is a wild eyed {{eccentric}} egomaniac and the world's {{most brilliant}} machine scientist.

50|$|Dennis Guise fits neither mold exactly. Krulik’s {{criteria}} fit in some ways. At {{the beginning}} of the story, Dennis is catatonic because of the confusion of the telepathic inputs from so many people. Through the various personalities <b>that</b> <b>he</b> channels he may gain a certain, if incomplete, culture and experience. He needs emotional maturity, his intelligence is assumed by some, but it is unclear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>realizes</b> his losses from his years of catatonia.|$|R
