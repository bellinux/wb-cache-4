40|$|IN {{the course}} of a two year {{investigation}} of a litter decomposition in the beech-pine forest in the Ratanica watershed (Southern Poland), organic matter mass loss of 44 % and 41 % was established on the experimental plots A and B respectively. The decomposition rates k were - 0. 258 and - 0. 266 for the plots A and B respectively. The concentration of majority of the chemical elements increased in {{the course of}} the two year decomposition. The decrease in concentration was observed only for K and Mg on both plots, for P on plot A and for Cu on the plot B. Nutrients can be ordered into a following sequence with respect to their release rate from litter plot A: K <b>more</b> <b>than</b> P <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Mg organic matter = C <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Ca <b>more</b> <b>than</b> S <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Na <b>more</b> <b>than</b> N, plot B: K <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Mg <b>more</b> <b>than</b> organic matter = C <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Ca <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Na <b>more</b> <b>than</b> P <b>more</b> <b>than</b> N. After the two year decompositoin differences between the two plots in concentration of majority of nutrients decreased significantly; a similar tendency was not, however, observed for majority of the heavy metals.

It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of great snipe, as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern <b>than</b> <b>more</b> recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians {{were for}} a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but {{increasing}} awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phyla. Modern cnidarians are generally classified into four main classes: sessile Anthozoa (sea anemones, corals, sea pens); swimming Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies); and Hydrozoa, a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms, and has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o' War. Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are now recognized as highly derived cnidarians rather <b>than</b> <b>more</b> closely related to the bilaterians.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, Greek Orthodox churches {{beginning}} in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather <b>than</b> <b>more</b> recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed quincunx plans. Examples include Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, completed in 1961 but designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957, Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Oakland (1960), and Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.|$|E
5|$|For galaxies {{more distant}} than the Local Group {{and the nearby}} Virgo Cluster, but within a {{thousand}} megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and {{has come to be}} known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. Hubble's law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier <b>than</b> <b>more</b> direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.|$|E
