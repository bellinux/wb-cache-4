The Students' Union subsequently apologized.|$|E
5|$|To remedy {{crumbling}} tarmac {{along the}} tracks on Princes Street, {{the road was}} closed in September 2011 and remained closed for ten months.

5|$|On 17 July 1995, U.S. Senator William Roth, {{chairman}} of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, authorized a Senate investigation into the incident, primarily in response <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> from {{family members of the}} shootdown victims that it appeared that the U.S. military was not holding anyone seriously accountable for the shootdown. Also in response <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> about the DoD's response to the incident, the U.S. House of Representatives' Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel scheduled a hearing on the incident for 3 August 1995 to examine the accident investigation and the judicial actions that followed. In addition, on 24 July the DoD ordered the USAF to reexamine the disciplinary and administrative actions for the personnel involved in the shootdown and for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review the corrective actions taken against those involved and determine whether further action was necessary. Widnall requested that the new USAF chief of staff, Ronald R. Fogleman begin his own review of accountability for the incident.|$|E

50|$|John F. Kennedy's 1962 Consumer Bill of Rights, {{which is}} not a legal document, asserts that {{consumers}} have the right to consumer safety, information preventing fraud, deceit and informed choice, to choose from multiple alternative options and the right <b>to</b> <b>complaint,</b> <b>to</b> be heard and addressed. A number of these principles are enshrined in the law of higher education.|$|R

5|$|On June 8, 1999, a {{tractor-trailer}} {{carrying a}} backhoe that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just {{northwest of the}} I-95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> about vandalism and crime.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} {{anniversary of the}} crash, a plaque on the Charles Landley Bridge was unveiled. The bridge crosses the rail tracks {{at the site of}} the accident, and a {{makeshift}} memorial had been maintained there by victims' families. NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman attended the unveiling along with Mayor Gray. Another memorial plaque was also installed, by Metro officials, at Fort Totten station; it was subject <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> from relatives of the dead, who claimed that it was insensitive.|$|E
5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states. He depended partly upon recommendations from congressmen and other prominent people. This helped maintain good relations between the executive and legislative branches. This also led <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.|$|E
50|$|The {{concerns}} were widely reported and have led <b>to</b> a <b>complaint</b> <b>to</b> the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), {{arguing that the}} data should be pseudonymised and encrypted.|$|R

5|$|The French Basque Country {{had been}} a {{favourite}} haven of ETA. Since mid-1968 most of ETA's leadership had lived there and {{used it as a}} base for training, infrastructure and planning attacks. ETA commandos also operated from there, crossing the border into Spain to carry out attacks before fleeing back to France. This led <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> in Spain that French authorities were not doing enough to tackle ETA activity, preferring to leave the Basque conflict to the Spanish to deal with.|$|E
5|$|The high injury toll and {{congested}} schedule contributed <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> about Joe Warbrick's behaviour. His {{comments to}} the English press – who directed much of their focus towards him – were viewed negatively by {{some members of the}} squad; he was accused of neglecting to acknowledge the contributions of players such as Thomas Ellison, Gage, Keogh, and Edward McCausland but to extol the efforts of himself and his brothers.|$|E
5|$|While other {{companies}} marketed directly to foreign air forces, {{as part of}} the FX program, the F-5G could only be marketed by the State Department. Under this policy umbrella, Northrop had to submit every piece of marketing material to government review, which could take months. The State Department had no interest in selling the FX; from its perspective it was one aircraft among many, leading to a lackadaisical approach, and led <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough.|$|E

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} working well without music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{school districts}} have responded <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> by local Native American {{individuals}} and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 {{when one of the}} teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon {{responded to}} the {{economic}} crisis by declaring a four-day banking holiday to begin on March 1, 1933. He twice extended the holiday, which finally ended on March 18. Responding <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> of low prices by farmers, he closed burley tobacco markets in December of that year. At {{the end of the}} 1932 fiscal year, figures showed that the state incurred a $2 million deficit. Kentucky was also unable to secure significant financial assistance under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal because the state was often unable to raise the required matching funds.|$|E

5|$|On May 6, 2009, Microsoft and Epic Games {{issued a}} joint press release announcing the Gears of War 2: All Fronts Collection, to be {{released}} on July 28, 2009. The All Fronts Collection was to be sold as a retail package, and would have included all add-ons released for Gears of War 2, a poster, and a strategy guide for the game. In response <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> that the All Fronts Collection had identical pricing to the Dark Corners add-on, but significantly more content, {{as well as the}} All Fronts Collection retail package not being made available in certain regions, Epic Games adjusted the release plan; the All Fronts Collection was released digitally via Xbox Live and the Dark Corners add-on was reduced in price.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles first {{played a}} full show with Best on 17 August 1960 at the Indra club in Hamburg, {{and the group}} slept in the Bambi Kino cinema in a small, dirty room with bunk beds, a cold and noisy former {{storeroom}} directly behind the screen. Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best remembered it as a depressing place filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller. As Best {{had been the only}} group member to study O-Level German at school, he could talk with the club's owner, Bruno Koschmider, and the clientele. After the Indra closed due <b>to</b> <b>complaints</b> about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartheid}} government greatly limited {{freedom of}} expression, through censorship, reduced economic freedom, and reduced mobility for black people. However, {{it did not}} have the resources to effectively enforce censorship of written and recorded material. The government established the Directorate of Publications in 1974 through the Publications Act, but this body only responded <b>to</b> <b>complaints,</b> and took decisions about banning material that was submitted to it. Less than one hundred pieces of music were formally banned by this body in the 1980s. Thus music and performance {{played an important role in}} propagating subversive messages.|$|E
