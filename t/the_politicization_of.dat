By collecting their background information and opinions towards learning, teaching {{as well as the}} uses of teaching materials in the lessons, a full and diversified investigation is able to be incorporated in the study. This study points out that there are many factors which are able to affect an individual’s goals and values of the politics and the school’s curriculum such as Liberal Studies is just one of them. Despite it can enhance student’s social and political awareness, there are no any motivation in this subject to encourage students to join into any political movements in society.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> the {{education}} system essentially replaced academic tradition and excellence with ideological adherence and trappings, such as membership in National Socialist organizations, such as the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP, National Socialist German Workers Party), the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League), and the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (NSDStB, National Socialist German Student League). The politicization can be illustrated with the conflict which evolved when a replacement for Arnold Sommerfeld was sought in view of his emeritus status.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> {{science in}} the sense of a {{manipulation}} of science for political gains is a part of the political process.

However, e.g. in case of the Ozone depletion, global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in a climate of high uncertainty and against strong resistance while in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.|$|E

25|$|He {{argues that}} the {{availability}} of federal research funds distorts “the natural market for scientific research” by inducing scientists to eschew pursuit of radical lines of potentially promising research that might not appeal to politicians and bureaucrats who hold influence over the allocation of grant monies. “Federal funding of medical research guarantees <b>the</b> <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> decisions about what types of research for what diseases will be funded. Scarce tax resources are allocated according to who has the most effective lobby, {{rather than on the}} basis of need or even likely success. Federal funding also causes researchers to neglect potential treatments and cures that do not qualify for federal funds.” In his view, eliminating government sources of funds for medical research would probably improve the quality of research being performed.|$|E

500|$|Biographer John Watson {{notes that}} Innis's work was profoundly {{political}} while McLuhan's was not.

This also underlies <b>the</b> <b>politicization</b> <b>of</b> Innis's position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan." [...] Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. [...] "For Innis, the yellow press of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command." [...] Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the [...] "dialectic of power and knowledge" [...] in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan's.|$|E
500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics {{has three}} key aims, and, correspondingly, its {{chapters}} are split into three sections.

The second of these is a possible rapprochement between animal ethics and ecologism (environmental ethics and green political theory). The third is the increased presence of animal protection laws for the benefit of nonhuman animals themselves. Aside from the introduction, the book features ten single-authored chapters, with three in Part I: <b>The</b> <b>Politicization</b> <b>of</b> the Animal Advocacy Discourse, three in Part II: The Rapprochement between Animal Ethics and Ecologism, and four in Part III: The Introduction of Laws and Institutions for the Benefit of Animals.|$|E

The Kadets transformed from an opposition force into a role of established leadership, as the former opposition party held most of the power in the new Provisional Government, which replaced the tsarist regime.
