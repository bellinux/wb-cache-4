5|$|In 1986, {{the first}} local short feature film {{to be shot}} on video was released. Titled Ciyaar Mood ("It is not a Joke"), it was {{directed}} by the filmmaker Abdurrahman Yusuf Cartan.

5|$|In {{parallel}} of {{the video}} game approach, in the media art field, Maurice Benayoun’s Virtual Reality artwork The Tunnel under the Atlantic (1995), often compared <b>to</b> <b>video</b> games, introduced a virtual film director, fully autonomous intelligent agent, to shoot and edit in real time a full video from the digging performance in the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Museum of Contemporary art in Montreal. The full movie, Inside the Tunnel under the Atlantic, 21h long, was followed in 1997 by Inside the Paris New-Delhi Tunnel (13h long). Only short excerpts where presented to the public. The complex behavior of the Tunnel’s virtual director makes it a significant precursor of later application <b>to</b> <b>video</b> games based machinimas.|$|E

Farrar had taken Tim and Kelly to the hockey game, while Green took Kate to ballet lessons. The family regrouped around 9 p.m. when Tim and Kelly were dropped back at the Prairie Village house for dinner.|$|E
5|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries to present <b>to</b> <b>video</b> on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest.

5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight <b>to</b> <b>video.</b> That left {{less than a}} year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Lundgren starred {{opposite}} Michael Paré in {{the direct}} <b>to</b> <b>video</b> action flick Direct Contact. He {{plays the role}} of Mike Riggins, an imprisoned ex-US Special forces operative in Eastern Europe, who is offered his freedom and money to rescue an American woman, Ana Gale, who has been kidnapped by a ruthless warlord. This was followed by another direct <b>to</b> <b>video</b> film Command Performance (2009), a hostage action drama in which Lundgren, a proficient musician in real life, plays a rock drummer forced to face terrorists at a concert in Moscow. The film co-starred Canadian pop singer Melissa Smith, playing a world-famous pop singer in the film and his own daughter Ida on her screen debut, who played one of the daughters of the Russian president. The story was inspired by a concert Madonna put on for Russian President Vladimir Putin, although Dolph has also likened the pop singer to Britney Spears.|$|E

5|$|Similar <b>to</b> <b>video</b> fluoroscopy, X-ray {{microbeam}} studies use radiation {{to study}} movements of articulators. Gold pellets, 2 to 3mm in size, {{are placed in}} and around the mouth similar to the coils used in EMA. Radiation exposure is limited by using computer software to focus narrow x-ray beams, about 6mm2, on the pellets and track them as they move. Like EMA, x-ray microbeam studies are limited by the placement of the pellets. While able to minimize radiation exposure, the system is largely inaccessible as it is unique to the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The Joker's {{popularity}} (and {{his role}} as Batman's enemy) has involved the character in most Batman-related media, from television <b>to</b> <b>video</b> games. These adaptations of the character have been received positively on film, television, and in video games. As in the comics, the character's personality and appearance shift; he is campy, ferocious or unstable, depending on the author and the intended audience.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{shown at the}} 1994 Cannes Film Festival and {{broadcast}} on British television in 1995. Although originally intended for theatrical release, it failed to find a theatrical distributor, and was released straight <b>to</b> <b>video</b> in the United States in 1997 under the title Shades of Fear. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, and while the lesbian sub-plot in particular was generally well received, Winterson's scripting was a focal point of criticism.|$|E
5|$|Titanfall {{received}} generally favorable reviews, according <b>to</b> <b>video</b> game review aggregator Metacritic. Critics {{praised the}} game's pilot–Titan balance, its Smart Pistol, fast-paced player mobility, and accessibility for players of all skill sets. Reviewers {{complained that the}} AI grunts were too unintelligent, that private match and community support features were lacking, and that the game had shipped with too few multiplayer modes. Multiple reviewers cited the Titan's feeling of grandiosity in the player experience—specifically, the thrill of watching a summoned Titan fall from the sky, but also the feeling of entering the Titan exoskeleton and of scaling a Titan to take it down.|$|E
5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film <b>to</b> <b>video</b> (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E
