500|$|He {{began the}} 1981 season with five {{consecutive}} 100-yard games, including a 253-yard effort. [...] Woolfolk's best {{game as a}} Wolverine was the October 10, 1981 contest against Michigan State. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach Bo Schembechler said: [...] "I wondered what a kid like that would do if he ran as much as <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> the West Coast (Marcus Allen). I didn't plan on this, but he proved he can do it. Butch {{is going to be}} our all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're going to stop him now. And so be it." [...] His 1981 rushing performance against the Spartans still stands as the fifth best single-game performance by a Wolverine running back.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Matthew Weiner {{called the}} {{decision}} to write off Lane Pryce [...] "a terrible thing {{to have to deal}} with." [...] He added, [...] "You {{want to make sure that}} it's worth it, that they're going out with a bang and you're not sacrificing someone who's a great actor and a great musician in the orchestra. But also I feel like there have to be stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> the Texas tower [...] The randomness and the nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated the story. Lane's story I thought was about someone who has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out, he thought." ...|$|E
500|$|The Cosby Show {{is famous}} for rarely {{discussing}} political or controversial topics; it spends significantly more time openly addressing Clair's role as [...] "a woman who 'has it all'", maintaining a successful career while raising a family, than it does the race of its characters. The series seldom shies away from discussing gender equality. Despite never referring to herself as feminist within the show, Clair proudly embodies several feminist themes and beliefs, remaining, according to The Daily Dots Nico Lang, [...] "an outspoken advocate for equality in her household, fighting sexism while setting an example for her daughters." [...] From the sitcom's earliest stages, Cosby had always intended for Clair to reflect the ever-changing work and family dynamic, explaining, [...] "If this was 1964 ... my wife could do the cooking and I could be <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> <b>on</b> the sofa who just says, ‘Let your mother handle this.’ But today {{a lot of things}} have changed and I want the show to reflect those changes." [...] According to Rotten Tomatoes' Alex Vo, Clair represents [...] "the rapidly changing gender and household roles from the 1980s and onward." [...] MeTV agreed that Clair is [...] "the '80s response to the '50s housewife." [...] Although feminism was hardly a new concept to sitcoms by the time The Cosby Show premiered, feminist television characters remained scare during the early 1980s. The Huffington Posts Dr. Mlsee Harris observed that, during this time, [...] "The stereotypical role of the black woman on television ... had been that of a financially struggling, single woman with dysfunctional relationships, trying to get her life together with no distinct direction", stereotypes Clair worked to defy. Sarah Galo of Mic observed that Clair demonstrates that motherhood and having a career are not [...] "separate entities".|$|E
