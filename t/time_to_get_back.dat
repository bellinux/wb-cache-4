Determined to beat corporate, Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X-ray while Dwight stalls the game to give them <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back.</b> When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update, the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant. Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players.|$|E

All three were among the drivers attempting to make the top 24 for the day. Rahal was too slow to make the field, while de Silvestro managed to bump her way in. In the last 30 minutes, Townsend Bell made two attempts, the second of which bumped his way in. With time running out, Newgarden was bumped out by James Jakes. Newgarden ran out of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> in line to make an attempt, {{and would have to}} wait until Sunday to qualify.|$|E

Bad results continued in January, including a first round loss at the Australian Open to a resurging Timea Bacsinszky, she had never lost her opener in Melbourne prior to this.

500|$|In late 1942, Como {{made the}} {{decision}} to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. He returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade, tired of life on the road without his wife and young son. Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style. While Perry was negotiating for a store lease to re-open a barber shop, he received a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Ted Weems. Como fielded many other calls that also brought offers, but he liked and trusted Rockwell, who was offering him his own sustaining (non-sponsored) Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio show and offering to get him a recording contract. The offers were also appealing because it meant staying in New York with no more road tours. As Perry pondered the job offer, Roselle told him, [...] "You can always get another barber shop if it doesn't work out!" [...] Until the radio show and recording contract offers, he did not really view singing as his career, believing the years with Carlone and Weems had been enjoyable, but now it was <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to work. Como said in an 1983 interview, [...] "I thought I'd have my fun and I'd go home to work." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy's offer {{saying that the}} challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into practice on openings and endgames, and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks. Staunton competed in a tournament that started in on 22 August in Birmingham, {{but this was a}} knock-out tournament and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal, after playing a total of four games. This was to be Staunton's last public chess competition. H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess. Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. Just after the tournament a letter signed by [...] "Anti-book" [...] appeared in Staunton's column in The Illustrated London News, alleging that Morphy did not actually have the money for his share of the stakes. This letter is widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself; if so, he must have written it immediately after reading Walker's article and Morphy's letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham. Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the US asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match. Morphy's family refused to contribute as they [...] "should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else's", but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £500. Meanwhile, Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters. In September The Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton's conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy's open letter, omitting the reference to the [...] "Anti-book" [...] letter. Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to Lord Lyttelton, the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton's representation of the facts in The Illustrated London News, and demanding [...] "that you shall declare to the world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place." [...] Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.|$|E

Depression, anxiety. It's taken me a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> again. I was wobbling and...I'm still struggling with it." [...] She believes this was partly a result of almost every aspect of the album's making, including production, composition, mixing and recording, which she mostly worked on by herself, but also {{as a result of the}} album's themes, [...] "in which she delved into her own life to examine the links between extreme love and violent hatred."

Mortaza made his comeback from injury in a match for Bangladesh Cricket Board XI against England during their tour of Bangladesh. Following the match, he commented {{that he had no}} interest in regaining the captaincy as in his opinion Shakib Al Hasan had done a good job. He also said that if his injury problems persisted he would contemplate retiring from Test cricket to focus on ODIs and T20s, similar to fellow fast bowlers Shane Bond, Shaun Tait, Andrew Flintoff, and Brett Lee. Mortaza declined to play in the Test series to avoid aggravating his knee injury, but played only the first out of the three ODIs against England before withdrawing from Bangladesh's squad {{as he was about to}} be dropped. Bangladesh lost the one match Mortaza played in, and the captain criticised his bowling. Shakib Al Hasan said [...] "The way Mashrafe bowled before his injury, that Mashrafe we might have missed tonight. But the way he bowled in the last match and the practice match, not really.
