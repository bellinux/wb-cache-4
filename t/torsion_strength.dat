40|$|The {{definition}} of the yield domains within the limit analysis of 3 D dry-jointed masonry block structures requires experimental and analytical investigation on the frictional contact conditions. One of the aspects which still create some challenging analysis problems yet to be fully resolved {{is related to the}} modelling of the geometric contacts accounting for the interaction of normal and shear forces, torsion and bending moments. In particular, a great difference in torsion capacity can be found within the single contact surface when adopting the most used models, i. e. those based on the concave and convex contact formulations. In this paper a comparison between these two formulations for the yield domains of pure torsion and combined loadings is carried out in order to identify the most reliable assumptions on the contact model. For both formulations, the analytical model of two dry-stacked rigid blocks is adopted under the assumptions of infinite compressive strength for blocks and no-tension and frictional behaviour at their contact. The results are also compared with experimental outcomes and other analytical results existing in the literature and difference percentages are evaluated in terms of <b>torsion</b> <b>strengths.</b> Lastly, a simple criterion to correct the torsion capacity provided by the concavity model is proposed, together with its implication on each case of combined loadings, in order to achieve a better agreement with the experimental data and the convexity formulation...|$|R

A simple experiment {{for the evaluation of}} the torsional strength of reinforced concrete beams as a one of this {{structural elements}} is presented in this research. The objective of this experiments would be the role of transverse and longitudinal reinforcement on <b>torsion</b> <b>strength.</b> Four beam test samples has been tested with the same length and concrete mix design. Due to the fact, that the goal of this experiment is to determine the effect of reinforcement type on <b>torsion</b> <b>strength</b> of concrete beams; therefore, bars with different types in each beam have been applied. It was observed that the ductility factor increases with increasing percentage reinforcement from the test results. It should be also noted that transverse bars or longitudinal bars lonely would not able to increase the torsional strength of RC beams and both of them can be essential for having a good torsional behaviour in reinforced concrete beams. Introduction. The interest in gaining better understanding of the torsional behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) members has grown in the past decades. This {{may be due to the}} increasing use of structural members in which torsion is a central feature of behaviour such as curved bridge girders and helical slabs. The achievements, however, have not been as much as those made in the areas of shear and bending. Dealing with torsion in today's codes of practice is also very primitive and does not contain the more elaborate techniques. Predictions of current standards for the ultimate torsional capacity of RC beams are found to be either too conservative or slightly risky for certain geometry, dimensions and steel bar sizes and arrangements...|$|E

Eleven (11) structural materials under combined bending and torsion cyclic loading are examined. For each analysed material, the value of  angle is selected so that the value of the scatter, defined by a root-mean-square value, is minimum.
