Reološke lastnosti smo opazovali z meritvami indeksa tečenja (MFI - {{melt flow}} index), termične lastnosti smo proučevali z diferenčno dinamično kalorimetrijo (DSC - {{differential}} scanning calorimetry), s trgalnim preizkusom smo proučevali mehanske lastnosti. Nukleatorji so imeli večji vpliv na reološke lastnosti v primeru modifikacije PPC, na PPH je imel vpliv samo dodatek α/β - nukleatorja. Z dodatkom nukleatorjev k PPH in PPC smo opazili povišanje temperature kristalizacije. Prav tako smo v primeru modifikacije PPC povišali stopnjo kristaliničnosti. Pri PPH smo z dodatkom β - nukleatorja opazili padec kristaliničnosti. Temperaturni pik taljenja se je, zaradi promocije β - kristalitov, v primeru β - nukleatorja znižal, ostali vzorci so imeli pik v področju α - kristalitov. Vzorec PPHα 1 je povišal čas oksidativne razgradnje (OIT - oxidative induction time), vsi ostali opazovani vzorci so ga znižali. Rezultati kažejo na povišanje togosti modificiranega PPH (razen v primeru β - nukleatorja) ter modificiranega PPC in zmanjšanje natezne trdnosti na meji plastičnosti (razen v primeru β - nukleatorja) za oba modificirana PP. Opazili smo povezanost trdote s togostjoβ - nukleator je v PPH znižal togost in povišal trdoto. Pri modifikaciji PPC so vsi nukleatorji povišali trdoto. This master thesis studied {{the effect of}} α, β, and the combination of α/β - nucleators on rheological, thermal and mechanical properties of polypropylene homopolymer (PPH) and polypropylene copolymer (PPC). Rheological properties were monitored by measuring flow index (MFI - melt flow index), the thermal properties were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC - Differential Scanning Calorimetry), and with a <b>tear-off</b> <b>test,</b> the mechanical properties were studied. Nucleators had a greater influence on the rheological properties {{in the event of}} PPC modification. PPH was influenced only when the α/β – nucleator were added. With the addition of nucleators to the PPH and PPC, an increase in the temperature of crystallization was noticed. In the case of PPC modification we have also increased the degree of crystallinity. When we added the β - nucleator to the PPH a drop in crystallinity was noticed. Due to the promotion of β - crystal in the case of β – nucleator the temperature of melting peak was reduced, whereas the other samples had a peak in their area of the α - crystal. PPHα 1 sample increased the OIT - oxidative induction time, while all the other observed patterns reduced it. The results show an increase in the stiffness of modified PPH (except in the case of β - nucleator) and modified PPC along with the reduction of the tensile yield strength (except in the case of β - nucleator) for both modified PP. A connection between hardness and stiffness was noticedβ - nucleator reduced stiffness and increased hardness when added to the PPH. When modifying the PPC, all nucleators increased the hardness...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} is to analyse dependence of roughness of machined surface on adhesion performance of various anticorrosion systems. In order to prepare samples for the experiment, samples were milled on a knee and column type of a horizontal milling machine. Depending on cutting conditions and machining tool, there were set intervals of roughness of machined surface which are commonly achievable on this type of machine. It is a roughness in the interval of 0. 4 – 1. 6 µm (finishing), 1. 6 – 6. 3 µm (standard milling) a 6. 3 – 12. 5 µm (roughening). Removable cutting tips were used as a machining tool and for roughening, a shell end milling cutter NAREX 63 x 40 HSS 90 was used. Three types of anticorrosion systems were used in order to analyse the adhesion, that is a water-thinnable system Eternal, synthetic single layer coating Hostagrund and a duplex system, whose first layer is formed by dipped zinc and a top layer by a single-layer acrylate system Zinorex. Testing {{of the influence of}} surface roughness (anchoring system) on adhesion of the individual anticorrosion systems were processed in compliance with the norm ČSN EN ISO 4624, a tearing test. The main criterion of adhesion of anticorrosion system is defined as a power which needed for <b>tear-off</b> <b>testing</b> object stuck to a tested sample. This analysis was processed also during the corrosion test in the salt spray environment according to the norm ČSN EN ISO 9227. In order to better identify the adhesion of the individual anticorrosion systems, the analysis of undercorrosion according to the norm ISO 4628 - 8 was processed...|$|R
