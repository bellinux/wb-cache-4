Bourget, at that time a close friend of Huysmans as of Wilde, admired it greatly; Paul Valéry called it his 'Bible and his bedside book' and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> became for Wilde. He said to the Morning News: 'This last book of Huysmans {{is one of the best}} I have ever seen'. It was being reviewed everywhere as the guidebook of decadence. At the very moment that Wilde was falling in with social patterns, he was confronted with a book which even in its title defied them.|$|E

500|$|Like many {{contemporary}} alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa. Hüsker Dü's seminal album Zen Arcade demonstrated {{to the band}} how they could place gentler material against more aggressive fare, and Corgan made such shifts in dynamics central {{to the pursuit of}} his grand musical ambitions. Corgan said he liked the idea of creating his own alternative universe through sound that essentially tells the listener, [...] "Welcome to Pumpkin Land, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> sounds like on Planet Pumpkin." [...] This emphasis on atmosphere carried through to Adore (described as [...] "arcane night music" [...] in prerelease promotion) and the Machina albums (concept records that tell the story of a fictional rock band).|$|E

[...] TIME magazine's Richard Corliss wrote the film's [...] "noble intent is to implant one man's vision {{in the mind of}} a vast audience ...

2500|$|Mishnah ב - The {{time for}} reciting the morning Shema is {{referred}} to by [...] "when you arise" [...] (ובקומך), and this is when there is enough light to distinguish between blue (תכלת) and white wool. R'Eliezer says between blue and green wool, which would be at a slightly later time. R'Yehoshua says {{until the end of}} the first three hours of the day, because it was customary for kings to still be rising until then. The hours referred to are seasonal hours, which are defined by measuring from either the first light of dawn to nightfall or from sunrise to sunset (this is a famous argument) and dividing this into twelve equal parts. Halacha accords with R'Yehoshua and if one recites the Shema after the first three hours, it is as if he is reading from the Torah, which shows that reciting the Shema properly is even greater than reciting words of Torah. The ideal time to recite the Shema is shortly before sunrise so the Shemoneh Esrei can be started at exactly sunrise. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to join the redemption blessing to the Shemoneh Esrei.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Buffy was conceived by Joss Whedon {{as a way}} of subverting the cliché of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror film".

[...] When asked how he came up with the name of [...] "Buffy," [...] Whedon states [...] "It was the name that I could think of that I could take the least seriously. There is no way you could hear the name Buffy and think, [...] "This is an important person. To juxtapose that with Vampire Slayer, just felt like that kind of thinga B movie. But a B movie that had something more going on. That was my dream." [...] Whedon claims the title was criticized for being too silly, and the television network begged him to change it. He refused, insisting [...] "You don't understand. It has to be this. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is." [...] Jason Middleton feels that Buffy avoids the [...] "final girl" [...] character trope seen in horror films, where the androgynous and celibate heroine gets to outlive her friends and exact revenge on their killer; in Middleton's words, [...] "she... gets to have sex with boys and still kill the monster".|$|E

[...] Piers Martin of NME said, [...] "Busy yourself with those nappies, Madge – <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> really {{feels like to be}} a girl.

[...] People Magazine ranked it among the year's best albums, stating, [...] "Take that, Britney! Move over, J.Lo! With a new generation of dance-pop divas following in her fancy footsteps, the baby Jackson shows who is still in control with this all-encompassing album that bounces from hip-hop to rock to classical—even during the same song—without missing a funky beat." [...] Dennis Kelly of The Morning Call added, [...] "If imitators such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, et al., are quiet the next few months, it's because the Queen of Pop has sent them back to class with new material to study." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon exclaimed Jackson [...] "has turned into a more interesting figure than Madonna, and a maker of better music." [...] The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan announced Jackson to be the highest paid recording artist in history, signing a contract with Virgin Records in the mid of the 90's worth $90 million, and was declared to have surpassed the influence of Michael Jackson. MTV News also noted the album's first week sales nearly doubled those of Michael's Invincible, released later that year.|$|E
