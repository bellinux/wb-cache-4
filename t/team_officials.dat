5|$|Despite his {{offensive}} success in junior, Giordano went unselected at the NHL Entry Draft. He accepted {{an invitation to}} attend the Phoenix Coyotes' training camp where, according to then-Owen Sound General Manager Mike Futa, Giordano impressed <b>team</b> <b>officials</b> but believed {{that he would be}} best served by playing a second season in the OHL. Giordano finished the 2003–04 season with 49 points.|$|E
5|$|A {{turning point}} for Windle was the 1960 Australian Championships; he came second in the 1650yd {{freestyle}} behind John Konrads and was selected for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He {{dropped out of high}} school to attend a three-month training camp in Queensland with the Olympic swimming team. Windle did not swim in Rome; <b>team</b> <b>officials</b> merely wanted him to learn from the routine and atmosphere of Olympic swimming. On his return to Australia, he switched to the tutelage of Don Talbot, who also coached Konrads.|$|E

5|$|All 45 {{members of}} the Olympic Council of Asia that existed as of 2010 participated in the 2010 Asian Games. All National Olympic Committees were ordered to submit their entries before September 30, 2010. Organizers allowed each NOC to submit {{additional}} entries and injury replacements after the deadline. After the final registration deadline, some 9,704 athletes, {{as well as some}} 4,750 <b>team</b> <b>officials,</b> took part in the Games, an increase of 184 athletes from the previous Asian Games in Doha. According to the Games' official website, Kuwaiti athletes participated the Games under the Olympic flag because the Kuwait Olympic Committee was suspended due to political interference in January 2010.|$|E
5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and <b>team</b> <b>officials.</b> After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny would prove to be for naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E
5|$|As {{the riders}} entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast, the winds became more problematic. Around {{three-quarters of the}} peloton had been dropped or had {{withdrawn}} from the race {{by the time the}} riders turned back inland. Gert Steegmans (Trek Factory Racing) was blown sideways into a ditch; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits (Etixx-Quick Step) and Lars Bak (Lotto-Soudal) to withdraw from the race. Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders. The conditions were so severe that some <b>team</b> <b>officials</b> called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders' safety. Shortly afterwards, two large groups came back together. The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway. The breakaway was caught soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Massive {{flooding}} in the Midwest {{resulted in the}} Sounds and the Iowa Cubs played a game with an official attendance of zero on June 14, 2008. Though downtown Des Moines was under a mandatory evacuation, <b>team</b> <b>officials</b> received permission from the city {{to play the game}} as long as no fans were allowed into Principal Park. In order to keep fans away, the lights and scoreboard were not turned on, the game was not broadcast in the local market, and a message on the team's website announced that the game was postponed. PCL Commissioner Branch Rickey III believed that {{this was the first time}} such actions were taken out of necessity. Kremblas' Sounds ended with a 59–81record, the second-lowest in the team's history.|$|E
5|$|The Residential Zone {{specifically}} accommodated {{athletes and}} <b>team</b> <b>officials,</b> with 1,168 apartments in 34 residential towers. Each apartment had {{two to five}} bedrooms, giving 4,008 bedrooms in total; each bedroom accommodated two residents which differed from the traditional practice of providing athletes with a bedroom each. The entire zone itself was divided into four zones, styled after four unique folk art styles found in India as identified by a colour and an image: warli (red), gond (blue), madhubani (green) and sanjhi (purple). Nine Resident Centres, each serving hundreds of residents, were spaced across the residential towers, and they provided key services and facilities as well as entertainment. The Residential Zone also housed offices and services centres for the Commonwealth Games Associations, a polyclinic, religious services and casual dining facilities.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro {{proposed}} to hold all sporting events {{within the city}} limits—apart from the football (soccer) tournaments which would {{be held in the}} cities of Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Salvador and São Paulo—making the Games more compact and technically feasible. The competition venues will be located in four Olympic zones—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã—and divided in seven Olympic clusters—Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, Flamengo, João Havelange, Lagoa and Maracanã—with four Olympic precincts—Maracanã, Olympic Park, Riocentro and X Park. The Olympic and Paralympic Village, the International Broadcast Centre (IBC) and the Main Press Centre (MPC) will be located at the Barra zone, which is the core of the project and includes the largest number of competition venues. A television tower will be built at the IBC/MPC complex to complement broadcasting operations and provide panoramic studios. There will be a media-exclusive hotel within the complex, accessible directly from the IBC/MPC. The Olympic and Paralympic Village complex will include an Olympic Village Training Center, an Olympic Village Park, an Olympic Beach and direct access to the Olympic Park, in addition to the 8,856 rooms to accommodate over 17,770 athletes and <b>team</b> <b>officials,</b> including accredited additional officials.|$|E

25|$|Umpires, players, <b>team</b> <b>officials,</b> {{trainers}} and police {{did their best}} to clear a pathway for Collins to take his kick, and after several minutes, they did succeed temporarily; however, Pilgrim did not allow Collins to take his kick at this time because he was not on the correct line with the goal. The crowd again converged on Collins before he could correct his line, and the opportunity was lost. By this stage, the pitch invasion was riotous, with many punches thrown, and umpires, players, <b>team</b> <b>officials,</b> and police were now tasked with restoring order, particularly after Collins' teammate Barry Styles was knocked to the ground and trampled; he was left unconscious with broken fingers and had to be carried from the field on a stretcher.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Ritchie caused {{controversy}} over racist and Islamophobic comments at a luncheon during the First Test between Australia and South Africa at the Adelaide Oval; after South African <b>team</b> <b>officials</b> complained (the team contained four Muslim and two black African players), Richie was effectively banned by Cricket Australia from functions {{for the rest}} of the 2012-13 season.|$|E

Since neither of the two had been declared fit they had not undergone official doping tests.|$|E
25|$|Owens won {{easily in}} the long jump, only taking two attempts; {{he was the only}} athlete to qualify in three events. Bob Clark, who also {{qualified}} in the decathlon, considered giving his place on the long jump squad to fourth-placer Kermit King; <b>team</b> <b>officials,</b> however, disallowed that. In the triple jump all of the top three came from Louisiana; AAU champion Brown, a 17-year-old high schooler, was the youngest athlete to qualify for the men's team.|$|E
25|$|After several failed {{attempts}} at developing an official team-owned mascot, the Vikings finally introduced Viktor the Viking during the 2007 Vikings' season. <b>Team</b> <b>officials</b> had long {{indicated that they}} were after a mascot concept that would primarily appeal to the team's younger fan base. Viktor the Viking, a muscle-bound, blond-haired and mustachioed character, wears a Vikings' #1 jersey and an oversized Vikings helmet with protruding horns and a small yellow nose guard. Due to contract disputes in 2015, the team lost its mascot Ragnar the Viking and still is without him for the 2017 season.|$|E

25|$|Garrincha {{was already}} married and a parent {{when he signed}} for Botafogo in 1953. <b>Team</b> <b>officials</b> were ecstatic to learn that he was over 18 and able {{to be treated as}} a professional. In his first {{training}} session, he demonstrated his extraordinary skills by dribbling the ball through the legs of Nílton Santos, a Brazilian international defender and defensive midfielder with 16 international caps, who then requested himself for Garrincha to be hired for Brazil. He played in a 5–0 win for Botafogo's reserves and then scored a hat trick on his first-team début against Bonsucesso on July 19, 1953.|$|E
25|$|Following his 2011–12 season, {{in which}} he made his {{professional}} debut, {{it was expected that}} Jensen would be named to the Danish national team for the 2012 IIHF World Championship, but he had sustained a concussion during the 2012 AHL playoffs, which may have dissuaded the Danish <b>team</b> <b>officials</b> from selecting him. Jensen would make his debut at the World Championships in 2013, when he was added to Denmark's roster following the elimination of the Vancouver Canucks from the Stanley Cup playoffs. Jensen recorded two goals in three games at the tournament as Denmark finished in 12th place.|$|E
25|$|However, the Phone Pals {{suffered}} three succeeding losses, prompting <b>team</b> <b>officials</b> to land Ren-Ren Ritualo from Air21 for Leo Avenido and {{a future}} first round draft pick, Don Allado from Alaska for Willie Miller, John Ferriols and a future first round pick on May 8. The move saw the Phone Pals {{as a potential}} title contender with the squad boasting a group of star players from their past teams along with Taulava, Alapag, Cardona and Carey. Even with a strong lineup, the trade put the Phone Pals in a deeper hole, losing three more games before a win against Coca-Cola gave them a disappointing 6–10 card.|$|E
