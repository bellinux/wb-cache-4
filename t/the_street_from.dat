5|$|Atlético had {{its first}} home ground built in 1912 at Paraopeba Avenue, in {{downtown}} Belo Horizonte, across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> América's first stadium. The club's main ground {{for most of}} its early years, however, was the Presidente Antônio Carlos stadium, which held 5,000 people; it was nicknamed Estádio de Lourdes for the quarter in which it was located. The Antônio Carlos {{was one of the first}} stadiums in Brazil to feature floodlights, and opened on 30 May 1929 with a friendly against Corinthians, won by Atlético 4–2.

After decades of legal disputes with the municipal government, the property returned to the club in 1991.
