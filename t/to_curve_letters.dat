50|$|In typography, the {{x-height}} or corpus size {{refers to}} {{the distance between the}} baseline and the mean line of lower-case letters in a typeface. Typically, this is the height of the letter x in the font (the source of the term), as well as the v, w, and z. (<b>Curved</b> <b>letters</b> such as a, c, e, m, n, o, r, s, and u tend to exceed the x-height slightly, due to overshoot.) One of the most important dimensions of a font, x-height is used to define how high lower-case letters are compared to upper-case letters.|$|R
50|$|From 1980, Ruscha {{started using}} an all-caps {{typeface}} {{of his own}} invention named ”Boy Scout Utility Modern” in which <b>curved</b> <b>letter</b> forms are squared-off (as in the Hollywood Sign) This simple font which is radically different from the style he used in works such as Honk (1962). Beginning in the mid-1980s, in many of his paintings black or white ‘blanks’ or ‘censor strips’ are included, to suggest where the ‘missing’ words would have been placed. The ‘blanks’ would also feature in his series of Silhouette, Cityscapes or ‘censored’ word works, often made in bleach on canvas, rayon or linen.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{when you}} are {{satisfied}} with {{the shape of the}} letter, draw pen and ink lines firmly round the tint, as at d, and remove any touches outside the limit, first with the India-rubber, and then with the penknife, so that all may look clear and right. If you rub out any of the pencil inside the outline of the letter, retouch it, closing it up to the inked line. The straight lines of the outline are all to be ruled,[203] but the <b>curved</b> lines are <b>to</b> be drawn by the eye and hand; and you will soon find what good practice there is in getting the <b>curved</b> <b>letters,</b> such as Bs, Cs, &c., to stand quite straight, and come into accurate form.|$|R
50|$|Within these {{limitations}} Julia transformed the 1852 Seal {{much as the}} College itself had altered. The earlier seal displayed a solitary Tappan Hall set on newly cleared land being cultivated. In Julia's new version the respected Hall was surrounded by trees, while across the road (symbolizing an established community), {{there is evidence of}} a bountiful harvest. She designed the motto and college name in <b>curved</b> <b>letters</b> with sharp edges that cast strong deep shadows. The design was so well received that the trustees decided to adopt it as the Official Seal. Julia also made a reduced version that is still in use today. Other copies of the Wilder decoration were made, including one of bronze displayed in the president’s office.|$|R

We {{describe}} an algorithm that determines {{a set of}} unramified covers of a given hyperelliptic curve, with the property that any rational point will lift {{to one of the}} covers. In particular, if the algorithm returns an empty set, then the hyperelliptic curve has no rational points. This provides a relatively efficiently tested criterion for solvability of hyperelliptic curves. We also discuss applications of this algorithm <b>to</b> <b>curves</b> of genus 1 and <b>to</b> <b>curves</b> with rational points. 1...|$|R
