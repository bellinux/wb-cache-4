40|$|ObjectivePoor {{growth has}} been {{described}} in infants with a single ventricle; however, little is known regarding its effect on surgical outcomes. We sought to assess the effect of nutritional status {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> bidirectional <b>Glenn</b> procedure on short-term outcomes. MethodsWe performed a retrospective case series of children who underwent <b>the</b> bidirectional <b>Glenn</b> procedure at our institution between January 2001 and December 2007. Anthropometric measurements were recorded at the time of neonatal admission and <b>the</b> bidirectional <b>Glenn</b> procedure. Data from preoperative echocardiograms and cardiac catheterization were recorded. The primary outcome variable was length of hospital stay. ResultsData on 100 infants were included for analysis. Age at the time of <b>the</b> bidirectional <b>Glenn</b> procedure was 5. 1 months (range, 2. 4 – 10 months). The median weight-for-age z score at birth was − 0. 4 (range, − 2. 6 to 3. 2), and by the time of <b>the</b> bidirectional <b>Glenn</b> procedure, it had decreased to − 1. 3 (range, − 3. 9 to 0. 6). In multivariable modeling longer postoperative hospital stays were predicted by lower weight-for-age z score (P =. 02), younger age (P <. 001), being fed through a gastrostomy tube (P =. 01), and undergoing concomitant aortic arch reconstruction (P <. 001) at the time of <b>the</b> bidirectional <b>Glenn</b> procedure. ConclusionsThere is suboptimal weight gain between neonatal discharge and <b>the</b> bidirectional <b>Glenn</b> procedure. A lower weight-for-age z score and younger age at the time of <b>the</b> bidirectional <b>Glenn</b> procedure affects length of hospital stay independent of hemodynamic or echocardiographic variables...|$|R

5|$|On April 25, 1979, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} who worked at the Argonne National Laboratory wrote to Senator John Glenn, the Chairman of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Federal Services.

5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. {{was born}} on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a {{plumbing}} firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, <b>the</b> <b>Glenn</b> Plumbing Company. He was only a toddler when he met Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor, who would later become his wife. The two {{would not be able to}} recall a time when they did not know each other. He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from balsa wood kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold rhubarb to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. He was a member of the Ohio Rangers, an organisation similar to the Cub Scouts; Annie was a girl scout. His boyhood home in New Concord has been restored as a historic house museum and education center.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1936, the United States {{had made}} it known that it would follow a policy of non-intervention, but did not {{announce}} it officially. This isolationism on the Spanish war would later be identified as disastrous by Under-Secretary of State Sumner Welles. Five days later, <b>the</b> <b>Glenn</b> L. Martin Company enquired whether the government would allow the sale of eight bombers to the Spanish Republican Air Force; the response was negative. It also confirmed it would not take part in several mediation attempts, including one by the Organization of American States. Mexico soon became the first nation to openly support the Republicans. On 15 August, the United Kingdom banned exports of war material to Spain. Neurath also agreed to the pact, and suggested that volunteers (many of whom would eventually form the International Brigades) be included. Italy similarly agreed, signing on 21 August after a determined diplomatic offensive by Britain and France. Although a surprising reversal of views, it has been put down to the growing belief that countries could not abide by the agreement anyway. Admiral Raeder urged the German government either to back the Nationalists more completely, and bring Europe {{to the brink of}} war, or to abandon them. On the 24th, Germany signed.|$|E
