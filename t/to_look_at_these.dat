In 1264 he was asked to go to Gansu to repair the damage that had been caused to the irrigation systems by the years of war during the Mongol advance through the region.

2500|$|According to Oxford University Press, the {{inequality}} {{toward women}} is “endorsed within cultures and entrenched within institutions [...] hold power to reproduce that inequality”. There are various gendered barriers in social networks that prevent women from working in male-dominated fields and top management jobs. Social networks {{are based on}} the cultural beliefs such as schemas and stereotypes. According to social psychology studies, top management jobs {{are more likely to have}} incumbent schemas that favor “an achievement-oriented aggressiveness and emotional toughness that is distinctly male in character”. Certain gender stereotypes assume women to be less worthy and less competent than men so they are not qualified for the top management jobs. However, when the women try to prove their competence and power, they often face obstacles. They are likely to be seen as dislikable and untrustworthy when they are excelled at tasks viewed as masculine. Also, women are likely to face the denial of credit for their achievements. Social networks and gender stereotypes provide many contributions to the injustices that women have to face in their workplace and the limitations when they try to advance in male-dominated jobs and top management jobs. Women in professions like science, technology, and other related industries are likely to encounter the gendered barriers in their careers. Based on the meritocratic explanations of gendered inequality, “as long as the people accept the mechanisms that produce unequal outcomes,” all the outcomes will be legitimated in the society. When women try to deny the stereotypes and the discriminations by becoming “competent, integrated, well-liked”, the society is more likely <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> impressions as selfishness or “being a whiner”. In the United States, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 provides opportunities for women to achieve to a wide range of education programs and activities by prohibiting sex discrimination. The law states “No person in the United Stated shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance”.|$|E

By <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> music-making as a ritual liturgical symbol of faith, I explain the meaning of liturgical music practice and its function in teaching the fundamentals of faith. Drawing upon the fields of ethnomusicology, theology, and ritual studies, I explore the theoretical orientations and methodological strategies that assist {{in the interpretation of}} music in ritual contexts. By examining various theories of symbol and ritual combined with fieldwork, I interpret Armenian Apostolic liturgical music using a theoretical methodology that investigates the operation of liturgical music within ritual contexts. Because “faith ” is not empirically observable, I focus on “the conception of faith ” as it is performed by participants in the Divine Liturgy. In addition <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> aspects, I also extend my search past that of the “official ” Christian Armenian community by asking what purpose the Armenian Apostolic Church serves in the community as a whole, even amongst non-Christians or non-practicing Armenian Christians.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years, discussions on human {{trafficking}} and sexual exploitation have come along way. These discussions have {{given birth to}} a new understanding of vulnerability and resiliency among various cultural and social economic groups. However, research on sexual exploitation in Southeast Asia has predominantly focused on the plight of women and girls and work with such groups remains a central concern among NGOs and Anti-trafficking organizations.

The sample for the present research was gathered by analysing Labour Review Reports that was accessed through the University of the Witwatersrand Library. A sample of 100 case reports was gathered in order to make accurate inferences from the sample about the target population. A Chi-Square test of association was conducted on the data gathered.
