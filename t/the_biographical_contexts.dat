40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the contexts of teaching of four beginning teachers and of the ways of knowing, derived through lived experience, that enabled their interactions within these contexts during {{the first two years of}} their careers in New South Wales primary schools. Within this thesis there is a particular focus on the beginning teachers' interactions with parents as one of the multiple dimensions of context. Educational reform has advocated the participation of parents and the community in the school. Accordingly, recently devised competency frameworks of teaching have included expectations that the graduate will have developed an ability to work with parents and, as a beginning teacher, be able to develop close partnerships between home and school. These expectations of policy have become an element of the structural context of teaching, but the practice of the beginning teachers us also shaped by elements of the sociocultural and historical contexts of the school and class and by <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>contexts</b> of the teacher, the learners and their parents. The development of the knowledge and skills that support participation is limited within initial teacher education programs. The expectations found within a framework of teaching competencies provides a statement of the theory of teaching, representing a technical knowledge base for the profession. Its application in context becomes the practical knowledge base. Here, communicative and critical knowledge based on lived experience come to supplement the technical foundations in shaping the practical work of a teacher in a particular context. Lived experience therefore provides the vehicle for the construction of ways of knowing that inform the practical work, language and power of each beginning teacher...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based upon life history and focus group {{interviews}} on the health beliefs of 26 older adults from Hull and surrounding areas. The research rationale is twofold. First, the area is relatively neglected. Second, it is posited that, whilst existing research reflects the idea that beliefs are constituted {{in the context of}} the relationship between the individual and society, its scope to explore issues of human agency is limited. The analytical framework adopted in this study is presented as a contribution towards redressing this imbalance by adopting a life course approach, thus helping to transcend the notion that agency and structure are separable. Interviewee agency is revealed in the way many draw upon a range of competing texts and narratives, much like books in a library, within biographical context, as competent social actors to create their own explanatory frameworks. The main finding is that imagined community (Anderson 1983) is the most common vocabulary of motive (Mills 1940) in the constitution of beliefs. Motivation, it is argued, is more a product of individuals drawing upon repertories of explanations in popular values and beliefs, rather than something which is innate and set apart from the social world. The motive of community appears most significant because beliefs tended to reflect a sense of an essential and moral self and a strong orientation towards reciprocal social relationships. The motive of community is, in large part, considered as imagined because it was often not possible to interact with other community members who included dead relatives, friends, famous and powerful people, and fictional characters from literature and TV. It is concluded that as well as reflecting <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>contexts</b> of interviewees, imagined community is made necessary by a society which subordinates. and excludes older adults...|$|E

The Einsteinturm, the climax of his Expressionist period, is the point of departure for his subsequent buildings. The influence of the Neue Sachlichkeit and the importance of Richard Neutra are shown to be instrumental in Mendelsohn's metamorphosis.

The latter is the bulk of this study and emphasizes the relevance of the notion of the self and of the individuation process. All this provides the background for an exploration of the positive aspect of the unconscious. Doing so is necessary to put in a new light the experience of Job, and thus the suffering of the righteous or the innocent. The conclusion widens the issue concerning the reality of evil and suffering in its relation to the divine according to Jung, and it suggests some possible research topics for further examination...|$|R

40|$|Near-death {{experiences}} (NDEs) {{have become}} a topic of increasing interest to medical and psychological researchers over the last 35 years.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the experience of having an NDE and what meaning NDErs attribute to that experience and its resultant after-effects by taking an idiographic, phenomenological approach. Three female participants took part in recorded face-to-face, semi-structured interviews. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) found that to more deeply understand the impact of NDEs it is crucial to consider how the experience fits within <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> of an individual’s life.

In addition, the process of integration was helped or hindered by physical and psychological factors concomitant at the time of the NDE.

40|$|Pain first {{emerged as}} an area of {{clinical}} specialisation in the 1950 s, but more recently has attracted wider interest from social scientists and clinicians who seek to expand its understanding to incorporate ideas about meaning, embodiment and culture. So far {{there have been few}} empirical studies which focus on how ideas and practices about pain are changing in modern healthcare. This paper addresses these issues through a specific case study of the early writings of Cicely Saunders in the period 1958 – 1967. A professional training in the three disciplines of nursing, social work and medicine, coupled with a strong personal religious faith, provided <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> for <b>the</b> development of Cicely Saunders' concern with pain. Through these influences we find in her work with dying patients an emphasis on pain as a key which unlocks other problems and as something which requires multiple interventions for its resolution. From here the concept of `total pain' is formulated, to include physical, psychological, social, emotional and spiritual elements. This concept, which proved so important to the development of hospice clinical practice, is shown to have paradoxical and conflicting implications. Adopting current ideas about the social theory of the body, `total pain' may be formulated either as a nomenclature of inscription, or as a nomenclature of facilitation. It is suggested that both of these may be at work in the discourse of `total pain' and that an appreciation of each enhances our understanding of the concept...|$|R
40|$|Between 1915 and 1929 J. C. Powys wrote five novels, Wood and Stone, Rodmoor, After My Fashion, Ducdame, and Wolf Solent, and two {{unpublished}} plays, Paddock Calls and a dramatisation of Dostoievsky's The Idiot. To each {{of these}} seven works a single chapter is devoted. In addition, three short chapters fill in biographical details and bridge chronological gaps; their subjects are Powys' unpublished writings, {{his work as a}} dramatist, and his contacts with modernism. The latter chapter provides <b>biographical</b> support for <b>the</b> main critical contention of the thesis, Powys' central place in twentieth-century literature. Bach chapter describes <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> in which <b>the</b> novel or play was written, before proceeding with a textual analysis. The critical aim is to demonstrate Powys' technique, his consciousness of aesthetic and formal questions, and his style. Powys' ideas and beliefs are discussed only with reference to his style and form of expression. The broad development from Wood and Stone to Wolf Solent is seen and analysed in terms of an increasing sophistication of technique. Particular stress is laid on Powys' treatment of his protagonist's self-consciousness, culminating in the formal solution of Wolf Solent. As literary history, apart from placing Powys among contemporaries such as Joyce, Pound, Mann, Faulkner and Dreiser, the thesis shows the influence on Powys of Henry James, Turgenev, Hardy and others. The most important and most widely recognised influence, of Dostoievsky, is examined from critical and biographical angles. Incidentally to its main purpose, the thesis provides <b>the</b> most detailed <b>biographical</b> record, to date, of Powys' life in these years.

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} case for viewing Asceses (1967) for solo flute/clarinet as a paradigmatic work in the compositional output of Andre Jolivet, reflective of his aesthetic and philosophical ideals as they had developed by the 1960 s. As such, the work serves as a touchstone for {{a deeper understanding of}} the aesthetic and philosophical stance from which Jolivet was working during the last decade of his life. Many aspects of Asceses suggest this interpretation of the work. The piece bears many striking similarities to one of Jolivet's self-identified paradigmatic works of the 1930 s, the Cinq Incantations for solo flute. In addition, the unaccompanied monophonic medium is one in which Jolivet did not work for thirty years, making his return to it in the 1960 s particularly striking. The document positions Asceses within <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> of <b>the</b> final fifteen years of Jolivet's life and suggests that Jolivet's activities of this time in his life and career support a reading of Asceses as a defining composition. The document also thoroughly explores the state of Jolivet's aesthetics and philosophy by the 1960 s, presenting a unified model of Jolivet's philosophy from which Asceses can be seen to have sprung, and suggesting ways in which Asceses reveals the strength of certain later influences on Jolivet's thought. The extra-musical materials of the work are considered for the ways in which they confirm and expand the understanding of Jolivet's worldview as presented. The document concludes with a detailed consideration of the ways in which Jolivet translates his late aesthetic ideals into compositional practice, and the ways in which Asceses reflects, at a deep structural level, the most important of them...|$|R

40|$|Background : The {{decision}} about whether {{to start a family}} within a partnership {{can be viewed as a}} result of an interaction process. The influence of each of the partners in a couple differs depending on their individual preferences and intentions towards having children. Both of the partners additionally influence each other's fertility intentions and preferences. Objective : We specify, estimate, and test a model that examines the {{decision about}} whether to have a child as a choice that is made jointly by the two partners. The transition to the birth of a (further) child is investigated with the explicit consideration of both the female partner and the male partner in the partnership context. Methods : An approach for modelling the interactive influences of the two actors in the decision-making process was proposed. A trivariate distribution consisting of both the female and the male partners' fertility intentions, as well as the joint generative decision, was modelled. A multivariate non-linear probit model was chosen and the problem of identification in estimating the relative effects of the actors was resolved. These parameters were used to assess the relative importance of each of the partners' intentions in the decision. We carried out the analysis with MPLUS. Data from the panel of intimate relationships and family dynamics (pairfam) was used to estimate the model. Results : <b>The</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> of each of the partners in relation to their own as well as to their partner's fertility intentions was found to be of considerable importance. Of the significant individual and partner effects, the male partner was shown to have the greater influence.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a biographical study of John of Brienne, king of Jerusalem and later Latin emperor of Constantinople (d. 1237). John’s {{extraordinary}} career is touched on by many commentators {{concerned with the}} crusades and the Latin East in the early thirteenth century, {{but it has not}} been properly re-assessed for more than seventy years. A comprehensive re-examination opens up new angles on the political structures and social landscapes that produced it. John’s career illustrates some residual strengths of the Jerusalemite monarchy just {{before the start of the}} Hohenstaufen epoch. It also sheds light on a period in the history of the Latin empire all too easily regarded as largely a void. But within <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context,</b> <b>the</b> thesis’s focus is more on the complex interplay between the Latin West and East in the early thirteenth century. A principal theme in this regard is the mobility, in geographical and politico-hierarchical terms, of a specific echelon of the high aristocracy in early thirteenth-century Europe, building on Bartlett’s conception of the contemporaneous western European ‘aristocratic diaspora’. Aristocrats who are ‘not quite first rank’ can be discerned on the make in regions, both west and east, distant from their original homelands. Much of the significance of that lies in the context, the variety of opportunities, and also the limitations on such figures. Whilst this thesis dwells on John’s experience of patronage and dependency, it also identifies grounds for tensions in his ‘new’ environments, as well as highlighting the opportunities and pitfalls presented by ‘dynastic interstices’. In this way, the thesis unpacks many of the ‘more normal’ features of the aristocratic diaspora out of John’s exceptional career. The thesis links together the thematic material to focus, in particular, on the interactions between various Western great powers and John as a client figure.

40|$|Persons {{from the}} former USSR {{constitute}} {{a significant proportion of}} the migrant population in contemporary Germany. Current research on their health is scarce and carried out from a medical perspective, mostly focusing on health outcomes and patterns of healthcare utilisation. In contrast, this thesis is based on a sociological approach to health as a phenomenon embedded in a complex system of social stratification and cultural traditions. The research question of this thesis is about the relationship of identity to health beliefs and help-seeking practices, and they ways migration transforms ways people think of themselves and their health. To answer this question, qualitative research needs to establish migrants' own interpretations of health and illness in <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context.</b> Setting out to identify and explain a variety of native conceptualisations of health, this thesis, on the one hand, seeks to establish differences between migrant and non-migrant population, and, on the other hand, to reflect on heterogeneity of health beliefs and help-seeking behaviours across different sub-groups of former Soviet citizens in Germany. In order to pursue these research objectives, comparative qualitative research design was employed, whereby different groups of migrant population were compared with each other and contrasted to native Germans. The empirical fieldwork was carried out in Berlin in 2009 - 2010, and included 35 semi-structured interviews (of which 8 were carried out with experts). This thesis suggests that health beliefs and help-seeking practices of migrants {{from the former}} USSR in Germany are highly heterogeneous. Attitudes to health make up components of diverse identities acquired in the sending country and that are transformed throughout the migratory processes. First, these findings argue against generalisations about 'fatalistic' health beliefs resulting from communist ideology, a stereotype appearing in some Western literatures. Second, this thesis draws attention to the effects of socialisation in the sending country on conceptualisations of health in the country of immigration, suggesting prospects for research in future migrant generations. And third, it demonstrates that folk conceptualisations of health are hugely heterogeneous, and diverge greatly from medical views of health as an absence of illness...|$|R
40|$|This article inscribes {{itself into}} the {{intellectual}} tradition of anthropology as literature. It offers a critical view {{on one of the}} iconic (albeit also problematic) texts of the discipline, Tristes tropiques by Claude Lévi-Strauss. My aim is to broaden the frame of reference of the analysis to make it more cosmopolitan, more biographical, and more historical. I offer here the results of the re-reading of the text "with my Polish eyes". In accordance with the methodological principles of anthropology of art, I was interested not just in the work itself, but also in its author and reception. Firstly, I situate Tristes tropiques in the broader context of, what I call, ethnographic prose. This enables me to show the working of disciplining practices of academia (following Michel Foucault), which kept literary writings of anthropologists outside the profession. Authors themselves were aware that they wrote them with the "other hand" than regular monographs. These observations are confirmed by <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> of <b>the</b> origin of Tristes tropiques. Another contribution of my paper consists in analysing (applying James Clifford's categories) the way the author presents himself in his text. I am showing that he describes himself consistently as an anthropologist, not only rhetorically but also on a deeper level of his professional habitus. The third part of my paper gives the results of my research concerning the reception of Tristes tropiques and its hero. I show how the book was received by the French public and anthropological community, as well as a reaction to it in Brazil, where the author’s journeys took place, and in Poland {{at the time of the}} post-Stalinist “thaw”, where the book was published for the first time in the Soviet bloc. The reception of the work in various places and times shows how differentiated the process of reading is. In the conclusion I put these interpretations in the historical context and suggest reasons for the unwavering popularity of Tristes tropiques. Its greatness is that, in addition to criticism, it inspires profound reflection and broader interpretation of the modern world...|$|R
40|$|This thesis focusses on the {{literary}} self-reflexivity of Birthday Letters, Ted Hughes's collection of poems addressed to his long-dead first wife, poet Sylvia Plath. By {{close attention to}} the language of select poems and a discussion of cross-referencing images and allusions across the volume, and intertextually, I argue that the collection is more self-consciously ordered and designed than <b>the</b> mainly <b>biographical</b> criticism <b>the</b> work has met with suggests. The thesis focusses on the poets' art rather than <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> of Birthday Letters, though it does not draw a neat distinction between their lives and their poetry - rather it demonstrates how Birthday Letters itself treats the relationship of art to life thematically. The introduction outlines the context of the volume's genesis and publication and the notions of poetry, myth and drama out of which Hughes works, and introduces the central metaphor of metamorphosis as figured in Ariel's song "Full Fathom Five" from The Tempest, as well as the importance of that play to Plath. Each of the chapters that follow focusses on a cluster of inter-related imagery through a discussion of four or five key poems. Chapter One examines Hughes's portrayal of himself as imprisoned by Plath's poetic portraits, and relates this to the recurring motifs of the snapshot and the Medusa myth. The poems discussed emphasize Hughes's consciousness of the metamorphic and "magical" relationship of art to life. The second chapter discusses Hughes's use of the myth of the labyrinth and the Minotaur, tracing it back to Plath's writings and reading, and pointing out its self-reflexivity: the labyrinth figures Hughes's own loss as well as the labyrinthine nature of writing. The third chapter considers the themes of possession and loss, and how they attach themselves to images of houses and jewels. Possession and loss tum, self-reflexively, upon issues of inheritance and remembrance, notably Hughes's inheritance of Plath's poetic legacy, and his remembrance of her and her poetry through his own poetry. The conclusion pursues connections between the observations made in the separate chapters, outlining the larger context out of which the poems emerge, and returning to the trope of metamorphosis as figured in "Full Fathom Five"...|$|R
30|$|In {{the light}} of the {{findings}} that young beneficiaries are not generally at risk to develop dependency in the limited period of observation but process the experience of repeated and long-term unemployment in different ways, it keeps an open empirical question under which conditions young people’s failure in training or job entry affects their labour supply and further transitions to financial independence. The study cannot give evidence in particular to whether recipients develop dependence in the very long run if they fail to establish in stable employment as young adults. Further theoretical discussion and research on benefits receipt will have {{to address the issue of}} how individual orientations develop and affect transitions to financial independence. Qualitative case studies have already shown that the risk of marginalisation among young beneficiaries in insecure school-to-work transitions is dependent on their interpretation of <b>the</b> given <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> and their resources for coping (Drilling 2004; Leisering and Leibfried 1999; Ludwig 1996). Subsequently, following the perspective that financial hardship might not only be a transitory experience, empirical efforts will have to investigate in the processes of poverty and benefits receipt during the status passage from youth to mid-adulthood based on further longitudinal data.|$|R

40|$|People's lived {{experiences}} of chronic illness have garnered increasing research interest {{over the last}} 30 – 40 years, with studies recognising the disruptive influence of illness onset and progression, both to people's everyday lives and to their biographical selves. We extend this body of work, drawing on the experiences of people living with Ménière's disease; a long-term progressive vestibular disorder characterised by unpredictable episodes of debilitating vertigo, tinnitus and permanent sensorineural hearing loss. In response to calls for more critical examination of <b>the</b> wider <b>biographical</b> <b>contexts</b> in which chronic illnesses are encountered, we draw on 28 in-depth narrative interviews with Ménière's patients and their family members to discuss how personal chronic illness experiences may be closely entwined with, and deeply shaped by, the life transitions (illness-related and otherwise) of ‘linked others’. Interviews were conducted in south west England from January to June 2015. Focusing on intersecting transitions of parenthood, caregiving and retirement, we explore how and why familial relationships can both facilitate and hinder adaptation to a lifetime of chronically disrupted normalities, contributing to fluctuating experiences of ‘cherished time’, ‘anomalous time’ and ‘turbulent time’. In so doing, we suggest that the onset and progression of chronic illness could usefully be re-conceptualised as one of many ‘biographical oscillations’ encountered during the life course that serve to re-route us between continually shifting life trajectories. In recognising life's dynamism and challenging the identity-limiting and self-damaging nature of entrenched cultural life course constructions, we suggest value in recognising alternative ways of ‘living well’ when negotiating <b>the</b> wide-ranging <b>biographical</b> maps that life can follow...|$|R
40|$|Treballs Finals del Grau d'Estudis Anglesos, Facultat de Filologia, Universitat de Barcelona, Curs: 2016 - 2017, Tutora: Clara Escoda Agustí[eng] This {{dissertation}} aims {{to analyse}} the poems of Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton which {{are related to}} death, {{with a view to}} linking the poet’s biography to their poems and comparing the male and female attitudes to death. First of all, this study will contextualise different approaches to death that have taken place throughout the history of the West. Then, each poet or poetess will be given <b>the</b> <b>biographical</b> <b>context</b> necessary to read the poems regarding death. The poems of Whitman and Dickinson will be analysed in order to see to what extent they reflect the presence of the dead amongst the living. In addition to this, Plath’s and Sexton’s poems will also be analysed from the same perspective and starting on the basis that they both committed suicide. At this point, the study will seek to demonstrate if there are any relevant differences considering the fact of dying between the feminine and the masculine perspectives. Previous studies have not taken the poet’s biography into consideration and have not focused on specific authors, which is what this study intends to do. [cat] L'objectiu d'aquest estudi és analitzar els poemes de Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath i Anne Sexton relacionats amb la mort, tractant de connectar els seus poemes amb la biografia dels poetes i comparar, també, la perspectiva masculina i femenina sobre la mort. En primer lloc, aquest estudi contextualitzarà les visions que s'han donat de la mort al llarg de la història d'occident. A continuació, s'oferirà el context biogràfic necessari de cada poeta o poetessa per tal d'entendre els poemes que tracten la mort. Els poemes de Whitman i Dickinson s'analitzaran per tal de veure fins a quin punt reflecteixen la presència dels morts entre els vius. A més, els poemes de Plath i de Sexton s'analitzaran de la mateixa manera i també partint de la base que ambdues van suïcidar-se. En aquest punt, l'estudi pretén mostrar si hi ha cap diferència rellevant considerant la mort entre la perspectiva masculina i la femenina. Altres estudis previs no varen tenir en compte la biografia de l'autor i tampoc van centrar-se en autors específics, que és el què aquest estudi pretén fer...|$|R
