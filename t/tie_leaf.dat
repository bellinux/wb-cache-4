40|$|Abstract. 1. Secondary {{colonization}} of leaf shelters constructed by caterpillars {{has been reported}} {{from a number of}} systems. Both the mechanism (larval or adult movement vs. oviposition) and the cues used by arthropods in locating leaf shelters, however, have received little attention. 2. Artificial leaf shelters (i. e. <b>leaf</b> <b>ties</b> or pairs of leaves clipped together to form sandwiches) were constructed on understorey white oak (Quercus alba L.) trees and the abundance and species composition of arthropods colonizing and ovipo-siting on leaf pairs was examined in three treatments: occupied <b>leaf</b> <b>ties</b> (contain-ing a leaf-tying caterpillar), unoccupied <b>leaf</b> <b>ties,</b> and non-tied control leaves. 3. The density of arthropods present in the occupied and unoccupied <b>leaf</b> <b>ties</b> after two weeks was seven and four times greater respectively, than non-tied controls. The guild composition of these early colonists differed among treat-ments, with the highest densities of leaf chewers, scavengers, and predators in occupied ties and the lowest densities in non-tied controls. 4. The densities of all arthropods ovipositing on leaf pairs in the occupied and unoccupied <b>leaf</b> <b>tie</b> treatments were four and three times greater than non-tied controls. Leaf-chewing insects (including leaf-tiers and non-tying inquiline species) and scavengers showed strong oviposition preferences for tied leaves. However, most species of leaf-tying caterpillars and the psocids (Psocoptera) did not distinguish between occupied and unoccupied ties, suggesting that these groups do not use occupancy-related cues in selecting oviposition sites.

40|$|Leaf-tying {{caterpillars}} act as ecosystem engineers {{by building}} shelters between overlapping leaves, which are inhabited by other arthropods. Leaf-tiers {{have been observed}} to leave their ties and create new shelters (and thus additional microhabitats), but the ecological factors affecting shelter fidelity are poorly known. For this study, we explored the effects of resource limitation and occupant density on shelter fidelity and assessed the consequences of shelter abandonment. We first quantified the area of leaf material required for a caterpillar to fully develop {{for two of the}} most common leaf-tiers that feed on white oak, Quercus alba. On average, Psilocorsis spp. caterpillars consumed 21. 65 ± 0. 67 cm 2 leaf material to complete development. We also measured the area of natural <b>leaf</b> <b>ties</b> found in a Maryland forest, to determine the distribution of resources available to caterpillars in situ. Of 158 natural <b>leaf</b> <b>ties</b> examined, 47 % were too small to sustain an average Psilocorsis spp. caterpillar for the entirety of its development. We also manipulated caterpillar densities within experimental ties on potted trees {{to determine the effects of}} cohabitants on the likelihood of a caterpillar to leave its tie. We placed 1, 2, or 4 caterpillars in ties of a standard size and monitored the caterpillars twice daily to track their movement. In ties with more than one occupant, caterpillars showed a significantly greater propensity to leave their tie, and left sooner and at a faster rate than those in ties as single occupants. To understand the consequences of <b>leaf</b> <b>tie</b> abandonment, we observed caterpillars searching a tree for a site to build a shelter in the field. This is a risky behavior, as 17 % of the caterpillars observed died while searching for a shelter site. Caterpillars that successfully built a shelter traveled 110 ± 20 cm and took 28 ± 7 min to find a suitable site to build a shelter. In conclusion, leaf-tying caterpillars must frequently abandon their <b>leaf</b> <b>tie</b> due to food limitation and interactions with other caterpillars, but this is a costly behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{immediate}} goal of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} new numerical model capable of predicting the influence of plant biophysics and soil properties on atmospheric tur-bulent exchange at scales ranging from the leaf level (centimeter to meter scale for a leaf or clumps of leaves) to the planetary boundary layer (kilometer scale). The near term scientific objectives are to use this model to provide a time-dependent, spatially varying canopy-induced source/sink distribution for large-eddy simula-tion (LES) which will potentially offer the ability to gen-erate intermittency in simulations of very stable bound-ary layers due to the rapid response of leaves to local variations in atmospheric temperature. This source/sink distribution will also be very useful in canopy-chemistry-turbulence studies because many of the biogenic emis-sions are <b>tied</b> with <b>leaf</b> temperature and available sun-light. Upon coupling with a parameterization that ac-counts for the canopy influence on the turbulence (e. g., Harman and Finnigan, 2007), this model can ultimately be incorporated into weather and climate models which cannot resolve the canopy as a means to account for within-canopy processes on the total flux of constituents into or out of the canopy layer...|$|R
50|$|Controlling Prosopis spp is a {{challenging}} task. One method {{that is often}} used is mechanical control. This can be effective with high mortality rates if stems are cut at least 20 cm underground. Another method is {{through the application of}} herbicides and this is done on an individual plant basis. Basal application is effective to Prosopis spp of all sizes while foliar application is best for plants smaller than 1.5 m. Another physical option for control is through fires. Some species of mesquite are fire sensitive while others are fire tolerant. For those that are fire sensitive this method can be highly effective but those that are fire tolerant require hot and intense fires to be effective. In Australia scientists are trying biological control methods. They have introduced multiple insects but the most effective in causing high population level impact is the <b>leaf</b> <b>tying</b> moth (Evippe spp). The most recommended method for managing Prosopis, both in native and introduced ranges, is by targeting large amounts of plants either through herbicide or physical removal. There is also new research being done on using satellite and aerial images to assess canopy cover and determine which ranges should be targeted.|$|R
40|$|Arthropods {{are known}} to use silk {{for a number of}} {{different}} purposes including web construction, shelter building, <b>leaf</b> <b>tying,</b> construction of pupal cocoons, and as a safety line when dislodged from a substrate (Alexander, 1961; Fitzgerald, 1983; Common, 1990). Across the arthropods, silk displays a diversity of material properties and chemical constituents and is produced from glands with different evolutionary origins (Craig, 1997). Among insects, larval Lepidoptera are prolific producers of silk. Because many lepidopteran larvae are pests, an ability to interfere with silk production or, at the very least, an understanding of how silk is used, could provide new options for pest control. After testing many known fluorescent dyes, we found that Fluorescent Brightener 28 (also known as Calcofluor White M 2 R) (Sigma-Aldrich Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW, Australia), an optical brightener used in the textile industry, binds to arthropod silk in a simple staining reaction, causing it to fluoresce under ultraviolet (UV) light. Such brighteners have also been used in insect gut content analysis (Schlein & Muller, 1995; Hugo et al., 2003). Here we describe the method of visualizing arthropod silk on plant surfaces, using as a model the thin, barely visible, single strands of silk produced by Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) neonates...|$|R

25|$|The Penguins {{started out}} March with a wild {{game against the}} Montreal Canadiens that {{combined}} {{for a total of}} thirteen goals including the Brandon Sutter game-winner in overtime. The game featured Brandon Sutter, Matt Cooke and Chris Kunitz all scoring two goals apiece with defenceman Kris Letang finished with a career-high four assist night. After missing four games, Evgeni Malkin made his return to the lineup against the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 4 where he tallied a goal and an assist before defeating the Lightning 4–3. Chris Kunitz extended his career-long point streak to six games scoring six goals and nine points during the stretch and has at least one point in eighteen of the Penguins’ last 23 games. After falling behind the Philadelphia Flyers 4–1 in the first period on March 7, and being outshot 18–4, the Penguins tied the score in the second period 4–4 outshooting the Flyers 12–3 eventually defeating the Flyers 5–4. Chirs Kunitz scored twice in the game extending his career-long point streak to seven games as he and his linemates (Sidney Crosby, Pascal Dupuis) combined for three goals and eight points in the game. James Neal scored his sixteenth goal of the season thirty-six seconds into the March 9 game against the Toronto Maple Leafs but despite the early lead the <b>Leafs</b> <b>tied</b> the game and sent the game to a shootout. Marc-Andre Fleury stopped Tyler Bozak and Nazem Kadri with James Neal and Sidney Crosby scoring on James Reimer with James Neal scoring the determining goal. Chris Kunitz saw his career-long point streak end being held without a point against the Leafs. After absorbing a hit from James van Riemsdyk in the third period, Evgeni Malkin left the game with an upper-body injury and did not return.|$|R
