40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the amount of plantar <b>pressures</b> on <b>the</b> lower limb during tilt table standing and to indicate the ideal degree of tilting for partial weight bearing. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen healthy subjects between the ages of 20 and 30 were recruited as volunteers for this study. All the measurements were taken while standing on a tilt table according to different inclination angles. [Results] <b>The</b> plantar <b>pressures</b> <b>for</b> 60 ° tilt table standing were lower by 7 – 9 % of total body weight than <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> during tilt table standing at 90 °, and <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>for</b> 30 ° tilt table standing were lower by 18 – 20 % of total body weight than <b>the</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>for</b> tilt table standing at 90 °. [Conclusion] Standing training on a 60 ° tilt table might be equivalent to 80 % of full weight bearing training, and tilt table standing training at 30 ° might be equivalent to 60 % of full weight bearing training...|$|R
5|$|Looking Glass {{intended}} Flight Unlimited as {{a gateway}} into {{the video game}} publishing industry. According to Lerner, the idea of self-publishing had been considered when the company was founded. In 1995, Looking Glass projected that sales of Flight Unlimited would increase royalty revenues to $10 million that year, up from $1.5 million in 1994. Jeffrey A. Kalowski, the company's vice president of finance and administration, expected that the game would recoup its development costs and make a return {{before the end of}} the year. He predicted that, over the following 12 to 18 months, the company's number of employees would increase from 52 to 82. The company's executive vice president and general manager, Jerry Wolosenko, told The Boston Globe that the company hoped to publish six games each year. According to Doug Church, <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>for</b> Flight Unlimited to succeed meant that the concurrently-developed System Shock, which was not self-published, received little attention from the company's management.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>for</b> reform {{continued}} to grow unabated and a fresh parliament met in June, passing a set of measures known as the Provisions of Oxford, which Henry swore to uphold. These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then {{had the power to}} appoint England's justiciar, chancellor, and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triannual parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons. The elected council included representatives of the Savoyard faction but no Poitevins, and the new government immediately took steps to exile the leading Lusignans and to seize key castles across the country.|$|E

She spent the next 30 months traveling the world promoting the book as well as writing newspaper articles covering the anti-globalization movement. Most of her articles were originally published in the Canadian national newspaper The Globe and Mail, while some were published by The Nation, The New York Times, and The Guardian. During this time she resisted her publisher's urgings to write a new book, and the pressure to match No Logos success was bearing down upon her. She relented to <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>for</b> another publication by collecting {{the best of the}} articles and speeches she had written since No Logo. She did not intend this new book to be a sequel or follow-up, but rather a stand alone collection of writing.|$|E

25|$|In 1979 {{a second}} oil shock nearly doubled {{the price of}} {{imported}} oil to Brazil and lowered the terms of trade further.

Nevertheless, the government continued borrowing, mainly to face an increasing debt burden, while it tried vainly to maintain the high-growth strategy. At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the foreign-debt problem became acute, leading to the introduction of a program to generate growing trade surpluses in order to service the foreign debt. The program was achieved by reducing growth and, with it, imports, and by expanding exports. As a result, in 1981 real GDP declined by 4.4 percent.
