5|$|Early diamond {{identification}} tests {{included a}} scratch test {{relying on the}} superior hardness of diamond. This test is destructive, as a diamond can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations.

5|$|The ensuing {{worldwide}} plant reduction {{resulting from}} the difficulties plants encountered in adjusting to the new climate caused a progressive fragmentation and collapse of rainforest ecosystems. This reinforced and so further accelerated the collapse by sharply {{reducing the amount of}} animal life which could be supported by the shrinking ecosystems at that time. The outcome of this animal reduction was a crash in global carbon dioxide levels, which impacted the plants even more. The aridity and <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> which resulted from this runaway plant reduction and decrease in a primary greenhouse gas caused the Earth to rapidly enter a series of intense Ice Ages.|$|E
5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E
25|$|For each {{interface}} between two objects {{in contact with}} each other, {{there will be a}} <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> across the interface. For such composite systems, the <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> across the interface may be appreciable.

25|$|Corydoras panda follows, {{with a few}} minor deviations, the {{standard}} model for breeding for the genus. Stimulus for breeding consists of the influx of cooler, oxygenated waters into their habitat, usually corresponding in the wild {{with the onset of}} the rainy season. However, while some Corydoras species require a <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> in the aquarium for spawning to be stimulated, in the case of Corydoras panda, the <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> appears to matter much less, as specimens have spawned in the aquarium without a <b>temperature</b> <b>drop.</b> The addition of new, clean, oxygenated water appears to be the primary stimulus for this species. In the wild, the appearance of new water courtesy of the rains is followed by an increase in the populations of assorted food organisms, and feeding upon these conditions the fishes for breeding.|$|E
25|$|When two solid bodies come in contact, such as A and B in Figure 1, heat {{flows from}} the hotter body to the colder body. From experience, the {{temperature}} profile along the two bodies varies, approximately, {{as shown in the}} figure. A <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> is observed at the interface between the two surfaces in contact. This phenomenon {{is said to be a}} result of a thermal contact resistance existing between the contacting surfaces. Thermal contact resistance is defined as the ratio between this <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> and the average heat flow across the interface.|$|E

25|$|Pre-War {{claims of}} wide scale, long-lasting, and {{significant}} global environmental effects were thus not borne out, {{and found to}} be significantly exaggerated by the media and speculators, with climate models by those not supporting the nuclear winter hypothesis {{at the time of the}} fires predicting only more localized effects such as a daytime <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> of ~10°C within 200km of the source.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{component in the}} long-term <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> {{may be related to}} the positions of the continents, relative to the poles (but it cannot explain the rapid retreat and advances of glaciers). This relation can control the circulation of the oceans and the atmosphere, affecting how ocean currents carry heat to high latitude. Throughout most of geologic time, the North Pole appears to have been in a broad, open ocean that allowed major ocean currents to move unabated. Equatorial waters flowed into the polar regions, warming them with water from the more temperate latitudes. This unrestricted circulation produced mild, uniform climates that persisted throughout most of geologic time.|$|E

25|$|Diamond is an {{extremely}} effective thermal conductor and usually an electrical insulator. The former property is widely exploited {{in the use of}} an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable <b>temperature</b> <b>drop.</b> As most simulants are thermal insulators, the thermistor's heat will not be conducted. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. The only possible exception is moissanite, which has a thermal conductivity similar to diamond: older probes can be fooled by moissanite, but newer Thermal and Electrical Conductivity testers are sophisticated enough to differentiate the two materials.|$|E
25|$|Modern non-avian {{reptiles}} exhibit {{some form}} of cold-bloodedness (i.e. some mix of poikilothermy, ectothermy, and bradymetabolism) so that they have limited physiological means of keeping the body temperature constant and often rely on external sources of heat. Due to a less stable core temperature than birds and mammals, reptilian biochemistry requires enzymes capable of maintaining efficiency over a greater range of temperatures than in the case for warm-blooded animals. The optimum body temperature range varies with species, but is typically below that of warm-blooded animals; for many lizards, it falls in the 24°–35°C (75°–95°F) range, while extreme heat-adapted species, like the American desert iguana Dipsosaurus dorsalis, can have optimal physiological temperatures in the mammalian range, between 35° and 40°C (95° and 104°F). While the optimum temperature is often encountered when the animal is active, the low basal metabolism makes body <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> rapidly when the animal is inactive.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to providing water for plant growth and development, irrigation systems {{can also be used}} for alternative purposes. One of the most common is the dual application of fertilizer with water in a process known as fertigation. Commonly used in drip irrigation systems, this method allows similarly regulate control over how precisely how much fertilizer and nutrients that each vine receives. Another alternative use for sprinkler irrigation systems can occur during the threat of winter or spring time frost. When <b>temperature</b> <b>drop</b> below 32°F (0°C), the vine is at risk of developing frost damage that could not only ruin the upcoming years harvest but also kill the vine. One preventive measure against frost damage is to use the sprinkler irrigation system to coat the vines with a protective layer of water that freezes into ice. This layer of ice serves as insulation keeping the internal temperature of the vine from dropping below the freezing mark.|$|E

25|$|Because of its {{tendency}} to travel very long distances at sea, individual saltwater crocodiles {{have been known}} to appear occasionally in areas far away from their general range. Vagrant individuals have historically been reported on New Caledonia, Fiji, and in Asian waters possibly swam with Kuroshio Current, reaching such as at Iwo Jima, Hachijō-jima, Amami Ōshima, Iriomote-jima (residences by several individuals along Urauchi River from Bakumatsu to Meiji until being hunted by locals were suggested), pelagic waters off Shima, Mie, Miura Peninsula, and even in the relatively frigid Sea of Japan (thousands of miles from their native territory.) In late 2008-early 2009, a handful of wild saltwater crocodiles were verified to be living within the river systems of Fraser Island, hundreds of kilometres from, and in much cooler water than, their normal Queensland range. These crocodiles did indeed migrate south to the island from northern Queensland during the warmer wet season and presumably returned to the north upon the seasonal <b>temperature</b> <b>drop.</b> Despite the surprise and shock within the Fraser Island public, this is apparently not new behaviour, and in the distant past, wild crocodiles had been reported appearing occasionally as far south as Brisbane during the warmer wet season.|$|E
