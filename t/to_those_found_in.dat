5|$|Burzahom's ceramic {{industry}} was mostly of hunting based culture and {{is different from}} the Chinese Neolithic pottery. The economy of the people was found to be based on hunting and gathering with a nascent stage of cultivation practices. Pottery made in Burzahom showed close affinity <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Swat valley in Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware pottery. The burial practices and type of tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the North Chinese Neolithic culture.|$|E

5|$|Whale {{morphology}} shows {{a number}} of examples of convergent evolution, the most obvious being the streamlined fish-like body shape. Other examples {{include the use of}} echolocation for hunting in low light conditions— which is the same hearing adaptation used by bats— and, in the rorqual whales, jaw adaptations, similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> pelicans, that enable engulfment feeding.|$|E
5|$|Where other {{languages}} may use grammatical cases, Swedish uses numerous prepositions, similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> English. As in modern German, prepositions formerly determined case in Swedish, but this feature {{can only be}} found in certain idiomatic expressions like till fots ("on foot", genitive).|$|E
5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
50|$|Weapons, {{among them}} spears, swords, seaxes, and shield {{fittings}} {{have been found}} from English rivers, such as the River Thames, although no large-scale weapon deposits have been discovered that are akin <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> elsewhere <b>in</b> Europe.|$|R

5|$|DragonFly's kernel is a hybrid, {{containing}} {{features of}} both monolithic and microkernels, {{such as the}} message passing capability of microkernels enabling larger portions of the OS to benefit from protected memory, as well as retaining the speed of monolithic kernels for certain critical tasks. The messaging subsystem being developed is similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> microkernels such as Mach, though it is less complex by design. DragonFly's messaging subsystem {{has the ability to}} act in either a synchronous or asynchronous fashion, and attempts to use this capability to achieve the best performance possible in any given situation.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the peridium does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the peridium dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba.|$|E
5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly comparable <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> neutron stars – quark matter {{is expected to}} degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge {{would be able to}} pass through it with no resistance.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} fourth {{millennium}} BC the track was built between an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick {{close to the}} River Brue. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of prehistoric lake dwellings, which were {{likely to have been}} similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village near Godney, itself built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble, and clay.|$|E
5|$|Seibal {{was first}} settled around 900 BC in the Preclassic Period. It {{reached its peak}} {{population}} in the Late Preclassic around 200 BC, {{at the end of}} the Cantuse ceramic phase (300-200 CE). Ceramics from the deep Middle Preclassic levels at Seibal belong to the little-known Real/Xe phase, found in the western Petén region. A cruciform Olmec-style cache consisting of a bloodletter and jade celts is similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and the artifacts were probably manufactured at La Venta. This cache dates to approximately 900 BC.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{metalwork}} includes {{personal items}} like the gold lunula or neckplates found at Auchentaggart in Dumfriesshire and Southside, Lanarkshire, which date from about 2000 BCE and are similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> relatively large numbers in Ireland, {{but also with}} examples across Great Britain and in Portugal. Jet beaded necklaces strung in a crescent shape have been found at sites including Poltalloch and Melfort in Argyll and Aberlemno in Angus.|$|E

5|$|The crystal {{structure}} of octaphenylrhodocene shows a staggered conformation (similar {{to that of}} ferrocene, and {{in contrast to the}} eclipsed conformation of ruthenocene). The rhodium–centroid distance is 1.904Å and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths average 2.26Å; the carbon–carbon bond lengths average 1.44Å. These distances are all similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation described above, with the one difference that the effective size of the rhodium centre appears larger, an observation consistent with the expanded ionic radius of rhodium(II) compared with rhodium(III).|$|E
5|$|The {{staircases}} of {{the interior}} façade are decorated with cartouches similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> First Quad, and likewise bear the arms of important figures in the College's history; (13) Sir Walter Raleigh who was an undergraduate from 1572 to 1574, (14) John Keble who was a Fellow between 1811 and 1835), (archway) Edward Hawkins who was Provost from 1828 until 1882 and (15) Gilbert White who was an undergraduate from 1739 until 1743 and a Fellow from 1744 until 1793.|$|E
5|$|Although the tree-ring {{analysis}} of the Philadelphia painting firmly places it in van Eyck's workshop, the technical evidence fails to prove indisputably whether van Eyck or a workshop member painted it. Until the early 1980s {{it was thought that}} the Philadelphia panel was the original and the Turin panel a copy, but x-ray analysis revealed a highly developed and sophisticated design underneath the paint that is accepted as by Jan van Eyck's hand. Infrared reflectography further disclosed extensive underdrawings beneath the original paint; the artist even made alterations to the composition after laying down the underdrawings and completing the painting. The underdrawings are typical of van Eyck's work and similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Ghent Altarpiece, thereby, according to Luber, tying the Turin version to van Eyck.|$|E
50|$|Throughout his career, Masami {{has always}} raced {{in the green}} over white with pink flames (similar style <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> {{typically}} <b>in</b> hot rods), but since the 1990s, the pink colour has become less dominant part of the colour as he added the orange and red to form part of his current colour scheme.|$|R

5|$|Early {{examples}} of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional {{items such as}} the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, {{thought to have been}} produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at Dalmeny Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with filigree and garnet, similar to sword harness mounts found at Sutton Hoo. There is also a bun-shaped loom from Yetholm, Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian runic inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword pommel from Culbin Sands, Moray and the Burghead drinking horn mount. After Christianisation in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland {{to become part of the}} common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, one of only two such claw lesions discovered in the course of the study. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration. Hand injuries, by contrast, are more likely to be obtained while in contact with struggling prey.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that laid down the Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E
