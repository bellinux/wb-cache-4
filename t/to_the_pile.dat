Two series of analyses were conducted so as to separate and comparatively examine <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> responses during <b>the</b> cyclic liquefaction and subsequent lateral spreading of the ground. It was found that liquefaction of the fill deposits developed after only two cycles of strong shaking, and that {{at this early stage}} of shaking, the maximum ground and pile responses due to cyclic loads were induced. Thus, part of <b>the</b> damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> was caused {{in the course of the}} cyclic ground deformation and solely due to effects of cyclic liquefaction. Further and larger damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> was caused during the subsequent lateral spreading of the liquefied soils. In both loading phases, i. e. dynamic phase and lateral spreading phase respectively, the large lateral ground displacement was the key factor influencing <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> response.

40|$|A {{well-documented}} {{case study}} from the 1995 Kobe earthquake highlighting <b>the</b> performance of <b>pile</b> foundations in liquefied deposits undergoing lateral spreading is presented. The subject {{of this study is}} an oil-storage tank supported on 69 precast concrete piles, 23 m long and 45 cm in diameter. The tank is located in the west part of Mikagehama Island, about 20 m inland from the revetment line. During the Kobe earthquake, the fill deposit surrounding the foundation of the tank developed liquefaction. The quay wall moved seawards and consequent lateral spreading of the backfill soils affected seriously <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> supporting <b>the</b> tank. This paper presents results of detailed ground surveying depicting the ground distortion in the backfill soils and observations from field inspection of damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> including bore-hole camera recordings and inclinometer measurements along the length of <b>the</b> <b>pile.</b> <b>The</b> <b>piles</b> were found <b>to</b> have suffered largest damage at depths corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interface between the liquefied fill deposit and the underlying non-liquefied soil layer.
