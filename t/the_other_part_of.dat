5|$|Keldric and Faye, {{with the}} help of the great beast, Flammie, force the Lorimarian army to leave the village. They chase after Stroud, {{catching}} up to him at the coast. There they free Ritzia, only to be attacked by Stroud, wielding <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the key—the Sword of Mana. Keldric is thrown off of Stroud's airship, and the Lorimarians invade Illusia again. Stroud opens the portal, and a wave of dark energy is released, transforming the Tree, turning the people of Illusia into monsters called Grimlies, and releasing dark monsters from Mavolia. Keldric and Faye flee, and head for Fa'Diel.|$|E

It is also Class A Wild Trout Waters from the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir. Numerous macroinvertebrate taxa have been observed in the stream and boreal forest trees inhabit wetlands in the watershed. A 12-mile (19-kilometer) rail trail connecting the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail to the Poconos via the Roaring Brook Corridor has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The Smart Street Initiative, a 20-year plan to {{make the}} city safer for pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists, began in 2013 with the {{conversion}} of one-way streets to two-way streets. The hope is to bring more businesses to the area, create shorter travel routes, and to reduce speeding. This phase {{of the project was}} expected to be completed by 2016. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the initiative is the West Side Main Streets Plan, which is a revitalization plan for the Lincoln Way West and Western Avenue corridor focusing on guiding business owners, residents, and developers to improve the street front by offering a reimbursement on exterior improvements from the city and the Urban Enterprise Association.|$|E

25|$|The Main South Line, {{sometimes}} referred to as part of the South Island Main Trunk Railway, is a railroad line that runs north and south from Lyttelton in New Zealand through Christchurch and along the east coast of the South Island to Invercargill via Dunedin. It {{is one of the most}} important railway lines in New Zealand and was one of the first to be built, with construction commencing in the 1860s. At Christchurch it connects with the Main North Line to Picton, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the South Island Main Trunk.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Hill's attack also foundered. Cleburne's {{division}} met heavy resistance at the breastworks {{defended by}} the divisions of Baird, Johnson, Palmer, and Reynolds. Confusing lines of battle, including an overlap with Stewart's division on Cleburne's left, diminished {{the effectiveness of}} the Confederate attack. Cheatham's division, waiting in reserve, also could not advance because of Left Wing troops to their front. Hill brought up Gist's Brigade, commanded by Col. Peyton Colquitt, of Walker's Corps to fill the gap between Breckinridge and Cleburne. Colquitt was killed and his brigade suffered severe casualties in their aborted advance. Walker brought the remainder of his division forward to rescue the survivors of Gist's Brigade. On his right flank, Hill sent Col. Daniel Govan's brigade of Liddell's Division to support Breckinridge, but the brigade was forced to retreat along with Stovall's and Adams's men {{in the face of a}} Federal counterattack.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the main}} line was the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad, which the D leased on February 24, 1870. The Delaware and Hudson already {{had a history of}} working with the Albany and Susquehanna, agreeing in 1866 to jointly build an {{extension}} to Nineveh and subsequently ship coal across the entire line. The two companies then entered into an arrangement whereby the Delaware and Hudson perpetually leased the Albany and Susquehanna for $490,000 per year. The connecting Lackawanna and Susquehanna Railroad, chartered in 1867 and opened in 1872, was also absorbed. The Albany and Susquehanna provided a line from Albany southwest to Binghamton, while the Lackawanna and Susquehanna split from that line at Nineveh, running south to the Jefferson Railroad at Lanesboro. Also leased in 1870 was the Schenectady and Susquehanna Railroad, connecting the Albany and Susquehanna at Duanesburg to Schenectady, opened in 1872 (reorganized as the Schenectady and Duanesburg Railroad in 1873).|$|E

25|$|Findings {{indicate}} that the Denisovan gene flow event happened to the common ancestors of Aboriginal Filipinos, Aboriginal Australians, and New Guineans. New Guineans and Australians have similar rates of Denisovan admixture, indicating that interbreeding took place prior to their common ancestors' entry into Sahul (Pleistocene New Guinea and Australia), at least 44,000 years ago. It has also been observed that the fraction of Near Oceanian ancestry in Southeast Asians {{is proportional to the}} Denisovan admixture, except in the Philippines where there is a higher proportional Denisovan admixture to Near Oceanian ancestry. Reich et al. (2011) suggested a possible model of an early eastward migration wave of modern humans, some who were Philippine/New Guinean/Australian common ancestors that interbred with Denisovans, respectively followed by divergence of the Philippine early ancestors, interbreeding between the New Guinean and Australian early ancestors with a part of the same early-migration population that did not experience Denisovan gene flow, and interbreeding between the Philippine early ancestors with a part of the population from a much-later eastward migration wave (<b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the migrating population would become East Asians).|$|E
25|$|In early 1591 an English fleet {{had been}} {{organised}} for a raiding {{expedition to the}} Spanish West Indies. The expedition had been financed in a joint stock venture and was organised into three fleets. The first and main fleet was financed largely by John Watts but also had investment from Walter Raleigh, Paul Bayning and Sir Francis Drake. The expeditions captain was William Lane of the 120-ton Centaur, while second in command was Captain Michael Geare in the 150-ton Little John and the 80-ton Pegasus under Captain Stephen Michell and the pinnace Fifth Part. The back up fleet was composed of two ships – Margaret of 60 tons under Captain Christopher Newport and the 50-ton Prudence under Captain John Burough. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the fleet had been financed largely by Sir George Carew – the 200-ton Hopewell (alias Harry and John) of Captain William Craston, the 130-ton bark Burr of under Captain William Irish, the 35-ton Swallow under Ralph Lee and the 30-ton Content under Captain Nicholas Lisle. They were to attack and raid any Spanish or Portuguese shipping {{in the area of}} Hispaniola and Cuba with the aim of making a profit.|$|E
25|$|In the Spring of 1864, Churchill's Division, with Hawthorn's Brigade moved {{south to}} oppose Union General Nathaniel Bank's Red River Campaign in north-central Louisiana in March and early April 1864, {{defeating}} {{him at the}} Battle of Pleasant Hill, Louisiana, on April 10, 1864. Hawthorn's Brigade was initially left behind at Camden {{when the rest of}} the army went to join General Taylor. They were eventually called upon as well, and left Camden for Louisiana on April 5. They reached Shreveport around April 14 or 15 when they got news about the Confederate victories at Mansfield and Pleasant Hill. On the 16th, they started their march back to Arkansas with the rest of the army. Churchill's Division marched back north into Arkansas to deal with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Federal advance, General Frederick Steele's Camden Expedition. The division arrived after a long forced march at Woodlawn, Arkansas, on April 26, where they rested overnight, then joined the pursuit of Steele's retreating army, catching it trying to cross the Saline River near Jenkins' Ferry. Colonel Cocke was killed during the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry. Lieutenant Colonel Polk assumed command of the regiment after Colonel Cocke was killed.|$|E
