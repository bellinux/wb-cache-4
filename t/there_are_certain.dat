5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named. Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> elements which are reasonably clear.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{a largely}} player-based economy, {{with a heavy}} {{reliance}} on auction houses {{in each of the}} major cities of Vana'diel. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees for putting items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation.

5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed by the executive branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> {{architectural}} styles {{present in}} the game; architectural styles determine the appearance of in-game buildings.

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> distributions, {{especially}} those with three or more parameters, whose likelihoods may become infinite along certain paths in the parameter space. Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the specific value that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent. The method of maximum spacings, however, being dependent on the difference between points on the cumulative distribution function and not individual likelihood points, does not have this issue, and will return valid results over a much wider array of distributions.|$|E

Judge Points (JP) are used to carry out combos with nearby allies or to summon a Totema. JP are also received upon knocking out an opponent. Later in the game, the player gains {{the ability to use}} law cards, which can add laws, and anti-law cards, which can nullify laws that are already in effect.|$|E
5|$|While The Tale of Mac Da Thó's Pig {{appears to}} be the quintessential Ulster Cycle story in theme and narrative, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> unusual {{elements}} of the extant forms which suggest it may have a more satiric quality, parodying the heroic genre of the Ulster Cycle. The eponymous pig of Mac Da Thó may be mythic in origin, but its highly exaggerated size may also be satiric. In the Táin Bó Cuailnge, the Ulaid and Connachta go to war over a mythic best, the finest bull in Ireland, whereas here they come to blows over a dog.|$|E

5|$|Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer {{than those}} in the wild. They are more {{comfortable}} around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and {{for a longer period of}} time over their lifespan. Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other; while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position. These behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed to genetics. However, it is also theorized that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more receptive to domestication than others, and that these differences are then passed down to offspring (compare Domesticated silver fox).|$|E
5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> {{jobs that}} horses do very well, and no {{technology}} has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for {{certain types of}} patrol duties and crowd control. Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses {{can also be used}} in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.|$|E
5|$|According to Jains, the {{consequences}} of karma are inevitable. The consequences may {{take some time to}} take effect but the karma is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>certain</b> points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E
