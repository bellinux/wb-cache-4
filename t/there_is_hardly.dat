5|$|The {{offspring}} may {{stay with}} the mother for 13 to 20 months, associating {{with one another and}} feeding on kills together. After weaning, juveniles may form mixed-sex herds; young females may stay back with their mother, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> any interaction between the mother and daughters. The females in the mixed-sex herd gradually move out as they near sexual maturity. In the Serengeti, average age of independence of 70 observed litters was 17.1 months. Young females had their first litters at the age of about 2.4 years and subsequent litters about 20 months later. The lifespan of wild cheetahs is 14 to 15 years for females; their reproductive cycle typically ends by 12 years of age. Males generally live as long as 10 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is a partial migrant: birds {{from the north}} and east of the range {{wintering}} in the milder areas of Europe and North Africa. Scandinavian and Russian birds start moving south from mid-September onwards, most birds wintering in Europe, western Turkey and the Middle East. Between mid-October and November, large numbers cross the Strait of Gibraltar and others pass through Cyprus, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> any migration across the North Sea. Breeding birds in the British Isles and north-west Europe are resident or move only short distances. In the Himalayas, the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter. Return migration starts mainly from late March, although it can be a month earlier in the Middle East, and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late April or early May. Migration may be by day or night, and typically involves individuals or small groups. Vagrant birds have occurred in the Azores, China, Crete, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Japan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sikkim and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E

25|$|Two primary {{characteristics}} {{are seen in}} these legends about Lilith: Lilith as the incarnation of lust, causing men to be led astray, and Lilith as a child-killing witch, who strangles helpless neonates.

25|$|Large loss: The size of {{the loss}} must be {{meaningful}} {{from the perspective of}} the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses, these latter costs may be several times the {{size of the}} expected cost of losses. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.|$|E

25|$|There are {{suggestions}} {{about a new}} larger border checkpoint to be built on the Norwegian side, as the current station has insufficient capacity to handle increased traffic, and the ground is not sufficiently stable to allow an expansion at the current site. Individual Norwegian police executives {{have called for a}} common border checkpoint located directly on the border line. This would allow for a more cost-effective and less time-consuming operation. However, Norwegian and Russian legislation, as well as the Schengen Agreement, prohibit such an operation. The Parliament of Norway's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has taken initiative to introduce a 24-hour-a-day opening time at the crossing; this has been rejected by the local police district, who stated that nearly all trans-border traffic is persons and that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> any demand for a night service. Estimates show that border traffic may increase to 400,000 crossings by the mid- to late 2010s. The demand for a larger station remains as of 2017.|$|E

I've seen this young woman run across a 60-foot stage, hit every note and never miss a thing. And that makes my job so much easier." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{male and}} other felines, female cheetahs do not {{establish}} territories. Instead, {{they live in}} unguarded areas, known as [...] "home ranges". Though home ranges often overlap, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> any interaction between the females. Females are regular visitors to male territories. The size of a home range depends mainly {{on the availability of}} prey. The greater the density of prey animals in an area, the smaller the home range of a female cheetah there. In areas with nomadic prey animals (such as the Thomson's gazelle in the Serengeti and the springbok in the Kalahari Desert), the home ranges cover hundreds of square kilometres. In contrast, home ranges are merely [...] large where sedentary prey, such as the impala in the Kruger National Park, is available.|$|E

500|$|Drawing on Adam of Bremen's {{assertion}} that Orkney was not conquered {{until the time}} of Harald Hardrada, who ruled Norway from 1043–66, Woolf (2007) speculates that Sigurd {{may have been the}} first Earl of Orkney. He also offers the hypothesis that the earldom was a created by the Danish king Harald Bluetooth, circa 980 rather than in the time of Harald Fairhair one hundred years earlier. He concludes that [...] "If there were no earls in Orkney before Sigurð's time it might help to explain the islands' low profile in the annals since these, for the most part, record only the deaths of great men." [...] However, the absence of comment on this subject by Irish sources prior to Sigurd's death <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> surprising. Irish sources of the period were not well informed about and [...] "not much concerned" [...] with Orkney. Smyth (1984) is more sympathetic to the claims of the sagas and argues that Torf-Einarr [...] "may be regarded as the first historical earl of Orkney".|$|E
500|$|For Ursula Franklin, {{technology}} {{is a set of}} practices in the [...] "here and now" [...] rather than an array of machines or gadgets. It is also a comprehensive system. [...] "Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." [...] Her definition is similar to the French thinker Jacques Ellul's concept of technique. Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. [...] "Technology has built the house in which we all live," [...] she writes, [...] "today <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> any human activity that does not occur within this house." [...] As such, {{technology is}} a central element of the here and now. [...] "In the broadest sense of the term, the here and now is our environment, that is, all that is around us—the ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves—'the way things are done around here.'" [...] Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.|$|E
500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>hardly</b> filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E
