5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with qualities) {{are one and}} the same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – both of which have a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E

500|$|Publication of {{the sequel}} The Lord of the Rings altered many critics' {{reception}} of the work. Instead of approaching The Hobbit as a children's book in its own right, critics such as Randell Helms {{picked up on the}} idea of The Hobbit as being a [...] "prelude", relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering a presentist interpretation are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> this approach misses out on much of the original's value as a children's book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right, and that it disregards the book's influence on these genres. Commentators such as Paul Kocher, John D. Rateliff and C. W. Sullivan encourage readers to treat the works separately, both because The Hobbit was conceived, published, and received independently of the later work, and to avoid dashing readers' expectations of tone and style.|$|E
500|$|Humphrey's {{progress}} with {{civil rights in}} Minneapolis gained national attention, with many cities inquiring about how they could establish their own civil rights commissions. In 1947, he was reelected with 102,000 votes over his opponent's 52,000 votes. As a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, he led the call for a strong civil rights plank. In his address, he said, [...] "There are <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> to you– we are rushing this issue of civil rights. I say we are 172 years late. There are those who say– this issue of civil rights is an infringement on states rights. The time has arrived for the Democratic Party {{to get out of}} the shadow of state's rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights." [...] Humphrey was elected to the United States Senate in the 1948 election and served many years as a prominent Minnesota politician, including Vice President of the U.S. from 1965–1969.|$|E

In addition, he called {{the latter part of}} [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] "the most brutal part in any song to date". Reviewing for Metal Invader, Nikos Patelis called the album, [...] "energetic, sharp– edged, full of beautiful melodies and heavy riffs, long epic compositions". He called Dream Theater's instrumentalists [...] "four masters of music that use their instruments as if they were their limbs", in addition to stating, [...] "James LaBrie sounds more mature than ever". In conclusion, Patelis called Systematic Chaos, [...] "an excellent album that needs many times to be listened in order to be digested". Greg Prato, of AllMusic, wrote [...] " [...] 'Forsaken' proves wrong <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that Dream Theater is all about instrumental gymnastics and not songwriting". He also compared riffs in [...] "The Dark Eternal Night" [...] to the band Pantera. Overall, he states [...] " [...] the quintet sticks to the prog metal game plan that they've followed since their inception". Reviewer Chad Bowar of About.com, wrote that [...] "In the Presence of Enemies - Part I" [...] is [...] "an effective way to {{set the tone for the}} rest of the songs". Overall, Bowar gave the album four out of five stars, calling it, [...] "one of the best Dream Theater releases in quite a while".|$|E

500|$|Goodman sees {{schools as}} {{mechanisms}} for adjusting youth to an automated society increasingly absent [...] "any human values". Goodman disagrees with <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> public schools teach middle class values, {{as he sees}} schools as more petit bourgeois than bourgeois, favoring [...] "bureaucratic, time-serving, grade-grind-practical, timid, and nouveau riche climbing" [...] over [...] "independence, initiative, scrupulous honesty, earnestness, utility, [...] respect for thorough scholarship". In this way, schooling {{is not a good}} use of student time, and students are right to quit and avoid the psychological and professional damage. More important is the disintegration of social class segregation. Goodman then asserts that lower- and middle-class kids would be better off without public or any schooling altogether. He proposes several alternatives to formal schooling, such as divvying up the high school's public funds directly amongst its students, and advocates for a variety of experimental school alternatives: [...] "no school at all, the real city as school, farm schools, practical apprenticeships, guided travel, work camps, little theaters and local newspapers, [...] community service". Other proposals include making class non-compulsory (such that attendance will reflect student interest without [...] "trapping" [...] children), requiring students to wait two years before applying to the most elite colleges, eliminating grades so the burden of testing for required skills falls on companies, and letting students quit and resume freely. He proposes Danish folk school-style education for those uninterested in academics. Goodman's foremost intention was to stimulate new educational paradigms. He acknowledges that his specific proposals may be unpopular or ignored.|$|E
