5|$|German {{infantry}} {{were spotted}} advancing towards the brigade box and were bombarded by heavy artillery, which repulsed the attack. Around 09:00, more infantry attacked {{the box and}} came <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> artillery fire. Hand-to-hand fighting began and a British platoon was overrun before a tank-infantry counter-attack repulsed the German infantry and restored the position. The Germans resorted to harassing fire, sniping, mortar bombardments and heavy artillery fire. After a long artillery bombardment, simultaneous attacks by tanks and infantry were made at 19:00, {{from the north and}} south, which broke into the box and closed on the brigade headquarters, before being driven back around 22:30.|$|E

5|$|The 47th Division {{planned to}} attack with two brigades, each {{reinforced}} by a battalion from the reserve brigade, along {{either side of}} the Ypres–Comines Canal. Large numbers of machine-guns were organised to fire offensive and defensive barrages and signal detachments were organised to advance with the infantry. An observation balloon was reserved for messages by signal lamp from the front line, as insurance against the failure of telephone lines and message-runners. The divisional trench mortar batteries were to bombard the German front line opposite the 142nd Brigade, where it was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> the artillery to shell without endangering British troops. Wire-cutting began in mid-May, against considerable local retaliation by German artillery. At the end of May the two attacking brigades began training at Steenvoorde, on practice courses built to resemble the German positions to be attacked, using air reconnaissance photographs to mark the positions of machine-gun posts and hidden barbed wire. Divisional intelligence summaries were used to plan the capture of German company and battalion headquarters. The 140th Brigade with four tanks attached, was to occupy White Château and the adjacent part of , while the 142nd Brigade attacked the spoil heaps and the canal bank to the left. On 1 June, the British artillery began the intense stage of preparatory bombardment for trench-destruction and wire cutting and the two attacking brigades assembled for the attack from 4 to 6 June.|$|E
5|$|Formby went to Normandy in July 1944 in {{the vanguard}} of a wave of ENSA performers. He and Beryl {{travelled}} over on a rough crossing to Arromanches giving a series of impromptu concerts to troops in improvised conditions, including on the backs of farm carts and army lorries, or in bomb-cratered fields. In one location the German front line was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> him to perform, so he crawled into the trenches and told jokes with the troops there. He then boarded HMS Ambitious for his first scheduled concert before returning to France to continue his tour. During dinner with General Bernard Montgomery, whom he had met in North Africa, Formby was invited to visit the glider crews of 6th Airborne Division, who had been holding a series of bridges without relief for 56 days. He did so on 17 August in a one-day visit to the front line bridges, where he gave nine shows, all standing beside a sandbag wall, ready to jump into a slit trench in case of problems; much of the time his audience were in foxholes. After the four-week tour of France, Formby returned home to start work on I Didn't Do It (released in 1945), although he continued to work on ENSA concerts and tours in Britain. Between January and March 1945, shortly after the release of He Snoops to Conquer, he left on an ENSA tour that took in Burma, India and Ceylon (the latter is now Sri Lanka). The concerts in the Far East were his last for ENSA, {{and by the end of}} the war it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel.|$|E

5000|$|Her 1998 {{installation}} Copyright, using {{a number}} of videos and items of Habitat furniture, portrayed everyday tragedies, described by The Independent as [...] "absurd, sad, funny - and <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to home <b>for</b> comfort." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{most recent}} of Berlet's two books, co-authored with Matthew N. Lyons, is Right-Wing Populism in America: <b>Too</b> <b>Close</b> <b>for</b> Comfort, {{published}} in 2000 by The Guilford Press. It {{is a broad}} historical overview of right-wing populism in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{small size}} is deceiving as the Parker House is spacious. The turret bays have walls {{that are more}} than half {{consisted}} of windows. The fireplace {{is set in the}} center of the house which allows it to heat and service two rooms, the parlor and the dining room. The side elevations of the Parker House are symmetrical but adjacent buildings are built <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> the design to be seen clearly.|$|E
25|$|A {{common problem}} {{encountered}} is when {{two or more}} holes are <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> independent standard bushings. In this case one large renewable bushing {{can be made with}} two (or more) holes in the proper location (the first example in the image). Another possibility is to make a custom bushing with an eccentric hole and then notches {{on the outside of the}} head are used to locate the proper position of the bushing for each location (the middle example in the image). Another common need for a custom bushing is when the hole needed is perpendicular jig plate; in this case a bracket bushing is used. It is a hardened piece of right angle steel that bolts to the jig plate and is located with dowel pins.|$|E
50|$|The game is tied, but {{the play}} at the plate is <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to call <b>for</b> the umpire, and it then ends in an argument. The narrator then concludes the short praising the values of what makes {{baseball}} America's sport.|$|R
50|$|A spinet is a {{harpsichord}} {{with the}} strings set {{at an angle}} (usually about 30 degrees) to the keyboard. The strings are <b>too</b> <b>close</b> together <b>for</b> the jacks to fit between them. Instead, the strings are arranged in pairs, and the jacks are in the larger gaps between the pairs. The two jacks in each gap face in opposite directions, and each plucks a string adjacent to the gap.|$|R
50|$|The Ant was {{cancelled}} in 1968 before full-scale production began, {{during the}} period when BMC {{became part of the}} British Leyland (BL) conglomerate; the merger caused several overlaps in model ranges, and the Ant was regarded as <b>too</b> <b>close</b> a competitor <b>for</b> the Land Rover range.|$|R
25|$|Warwickshire {{survived a}} scare as a virtual second XI still beat the Cambridge {{students}} by 18 runs. The {{first day at}} Fenner's was ruined by rain, with only 6 overs possible. Warwickshire batted first, losing three wickets for no runs to collapse to 48 for 4, but Jonathan Trott's three-hour 150 not out lifted the visitors to 296 for 6 declared. In reply, Zohail Sharif made an unbeaten fifty as the students {{made their way to}} 109 for 1 in just 24 overs. An overnight declaration from the students was followed by an equalling blazing accumulation of runs from Warwickshire led them to 127 for 1. In the reply, Cambridge came <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> comfort, though, and at 281 for 6 with 34 runs left to hit it looked like they could do it - but opening batsman and off spinner Alex Loudon came to the rescue with three wickets for 48, as Cambridge collapsed to 296 all out and lost the match by 18 runs.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{dominated}} the American television landscape during the 1970s and early 1980s (by 1980, {{the three major}} networks represented 90% of all prime-time television viewership in the U.S.). Several flagship series debuted on the network during this time including Dynasty, an opulent drama from Aaron Spelling that became a hit when it premiered as a midseason series in 1981, five months before Spelling's other ABC hit Charlie's Angels ended its run. The network was also propelled during the early 1980s by the continued successes of Happy Days, Three's Company, Laverne & Shirley and Fantasy Island, and gained new hits in <b>Too</b> <b>Close</b> <b>for</b> Comfort, Soap spinoff Benson and Happy Days spinoff Mork & Mindy. In 1981, ABC (through its ABC Video Services division) launched the Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS), a cable channel operated as {{a joint venture with}} the Hearst Corporation offering cultural and arts programming, which aired as a nighttime service over the channel space of Nickelodeon.|$|E
500|$|Colin Jacobson for DVD Movie Guide {{criticized the}} writing, saying, [...] "the show's rather bland. It {{provides}} the occasional chuckle, but the characters aren't formed yet, {{and that makes}} the program ring false. The ending reconciliation between Jerry and Elaine causes particular problems; it doesn't turn sappy, but it comes <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> Seinfeld." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{press your}} horses too hardly," [...] Oswald said, as they galloped along. [...] "They are <b>too</b> <b>close</b> behind us <b>for</b> {{us to get}} help {{from any of the}} small villages, but they dare not follow us into Longtown, and we have barely a ten miles' ride." ...|$|R

[...] The strings are <b>too</b> <b>close</b> together <b>for</b> the jacks to fit between them. [...] Instead, the strings are arranged in pairs, and the jacks are in the larger gaps between the pairs. [...] The two jacks in each gap face in opposite directions, and each plucks a string adjacent to the gap.|$|R
50|$|A bonus scene {{not shown}} in the {{original}} broadcast available at Spike.com showed the battlefield tactics of each warrior in the scenario of North Korea invading South Korea and the response by the U.S., which Mack deemed <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to call <b>for</b> him to give either side the edge.|$|R
500|$|Kaspersky said {{anonymity}} on the Internet {{could be}} protected by using a proxy, whereby a responsible international body maintains a record of which online identities correspond to which real-world ones. For example, a person's identity would be revealed in cases of malicious activity. Some security experts believe that a centralized database of the real-world identities of Internet users would be [...] "a privacy disaster and a highly attractive target for thieves." [...] The Age said it [...] "sounds a little <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> comfort to a Big Brother scenario" [...] and Wired said Kaspersky's views were highly aligned with the Russian government's agenda.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, a First Tee course, {{for young}} golfers, {{opened at the}} Mosholu course. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course and its {{attached}} clubhouse were renovated from 2007 to 2014 for $5 million. Prior to the renovation, there was poor management, dirty grounds, and [...] "a proliferation of prostitutes and drug dealers operating much <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> comfort plagued the grounds." [...] The renovation overhauled the course with such improvements as seven new greens and a new drainage system. The clubhouse received an infusion of historic golf artifacts from NYC Parks, including [...] "vintage photographs" [...] and an exhibit {{about the history of}} the golf ball.|$|E
500|$|At the Russian sides, 24th Division of Likhachov {{was sent}} into the battle. The Russian fought bravely under Likachev's motto: [...] "Brethren, behind us is Moscow !" [...] But the French troops {{approached}} <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> the cannons to fire, and the cannoneers {{had to use}} everything to fight against their foes. General Caulaincourt ordered Watier's cuirassier division to lead the assault. Barclay watched Eugène's assault preparations and countered it, moving his forces against it. The French artillery, however, began bombarding the assembling force even as it gathered. Caulaincourt led the attack of Watier's cuirassiers into the opening {{at the back of}} the redoubt and met his death as the charge was stopped cold by Russian musketry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result was}} <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to call <b>for</b> almost two days. [...] Ultimately, Merkley was {{declared}} the winner by 49% to 46%, with 5% going to David Brownlow, a Constitution Party candidate. [...] While Smith carried all but six counties, {{he could not}} overcome a 142,000-vote deficit in Multnomah County.|$|R
50|$|Conan {{remained}} the only character that Howard ever spoke of {{with his friends}} in Texas {{and the only one}} in whom they seemed interested. It is possible that Breckinridge Elkins and the other characters in his stories were <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to home <b>for</b> Howard to be entirely comfortable discussing them.|$|R
50|$|The {{residents}} {{complained that}} the construction site for the tunnel boring machine is a little <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to home <b>for</b> residents at Maplewoods as it will be right up to their main entrance. They claimed that is an accident waiting to happen. Construction works thus ceased on 6 June 2011.|$|R
500|$|Peter and {{his friends}} parody the 1980s American drama series The A-Team. When the {{introduction}} sequence of The A-Team was made for the episode, it took the writers and producers several attempts to animate it correctly. The background images used were real images used from The A-Teams intro sequence. When Brian is shown to be exercising heavily at a ski resort {{under the supervision of}} Stewie, and then climbs the mountain and shouts from the top, the montage is a reference to Rocky IV. The 1980s television convention that the gang attends features references to <b>Too</b> <b>Close</b> <b>for</b> Comfort ("Cosmic Cow Autographs") and The Cosby Show ("Bill Cosby aerobics"). At the American football game, the teams playing are [...] "Brown" [...] and the [...] "Board of Education", referencing the Brown v. Board of Education court case in 1954 which led to desegregation in the US school system.|$|E
500|$|At 13:32, {{during the}} zig-zag, it became {{apparent}} that Queen Mary would come too close to the cruiser and the liner's officer of the watch interrupted the turn to avoid Curacoa. Upon hearing this command, Illingworth told his officer to: [...] "Carry on with the zig-zag. These chaps are used to escorting; they will keep out of your way and won't interfere with you." [...] At 14:04, Queen Mary started the starboard turn from a position slightly behind the cruiser and at a distance of two cables (about [...] ). Boutwood perceived the danger, but the distance was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> either of the hard turns ordered for each ship to make any difference at the speeds that they were travelling. Queen Mary struck Curacoa amidships at full speed, cutting the cruiser in half. The aft end sank almost immediately, {{but the rest of the}} ship stayed on the surface a few minutes longer.|$|E
500|$|After {{the attack}} on Southland, UB-14 broke down again and put in at Chanak to await repairs. While there on 4 September, word came of the British {{submarine}} [...] entangled in Turkish antisubmarine nets off Nagara Point. Von Heimburg, Prince Heinrich, and UB-14s cook, {{a man by the}} name of Herzig, set out in a rowboat to observe the Turkish attempts to destroy E7. After several mines that formed part of the net had been detonated to no avail, von Heimburg and his group rowed out and repeatedly dropped a plumb line until it contacted metal. Then, von Heimburg dropped a Turkish sinker mine with a shortened fuse right on top of E7. After the hand-dropped mine detonated <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>for</b> the British submarine's captain's comfort, he ordered his boat surfaced, abandoned, and scuttled. Between shellfire from the Turkish shore batteries and E7s scuttling charges, von Heimburg and company narrowly escaped harm. While most sources credit E7s sinking to the Turkish efforts, author Robert Stern contends that von Heimburg and UB-14 deserve partial credit for the demise of E7.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pilot film}} for a {{proposed}} TV drama, Civil, about a disputed election that slides into civil unrest and eventually war, was optioned by TNT Network in 2016. However TNT {{decided not to}} proceed as it was felt to be <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to home <b>for</b> the 2016 US presidential elections.|$|R
50|$|In the supermarket, Nora tells Carolyn that Lynette {{is trying}} to steal her child. Lynette then says that Nora tried to seduce her husband. That hits <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to home <b>for</b> Carolyn, and she {{immediately}} shoots Nora in the chest. As Nora is dying, she asks Lynette {{to take care of}} Kayla for her. Lynette says she will raise Kayla as her daughter.|$|R
60|$|But {{they were}} riding {{so fast that}} there was scant {{possibility}} for words; and, besides, Sir James kept <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to them <b>for</b> private whispers. In about an hour's time they had crossed the bit of table-land that formed the moor, and descended into another little gorge, which was {{the place where the}} attack had been made upon the travellers.|$|R
