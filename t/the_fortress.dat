Although the Ottomans eventually lifted the siege, Ferdinand was displeased that the Pope had provided no assistance {{in the defense of}} <b>the</b> <b>fortress.</b> In 1535, the Ottomans tried to seize <b>the</b> <b>fortress</b> by treachery, and again in 1536, but they failed on both occasions. During that year the Ottomans started a new siege which would last until the final fall of <b>the</b> <b>fortress.</b>|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{identified}} {{factors contributing to}} the relatively rapid fall of <b>the</b> <b>fortress.</b> It had not been completely renovated; its defenders were inexperienced; the crew had been frequently rotated, and {{had not been able}} to familiarize themselves with the surrounding area and with <b>the</b> <b>fortress.</b> Although most of their experience lay in the defense of the fortress' interior, they were dispatched to fight on open ground. When the combat moved outside <b>the</b> <b>fortress,</b> communication lines were disrupted by the German bombardment, and <b>the</b> <b>fortress</b> defense was unable to restore complete communication with the command center or with other forts. The absence of external support was a crucial factor in its fall.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fortress</b> was {{the best}} {{developed}} citadel during the 14th century.

At the foot of <b>the</b> <b>fortress,</b> monasteries and churches were found; some of which were reconstructed in the 1980s. The restoration works completed in 2015 covered walls of <b>the</b> <b>fortress,</b> creating tracks for walking around <b>the</b> <b>fortress,</b> and also building turnstiles. Other infrastructure created to encourage tourism are artistic lighting and equipment for temperature and humidity control, publicity brochures and overall management aspects.|$|E

50|$|After the Russian-Swedish border moved westwards to Tornionjoki {{river in}} 1809 after the Finnish War, <b>the</b> <b>fortresses</b> in {{south-eastern}} Finland lost their military value, Kärnäkoski fortress among them.

5|$|Garista, the {{strategist}} for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren {{but to no}} avail. The investigation in <b>the</b> <b>fortress</b> {{turns out to be}} more dangerous as the aer begins to turn <b>the</b> <b>fortress</b> into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights make their way into the center of <b>the</b> <b>fortress,</b> where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing <b>the</b> <b>fortress</b> to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.|$|E

Thousands of prisoners were taken, and the Italian garrison now held out only in the northern and southernmost parts of <b>the</b> <b>fortress.</b> On the third day, the 19th Infantry Brigade advanced south from Bardia, supported by artillery and the Matilda tanks, now reduced in number to just six. Its advance allowed the 17th Infantry Brigade to make progress as well, and the two brigades reduced the southern sector of <b>the</b> <b>fortress.</b> Meanwhile, the Italian garrisons in the north surrendered to the 16th Infantry Brigade and the Support Group of the British 7th Armoured Division outside <b>the</b> <b>fortress.</b> In all, some 36,000 Italian prisoners were taken.|$|E
