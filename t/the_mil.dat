25|$|The XCH-62 {{prototype}} was in {{an advanced}} state of assembly in 1975, being readied for a planned initial flight in 1976. Failures in the spiral bevel gearing of the main transmission were experienced in tests because the method of analysis employed had not considered the effect of rim bending. Consequently, new gears with strengthened rims were designed and fabricated. For a more accurate prediction of the load capacity of the gears, an extensive Finite Element Method (FEM) system was developed. The U.S. Army's XCH-62 HLH aft rotor transmission was finally successfully tested at full design torque and speed, but the US Congress cut funding for the program in August 1975. The designers of <b>the</b> <b>Mil</b> Mi-26 avoided similar problems by using a split-torque design in the main rotor transmission.|$|E
25|$|For 2007, Hughes {{moved to}} Embassy Racing, who were {{entering}} a LMP2-class Radical SR9-Judd in the Le Mans Series (the team having initially entered with a Pilbeam MP93.) Despite the move, however, his season {{started in the}} same way as the previous one had; with two retirements in the first two rounds for Hughes and his teammate Neil Cunningham. Hughes returned to Team ASM for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, partnering the same drivers as he had in 2006, but once more failed to finish, due to an accident after 137 laps. Returning to the LMS after the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Hughes took fifth place in class at the 1000km of Nürburgring, before finishing sixth in class at the 1000km of Spa, partnered by Darren Manning for the first time. An eighth place at the 1000km of Silverstone was followed by a second place at the final round of the season, <b>the</b> <b>Mil</b> Milhas Brasil, where Manning and Hughes were joined by Mario Haberfield. Hughes finished seventh in class at the end of the season, with Embassy Racing finishing seventh as well.|$|E

50|$|In 1863, 1-mil (-cent), 1-cent and 10-cent coins were introduced, {{followed}} in 1866 by 5 and 20 cents, half dollar and 1 dollar. <b>The</b> 1 <b>mil</b> and 1 cent were struck in bronze, with <b>the</b> 1 <b>mil</b> a holed coin.

40|$|Processing {{experiments}} using wire-saw {{techniques to}} slice thin silicon wafers are described. Substrates were sliced directly to 17 mil, 8 mil, and 5 mil thicknesses. Some of <b>the</b> 8 <b>mil</b> substrates {{and all of}} <b>the</b> 5 <b>mil</b> substrates were chemically etched to 7 and 4 mils, respectively, to guarantee removal of any saw damage. The wafers wire sawed to 17 mil thicknesses were processed as reference cells. A baseline process which results in an n(+) -p cell structure, and two advanced processes which provide n(+) -p-p(+) structures were utilized. By using a p(+) enhancement layer on the solar cell back surface, the performance of <b>the</b> 7 <b>mil</b> wafers was increased to exceed that of <b>the</b> 17 <b>mil</b> solar cells with simple n(+) -p structures.
