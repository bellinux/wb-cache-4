Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, {{are thought to have}} given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E

5|$|Freitas finds {{numerous}} {{reasons why}} interstellar probes {{may be a}} preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing {{to make contact with}} Earth. A civilization aiming {{to learn more about the}} distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey. Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations. In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.|$|E

Although the patient was not cognizant of having received the information, they were able to correctly act upon it, {{in a manner similar to}} blindsight.|$|E
25|$|Libraries {{are using}} open source {{software}} to develop information as well as library services.

They also promote the same ideas of learning and understanding new information through the resources of other people. Open source allows a sense of community. It is an invitation for anyone <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> various topics. The open source tools even allow libraries to create web-based catalogs.

25|$|Authors are {{expected}} to keep all study data for later examination even after publication. The failure to keep data may be regarded as misconduct.

Provision of incorrect information to journals may be regarded as misconduct. Financial pressures on universities have encouraged this type of misconduct.
