50|$|<b>Boiling</b> <b>the</b> wort ensures its sterility, {{helping to}} prevent {{contamination}} with undesirable microbes. During <b>the</b> <b>boil,</b> hops are added, which contribute {{aroma and flavour}} compounds to the beer, especially their characteristic bitterness. Along with the heat of <b>the</b> <b>boil,</b> they cause proteins in the wort to coagulate and the pH of the wort to fall, and they inhibit the later growth of certain bacteria. Finally, the vapours produced during <b>the</b> <b>boil</b> volatilize off-flavours, including dimethyl sulfide precursors. <b>The</b> <b>boil</b> must be conducted {{so that it is}} even and intense. <b>The</b> <b>boil</b> lasts between 60 and 120 minutes, depending on its intensity, the hop addition schedule, and volume of wort the brewer expects to evaporate.|$|R

50|$|Common {{characteristic}} {{include a}} bowl-shaped boil, an elevated center, a {{formation of an}} organic layer on the outer edge, and resistance of the soil surface to vegetation colonization.

In warm seasons (summer), the elevated center of <b>the</b> frost <b>boil</b> is moderately well drained compared to <b>the</b> depressed inter <b>boil.</b> <b>The</b> permafrost table surface is also affected by differing activity across <b>the</b> <b>boil.</b> <b>The</b> inner <b>boil</b> is more active and generally has more than twice the active depth than <b>the</b> inter <b>boil,</b> which causes <b>the</b> permafrost table surface to be in a nearly perfect bowl shape.|$|R

50|$|The {{resulting}} wort is then boiled, {{usually for}} 60-90 minutes. Hops are added {{at different times}} during <b>the</b> <b>boil,</b> depending on <b>the</b> desired result. Hops added {{at the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>boil</b> contribute bitterness, hops added in the last thirty minutes contribute flavor. Hops added in the last few minutes or even after the end of <b>the</b> <b>boil</b> contribute both flavor and hop aroma. These hop additions are generally referred to as bittering, flavor, and aroma additions respectively. Finings such as Irish moss, a form of seaweed, and others can be added in the final 15-30 minutes of <b>the</b> <b>boil</b> to help prevent haze in the resulting beer.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, little of the planet has been explored; {{in addition to the}} fact that life as currently understood may not necessarily be the same {{in other parts of the}} universe, the extent of the tenacity of life on Earth itself has not yet been shown. Creatures known as extremophiles exist on Earth, preferring extreme habitats.

5|$|Eventually {{the water}} {{remaining}} in the geyser cools back to below <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again.

5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium.

5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727°C), but not in <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> point (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>boiling</b> frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive.

The solution of the activator partially purified by ethanol fractionation of the barium salt indicated its absorption maximum at 262 m&# 956;.

5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera and volcanic fallout may have inspired the myths of the Titanomachy in Hesiod's Theogony.

5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma {{that needs to}} be near the surface of the earth. The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas.

5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} {{tennessine}} are not known; earlier papers predicted about 350–500°C and 550°C, respectively, or 350–550°C and 610°C, respectively.

A later paper predicts <b>the</b> <b>boiling</b> point of tennessine to be 345°C (that of astatine is estimated as 309°C, 337°C, or 370°C, although experimental values of 230°C and 411°C have been reported). The density of tennessine {{is expected to}} be between 7.1 and 7.3g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density among the halogens; that of astatine is estimated to be between 6.2 and 6.5g·cm−3.|$|E

5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial boiling point of about 35°C and a final boiling point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. <b>The</b> <b>boiling</b> range of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150°C to a final boiling point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180°C to about 315°C. <b>The</b> <b>boiling</b> ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp.
