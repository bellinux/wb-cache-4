40|$|The most {{interesting}} observations were: 1 - The "mal de cadeiras" (believed {{to be an}} equine trypanosomose, due to <b>Trypanosoma</b> <b>equinum)</b> is a syndrome originated from malnutrition, overwork, intense blood-loss through blood-sucking arthropods (chiefly tabanids and bot-flies) and aggravated by the conditions prevailing in the "Pantanal" region of Mato-Grosso, when {{the waters of the}} Paraguay river basin ebb, after the periodic flood. The trypanosomes act only as one more factor contributing to the horses debility. 2 - The "curso preto dos bezerros" (calves black scour), usually attributed to poly-helminthoses, was observed to be related exclusively to pure Strongyloides papillosus infestations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trypanosoma</b> evansi. T. <b>equinum</b> in South America is a dyskinetoplastic {{variant of}} T. evansi {{and not a}} {{separate}} species. Transmitted mechanically from infected blood of animals, and is not capable of cyclical development in tsetse Glossina spp. Morphologically indistinguishable from T. brucei. Resistance to physical and chemical action Chemicals/Disinfectants: Controlling arthropod vectors and preventing access to host species is important in preventing new infections. Disinfection does not prevent spread of disease (blood-borne parasite). One minute exposure to ultraviolet light prevents infection. Survival: Trypanosomes only survive short periods outside the host. T. evansi disappears quickly from the carcass after death. Flies no longer transmit the parasites after 8 hours. EPIDEMIOLOGY T. evansi has a wide host range. In some countries incidence of surra increases significantly furing the rainy season when biting fly populations have greatly increased. Surra affects mainly camels and horses but buffaloes and cattle are also affected. Other species that develop severe disease include donkeys, mules, deer, llamas, dogs, cats, cattle and buffalo. Sheep, goats, pigs and elephants may occasional develop mild or chronic disease. Camel raising in Africa and buffalo production in Asia are severely affected. Hosts Pathogenic in most domesticated animals and some wild animal...|$|R
