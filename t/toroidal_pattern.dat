In addition, a L-Band mechanically steered microstrip array, a L-Band microstrip phased array tracking antenna for mounting on a car roof and an X-Band radial line slotted waveguide antenna have been demonstrated. In the above electronically scanned printed arrays, the individual element radiates normally to the plane of the array and hence require a phase shifter to scan the beam towards the horizon. Scanning in the azimuth is by mechanical or electronic steering. An alternate approach is to mount microstrip patch radiators on the surface of a cone to achieve the required elevation angle. The array then scans in the azimuth by beam switching...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new {{kinematic}} and strain model {{of an area}} encompassing the Calabrian and Hellenic subduction zones, western Anatolia and the Balkans. Using Haines and Holt's (1993) method, we derive continuous velocity and strain rate fields by interpolating geodetic velocities, including recent GPS data in the Balkans. Relative motion between stable Eurasia and the western Aegean Sea is gradually accommodated by distributed N-S extension from Southern Balkans to the Eastern Corinth Gulf, so that the westward propagation of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) throughout continental Greece or Peloponnesus is not required. We thus propose that the NAF terminates in north Aegean and that N-S extension localized in the Corinth Gulf and distributed in Southern Balkans {{is due to the}} retreat of the Hellenic slab. The motion of the Hyblean plateau, Apulia Peninsula, south Adriatic Sea, Ionian Basin and Sirte plain can be minimized by a single rigid rotation around a pole located in the Sirte plain, compatible with the opening the Pelagian rifts (2 – 2. 5 mm/yr) and seismotectonics in Libya. We interpret the trenchward ultraslow motion of the Calabrian arc (2 – 2. 5 mm/yr) as pure collapse, the Calabrian subduction being now inactive. In the absolute plate motion reference frame, our modeled velocity field depicts two toroïdal crustal patterns located {{at both ends of the}} Hellenic subduction zone, clockwise in NW Greece and counter-clockwise in western Anatolia.

In addition, morphological features show large uplifting domains far from plate boundaries. We speculate that the tectonic evolution of AAA is related to the progressive northward entrainment of upwelling mantle material, which is itself associated with the establishment of the downwelling part of a convection cell through the segmented Tethyan slab below the northern Zagros and Bitlis collision zone. The recently established westward flow dragged Anatolia and pushed the Aegean slab south-westward, thus accelerating backarc extension.

40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional {{steady and}} oscillatory flows are {{simulated}} in a vertical cylinder partially heated from the side. The vertical wall is heated in a zone at midheight and is insulated {{above and below}} this middle zone, while {{both ends of the}} cylinder are cooled. The cylinder aspect ratio (A=height/radius) ranges from 2 to 8, whereas a fixed Prandtl number, Pr= 0. 021, is considered as well as a fixed length of the heated zone, equal to the cylinder radius. Three-dimensional steady and unsteady simulations as well as mode decomposition techniques and energy transfer analyses are used to characterize the flows and their transitions. The flows that develop from the steady <b>toroidal</b> <b>pattern</b> beyond the first instability threshold break the axisymmetry. At small A (2 <= A <= 2. 5), the flow corresponds to a two-roll rotating pattern, which is triggered by a k= 2 azimuthal mode {{as a result of a}} hydrodynamic instability. At large A (3 <= A <= 8), the flow is steady and corresponds to a main one-roll pattern in the upper part of the cylinder. The flow is triggered by a k= 1 mode as a result of buoyancy effects affecting this unstably stratified upper part (Rayleigh-Benard instability), but shear effects are involved in the instability for the smaller values of A. These steady flows then transit at a higher threshold to a standing-wave oscillatory one-roll pattern associated with the breaking of symmetry of the previous steady pattern. For intermediate values of A (2. 7 <= A <= 2. 9), the transition is toward an oscillatory pattern, but hysteresis phenomena with multiplicity of steady and oscillatory states have been found. Comparisons with experiments performed at aspect ratios A= 4 and 8 are then considered and discussed. © 2005 American Institute of Physic...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the combined effect of re-deposition, re-erosion and local transport, known quantities of (CH 4) -C- 13 were puffed {{at the end}} of the 2007 experimental campaign in the ASDEX Upgrade outboard divertor. Exposed tiles were carefully removed for analysis. The amount of C- 13 locally deposited was measured by nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) and colorimetry. About 100 % of injected carbon is deposited within a +/- 15 cm extension in the toroidal direction. In contrast to H-mode results where re-deposition was exclusively downstream, in L-mode, more than one third of the injected hydrocarbon is found upstream. Colorimetric analysis of images taken with different lighting angles to the surface reveals a strong asymmetry in the carbon deposition pattern with respect to the injection facing/averting side of the surface roughness, with 4 x thicker layers on the side facing the puffing location. The deposition pattern deviates clearly from the magnetic trajectories showing the effect of downward and radial drifts. ERO modelling of a similar experiment carried out in 2003 in H-mode background plasma can nicely reproduce the <b>toroidal</b> deposition <b>pattern</b> but drifts are not yet satisfactory described.

The central Andean plateau is a prime region to study mantle flow above an active plateau margin, where {{it has been suggested that}} a link exists between plateau uplift and removal of the lower crust and lithospheric mantle. This study analyzed shear-wave splitting measurements of the southern Puna plateau (25 °S to 28 °S) caused by anisotropic layers of the mantle in an effort to infer asthenospheric flow patterns. Using 30 teleseismic and 88 local splitting events for vertical constraint, results imply that trench-parallel subslab splitting occurs from retrograde slab motion and shifts to trench-perpendicular as the angle of slab subduction transitions to shallow. The behavior of slab flattening also seems to affect the mantle wedge as splitting above the slab shifts from trench-perpendicular in accordance with absolute plate motion to trench-parallel towards the trench. A <b>toroidal</b> rotation <b>pattern</b> of mantle wedge splitting is also observed around the Cerro Galan ignimbrite region, suggesting a flow obstruction.

Each limiter consisted of nine specially shaped graphite tiles, designed to conform to the last closed field line geometry in the bean-shaped section of the standard OP 1. 1 magnetic field configuration (Sunn Pedersen et al 2015 Nucl. Fusion 55 126001). We observed the limiters with multiple infrared and visible camera systems, as well as filtered photomultipliers.

40|$|The {{questions}} of how strong magnetic fields {{can be stored}} in rotating stellar radiative zones without being subjected to pinch-type instabilities and how much radial mixing is produced if the fields are unstable are addressed. Linear equations are derived for weak disturbances of magnetic and velocity fields which are global in horizontal dimensions but short [...] scaled in radius. The equations are solved to evaluate the stability of <b>toroidal</b> field <b>patterns</b> with one or two latitudinal belts under the influence of a rigid basic rotation. Hydrodynamic stability of latitudinal differential rotation is also considered. The magnetic instability is essentially three [...] dimensional. It does not exist in a 2 D formulation with strictly horizontal disturbances on decoupled spherical shells. Only stable (magnetically modified) r-modes are found in this case. The instability recovers in 3 D. The most rapidly growing modes for the Sun have radial scales smaller than 1 Mm. The finite thermal conductivity makes a strong destabilizing effect. The marginal field strength for the onset of the instability in {{the upper part of the}} solar radiative zone is about 600 G. The toroidal field can only slightly exceed this critical value for otherwise the radial mixing produced by the instability would be too strong to be compatible with the observed lithium abundance. Also the threshold for hydrodynamic instability of differential rotation which exists in 2 D is lowered in 3 D. When radial displacements are included, the value of 28 % for critical shear is reduced to 21 %. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|The Juno {{mission to}} Jupiter {{requires}} an antenna with a torus-shaped antenna pattern with approximately 6 dBic gain and circular polarization over the Deep Space Network (DSN) 7 -GHz transmit frequency and the 8 -GHz receive frequency. Given the large distances that accumulate en-route to Jupiter {{and the limited}} power afforded by the solar-powered vehicle, this toroidal low-gain antenna requires as much gain as possible while maintaining a beam width that could facilitate a +/- 10 deg edge of coverage. The natural antenna that produces a <b>toroidal</b> antenna <b>pattern</b> is the dipole, but the limited approx. = 2. 2 dB peak gain would be insufficient. Here a shaped variation of the standard bicone antenna is proposed that could achieve the required gains and bandwidths while maintaining a size that was not excessive. The final geometry that was settled on consisted of a corrugated, shaped bicone, which is fed by a WR 112 waveguide-to-coaxial- waveguide transition. This toroidal low-gain antenna (TLGA) geometry produced the requisite gain, moderate sidelobes, and the torus-shaped antenna pattern while maintaining a very good match over the entire required frequency range. Its "horn" geometry is also low-loss and capable of handling higher powers with large margins against multipactor breakdown. The final requirement for the antenna was to link with the DSN with circular polarization. A four-layer meander-line array polarizer was implemented; an approach that was fairly well suited to the TLGA geometry. The principal development of this work was to adapt the standard linear bicone such that its aperture could be increased {{in order to increase}} the available gain of the antenna. As one increases the aperture of a standard bicone, the phase variation across the aperture begins to increase, so the larger the aperture becomes, the greater the phase variation. In order to maximize the gain from any aperture antenna, the phase should be kept as uniform as possible. Thus, as the standard bicone fs aperture increases, the gain increase becomes less until one reaches a point of diminishing returns. In order to overcome this problem, a shaped aperture is used. Rather than the standard linear bicone, a parabolic bicone was found {{to reduce the amount of}} phase variation as the aperture increases. In fact, the phase variation is half of the standard linear bicone, which leads to higher gain with smaller aperture sizes. The antenna pattern radiated from this parabolic-shaped bicone antenna has fairly high side lobes. The Juno project requested that these sidelobes be minimized. This was accomplished by adding corrugations to the parabolic shape. This corrugated-shaped bicone antenna had reasonably low sidelobes, and the appropriate gain and beamwidth to meet project requirements...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} from {{monitoring}} the multi-waveband flux, linear polarization, and parsec-scale {{structure of the}} quasar PKS 1510 - 089, concentrating on eight major gamma-ray flares {{that occurred during the}} interval 2009. 0 - 2009. 5. The gamma-ray peaks were essentially simultaneous with maxima at optical wavelengths, although the flux ratio of the two wavebands varied by an order of magnitude. The optical polarization vector rotated by 720 degrees during a 5 -day period encompassing six of these flares. This culminated in a very bright, roughly 1 day, optical and gamma-ray flare as a bright knot of emission passed through the highest-intensity, stationary feature (the "core") seen in 43 GHz Very Long Baseline Array images. The knot continued to propagate down the jet at an apparent speed of 22 c and emit strongly at gamma-ray energies as a months-long X-ray/radio outburst intensified. We interpret these events {{as the result of the}} knot following a spiral path through a mainly <b>toroidal</b> magnetic field <b>pattern</b> in the acceleration and collimation zone of the jet, after which it passes through a standing shock in the 43 GHz core and then continues downstream. In this picture, the rapid gamma-ray flares result from scattering of infrared seed photons from a relatively slow sheath of the jet as well as from optical synchrotron radiation in the faster spine. The 2006 - 2009. 7 radio and X-ray flux variations are correlated at very high significance; we conclude that the X-rays are mainly from inverse Compton scattering of infrared seed photons by 20 - 40 MeV electrons.

40|$|Trapped Vortex Combustor (TVC) is a {{relatively}} new concept for potential use in gas turbine engines addressing ever increasing demands of high efficiency, low emissions, low pressure drop, and improved pattern factor. This concept holds promise for future because of its inherent advantages over conventional swirl-stabilized combustors. The main difference between TVC and a conventional gas turbine combustor is in the way combustion is stabilized. In conventional combustors, flame is stabilized because of formation of <b>toroidal</b> flow <b>pattern</b> in the primary zone due to interaction between incoming swirling air and fuel flow. On the other hand, in TVC, there is a physical cavity in the wall of combustor with continuous injection of air and fuel leading to stable and sustained combustion. Past work related to TVC has focussed on use of two cavities in the combustor liner. In the present study, a single cavity combustor concept is evaluated through simulation and experiments for applications requiring compact combustors such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and cruise missiles. In the present work, numerical simulations were initially performed on a planar, rectangular single-cavity geometry to assess sensitivity of various parameters and to design a single-cavity TVC test rig. A water-cooled, modular, atmospheric pressure TVC test rig is designed and fabricated for reacting and non-reacting flow experiments. The unique features of this rig consist of a continuously variable length-to-depth ratio (L/D) of the cavity and optical access through quartz plates provided on three sides for visualization. Flame stabilization in the single cavity TVC was successfully achieved with methane as fuel, and the range of flow conditions for stable operation were identified. From these, a few cases were selected for detailed experimentation. Reacting flow experiments for the selected cases indicated that reducing L/D ratio and increasing cavity-air velocity favour stable combustion. The pressure drop across the single-cavity TVC is observed to be lower as compared to conventional combustors. Temperatures are measured at the exit using thermocouples and corrected for radiative losses. Species concentrations are measured at the exit using an exhaust gas analyzer. The combustion efficiency is observed to be around 98 - 99 % and the pattern factor is observed to be in the range of 0. 08 to 0. 13. High-speed imaging made possible by the optical access indicates that the overall combustion is fairly steady, and there is no major vortex shedding downstream. This enabled steady-state simulations to be performed for the selected cases. Insight from simulations has highlighted the importance of air and fuel injection strategies in the cavity. From a mixing and combustion efficiency standpoint, it is desirable to have a cavity vortex that is anti-clockwise. However, the natural tendency for flow over a cavity is to form a vortex that is clockwise. The tendency to blow-out at higher inlet flow velocities is thought to be because of these two opposing effects. This interaction helps improve mixing, however leads to poor flame stability unless cavity-air velocity is strong enough to support a strong anti-clockwise vortex in the cavity. This basic understating of cavity flow dynamics can be used for further design improvements in future to improve flame stability at higher inlet flow velocities and eventually lead {{to the development of a}} practical combustor...|$|R
40|$|Convergent plate margins {{occur when}} two {{adjoining}} tectonic plates {{come together to}} form either a subduction zone, where {{at least one of}} the converging plates is oceanic and plunges beneath the other into the mantle, or a collision zone, where two continents or a continent and a magmatic arc collide. Convergent plate margins are arguably the most complicated and dynamic plate boundaries on Earth and have been the subject of many investigations and discussions since the advent of plate tectonic theory. This paper provides a historical background and a review of the development of geological and geodynamic theories on convergent plate margins. Furthermore, it discusses some of the recent advances that have been made in the fields of structural geology, geophysics and geodynamics, which are fundamental to our understanding of this phenomenon. These include: (1) the finding that plates and plate boundaries move at comparable velocities across the globe; (2) the emerging consensus that subducted slabs are between two to three orders of magnitude stronger than the ambient upper mantle; (3) the importance of lateral slab edges, slab tearing and <b>toroidal</b> mantle flow <b>patterns</b> for the evolution of subduction zones; and (4) clear evidence from mantle tomography that slabs can penetrate into the lower mantle. Still, many first-order problems regarding the geodynamic processes that operate at convergent margins remain to be solved. These include subduction zone initiation and the time of inception of plate tectonics, and with it convergent plate margins, on Earth. Fundamental problems in orogenesis include the mechanism that initiated Andean mountain building at the South American subduction zone, the potential episodicity of mountain building with multiple cycles of shortening and extension, and the principal driving force behind the construction of massive mountain belts such as the Himalayas-Tibet and the Andes. Fundamental questions in subduction dynamics regard the partitioning of subduction into a trench and plate component, and the distribution of energy dissipation in the system. In seismic imaging, challenges include improving resolution at mid to lower mantle depth in order to properly understand the fate of slabs, and better constraining the 3 -D flow-related anisotropic structure in the surrounding mantle. Future insights into such fundamental problems and into the regional and global dynamics of convergent plate margins will likely be obtained from integrating spatio-temporal data, structural geological data, geophysical data and plate kinematic data into plate tectonic reconstructions and three-dimensional geodynamic models of progressive deformation...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{overview}} {{of a number of}} investigations on antenna systems and related subjects over a period of 28 years, which has resulted in 44 publications in the technical literature, one current patent, and an M. Sc. thesis. The investigations have been grouped into 7 categories: -	Log periodic antennas, -	Antenna performance measurement techniques, -	Spacecraft Antenna Systems, -	Satcom Terminal Antennas, -	Transmission lines and baluns, -	High Radar Cross Section Reflectors for Spaceborne Radar Calibration, -	Miscellaneous Antenna Investigations. These investigations have resulted in various outcomes: in new antenna types and in improved antenna configurations; in improved techniques for antenna rf performance evaluation; in new knowledge relating to materials used with spacecraft antenna systems; in the development of computer software and computer-numerical methods for specific purposes; and in the advancement of accurate radar cross section prediction methods for spaceborne radar calibration targets. In the discipline of log-periodic antennas, a planar 'printed circuit 1 antenna structure has been devised which has a <b>toroidal</b> shaped radiation <b>pattern</b> distribution with horizontal linear polarization. A non-planar form of this radiating structure with a unidirectional beam has also been demonstrated. Some new techniques for measuring the rf characteristics of antenna systems have been devised. These include special techniques for frequency scaled ship model hf radar antenna measurements, and techniques for measuring scattering from the feed support struts of large Earth station parabolic reflector antennas. A novel method of acquiring near field phase and amplitude data using an interference technique for determining antenna far field performance characteristics by near field to far field data processing transformation has been demonstrated. Correction factors which allow gain comparison measurements to be made in short range length facilities, such as certain types of anechoic chamber, have also been presented. Antenna measurement techniques which are applicable to spacecraft antenna systems have been reviewed. With regard to spacecraft antenna systems, a number of diverse studies have been carried out, one of which has resulted in the composition of a mathematical procedure for predicting the complex beamshapes of contoured beam satellite reflector antenna systems. Also, experimental work has been described which showed that spacecraft reflector antennas constructed with carbon fibre reinforced plastics do not require metallic surface coatings, and that thermal control paint applied to spacecraft does not cause antenna performance degradation. Other programmes of research involved VHP turnstile antenna systems on large satellites, and future technology, geostationary orbit multi-role satellites with 'plug-in' payloads. New satcom terminal antenna configurations has been a very important area of research, resulting in high performance circularly polarized antenna configurations for small terminals for maritime, aeronautical and land-mobile applications. A patent has also been granted on a very compact antenna system for a satellite paging receiver. Many types of antenna require a balun system of some type, often with impedance transformation, for excitation of the radiating elements. A mathematical analysis which allows the design of one type of impedance transforming balun has been presented, and a new microstrip and coaxial cable balun system with progressive quadrature phase output (for the excitation of quadrifilar antennas) has been demonstrated. Very large radar cross section (RCS) passive radar reflectors are used for the monostatic calibration of spaceborne synthetic aperture radars on Earth resource monitoring satellites. A computer-numerical technique for accurately determining the RCS of these large reflectors was devised and has been extensively used. Other aspects of large radar reflector operation were also investigated, such as RCS reduction due to construction errors and radome covers Publications relating to a number of other miscellaneous antenna investigations are also included in this thesis. Among these are descriptions and performance details of choked waveguide and printed dipole feeds for parabolic reflector antennas, a special purpose antenna for a remotely piloted vehicle, and some results from an investigation on a double offset reflector antenna system.
