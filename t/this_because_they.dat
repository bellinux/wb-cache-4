5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are only children, not adults.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Stewart {{sought a}} {{change to the}} script to have the crew defend the Ba'ku village {{in the manner of}} the Battle of the Alamo instead of fleeing into the mountains. Piller could not find a {{feasible}} way to include this in the script, and the budget ruled out the creation of Alamo-like structures in the mountains. Several titles were considered for the film as shooting approached. Star Trek: Where Time Stands Still, Star Trek: Forever and Star Trek: Beyond Paradise were all considered but were rejected. Piller's favorite was Star Trek: Sacred Honor, but the studio rejected <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were concerned that it sounded too religious. When shooting began, the film was still called Star Trek IX.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked {{were considered to be}} vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Politics) said that a smoking mother's breast milk contained nicotine, a claim that modern research has proven correct. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E

25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans do <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{feel like they}} shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances {{it can be seen}} as a racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E
25|$|Courts need {{lawyers and}} Macquarie's efforts to allow emancipist {{attorneys}} {{to appear before}} the Supreme Court were blocked by Jeffrey Bent, who, with his brother, had allegiances with the military and exclusive settlers. Later in 1814, two solicitors, Fredrick Garling and Moore, arrived in New South Wales. English law was to be followed as far as it was possible. Where new ordinances or laws were needed, they were to be consistent with English laws as far as the particular circumstances of the colony would allow. Many of the settlers were discontented with <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> questioned whether some of the governors' ordinances were valid. Claims were made in New South Wales and in England that governors were exceeding their authority by making ordinances that were in conflict with English laws.|$|E
25|$|A {{secured credit}} card {{is a type}} of credit card secured by a deposit account owned by the {{cardholder}}. Typically, the cardholder must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the cardholder puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer incentives even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special savings account. Credit card issuers offer <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.|$|E

25|$|According to Appian, in 60 BC Caesar {{came back}} from his {{governorship}} in Hispania (Spain and Portugal) and was awarded a triumph for his victories there. He was making preparations to celebrate this outside the city walls. He also {{wanted to be a}} candidate for the consulship for 59 BC. However, the candidates had to present themselves in the city and it was not legal for those who were preparing a triumph to enter the city and then go back out for these preparations. Since he was not ready yet, Caesar asked to be allowed to register in absentia and to have someone to act on his behalf, even though this was contrary to the law. Cato the Younger, who was against this, used up {{the last day of the}} presentation with speeches. Caesar dropped the triumph, entered the city and presented his candidacy. Pompey had failed to get the acts for his settlements he made in the east during the Third Mithridatic War ratified by the senate. Most senators opposed <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were envious, particularly Lucius Licinius Lucullus who had been replaced in the command of this war by Pompey. Crassus had co-operated with Lucullus in this matter. An aggrieved Pompey ‘made friends with Caesar and promised under oath to support him for the consulship'. Caesar then brought Crassus into friendly relations with Pompey and ‘these three most powerful men pooled their interests.’ Appian also noted that Marcus Terentius Varro wrote a book about this alliance called Tricaranus (the three-headed monster). Appian's version and Plutarch's Life of Pompey are the only sources that have Pompey seeking an alliance with Caesar, rather than the other way round.|$|E
500|$|Shirley and Tina's 'brother' Mick Carter, {{portrayed by}} Danny Dyer, was {{revealed}} to the audience as Shirley's son. Badland explained that Babe and Shirley's mother, Sylvie Carter, portrayed by Linda Marlowe, knew <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> covered up Shirley's pregnancy and helped her give birth, which estranged Shirley from Babe. Babe threatens Shirley with her knowledge and promises to tell Mick if Shirley crosses her. Babe is unmarried and has no children so Shirley, Tina and Mick are the [...] "closest thing she ever had" [...] to children and her backstory states she was devastated when Tina and Mick were taken into care.|$|E
500|$|Byrne was {{at first}} {{reluctant}} but later agreed, and delivered the merchandising contract to Jacobs's office on 4 December 1963, leaving blank the percentages. Jacobs asked Byrne what percentage rate he should write down to which Byrne ambiguously replied: [...] "Oh, look, just put in 10%." [...] A typical percentage would have been 75% or 80% for NEMS, and Byrne expected Epstein would begin to negotiate. However, the contract came back initialled (meaning Epstein had read it) and signed by Epstein and Jacobs. Jacobs's advice to Epstein was, [...] "10% is better than nothing". This lapse of shrewdness set the scene for what would later become a legal battleground which deprived the Beatles and Brian Epstein of such {{large sums of money}} they would have easily overshadowed any royalties they would receive in the medium term from the sale of records. Byrne later said: [...] "They couldn't wait to get somebody else to do <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were in a mess themselves." [...] Epstein would later realise that he had made a colossal error of judgment, as Byrne charged 10% commission to the merchandisers for a licence (receiving $10 out of every hundred) and then giving 10% of that to NEMS, which was $1.|$|E

500|$|The {{final version}} of the episode {{differed}} from the original concept. It was initially intended for Dean to be a [...] "huge loser" [...] in his new life; being a hunter is what gives him structure and purpose. Without hunting, he would be a jobless barfly. Kripke compared the new reality to a Charles Bukowski novel, but noted that the selfless Dean still preferred the new universe, with Sam happy and living a good life. However, executive producer Robert Singer and others convinced him to change <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> did not think Dean would be happy suddenly waking up in such a reality. Another variation stemmed from Dean's lack of someone to confide innormally Sam is his confidant. Because the writers found it difficult to communicate Dean's feelings, early drafts of the script included a number of internal monologues. These were ultimately replaced by a scene in which he discusses the djinn with a professor. The studio wanted the scene of Dean and his girlfriend Carmen kissing on the sofa to include sex. However, Kripke could not work it into the script, because he found it unrealistic that she would deliberately be late for her job as a hospital nurse.|$|E
500|$|Macnaghten's fourth {{category}} contains {{not only}} individual categories of its own, but also general principles that are applied when a body seeks to be recognised as a charitable trust. The {{first of these}} [...] "sub-categories" [...] contains trusts {{for the benefit of}} the sick and old; the Preamble to the 1601 Act gave [...] "aged, impotent and poor people" [...] as acceptable beneficiaries for a charity. These acceptable beneficiaries are to be read individually; there is no requirement to aid the aged and impotent as well as the poor, and one can even exclude the poor, such as in Re Resch's Will Trusts, which dealt with a hospital that charged fees. The second sub-category is for charitable trusts relating to animals. As with religious charities, the benefit is derived not from the comfort afforded to the animals, but from the [...] "indirect moral benefit to mankind". Again, this excludes trusts which isolate the beneficiaries from the public, as in Re Grove-Grady, where the trust sought to provide [...] "a refuge ... so that they shall be safe from molestation and destruction by man". Charities for the purpose of creating animal sanctuaries usually pass the public benefit test despite <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> do not completely exclude the public and often have educational value.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Lofton {{was one of}} six Indians' {{starters}} who batted [...]300 {{or higher}} (.310). He also had an MLB-best 13 triples. His 54 stolen bases led the AL {{for the third consecutive}} season. The Indians faced the Seattle Mariners in the 1995 ALCS. In the eighth inning of Game Six, Lofton had an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians won the game 40. It was described by The New York Times as [...] "the run that demoralized the Mariners." [...] Fifteen years after Lofton's crossing of home plate, the Plain Dealer recalled: [...] "Of all the electrifying moments on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995." [...] As a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland {{for the first time since}} the 1954 season. [...] "I'm glad for the city of Cleveland to be able to experience <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> haven't experience this for a long time. The city of Cleveland has grown a lot, and it's improving, and we tried to do this for the city", Lofton said. The Indians lost the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular season with a major league-best 10044 record in the strike-shortened year. Lofton finished with a [...]200 batting average and six stolen bases in his first World Series appearance. In 2010, a few years into his retirement, Lofton stated he felt it was the toughest post-season loss of his 11 career playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike zones for Braves pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.|$|E

2500|$|The words [...] "humility" [...] and [...] "humiliation" [...] occur {{frequently}} in the Quran and later Muslim literature in relation to Jews. According to Lewis, [...] "This, in Islamic view, is their just punishment for their past rebelliousness, and is manifested in their present impotence between the mighty powers of Christendom and Islam." [...] The standard Quranic reference to Jews is verse : [...] "And remember ye said: [...] "O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions." [...] He said: [...] "Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!" [...] They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. <b>This</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. <b>This</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> rebelled and went on transgressing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 3 January, Ahlu Sunna Waljamaa {{official}} Sheikh Abdi Badel Sheikh Abdullahi, {{complained about}} Ethiopian {{forces in the}} town of Dolo, in Gedo region.

The standards for judging the Palestinians, however, are very low. Most outsiders remain silent on all the problems in their territories.

2500|$|During the Prohibition era, the Prohibition Party {{pressed for}} stricter {{enforcement}} of the prohibition laws. During the 1928 election, for example, it considered endorsing Republican Herbert Hoover rather than running its own candidate. However, by a 3/4 vote, its national executive committee voted to nominate its own candidate, William F. Varney, instead. They did <b>this</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> felt Hoover's stance on prohibition not strict enough. The Prohibition Party became even more critical of Hoover after he was elected President. By the 1932 election, party chairman David Leigh Colvin thundered that [...] "The Republican wet plank [...] means that Mr. Hoover is the most conspicuous turncoat since Benedict Arnold." [...] Hoover lost the election, but national prohibition was repealed anyway in 1933, with the 21st Amendment during the Roosevelt administration.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{emphasized}} the [...] "groove" [...] of the song, {{and found it}} important that every musical aspect of the song was blended together. They found that this was difficult to balance, and recorded the song while simultaneously using computers and instruments while a Korg Donca Matic rhythm machine kept time. They found that recording with this method meant the music was more sensitive to maintaining the song's groove. Due to the film's young female audience, an early idea by the band was to have bassist Ami Kusakari sing the song, which she did in initial demo takes. Sakanaction decided against <b>this,</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were concerned that the film's production staff would feel misled, having commissioned a Sakanaction song and assuming that Yamaguchi {{would be the one}} singing it.|$|E
