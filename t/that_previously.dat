5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries <b>that</b> <b>previously</b> had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries <b>that</b> <b>previously</b> had a weak currency.|$|E

5|$|Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther {{proposed}} {{reform to}} the Church, {{often based on}} humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517 Luther published the 95 Theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, {{particularly with regard to}} instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a break with the Roman Catholic Church <b>that</b> <b>previously</b> claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.|$|E
