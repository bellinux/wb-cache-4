50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} the pivot clamp around the rocket midsection, which could move the rocket 28 mm (~1") forward or backward along its centreline. The rocket midsection was {{fitted with a}} band which included <b>trunnion</b> <b>pins</b> placed in opposition; the pivot clamp held the rocket by the <b>trunnion</b> <b>pins.</b> The pivot clamp was able to rock on a transverse shaft, thus causing the rocket to move along its centreline. After erection of the rocket to a vertical position, it was held suspended above the launch table; by use of the pivot clamp, {{the weight of the}} rocket could be gently lowered onto the launch table until fully taken up, allowing the rocket to be unsecured from the lifting frame, thus dismounting it from the Meillerwagen.|$|R

50|$|The {{drive cam}} {{is driven by}} the camshaft. This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the <b>trunnion</b> <b>pin</b> or rocker shaft. Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller tip. A similar {{arrangement}} transfers the motion via another roller tip to a second rocker arm. This rotates about the rocker shaft, and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve. In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head.|$|E

50|$|The {{long drive}} shaft {{ran along the}} full length of the port beam of the lifting frame. It entered a worm gear at the pivot clamp, then {{continued}} to the nose clamp where it entered another worm gear. A shift lever at the nose clamp disengaged the drive shaft to allow either simultaneous or independent operation of the two worm gears. The worm gear at the pivot clamp operated a pair of scissor arms, one {{on each side of the}} lifting frame to insert or extract the <b>trunnion</b> <b>pins</b> from the rocket. The worm gear at the nose clamp operated the jaws of the nose clamp to either open or close, thus enclosing or releasing the rocket.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{ultrasonic}} {{phased array}} (UPA) technology for {{inspection of the}} <b>trunnion</b> bearing <b>pin</b> of the 100 -year old Salmon Bay Bascule Bridge {{is the focus of}} this research. To thoroughly investigate the bearing pin, two main objectives are addressed: the development of a UPA system, including the design of a case that uses a Poly Methyl Meth Acrylate (PMMA) material to house the transducer, and the implementation of the system in the field to test the feasibility of the UPA system and its application as a nondestructive testing unit. Two different testing settings are carried out in this research. The first study is performed in a lab-based setting on a mock-up model pin. This model is used as a reference to provide the calibration of the UPA system using the exterior edge, two keyholes, and three diagonal interior grease holes. The second study is performed in a field-based setting on the authentic <b>trunnion</b> bearing <b>pin</b> taken out of service from the Salmon Bay Bridge in Seattle, Washington, currently residing at the Riverside Campus. This pin has three similar diagonal holes, keyholes, and unknown internal defects. Realtime measurements using the UPA system is used to identify the exterior surfaces and the keyholes of the original pin. The results of the inspection of the pins using the UPA system indicate the accuracy of the real-time data taken from the probe measurements. It was limited to seeing perpendicular defects and exterior sides, and could not identify the diagonal grease hole within both pin parts. It did, however, identify the keyholes, and was later verified by visual inspection once the sleeves were removed. The original pin showed no internal defects. For future research in nondestructive testing used in historic <b>trunnion</b> <b>pins,</b> it is recommended to combine this technology with an automatic system that allows the reduction of human interaction with the inspection. A membrane-like surface adaptable to rough faces, along with a constant flow of water between the wedge and surface, would facilitate the need to remove the PMMA case out of the pin to re-apply couplant for inspections. Finally, a modified angled wedge could also be applied within the PMMA case to search for different angled cracking...|$|R

This has to withstand the dynamic force of the bell as it swings, up to three times its static weight.

50|$|On {{the third}} day of the mission, Challengers orbit was raised to about 300 nmi km, and it maneuvered to within 200 ft of the {{stricken}} Solar Max satellite. Astronauts Nelson and van Hoften, wearing spacesuits, entered the payload bay. Nelson, using the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), flew out to the satellite and attempted to grasp it with a special capture tool, called the <b>Trunnion</b> <b>Pin</b> Acquisition Device (TPAD). Three attempts to clamp the TPAD onto the satellite failed. Solar Max began tumbling on multiple axes when Nelson attempted to grab one of the satellites solar arrays by hand, and the effort was called off. Crippen had to perform multiple maneuvers of the orbiter to keep up with Nelson and Solar Max, and nearly ran out of RCS fuel.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} load on {{this type of}} spillway gate (Tainter gate) is transmitted from the cylindrical skin plate, which is {{in contact with the}} reservoir, through a number of struts to a convergence at the trunnion hub. The hub collects the load from the struts and transfers it across an interface to the <b>trunnion</b> <b>pin,</b> which is stationary and is connected to the dam. When the gate is operated, the hub rotates around the pin. The struts are primarily compression members, but friction at the pin-hub interface induces a bending stress during gate operation. Typically, and in this case, the struts are oriented such that the trunnion friction stress is applied to the weak axis of the struts (see Section modulus). In order to better handle these loads, the struts are connected with diagonal braces that take the stress as axial loads. At Folsom Dam, increasing corrosion at the pin-hub interface had raised the coefficient of friction and, therefore, the bending stress in the strut and the axial force in the brace. The capacity of the brace connection was exceeded and it failed. This caused the load to redistribute and the failure progressed, eventually buckling the struts.|$|E

50|$|The AKMâ€™s barrel is {{installed}} in the forward <b>trunnion</b> and <b>pinned</b> (as opposed to the AK-47, which has a one piece receiver with integral trunnions and a barrel that is screwed-in). Additionally the barrel has horizontal guide slots that help align and secure the handguards in place. To increase the weaponâ€™s accuracy during automatic fire, the AKM was fitted with a slant cut muzzle brake that helps redirect expanding propellant gases upward {{and to the right}} during firing, which mitigates the rise of the muzzle during an automatic burst when held by a right-handed firer. The muzzle brake is threaded on {{to the end of the}} barrel with a left-hand thread. Not all AKMs had slant muzzle brakes; some were also fitted with the older muzzle nut which came from the AK-47. Most AKMs with muzzle nuts were older production weapons. The AKM's slant brake can also be used on the AK-47, which had a simple nut to cover the threads.|$|R

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on October 1, 2012 Thesis advisor: Kevin Z. TrumanVitaIncludes bibliographic {{references}} (p. [65]) Thesis (M. S.) [...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Nonlinear simulations {{were used to}} predict and further understand the load transfer between trunnion shafts and yoke plates within a tainter gate trunnion assembly. Traditionally, yoke plates have been sized for an average stress based on the projected bearing area between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate; however, finite element analyses proved that the stress is not uniform across {{the thickness of the}} yoke plate. The non-uniform stress distribution is attributed to the transverse shaft rotations that exist at the supports, concentrating load on the inboard edges of the yoke plates. Further study showed that the installation of either a bronze or composite sleeve between the yoke plate and the trunnion shaft will reduce the magnitude of the stress concentrations. A series of finite element models was developed to investigate the effects that shaft diameter, yoke plate thickness, and sleeve material have on the trunnion shaft to yoke plate load path. The finite element models were developed utilizing solid elements in order to capture the stress distribution across the yoke plate thickness by including multiple solution points across the yoke plate thickness. The analyses showed that a trend can be identified between the magnitude of the edge stress and the L/D ratio (shaft clear span to shaft diameter). As the L/D ratio of the system is increased, the magnitude of the edge stress increases; however, when a sleeve with a lower modulus of elasticity is introduced into the system, it is observed that the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced. The results proved that the reduction in stress is sensitive to shaft diameter, sleeve material, yoke plate thickness and L/D ratio. Typically for a yoke-shaft detail, the L/D ratio is designed to be close to 1. 0 in order to minimize the inboard edge stress; however, trunnion assemblies with larger L/D ratios are desirable from a tainter gate design perspective. Larger clear spans (L) simplify the connection between the strut arms and the trunnion assembly, and small shaft diameters (D) reduce the <b>trunnion</b> <b>pin</b> friction moment demand on the tainter gate strut arms. By installing a low modulus sleeve between the trunnion shaft and the yoke plate, the magnitude of the edge stress is reduced; therefore, the design can accommodate L/D ratios larger than 1. 0 while still keeping the stresses below an acceptable level. The simplified detailing and the reduction in strut arm demand will produce a more cost effective tainter gate design.
