50|$|In 1982 the CIA, with {{assistance}} from the Argentine national intelligence agency, organized and financed right-wing paramilitaries in Nicaragua, known as the Contras. The <b>tracing</b> <b>of</b> secret <b>funds</b> for this scheme led to the revelations of the Iran-Contra affair. In 1985 Reagan authorized the sale of arms in Iran in an unsuccessful effort to free U.S. hostages in Lebanon; he later professed ignorance that subordinates were illegally diverting the proceeds to the Contras, a matter for which Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, an aide to National Security Advisor John M. Poindexter, took much of the blame. Reagan's approval ratings plummeted in 1986 {{as a result of}} the scandal, and many Americans began to seriously question his judgement. While the president's popularity improved in his final two years, he would never again enjoy the support he had had in 1985. Predictably, the Democrats regained control of Congress in the 1986 midterm elections. Oliver North meanwhile achieved a brief celebrity status in 1987 during his testimonies before Congress.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the central rationale of feminism, and thus of feminist perspectives in criminology, to bring about change for women subject to the criminal justice system. It argues that any attempt to influence that system, to bring about change or reform, must be considered within the broader context of policy-making and programme development and their underlying assumptions and purposes, as we]] as in relation to specific contextually located histories. It does so by <b>tracing</b> the history <b>of</b> a particular feminist initiative in Canada - a community-based programme in Nova Scotia which offered feminist therapy and counselling to women in conflict with the law. It <b>traces</b> the processes <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> and evaluation for the federal government, and the differential experiences of the project and its clients, the researchers, and the funders. In so doing it considers the role of policy and programme development and of feminist attempts to reform and their failure to impact the lives of sentenced women; it examines the development of feminist methodology and contrasts it with mainstream correctional methodology and evaluation; it explores the development of feminist intervention and some of the problems inherent in such approaches and their appropriateness for women in the correctional system; and it examines the difficulties encountered in evaluating a feminist initiative. The views of the project and of its women clients are explored {{to assess the impact of}} the intervention, its benefits for the women, as well as its limitations. This analysis shows how the project, while successful in avoiding many of the problems of feminist intervention, was unable to sustain itself beyond the period <b>of</b> federal <b>funding,</b> while the evaluation itself proved to be a difficult process. The discrepancies between feminist ways of working and the dominant correctional models, the assumptions underlying programme development and evaluation, and the limitations of that approach are revealed as a series of over-lapping layers which impact on feminist endeavours...|$|R

In this work, we present Galois <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> class invariants which are singular values of the modular functions that generate Hilbert class fields of imaginary quadratic fields and show that they coincide with modular <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> the singular values.
