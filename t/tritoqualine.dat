50|$|Antihistamines are a {{class of}} {{medications}} designed to reduce unwanted effects of histamine in the body. Typical antihistamines block specific histamine receptors, depending on what physiological purpose they serve. For example, diphenhydramine (Benadrylâ„¢), targets and inhibits the H1 histamine receptor to relieve symptoms of allergic reactions. Inhibitors of histidine decarboxylase can conceivably be used as atypical antihistamines. <b>Tritoqualine,</b> as well as various catechins, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate, {{a major component of}} green tea, have been shown to target HDC and histamine-producing cells, reducing histamine levels and providing anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoral, and anti-angiogenic effects.|$|E
