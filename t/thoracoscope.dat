25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a <b>thoracoscope,</b> along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|E

50|$|VATS {{lobectomy}} is {{the same}} as lobectomy performed via thoracotomy in that the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, and bronchus to the involved pulmonary lobe are individually dissected, ligated and divided. Generally, endoscopic stapling devices are used to ligate and divide the vessels and the bronchus however conventional suture material can also be used. During VATS lobectomy, the structures being operated on are not directly visualized with the naked eye but are visualized solely with a rigid <b>thoracoscope.</b> A camera attached to the <b>thoracoscope</b> transmits the image to a video screen, which allows surgeons and assistants to observe the flow of the operation. Surgical specimens are placed into a water-tight bag and removed from the chest without morcellization (i.e. breaking up the specimen into small pieces before removal); this prevents seeding of the VATS incisions with tumor cells and allows for an intact specimen for pathology examination and cancer staging. Removal of lymph nodes from the mediastinum is not compromised by VATS and remains a cornerstone of the surgical therapy of lung cancer. Visualization is enhanced due to the magnification afforded by the fiberoptic <b>thoracoscope</b> and a 30-degree angle of visualization aids in looking around corners. However, because the incisions are too small to allow passage of the surgeon's hands into the thorax, the surgeon's tactile input is compromised. VATS operations rely on a thorough understanding of pulmonary anatomy to allow for strategically placed incisions (usually 3-5 incisions total). The main advantages of VATS over thoracotomy are that major muscles of the chest wall are not divided and rib spreaders that can lead to rib fractures or costovertebral joint pain are not used. This results in a hospital length of stay after VATS lobectomy generally reported to range from 3-5 days, or roughly half that for lobectomy via thoracotomy.|$|E

40|$|Primary or {{essential}} hyperhidrosis is {{a disorder}} characterized by excessive sweating beyond physiological needs. It {{is a common}} disease (with an incidence of up to 2. 8 %) that causes intense discomfort for patients. Video-assisted thoracoscopic bilateral sympathectomy is an effective surgical treatment with high success rates and improvement in quality of life. In the last decade, the advantages of a single-port thoracoscopic approach have become clear. Problems with intraoperative bleeding management have been solved by using <b>thoracoscopes</b> with integrated electrocautery scissors. In this report, we describe successful transaxillary bilateral single-port thoracoscopic T 2 -T 5 sympathectomy with the VasoView (R) device in three patients with palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. The VasoView (R) device, with its integrated electrocautery scissors, was originally designed for endoscopic vessel harvesting in coronary artery bypass surgery, but it has proven highly effective for single-port thoracoscopic sympathectomy.

50|$|Generally, {{a biopsy}} {{is needed to}} confirm a {{diagnosis}} of malignant mesothelioma. A doctor removes a sample of tissue for examination under a microscope by a pathologist. A biopsy may be done in different ways, depending on where the abnormal area is located. If the cancer is in the chest, the doctor may perform a thoracoscopy. In this procedure, the doctor makes a small cut through the chest wall and puts a thin, lighted tube called a <b>thoracoscope</b> into the chest between two ribs. Thoracoscopy allows the doctor to look inside the chest and obtain tissue samples. Alternatively, the chest surgeon might directly open the chest (thoracotomy). If the cancer is in the abdomen, the doctor may perform a laparoscopy. To obtain tissue for examination, the doctor makes a small incision in the abdomen and inserts a special instrument into the abdominal cavity. If these procedures do not yield enough tissue, an open surgical procedure may be necessary.|$|E
50|$|Through {{two small}} incisions {{in the side}} of the chest, an {{introducer}} is pushed along posterior to the sternum and ribs, and anterior to the heart and lungs. Then a concave stainless steel bar is slipped under the sternum, through the incisions {{in the side of}} the chest. A third, smaller incision is made to insert a <b>thoracoscope</b> (small camera) used to help guide the bar. Taller patients, older patients, or patients requiring extensive correction may receive two or more bars. All bars may be placed through two incisions or additional incisions may be made. The bar is then flipped, and the sternum pops out. To support the bar and keep it in place, a metal plate called a stabilizer may be inserted with the bar on one side of the torso. PDS sutures may also be used in addition to the stabilizer. The stabilizer fits around the bar and into the ribcage. The bar and stabilizer are secured with sutures that dissolve in about six months.|$|E

Patients and methods: From January 2011 to December 2012, 21 patients underwent VATS segmentectomy and 61 underwent VATS lobectomy. Intraoperative blood loss, operating time, postoperative drainage time, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, local recurrence, and survival were compared {{between the two}} groups. Results: The intraoperative blood loss and average hospital stay were less in the segmentectomy group than in the lobectomy group (P 0. 05). Only one patient died because of heart disease.

40|$|Objectives: The {{accurate}} {{diagnosis of}} pleural diseases can present a considerable challenge. Conservative estimates {{suggest that in}} 25 % of patients examined in a general pulmonologist’s practice the pleura was involved. Of these cases, 25 % are unable to {{be attributed to a}} specific diagnosis, even after thoracentesis and closed pleural biopsy. The aim of this work was to evaluate the diagnostic role of medical <b>thoracoscope</b> in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion and to compare the diagnostic yield of rigid versus flexible (the fibreoptic bronchoscope used as a <b>thoracoscope)</b> thoracoscopy. Patients and methods: Forty patients with exudative pleural effusion of undetermined aetiology were enrolled in this study. Ethics: the study was approved by the institutional ethics committee and each patient gave an informed consent to participate in the study. Under conscious sedation and local anaesthesia, both rigid and flexible thoracoscopy were carried out using fibreoptic bronchoscope as a flexible <b>thoracoscope</b> inserted through a metal trocar. The pleural cavity was carefully explored and multiple forceps biopsies were equally taken with both types of thoracoscopes and sent for both histopathological and microbiological examinations. Results: All thoracoscopy procedures were performed safely. The diagnostic yield of flexible <b>thoracoscope</b> and that of rigid <b>thoracoscope</b> was 80 % (32 / 40) and 95 % (38 / 40), respectively. Conclusions: Thoracoscopy using either fibreoptic bronchoscope or rigid <b>thoracoscope</b> is safe and well tolerated.

40|$|Objective: To {{discuss the}} effects of <b>thoracoscope</b> radical {{resection}} of esophageal carcinoma and open radical resection of esophageal carcinoma on cellular immune function, organism's traumatic stress response and complication occurrence rate of patients during the perioperative period. Method: A total of 267 cases with esophageal carcinoma who were admitted in our hospital from June 2010 to June 2015 were selected and were divided into <b>Thoracoscope</b> Group (n= 154) and Open Group (n= 113) based on different therapeutic methods. Patients in <b>Thoracoscope</b> Group were given <b>thoracoscope</b> radical resection of esophageal carcinoma treatment and patients in Open Group were given open radical resection of esophageal carcinoma treatment. Surgery time, bleeding volume in surgery, lymph node dissection numbers, surgery-related complication occurrence rate, stress response 1 d, 6 d before and after surgery and immune function level changes of patients in both groups were observed and compared. Result: comparative difference of cellular immune function levels in both groups at the same point-in-time (1 d, 6 d after surgery) had statistical significance; comparative difference of stress response levels in both groups at the same point-in-time (1 d, 6 d before and after surgery) had no statistical significance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Medical thoracoscopy is a {{valuable}} tool in the investigation and management of pleural disease. It has considerable advantages over conventional blind pleural biopsy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Despite this, the practice of this technique in the UK is limited. Most operators use the rigid <b>thoracoscope,</b> which may be an unfamiliar instrument to respiratory physicians. A semirigid <b>thoracoscope</b> is available but its use has not been possible in the UK as it requires sterilisation with ethylene oxide, which is not approved in this country. The present authors describe herein their experience with the first ever autoclavable semirigid <b>thoracoscope.</b> Medical thoracoscopy using the new instrument was performed in 56 patients between June 2004 and May 2006. All patients had been referred with a unilateral pleural effusion of unknown aetiology, where blind pleural aspiration had failed to yield an answer. Diagnostic samples were taken and talc poudrage performed where appropriate. The instrument was easy to handle and excellent views were obtained. Histologically adequate biopsy samples were obtained in 54 patients. The combination of clinical features, computed tomography findings and thoracoscopic biopsy enabled a definite diagnosis in 49 (90. 7 %) of these patients. There were no complications. The autoclavable semirigid <b>thoracoscope</b> has immense potential in the diagnosis and management of pleural disease. Its diagnostic yield in pleural disease {{is comparable to the}} conventional rigid <b>thoracoscope.</b> It is similar in design to the fibreoptic bronchoscope and respiratory physicians should be able to adapt to its use easily. It is also compatible with existing video processors and light sources available in most endoscopy suites. The fact that this instrument is autoclavable should open the field for its use in the UK as well as in other countries...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivePulmonary segmentectomy {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an operative option for complete resection of early-stage lung cancer in patients with poor pulmonary function. However, identification of anatomic pulmonary segments is sometimes difficult in patients with emphysema. We developed an intraoperative method for identifying intersegmental planes of the lung with high-sensitivity infrared fluorescence imaging after transbronchial injection of indocyanine green. MethodsThe study included 10 patients with early-stage lung cancer who underwent thoracoscopic segmentectomy. Under general anesthesia, indocyanine green was injected into the bronchus of target pulmonary segments. The target segments of the lung were identified using the indocyanine green fluorescence endoscope (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The intersegmental lines and planes were identified and allowed removal of the segments. To evaluate operative outcomes, we compared the indocyanine green injection group with a retrospective control group with 10 matched-pair patients who underwent traditional thoracoscopic segmentectomy. ResultsAccurate, real-time intraoperative detection of indocyanine green with an infrared <b>thoracoscope</b> was confirmed. Sparing of intersegments was safely performed using both staples and electric cautery. Furthermore, infrared thoracoscopy allowed visualization of any residual portion of resected segments after segmentectomy.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: A transesophageal natural orifice transluminal {{endoscopic}} surgery (NOTES) {{approach has been}} proposed for thoracic and mediastinal access. Similarly to transgastric surgery, serious limitations remain related to creating an esophagotomy and its safe closure. A hybrid approach in thoracic NOTES could work as an intermediate step before pure transesophageal NOTES. We assessed the benefit of hybrid thoracic NOTES for peroral segmental esophagectomy and subsequent complete esophageal anastomosis with a single transthoracic port. METHODS: Two protocols were used to attempt esophago-esophageal anastomosis: ex vivo using a phantom model (n = 5), and in vivo after esophageal mobilization, and segmental esophagectomy achieved using either a gastroscope (flexible) (n = 5) or <b>thoracoscope</b> (rigid) instruments (n = 5). A forward-viewing double-channel endoscope and a transthoracic operative <b>thoracoscope</b> with a working channel were coordinated {{in order to create}} a complete single-layer, end-to-end esophageal anastomosis ex vivo as well as in vivo. Feasibility and anastomosis quality were evaluated by inside and outside assessment of: patency, the incorporation of mucosa in all stitches, and a leak test. RESULTS: Anastomosis was achieved in all ex vivo experiments and thoracoscopically-led in vivo procedures. All anastomoses were patent, allowing distal passage of the endoscope, with mucosa incorporation. In in vivo experiments, a leak was detected in three animals and corrected with additional stitching. CONCLUSIONS: Peroral esophageal anastomosis with a single transthoracic trocar is feasible, which may represent a step forward in thoracic NOTES...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the {{dynamics}} of lymphatic drainage of the pleural cavity to understand the mechanism of malignant pleural effusion. Methods: We injected carbon particles into the pleural cavity of monkeys subjected to general anesthesia. We then observed the parietal pleura with a video-assisted <b>thoracoscope</b> and scanning and transmission electron microscopes to examine the regions of the parietal pleura where the carbon particles had been absorbed. Results: The video-assisted <b>thoracoscope</b> showed that the carbon particles had gone directly to the costal, mediastinal, and diaphragmatic pleura by 10 to 15 minutes after injection. From the scanning and transmission electron microscopes, we found that the parietal pleura in the costal and mediastinal regions consisted of 3 elements: a layer of small mesothelial cells, the macula cribriformis, and lymphatic lacunae. Stomata (3 - 5 μm in diameter) were found between the small mesothelial cells. The macula cribriformis was composed of densely packed collagen fibrils and had many foramina (3 - 10 μm in diameter). Intrapleurally injected carbon particles were carried into the lymphatic lacunae via the stomata and vesicles of the mesothelial cells and the foramina of the macula cribriformis. The lymphatic lacunae filled with carbon particles were richly distributed in both the anterior costal pleura and the mediastinal pleura. Conclusion: We suggest that the mesothelial stomata and the macula cribriformis are structures essential to the absorption of macromolecules and cellular elements from the pleural cavity into the lymphatic system.

This problem is most commonly treated by pericardiocentesis alone, pericardiotomy being reserved for cases of recurrence and pericardiectomy for those patients presenting with constrictive pericarditis. A series of 16 patients treated with pericardial fenestration via a <b>thoracoscope</b> is presented. Pericardial and pleural biopsies were performed, together with cytological and biochemical {{analysis of the}} pericardial and pleural fluid where present. This procedure established the aetiology of effusion in all cases. In malignant pericardial effusion bleomycin was used for pericardial sclerosis.

40|$|ObjectiveCurrent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery {{training}} models rely {{on animals}} or mannequins to teach procedural skills. These approaches lack inherent teaching/testing capability and {{are limited by}} cost, anatomic variations, and single use. In response, we hypothesized that video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery right upper lobe resection could be simulated in a virtual reality environment with commercial software. MethodsAn anatomy explorer (Maya [Autodesk Inc, San Rafael, Calif] models of the chest and hilar structures) and simulation engine were adapted. Design goals included freedom of port placement, incorporation of well-known anatomic variants, teaching and testing modes, haptic feedback for the dissection, ability to perform the anatomic divisions, and a portable platform. ResultsPreexisting commercial models did not provide sufficient surgical detail, and extensive modeling modifications were required. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery right upper lobe resection simulation is initiated with a random vein and artery variation. The trainee proceeds in a teaching or testing mode. A knowledge database currently includes 13 anatomic identifications and 20 high-yield lung cancer learning points. The “patient” {{is presented in the}} left lateral decubitus position. After initial camera port placement, the endoscopic view is displayed and the <b>thoracoscope</b> is manipulated via the haptic device. The <b>thoracoscope</b> port can be relocated; additional ports are placed using an external “operating room” view. Unrestricted endoscopic exploration of the thorax is allowed. An endo-dissector tool allows for hilar dissection, and a virtual stapling device divides structures. The trainee’s performance is reported. ConclusionsA virtual reality cognitive task simulation can overcome the deficiencies of existing training models. Performance scoring is being validated as we assess this simulator for cognitive and technical surgical education...|$|E
40|$|Background Spinal canal dumbbell-shaped tumor {{growing to}} spinal canal and paravertebral, may {{compress}} {{the spinal cord}} and invade the spinal canal, intervertebral foramen and spinal structures, and cause clinical symptoms. The dumbbell-shaped tumor in the thoracic vertebrae can penetrate thorax to cause pleural irritation symptoms, such as chest pain, short breath, cough and so on. As the microsurgical technique and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery can remarkably reduce the harm, retrospective analysis was performed in order to explore the combined treatment of microsurgical proceduse and thoracoscopic resection for spinal canal dumbbell-shaped tumor and to summarize the surgical experience. Methods and Results There were 4 cases with thoracic spinal canal dumbbell-shaped tumors, among them 3 were typeⅡ and one was typeⅢ. In the surgery, 3 patients with typeⅡ underwent posterior mediastinal tumor resection under <b>thoracoscope,</b> and then underwent hemilaminectomy through posterior median approach. Under microscope, the tumors were entirely excised with excellent exporsure. The patient with type Ⅲ was firstly subjected to spinal canal tumor excision, and then entirely excisied intrathoracic tumor under <b>thoracoscope.</b> In 2 cases, the uncommon feelings became worse after surgery, but became better after half a year. In one case, the weakness of two legs, chest pain and cough were remarkably relieved, and in one case dry cough obliterated. During the follow-up period, there was no serious complication or death, and MRI revealed that the tumors were entirely excised without relapse. Conclusion The posterior median hemilaminectomy combined with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery to treat spinal canal dumbbell?shaped tumors has following advantages: small trauma, few complication, good effectiveness and rapid recovery, {{which can be used}} as preferred treatment for spinal canal dumbbell-shaped tumor...|$|E
40|$|Mini-invasive {{thoracic}} technique mainly {{refers to}} a technique involving the significant reduction of the chest wall access-related trauma. Notably, <b>thoracoscope</b> is the chief representative. The development of <b>thoracoscope</b> technique is characterized by: developing from direct peep to artificial lighting, then combination with image and video technique in equipments; technically developing from diagnostic to therapeutic approaches; developing from simpleness to complexity in application scope; and usually developing together with other techniques. At present, the widely used mini-invasive thoracic surgery refers to the mini-open thoracic surgery performed mainly by using some instruments to control target tissues and organs based on the vision associated with multi-limb coordination, which may be hand-assisted if necessary. The mini-invasive thoracic surgery consists of three approaches including video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), video-assisted Hybrid and hand-assisted VATS. So far the mini-invasive thoracic technique has achieved great advances due to the development in instruments of mini-invasive thoracic surgery which has the following features: instruments of mini-invasive thoracic surgery appear {{to be safe and}} practical, and have successive improvement and diversification in function; the specific instruments of open surgeries has been successively developed into dedicated instruments of endoscopic surgery; the application of endoscopic mechanical suture device generates faster fragmentation and reconstruction of organ tissues; the specific delicated instruments of endoscopic surgery have rapid development and application; and the simple instruments structurally similar to the conventional instruments are designed according to the mini-incison. In addition, the mini-invasive thoracic technique is widely used in five aspects including diseases of pleura membrane and chest wall, lung diseases, esophageal diseases, mediastinal diseases and heart diseases. However, there remain many problems in specifications and trainings, economic cost, conservation and innovation. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to these problems. Nevertheless, the promotion of thoracic surgery appears promising in the future...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery thymectomy {{has been}} used in the {{treatment}} of Myastenia Gravis and thymomas (coexisting or not). In natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, new approaches to the thorax are emerging as alternatives to the classic transthoracic endoscopic surgery. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the feasibility and reliability of hybrid endoscopic thymectomy (HET) using a combined transthoracic and transesophageal approach. METHODS: Twelve consecutive in vivo experiments were undertaken in the porcine model (4 acute and 8 survival). The same procedure was assessed in a human cadaver afterward. For HET, an 11 -mm trocar was inserted in the 2 nd intercostal space in the left anterior axillary line. A 0 ° 10 -mm <b>thoracoscope</b> with a 5 -mm working channel was introduced. Transesophageal access was created through a submucosal tunnel using a flexible gastroscope with a single working channel introduced through the mouth. Using both flexible (gastroscope) and rigid (<b>thoracoscope)</b> instruments, the mediastinum was opened; the thymus was dissected, and the vessels were ligated using electrocautery alone. RESULTS: Submucosal tunnel creation and esophagotomy were performed safely without incidents in all animals. Complete thymectomy was achieved in all experiments. All animals in the survival group lived for 14 days. Thoracoscopic and postmortem examination revealed pleural adhesions on site of the surgical procedure with no signs of infection. Histological analysis of the proximal third of the esophagus revealed complete cicatrization of both mucosal defect and myotomy site. In the human cadaver, we were able to replicate all the procedure even though we were not able to identify the thymus. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid endoscopic thymectomy is feasible and reliable. HET could be regarded as a possible alternative to classic thoracoscopic approach for patients requiring thymectomy.

40|$|The use of {{near-infrared}} (NIR) {{fluorescence imaging}} with indocyanine green (ICG) for sentinel lymph node (SN) mapping {{has been investigated}} in lung cancer; however, {{this has not been}} fully adapted for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). The aim of our study was to develop a minimally invasive SN mapping integrating pre-operative electro-magnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) -guided transbronchial ICG injection and intraoperative NIR thoracoscopic imaging. A NIR <b>thoracoscope</b> was used to visualize ICG fluorescence. ICG solutions in a 96 -well plate and ex vivo porcine lungs were examined to optimize ICG concentrations and injection volumes. Transbronchial ICG injection (n= 4) was assessed in comparison to a traditional transpleural approach (n= 3), where after thoracotomy an ICG solution (100 μL at 100 μg/mL) was injected into the porcine right upper lobe for SN identification. For further translation into clinical use, transbronchial ICG injection prior to thoracotomy followed by NIR thoracoscopic imaging was validated (n= 3). ENB was used for accurate targeting in two pigs with a pseudo-tumor. The ICG fluorescence at 10 μg/mL was the brightest among various concentrations, unchanged by the distance between the <b>thoracoscope</b> and ICG solutions. Injected ICG of no more than 500 μ L showed a localized fluorescence area. All 7 pigs showed a bright paratracheal lymph node within 15 minutes post-injection, with persistent fluorescence for 60 minutes. The antecedent transbronchial ICG injection succeeded in SN identification in all 3 cases at the first thoracoscopic inspection within 20 minutes post-injection. The ENB system allowed accurate ICG injection surrounding the pseudo-tumors. ENB-guided ICG injection followed by NIR thoracoscopy was technically feasible for SN mapping in the porcine lung. This promising platform may be translated into human clinical trials and is suited for MIS...|$|E

Background and Study Aims Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) {{has been}} {{widespread}} as the better approach {{to carry out}} pulmonary lobectomy. Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is being assessed {{as an alternative to}} the transthoracic endoscopic surgery. We designed this study to test the feasibility of peroral transesophageal right upper pulmonary lobectomy with the assistance of a single transthoracic trocar. Material and Methods In ten anesthetized pigs (35 - 45 Kg), we performed right upper pulmonary lobectomy using a forward viewing single-channel gastroscope (introduced perorally) and an operative <b>thoracoscope</b> with a 5 mm working channel (introduced through a single-transthoracic 10 mm port) (Karl Storz). After introducing the gastroscope throughout an oroesophageal overtube into the esophagus, a 1 cm transverse esophagotomy was carried out in the upper third using an ESD-knife under <b>thoracoscope</b> control. Anatomic dissection of the right upper hilum was performed using flexible (gastroscope) and rigid (<b>thoracoscope)</b> instruments. After individual dissection, right upper pulmonary arteries, veins and correspondent bronchus were independently stapled using a 45 -mm long, linear endostapler (EndoPath®, Ethicon Endo-Surgery) introduced through the oroesophageal overtube. After completing the lobe resection using an endoscopic snare with cautery, the specimen was extracted retrogradely through the mouth. The esophagotomy was stitched and tied using Endo Stitch™ (Covidien) and a long knot-pusher, which were handled through the oroesophageal overtube. Results Esophagotomy was performed safely in all animals. Dissection of the right upper lobe hilum elements (arteries, veins and bronchus) was also carried out in all animals without significant problems. Oroesophageal handling of the endostapplers for independent ligation of the hilum elements under transthoracic imaging was surprisingly feasible, reasonably easy to perform and reliable in 7 cases. In two cases ligation of the vessels was en bloc. In one case, severe hemorrhage occurred from incomplete vein ligation, although we could control it using electrocoagulation. Esophagotomy closure was feasible but its reliability was not tested in survival studies. All but one animal were kept alive until the end of the acute experiment when they were sacrificed. Conclusions Transesophageal right upper pulmonary lobectomy using single transthoracic trocar assistance is feasible and it may represent a step towards scarless pulmonary lobectomy. Additional survival studies are necessary to test the reliability of this procedure. Apresentador: João Moreira-Pinto, Médico Interno de Cirurgia Pediátrica, CHP...|$|E
