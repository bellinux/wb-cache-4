25|$|<b>Transmission</b> <b>{{electron}}</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{are often}} used in electron diffraction mode. The advantages of electron diffraction over X-ray crystallography are that the specimen {{need not be a}} single crystal or even a polycrystalline powder, and also that the Fourier transform reconstruction of the object's magnified structure occurs physically and thus avoids the need for solving the phase problem faced by the X-ray crystallographers after obtaining their X-ray diffraction patterns of a single crystal or polycrystalline powder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{are capable}} of imaging at a {{significantly}} higher resolution than light microscopes, owing to the smaller de Broglie wavelength of electrons. This enables the instrument to capture fine detail—even {{as small as a}} single column of atoms, which is thousands of times smaller than a resolvable object seen in a light microscope. Transmission electron microscopy is a major analytical method in the physical, chemical and biological sciences. TEMs find application in cancer research, virology, and materials science as well as pollution, nanotechnology and semiconductor research.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} application {{area for}} generalized transforms involves systems in which high frequency resolution is crucial. For example, darkfield electron optical transforms intermediate between direct and reciprocal space {{have been widely}} used in the harmonic analysis of atom clustering, i.e. in the study of crystals and crystal defects. Now that <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are capable of providing digital images with picometer-scale information on atomic periodicity in nanostructure of all sorts, the range of pattern recognition and strain/metrology applications for intermediate transforms with high frequency resolution (like brushlets and ridgelets) is growing rapidly.|$|E

Recently a new low voltage <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> has been introduced that operates at variable voltage ranges between 6-25kV.|$|R
25|$|In 1932, Ernst Lubcke of Siemens & Halske {{built and}} {{obtained}} images from a prototype electron microscope, applying concepts {{described in the}} Rudenberg patent applications. Five years later (1937), the firm financed the work of Ernst Ruska and Bodo von Borries, and employed Helmut Ruska (Ernst’s brother) to develop applications for the microscope, especially with biological specimens. Also in 1937, Manfred von Ardenne pioneered the scanning electron microscope. The first commercial electron microscope was produced in 1938 by Siemens. The first North American electron microscope was constructed in 1938, at the University of Toronto, by Eli Franklin Burton and students Cecil Hall, James Hillier, and Albert Prebus; and Siemens produced a transmission electron microscope (TEM) in 1939. Although contemporary <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are capable of two million-power magnification, as scientific instruments, they remain based upon Ruska’s prototype.|$|E
25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes,</b> image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in scanning probe microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.|$|E
500|$|Two main {{types of}} {{electron}} microscopes exist: transmission and scanning. <b>Transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> function like overhead projectors, with {{a beam of}} electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge-coupled device. [...] Scanning electron microscopes rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.|$|E

500|$|Viruses {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} {{of shapes and}} sizes, called morphologies. In general, viruses are much smaller than bacteria. Most viruses that have been studied have a diameter between 20 and 300 nanometres. Some filoviruses have a total length of up to 1400nm; their diameters are only about 80nm. Most viruses cannot be seen with an optical microscope so scanning and <b>transmission</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are used to visualise virions. To increase the contrast between viruses and the background, electron-dense [...] "stains" [...] are used. These are solutions of salts of heavy metals, such as tungsten, that scatter the electrons from regions covered with the stain. When virions are coated with stain (positive staining), fine detail is obscured. Negative staining overcomes this problem by staining the background only.|$|E
