The thread would easily crush and allow play to develop, and the off-centre loading would fail the lugs at much lower loads than if the hole was cylindrical. Cochrane added that the bolt would bend permanently (and slacken its <b>tiebar</b> to about the extent that had {{had to be taken}} up by packing pieces) at an even lower loading than that at which the cotters would deform; he had found some bent <b>tiebar</b> bolts as apparent confirmation.|$|E

40|$|Three {{types of}} {{concrete}} pavements {{are commonly used}} (1) : • Jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) has transverse joints spaced less than about 5 m apart and no reinforcing steel in the slab. JPCP may, however, contain steel dowel bars across transverse joints and steel <b>tiebars</b> across longitudinal joints. • Jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP) has transverse joints spaced about 9 to 12 m apart and contains steel reinforcement in the slab. The steel reinforcement is designed to hold tightly together any transverse cracks that develop in the slab. Dowel bars and <b>tiebars</b> are also used at all transverse and longitudinal joints, respectively. • Continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) has no regularly spaced transverse joints and contains more steel reinforcement than JRCP. The high steel content influences the development of transverse cracks within an acceptable spacing and serves to hold these transverse cracks tightly together. Transverse reinforcing steel is often used. According to a 1999 survey, at least 70 {{percent of the state}} highway agencies in the United States use JPCP. About 20 percent of the states build JRCP, and about six or seven state highway agencies build CRCP, most notably on high-volume, urban roadways. A few states report that they do not build concrete pavements (2). CONCRETE PAVEMENT DESIGN METHODS The most widely used procedure for design of concrete pavements is specified in the Guid...|$|R

Addition of excess MeNC led to sequential insertions of two further MeNC molecules into the Ge–C bond.

These reactions are proposed to take place with the initial coordination of the olefin and isomerization to a carbene form and subsequent insertion into the Ir–C(phenylic) bond and a final α-H elimination. The reaction with ethoxyethylene does not afford the corresponding derivative but rather gives a mixture of three, isolable, compounds, which are proposed to derive from three different types of insertion of the olefin, one of them a typical 1, 2 -insertion and the other two as (different) carbenes.

5000|$|Samples of {{the bridge}} materials, both cast and wrought iron, were tested by David Kirkaldy, as {{were a number of}} bolts, <b>tiebars,</b> and {{associated}} lugs. Both the wrought and cast iron had good strength, while the bolts [...] "were of sufficient strength and proper iron." [...] However, both ties and sound lugs failed at loadings of about 20 tons, well below what had been expected. Both ties and lugs were weakened by high local stresses where the bolt bore on them. Four of the fourteen lugs tested were unsound, having failed at lower than expected loadings. Some column top lugs outlasted the wrought iron, but the bottom lugs were significantly weaker.|$|R

Pole - called by Bouch's counsel - agreed. Bouch said if he had known the holes were cast conical he would have had them bored or reamed.

40|$|The {{analogy between}} {{cationic}} group 10 metal−phosphenium complexes and Fischer carbenes has been formalized through structural and reactivity studies and by energy decomposition analysis (EDA) of the M−P bond. The studied compounds were the three-coordinate, 16 -electron species [(NHPMes) M(PPh 3) 2]OTf (M = Pt (1) and Pd (2); [NHPMes]+ is the N-heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) cation, [tiebar above startPN(2, 4, 6 -Me 3 -C 6 H 2) CH 2 CH 2 <b>tiebar</b> above endN(2, 4, 6 -Me 3 -C 6 H 2) ]+, OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate); these {{were made by}} reaction of [NHPMes]OTf with M(PPh 3) 4. The metal−phosphenium bond in both compounds was dominated by metal-to-ligand π-donation. This differed from the M−C bonds in the analogous N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes, (NHCMes) M(PPh 3) 2 (M = Pt (6), Pd (7)), which were instead predominantly σ-type. Structural determination of 1 by X-ray crystallography revealed the shortest yet reported Pt−P bond of 2. 107 (3) Å, consistent with significant double-bond character, and trigonal planar geometries at both the P-atom within the [NHPMes]+ ligand (∑(angles) = 359. 99 °) and at the Pt-atom (∑(angles) = 360. 00 °), which indicated that 1 was better described as a Pt(0) −phosphenium {{rather than as a}} Pt(II) −phosphide. Reactions of 1 and 2 with excess PMe 3 cleanly gave the four-coordinate species [(NHPMes) M(PMe 3) 3]OTf (M = Pt (3) and Pd (4)), while reaction of 1 with bis(diphenylphosphino) ethane (dppe) gave [(NHPMes) Pt(dppe-κ 2 P) (dppe-κP) ]OTf (5).

50|$|The bedrock {{actually}} lay {{much deeper}} than the trial borings had shown, and Bouch had to redesign the bridge, with fewer piers and correspondingly longer span girders. The pier foundations were now constructed by sinking brick-lined wrought-iron caissons onto the riverbed, and filling these with concrete. To reduce the weight these had to support, Bouch used open-lattice iron skeleton piers: each pier had multiple cast-iron columns taking {{the weight of the}} bridging girders. Wrought iron horizontal braces and diagonal <b>tiebars</b> linked the columns in each pier to provide rigidity and stability. The basic concept was well known, but for the Tay Bridge, the pier dimensions were constrained by the caisson. For the higher portion of the bridge, there were 13 girder spans. In order to accommodate thermal expansion, at only 3 of their 14 piers was there a fixed connection from the pier to the girders. There were therefore 3 divisions of linked high girder spans, the spans in each division being structurally connected to each other, but not to neighbouring spans in other divisions. The southern and central divisions were nearly level, but the northern division descended towards Dundee at gradients of up to 1 in 73.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the bridge}} {{extended}} {{out into the}} river, it became clear (December 1873) that the bedrock really lay much deeper; too deep {{to act as a}} foundation for the bridge piers. Bouch redesigned it quickly {{to reduce the number of}} piers and correspondingly increase the span of the girders. The pier foundations were no longer taken down to bedrock; instead they were constructed by sinking brick-lined wrought-iron caissons onto the riverbed, removing sand until the caissons rested upon the consolidated gravel layer which had been misreported as rock, and then filling the caissons with concrete. [...] To reduce the weight the ground under the caissons would have to support, the brick piers were replaced by open lattice iron skeleton piers (each pier had multiple cast-iron columns taking the weight of the bridging girders, with wrought iron horizontal braces and diagonal <b>tiebars</b> linking the columns of the pier to give rigidity and stability). The basic concept was well known, having been used first by Kennard in the Crumlin Viaduct in South Wales in 1858; Bouch had used it for viaducts (notably the Belah Viaduct (1860)) on the South Durham & Lancashire Union Railway line over Stainmore, but for the Tay Bridge, even with the largest practicable caissons the pier dimensions were significantly constrained by the caisson. Bouch’s pier design set 6 columns in a hexagon; this maximised the pier width but not the amount of diagonal bracing directly resisting sideways forces.|$|R
50|$|Brunel {{also looked}} at novel track forms, and decided to use a {{continuously}} supported rail. Using longitudinal timbers under each rail, he achieved a smoother profile while not requiring such a strong rail section, and he used a shallow bridge rail for the purpose. The wider, flat foot also meant that the chair needed by the bullhead section could be dispensed with. The longitudinal timbers needed to be kept at the proper spacing to retain the gauge correctly, and Brunel achieved this by using timber transoms - transverse spacers - and iron tie-bars. The whole assembly {{was referred to as}} the baulk road - railwaymen usually call their track a road. Initially, Brunel had the track tied down to timber piles to prevent lateral movement and bounce, but he had overlooked the fact that the made ground, on which his track was supported between piles, would settle. The piles remained stable and the ground between them settled so that his track soon had an unpleasant undulation, and he had to have the piles severed, so that the track could settle more or less uniformly. A variant of the baulk road can still be seen today on many older under-bridges where no ballast was provided. The design varies considerably, but in many cases longitudinal timbers are supported directly on the cross-girders, with transoms and <b>tiebars</b> to retain the gauge, but of course with modern rails and base-plates or chairs. The longitudinal sleepers are somewhat similar to modern-day Ladder track.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of recycled concrete aggregate requires a simple, well defined process. Concrete pavement recycling {{is a relatively}} simple process that involves breaking, removing and crushing hardened concrete from an acceptable source to produce recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The formal process of RCA production typically involves an initial evaluation of the existing source concrete; pavement preparation, which may include removal of an asphalt overlay; pavement breaking, removal and transport to a processing facility; removal of any embedded steel such as dowel bars, <b>tiebars,</b> reinforcing bar, or wire mesh; crushing and sizing operations {{similar to those used}} for virgin aggregate production; beneficiation {{to improve the quality of}} the RCA, if necessary; and stockpiling of the freshly produced RCA. If desired, the RCA also can be produced in-place in the field. More about these topics is available in ACPA’s EB 043 P, “Recycling Concrete Pavements. ” The major steps in the {{production of}} recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) from concrete pavement are: evaluation of the source concrete; preparation of the slab; breaking and removing the concrete; removal of any embedded steel; crushing the concrete and sizing the RCA; beneficiation, if necessary; and stockpiling the RCA. Evaluation of Source Concrete The first step in producing RCA from a concrete pavement is to determine the quality and overall properties of the source concrete. Records of the original concrete components, strength and durability can be useful in determining the potential applications for the RCA produced. Pavement Preparation If the RCA being produced is to be considered for use in a new concrete mixture, efforts must be made to minimize the potential for introducing contaminants throughout the production process. Contaminants are generally of much less concern for RCA intended for use in subbase aggregate and fill applications. Potential contaminants in concrete pavement recycling typically include joint sealants, asphalt concrete shoulders and patching materials, reinforcing steel and dowel bars, and soils and foundation materials (NHI 1998). If possible, contaminants should be removed by an accepted method prior to the recycling process. Front-end loaders and dump trucks can easily handle removal and transport of the broken pavement fragments to the crushing site (Figure 2) ...|$|R
