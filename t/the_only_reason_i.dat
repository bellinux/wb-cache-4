500|$|The film's B movie-esque title {{generated}} {{a lot of}} pre-release interest on the Internet. One journalist wrote that Snakes on a Plane is [...] "perhaps the most internet-hyped film of all time". Much of the initial publicity came from a blog entry made by screenwriter Josh Friedman, who had been offered {{a chance to work}} on the script. The casting of Samuel L. Jackson further increased anticipation. At one point, the film was given the title Pacific Air Flight 121, only to have it changed back to the working title at Samuel Jackson's request. In August 2005, Samuel Jackson told an interviewer, [...] "We're totally changing that back. That's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> took the job: I read the title." [...] On March 2, 2006, the studio reverted the title to Snakes on a Plane. New Line hired two additional writers to smooth out the screenplay.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Northern Echo, Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series: [...] "We're not allowed {{to say anything about}} anyone that isn't true. It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. We go back to the recording studio and put one line over another line. ... <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> reckon we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't." [...] He said the series was [...] "well looked after" [...] by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: [...] "I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [...] 'yeah but you can't do that on TV' [...] 'what you’re talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts?? [...] has Tom Cruise seen this?!" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Bruce, [...] "In Yo Face" [...] was {{originally}} titled [...] "Pie in Yo Face", {{but it was}} decided that the final title sounded better. [...] "The Bone" [...] features surf rock-influenced guitars. According to Bruce, [...] "Mike's beat for this was so fuckin' crazy sounding I {{had no idea what the}} fuck to do with it." [...] "To Catch a Predator" [...] was written during the mixing process, when the group realized that the album needed a song [...] "that attacks an evil". Inspired by the television series To Catch a Predator, the song's lyrics describe Violent J luring pedophiles into his house to violently murder them. According to Bruce, [...] "I could easily see myself killing pedophiles in real life and having no guilt. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> don’t do it is because I'd probably get caught. So its nice to live it out through my music." [...] "Boing Boing", a comedic sex-oriented rap, samples audio from a pornographic film which had previously been sampled by the group on their Tunnel of Love EP. Bruce says that the song was intended as a joke. Some fans interpreted the song as Bruce and Utsler calling themselves ugly, while others believed that they were bragging about how many women they have sex with. Bruce commented [...] "We're not sex symbols, especially not me. If there are girls, they’re there to see Shaggy." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Just {{because of}} the {{experience}} around it—it {{has nothing to do}} with a lot of the music—but I have to say my least favorite is All Hope is Gone[...]. So it was really difficult to get that album made in the first place, and it was difficult to get everyone on the same page going out on the road. It was a miserable two years. One of <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> can look back fondly on it is I got to spend a lot of time with Gray. So other than that, the rest of it was so much hard work and pulling teeth, I have a hard time listening to that album without conjuring up terrible memories of what happened." ...|$|R
2500|$|ARMITAGE: They're not {{words on}} which I disagree. I {{think it was}} {{extraordinarily}} foolish of me.

Maybe somewhere down the road. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> ever did anything by my own was because my band wasn't really doing anything. My band has been doing things lately, so I don't really have time to do anything. I kinda focus my energy there [...] Of course, you know, possibilities..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved {{to know what was going}} on inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cried," [...] he explained, [...] "because I {{suddenly}} {{knew that}} my mother was nearing her end. There was no weight, no hurt, in her blows.

5000|$|Agnew {{formed a}} rock combo called the Shadettes in 1961, {{performing}} {{for eight years}} as the band's rhythm guitarist. In 1969 the band needed a new bassist. He once quipped, [...] "I never even wanted to play the bass (laughter). <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> started playing the bass was because there was nobody in Dunfermline who could do it (laughter)." [...] The band became known as Nazareth in 1970.|$|R

2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever since I was a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E
2500|$|On May 21, 2014, Smith {{appeared}} {{along with}} other celebrities in Washington, D.C. at a White House talent show held by Michelle Obama which was organized to raise awareness for Turnaround Arts, a program enacted {{under the guidance of}} the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH) to increase performance and achievement at some of the lowest-ranked schools in the country through arts education. Students from eight schools around the country participated in the show which featured musical theatre, spoken word and interpretative dance. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the event. Smith adopted a school in Greenfield, California also lobbied Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner for increased funding for arts education and that it is a personal issue for him. Smith said [...] "I didn't give a shit about science, math or English when I was in school and music was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> wanted to go. It got me interested in other subjects and I would've never graduated without it. If kids can connect with some sort of art in some way, it will enrich their lives in ways they probably can't fully comprehend at the time." [...] Earlier in the week, Smith was joined by former New York Yankee and musician, Bernie Williams at Savoy Elementary School in Washington, D.C. where together they taught a music class. [...] "These are schools where the kids look down at their feet and have no hope and don't feel like they mean anything. They have no self-worth. They need something. This is not a photo-op and just throwing some money. You really roll your sleeves up and immerse yourself in the school." [...] Smith said.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 April 1964 Springfield issued {{her debut}} album A Girl Called Dusty which {{included}} mostly remakes of her favourite songs. Among the tracks were [...] "Mama Said," [...] "When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes," [...] "You Don't Own Me," [...] and [...] "Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa." [...] The album reached No.6 in the UK in May 1964. The chart hits [...] "Stay Awhile," [...] "All Cried Out," [...] and [...] "Losing You" [...] {{followed the same}} year. The B-side of [...] "Stay Awhile" [...] featured another self-penned track, [...] "Somethin' Special," [...] which AllMusic's Richie Unterberger described as [...] "a first-rate Springfield original". However, Springfield declared: [...] "I don't really {{see myself as a}} songwriter. I don't really like writing... I just don't get any good ideas and the ones I do get are pinched from other records. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> write is for the money – oh mercenary creature!" [...] In 1964, Springfield recorded two Burt Bacharach songs: [...] "Wishin' and Hopin'" [...] – a US Top10 hit – and the emotional [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself," [...] which reached No.3 on the UK chart. The latter song set the standard for much of her later material. In December 1964, Springfield's tour of South Africa with her group The Echoes was controversially terminated, and she was deported, after they performed for an integrated audience at a theatre near Cape Town, which was against the then government's segregation policy. Her contract specifically excluded segregated performances, making her one of the first British artists to do so. In the same year, she was voted the Top Female British Artist {{of the year in the}} New Musical Express poll, topping Lulu, Sandie Shaw, and Cilla Black. Springfield received the award again for the next three years. During 1965, Springfield released three more UK Top40 hits: [...] "Your Hurtin' Kinda Love," [...] "In the Middle of Nowhere," [...] and the Carole King-penned [...] "Some of Your Lovin'." [...] However, these were not included on her next UK album recorded with The Echoes, Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty, which was released in October 1965 and featured songs by Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley, Rod Argent, and Randy Newman, and a cover of the traditional Mexican song, [...] "La Bamba." [...] The album peaked at No.6 on the UK chart.|$|E
500|$|In 1984 McCulloch said, [...] "I think Porcupine was {{a classic}} autobiographical album, the most honest thing that I'd ever written or sung." [...] Talking about how the album made him feel, {{he went on to}} say, [...] "I found the {{material}} from it really heavy to play– like, really oppressive. That's <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>I</b> didn't like the album. The songs were great but it didn't make me happy."
