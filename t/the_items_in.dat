5|$|The game {{implements}} {{an inventory}} system to allow Sam to store any items that the player picks {{up during the}} course of the game. The player may select any of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by clicking on the desired target. Unlike Save the Worlds predecessor, Sam & Max Hit the Road, inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items. Typically, Sam carries a gun that may be used to solve several puzzles.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} about why the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E

5000|$|To {{illustrate}} the concepts, {{we use a}} small example from the supermarket domain. <b>The</b> set of <b>items</b> is [...] and in the table is shown a small database containing <b>the</b> <b>items,</b> where, <b>in</b> each entry, the value 1 means the presence of <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corresponding transaction, and the value 0 represents {{the absence of an}} <b>item</b> <b>in</b> that transaction.|$|R
5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of symbols}} of the U.S. state of Maryland. The {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the list are officially recognized symbols created by an act of the Maryland General Assembly and signed into law by the governor. However, two of the more famous symbols of Maryland, the state motto and the state nicknames, were never made official by the state government. While the state seal derives from the colonial heritage of the state, the majority of official state symbols were designated in the last few decades.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the Blades of Athena, {{a pair of}} blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. Later in the game, Kratos acquires a new weapon, the Arms of Sparta—a spear and shield offering alternative combat options (e.g., Kratos can use the shield for defense and the spear for offense, such as throwing it at distant targets). Kratos gains a special ability, Thera's Bane, that infuses his blades with fire, and {{is similar to the}} Rage ability in previous games, providing increased attack damage that is strong enough to pierce through enemy armor. As with <b>the</b> <b>Items</b> <b>in</b> God of War III, this ability automatically replenishes itself (represented by the Fire meter), allowing further usage. Both the Arms of Sparta and Thera's Bane are used to overcome environmental obstacles (e.g., certain doors require the use of Thera's Bane to open). Kratos learns to use up to three magical abilities, including the Eye of Atlantis, Scourge of Erinys, and the Horn of Boreas, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. The relic Poseidon's Trident is retained from the prior installment, which allows him to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E
5|$|The Liudhard medalet is a gold Anglo-Saxon coin {{or small}} medal found {{some time before}} 1844 near St Martin's Church in Canterbury, England. It {{was part of the}} Canterbury-St Martin's hoard of six items. The coin, along with other items found with it, now resides in the World Museum Liverpool. Although some {{scholarly}} debate exists on whether or not all <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the hoard were from the same grave, most historians who have studied the object conclude that they were buried together as a necklace in a 6th-century woman's grave. The coin is set in a mount so that it could be worn as jewellery, and has an inscription on the obverse or front surrounding a robed figure. The inscription refers to Liudhard, a bishop who accompanied Bertha to England when she married Æthelberht the king of Kent. The reverse side of the coin has a double-barred cross, or patriarchal cross, with more lettering.|$|E

30|$|A second {{focus group}} {{meeting with the}} same {{previously}} consulted experts was carried out to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>items</b> included <b>in</b> NutriQoL® version 0. For each <b>item,</b> participants rated <b>the</b> clarity of the wording, the frequency of occurrence in routine clinical practice, the importance of <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HRQoL and the relevance of <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> therapeutic decisions. Participants scored clarity, frequency, importance and relevance on a 5 -point Likert scale (1 [*]=[*]not clear/ frequent/important/relevant and 5 [*]=[*]very clear/ frequent/important/relevant). <b>The</b> <b>items</b> remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire if clarity, frequency, relevance and importance were high, or if clarity, relevance and importance were high even though the frequency was low. In cases of high score for frequency, relevance and importance with a low score for clarity, the wording of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> was modified to improve this feature [15, 17]. High scores were those above the 25 th percentile. Based on this assessment, version 1 of the questionnaire was issued.|$|R
25|$|As {{the first}} digital {{platform}} in Turkey {{that covers the}} whole permanent collection in a museum, digitalSSM has also a primary role in {{the preservation of the}} cultural legacy.

Failure because of items easily replaceable, such as tyres or windscreen wiper blades, may not be appealed against, as it cannot be adequately determined if they were the ones fitted at the time of inspection.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010, it was {{reported}} that approximately 42 Buddhist relics have been discovered in Mes Aynak of the Logar Province in Afghanistan, which is south of Kabul. Some of these items date back to the 2nd century according to Archaeologists. Some Buddhist sites were found in Ghazni. <b>The</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> Logar include two Buddhist temples (Stupas), Buddha statues, frescos, silver and gold coins and precious beads.|$|E

25|$|Common {{opinion of}} the mass disk {{distribution}} is also reflected in some popular media. For example, in episode 120 ("Tiki Lounge") of Malcolm in the Middle, Malcolm complains that the booster club auction items are all embarrassingly worthless. One of <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the auction is an AOL startup disk. This sentiment is also recorded in Urban Dictionary, where listed uses for the disks include flying disks, pizza cutters, sun catchers, and microwave fodder.|$|E
25|$|A limited collector's edition was {{launched}} with the game. It includes a SteelBook case, a hard cover art book, and a digital {{copy of the}} game's soundtrack. The soundtrack was released separately on April 21, 2015. The European exclusive Nightmare Edition included physical items such as a quill and ink set, {{as well as all}} <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the collector's edition. An Asian edition includes a letter opener modeled off of the in-game weapon, the Kirkhammer. A PlayStation 4 bundle is also available in Asian regions.|$|E
