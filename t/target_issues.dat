These new shares usually have severe redemption provisions, such as allowing them to be converted into {{a large number}} of common shares if a takeover occurs. This immediately dilutes the percentage of the target owned by the acquirer, and makes it more expensive to acquire 50% of the target's stock.|$|E

50|$|The most {{significant}} {{outcome of the}} conference was the official signing of CEDAW by the delegates at the opening ceremony. The conference adopted the official World Programme of Action with a vote of with ninety-four favorable votes, twenty-two abstentions, and four opposed—Australia, Canada, Israel and the United States. It included sections to create women's bureaus or agencies, defined the roles of NGO and grassroots organizations, and established <b>target</b> <b>issues</b> countries were to monitor. Those issues included child care, households headed by women, migrants, rural women, unemployment, and youth. The Programme also included a section regarding water insecurity, but the {{most significant}} changes to the previous Plan of Action were sections devoted to ensuring equal access to education, employment opportunities, and adequate health care. The Conference established the Third World Conference on Women {{for the end of}} the decade to be hosted in Nairobi, Kenya in 1985 with a back up location in Tokyo.|$|E
5000|$|The World Health Organization, in {{conjunction}} with the Food and Agriculture Organization, published guidelines that can effectively be represented in a food pyramid relating to objectives to prevent obesity, chronic diseases and dental caries based on meta-analysis [...] though they represent it as a table rather than a [...] "pyramid". The structure is similar in some respects to the USDA food pyramid, but there are clear distinctions between types of fats, and a more dramatic distinction where carbohydrates are split on the basis of free sugars versus sugars in their natural form. Some food substances are singled out due to the impact on the <b>target</b> <b>issues</b> the [...] "pyramid" [...] is meant to address, while in a later revision, some recommendations are omitted since they follow automatically from other recommendations while other sub-categories are added. The reports quoted here explain that where there is no stated lower limit in the table below, there is no requirement for that nutrient in the diet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Answers to {{attitude}} {{questions in}} surveys can vary markedly {{depending on the}} preceding items in the questionnaire. This study concerns such context effects. More than 1, 100 re-spondents were asked about six <b>target</b> <b>issues</b> in a telephone sur-vey. Before answering the target questions, most of the respon-dents had been asked about one of two sets of related issues; the remainder received unrelated, "neutral " context items. For {{five of the six}} <b>target</b> <b>issues,</b> the two groups receiving different sets of context items differed significantly in their answers to the target questions. However, only one of the substantive context groups differed significantly from the group that received the neutral context items. Additional results indicated that context effects were larger when respondents reported that their beliefs about the target issue were both mixed and important. Coding of open-ended responses to follow-up questions suggested that the con-text items may have changed how respondents thought about the <b>target</b> <b>issues.</b> Context effects appear to arise through several distinct processes. Ac-cording to Tourangeau and Rasinski (1988), answers to attitude ques-tions are produced in several stages (involving the comprehension of the item, retrieval of relevant material from memory, formation of an overall judgment, and selection of a response), and the outcome o...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses social {{movement}} theory to examine {{one way in}} which secondary stakeholders outside the corpo-ration may influence organizational processes, even if they are excluded from participating in legitimate chan-nels of organizational change. Using data on activist protests of U. S. corporations during 1962 – 1990, we exam-ine the effect of protests on abnormal stock price returns, an indicator of investors ’ reactions to a focal event. Empirical analysis demonstrates that protests are more influential when they <b>target</b> <b>issues</b> dealing with critical stakeholder groups, such as labor or consumers, and when generating greater media coverage. Corporate tar-gets are less vulnerable to protest when the media has given substantial coverage to the firm prior to the protest event. Past media attention provides alternative informa...|$|E
40|$|Hamsters inoculated {{with the}} TC- 83 vaccine strain of Venezuelan {{encephalitis}} (VEE) virus were protected against a normally lethal challenge by virulent VEE virus, strain 68 U 2 ol, inoculated 3 o h after vaccination. Protection {{was correlated with}} significantly decreased levels of challenge virus in <b>target</b> <b>issues</b> (spleen a d bone marrow). Inhibition of challenge virus replication was correlated more closely with the interferon concentrations in spleen and bone marrow than with the vaccine virus infectivities in these tissues {{at the time of}} challenge. The induction of early defence mechanisms involves the efficient interaction of virus with the spleen; although this interaction is more efficient for TC- 83 vaccine, virulent VEE viruses are sensitive to the induced protective mechanism. Interferon appears to be a mediator of this mechanism...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of the}} implementation of a small-scale critical media literacy curriculum unit focused on gender stereotypes, especially as they pertain to occupations. The research question was whether students exposed to the critical media literacy (CML) curriculum were more likely than students not exposed to believe: that women experience discrimination in the workplace; that the media constructs stereotypical messages about women and men, especially regarding occupations; and that the media influences people’s thinking. Participants were students in 5 seventh grade classes, who were exposed to a 4 -workshop curriculum, and students in 5 eighth grades classes, who were not. Methods included a 14 -question pre-post survey and interviews with 4 students before and after implementation of the CML unit. Quantitative and qualitative findings indicate that the CML unit was generally successful at increasing the seventh graders’ understanding of <b>target</b> <b>issues...</b>|$|E

In the 1990s over 200 foreigners and many more Cubans were caught smuggling drugs, and some 31 tons of drugs, mostly United States-bound, were seized by the authorities. The activity created a climate of fear of mistrust in Cuba, known as [...] "desconfianza". Both the American and Cuban governments <b>targeted</b> <b>issues</b> such as migration, drug trafficking, and terrorism.|$|R
40|$|This article {{suggests}} {{new ways}} of approaching clinical-based research {{in an era of}} evidence-based practice. Using the example of self-harm, we identify three distinct problems with current dominant approaches to research in this area. These include insufficient clarity about <b>target</b> <b>issues,</b> an overreliance on predetermined outcomes which prioritise behavioural measures (such as self-harm cessation) and an undue focus on treatment techniques. We argue that clinical research requires flexible, user-centred and practice-based methods, informed by a focus on principles instead of techniques. Therefore, we outline key practice-based principles that we argue need to be embedded within clinical research strategies. We then demonstrate how traditional behavioural approaches to research can be enriched with more qualitative cognitive and emotionally based data. We conclude that such strategies provide thickened, meaningful and context-specific research which is more relevant for service commissioners, clinicians and service users...|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{concern in}} the nation`s stockpile surveillance program in prediction of the lifetimes of the high explosives (HE) and their components as the weapons age. The Department of Energy`s Core Surveillance and Enhanced Surveillance programs specifically <b>target</b> <b>issues</b> of degradation of HE, binders, and plastic-bonded explosives (PBX) for determination of component lifetimes and handling procedures. These material science topics are being addressed at the DOE national laboratories and production plants, including Pantex. The principal goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms of decomposition of HE, plasticizers, plastic polymer binders, and radical stabilizers resulting from exposures to ionizing radiation, heat, and humidity. The following reports the work completed for 1998, including a comprehensive literature review {{about some of the}} materials examined and the laboratory work completed to date. The materials focused on in the laboratory are TATB, Estane 5301, and Irganox 1010...|$|E
40|$|Although {{previous}} {{research has indicated that}} Facebook users, especially young adults, can cultivate their civic values by talking about public matters with their Facebook friends, little research has examined the predictors of political discussion on Facebook. Using survey data from 442 college students in the United States, this study finds that individual characteristics and network size influence college students' expressive behavior on Facebook related to two controversial topics: gay rights issues and politics. In line with previous studies about offline political discussion, the results show that conflict avoidance and ambivalence about <b>target</b> <b>issues</b> are negatively associated with Facebook discussions. Perhaps the most interesting finding is that users who have a large number of Facebook friends are less likely to talk about politics and gay rights issues on Facebook despite having access to increasing human and information resources. Theoretical implications of these findings and future directions are addressed...|$|E
