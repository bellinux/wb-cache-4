5|$|There {{have been}} various {{prisoner}} riots and other disturbances at Fremantle Prison {{over the years}} that it was operational. One of the earliest was in 1854, while major riots which occurred in 1968 and 1988 resulted in damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} no deaths, the fire caused $1.8million of damage, and {{officers}} were injured. In {{the aftermath of the}} riot, there was extensive media attention on Fremantle Prison, and investigative journalists uncovered prior warnings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> authorities of the risk of such an event. The government hastily initiated an enquiry into the incident, and a report was completed within six weeks.|$|E
5|$|At William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, 11planes {{were damaged}} when a hangar collapsed, {{resulting}} in losses of $250,000. Hermann Park was also {{affected by the}} storm, where nine goats began to roam within the park due to a broken fence caused by a fallen limb. 35convicts were freed from the Ramsey Unit state prison during the storm due to the chance of the prison collapsing. However, after the storm, only eight returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison,</b> leaving 27others missing.|$|E

5|$|His mother, Elizabeth Barrow, and {{her three}} {{youngest}} children joined {{her husband in the}} Marshalsea in April 1824. Dickens would visit them every Sunday until he found lodgings in Lant Street, closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison,</b> in the attic of a house belonging to the vestry clerk of St George's Church. This meant he was able to breakfast with his family in the Marshalsea and dine with them after work.|$|E
5|$|In a flashforward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison,</b> {{the ending}} is {{determined}} based on Reza's actions to Hossein throughout the game: if Reza was unpleasant to Hossein, Hajj frees the latter, who begins to choke Reza and demands Bibi's location; if Reza was favorable to Hossein, Hajj shoots and kills the latter, before pointing {{the gun to}} Reza's head and demanding Bibi's location.|$|E
5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison.</b> Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E

5|$|On the Job (abbreviated as OTJ) is a 2013 Philippine neo-noir crime thriller film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Erik Matti. It stars Joel Torre and Gerald Anderson as two contract killing prisoners temporarily released from jail to carry out political executions in a corrupt justice system. Piolo Pascual and Joey Marquez portray law enforcement officers tasked with investigating the drug-related murder case, connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> gun-for-hire business. Michael de Mesa, Leo Martinez, Vivian Velez, Angel Aquino, Shaina Magdayao, and Rayver Cruz play supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|The {{surviving}} wall {{runs along}} an alleyway {{that was part}} of the prison, now called Angel Place. The name Angel Place has led to confusion because there were two alleyways on the north side of the Marshalsea (Angel Court and Angel Alley), the first of which Dickens refers to when giving directions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> remains in 1857. See , which shows Angel Court/Angel Alley near the Borough Goal , marked by the number 2.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the execution, the ten {{condemned}} prisoners who had had their sentences commuted to twelve months' imprisonment were transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> hulk Justitia, moored at Woolwich on the River Thames. Such ships were used as holding areas prior to convicts being transferred to a regular vessel for penal transportation to, at this time, Australia. Residents of Ely tried to hold meetings to complain at this apparent extension of the prisoners' sentences. Despite, or because of, media attention—newspapers of the time took sides depending whether they supported the government or not—the prisoners were returned to Ely gaol; it may all have been a simple mistake by the clerk of the assizes.|$|E

The decision was made <b>to</b> build <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> in London and the land, most of which was swamp, was purchased from John Ellsworth. In 1910, honor inmates were transported from <b>the</b> Ohio Penitentiary <b>to</b> London by railway <b>to</b> construct <b>the</b> <b>prison.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{became a}} {{follower}} of the Báb in Persia in 1845. Three years after the Báb was executed, he was exiled to Baghdad (then {{a part of the}} Ottoman Empire), where in 1863 he proclaimed the Bahá'í Faith when he declared himself He whom God shall make manifest, a messianic figure in Babi theology. Bahá'u'lláh based this announcement on a vision of the Maid of Heaven he claimed to have had while imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, Persia. He would be further exiled to Edirne and ultimately <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> city of Acre, Palestine (present-day Israel), where he died. He wrote , most notably the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, and the Hidden Words.|$|E
5|$|Cayce {{flies to}} Moscow to meet Stella {{in person and}} watch Nora work. Nora is brain damaged from an {{assassination}} attempt and can only express herself through film. At her hotel, Cayce is intercepted and drugged by Dorotea and wakes up in a mysterious prison facility. Cayce escapes; exhausted, disoriented and lost, she nearly collapses as Parkaboy, who upon Cayce's request was flown to Moscow, retrieves her and brings her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> where the film is processed. There Hubertus, Stella and Nora's uncle Andrei, and the latter's security employees are waiting for her. Over dinner with Cayce, the Russians reveal {{that they have been}} spying on her since she posted to a discussion forum speculating that the clips may be controlled by the Russian Mafia. They had let her track the clips to expose any security breaches in their distribution network. The Russians surrender all the information they had collected on her father's disappearance and the book ends with Cayce coming to terms with his absence while in Paris with Parkaboy, whose real name is Peter Gilbert.|$|E

50|$|In 1909 (and coincidentally, upon Captain Hume’s retirement), prison {{reform was}} sought. The Crimes Amendment Act 1910 saw {{teachers}} appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisons,</b> allowed for small wages {{to be paid}} to prisoners, and allowed for prisoners to be released on probation.|$|R
5|$|Croatian Serb forces turned Ovčara into {{a prison}} camp in early October 1991. Aside from the massacre, 3,000–4,000 male prisoners were {{temporarily}} {{held in the}} Ovčara camp {{at some point during}} autumn of 1991 before being transported <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> in Sremska Mitrovica or to the local JNA barracks, which was the transit point for Serbian detention camps such as Stajićevo and Begejci. Following a series of political agreements concluded in 1991 and a ceasefire between the JNA and Croatia in early 1992, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed for peacekeeping in certain parts of Croatia, including Vukovar and its surroundings. It began its deployment in March 1992.|$|E
5|$|Following another Royal Commission {{investigation}} 1911, {{there were}} some rapid changes in prison policy. A new superintendent with outside experience, Hugh Hann, was appointed, {{and supported by the}} newly elected Labor government interested in penal reform. Fremantle Prison was partially used as a military gaol during both world wars. The World War II takeover necessitated the commissioning of Barton's Mill Prison in 1942, which remained opened after the war. Pardelup Prison Farm was another prison outstation established in 1927 to reduce overcrowding at Fremantle. Both facilities were part of reforms made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> system, but significant changes to the operation of Fremantle Prison did not begin until the 1960s. Comptroller General Colin Campbell introduced expedient prisoner assessments, officer training, work release programs, and social workers and welfare officers.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Andy overhears {{the captain}} of the guards, Byron Hadley, {{complaining}} about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the warden begins using him to handle matters for himself and variety of people, including guards from other prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison's decaying library.|$|E
50|$|On 4 September 2013, the Ministry of Justice {{announced}} <b>the</b> decision <b>to</b> convert <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> into {{an immigration}} removal centre for 600 detainees awaiting deportation. <b>The</b> <b>prison</b> closed in November 2013, with all prisoners being transferred to other suitable prisons, and work <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> function of <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> began immediately. <b>The</b> planned re-role came {{as part of}} a wider programme <b>to</b> modernise <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> estate, and <b>the</b> nearby HM <b>Prison</b> Dorchester would be closed in December 2013.|$|R

Entry tickets were charged at RM5.00 for adults and RM2.00 for children (7–17 years old).|$|R
50|$|Lee Arrendale State Prison {{was built}} in 1926 and <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> was named after Lee Arrendale, former Chairman of the Georgia Board of Corrections after {{he and his wife}} were killed in a plane crash. It began its {{existence}} as a TB Hospital and operated till the mid-1950s when it was turned over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Georgia <b>Prison</b> system. Once acquired by the Georgia Department of Corrections, its focus then turned <b>to</b> using <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> <b>to</b> house youthful offenders from ages 18-25. Over a short amount of time, the influx of young, reckless and ruthless inmates lead Lee Arrendale to gain a bad reputation as the second most violent all-men <b>prisons</b> in <b>the</b> state. In 2005, however the Department of Corrections decided <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> an exclusive general purpose women's prison. As a result of the prison's past troubles and reputation for violence, <b>the</b> state decided <b>to</b> make this change <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> <b>prisons</b> status in <b>the</b> state. In March 2006, <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> took in 350 women prisoners from Georgia's overflowing jail system to start this process.|$|R
5|$|Initially {{known as}} the Convict Establishment (or just The Establishment), Fremantle Prison was {{constructed}} between 1851 and 1859, using convict labour. It was initially used for convicts transported from Britain, but {{was transferred to the}} colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison.|$|E
5|$|Mladen {{and other}} members of the Tuzla group were sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> in Zenica. Three months after they were sentenced they were joined by Ilić, whose death penalty had been {{commuted}} to 20 years' imprisonment. In the Zenica prison, each convict had to spend the first three months in solitary confinement. This was very hard on Mladen, who became mentally unwell and became so emaciated that Ilić could hardly recognise him. He recovered and took a course in shoe-making which was given in the prison. Afterwards, he fell seriously ill and had to undergo surgery in the prison hospital. In late 1917, the Austrian authorities pardoned all convicts of the Tuzla group except Ilić. Mladen went to his family in Prijedor. After a medical examination, he was declared unfit for army service due to his surgery and as a result was not drafted into the Austrian army. He entered the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, shortly before the disintegration of Austria-Hungary in November 1918.|$|E
5|$|The White Guards {{executed}} Red Guard {{and party}} leaders, common Red troopers, socialist {{members of the}} Finnish parliament and local Red administration, and those active in the Red terror. The level of killings varied over the months as they conquered southern Finland, and initially did not encounter marked resistance in White Finland. The comprehensive White terror started with the general offensive of the Whites in March 1918, increased constantly, culminated {{in the end of}} the war and ceased soon after the enemy had been sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> camps. During the peak of the executions, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. The White terror hit strong against the Russian soldiers who assisted the Finnish Reds and several Russian non-socialist civilians were killed in the aftermath of the Battle for Viipuri.|$|E
