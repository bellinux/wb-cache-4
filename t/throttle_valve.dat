25|$|The {{two most}} common methods used for testing {{centrifugal}} compressors is to test along lines of constant shaft speed or along lines of constant throttle. If the shaft speed is held constant, test points are taken along a constant speed line by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> is held constant, test points are established by changing speed (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate {{the most common}} method; lines of constant speed. In this case we see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM. The first three speed lines have 6 points each while the highest speed line has five.|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{energy and}} exergy {{investigations}} are reported for a transcritical N 2 O refrigeration cycle with a <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> or with an expander when the gas cooler exit temperature varies from 30 to 55 °C and the evaporating temperature varies from − 40 to 10 °C. The system performance is also {{compared with that}} of similar cycles using CO 2. Results show that the N 2 O expander cycle exhibits a larger maximum cooling coefficient of performance (COP) and lower optimum discharge pressure than that of the CO 2 expander cycle and N 2 O <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> cycle. It is found that in the N 2 O <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> cycle, the irreversibility of the <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> is maximum and the exergy losses of the gas cooler and compressor are ordered second and third, respectively. In the N 2 O expander cycle, the largest exergy loss occurs in the gas cooler, followed by the compressor and the expander. Compared with the CO 2 expander cycle and N 2 O <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> cycle, the N 2 O expander cycle has the smallest component-specific exergy loss and the highest exergy efficiency at the same operating conditions and at the optimum discharge pressure. It is also proven that the maximum COP and the maximum exergy efficiency cannot be obtained at the same time for the investigated cycles...|$|R
50|$|<b>Throttling</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} to control the amount or {{pressure}} of a fluid allowed to pass through, and are designed to withstand the stress and wear caused by this type of operation.

25|$|The Butler Petrol Cycle was a {{three-wheeled}} vehicle, {{with the}} rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, {{all of which were}} state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.|$|E

On 16 September, the three battleships left the convoy in the Atlantic and steamed back to the United States, while other escorts brought the convoy into port.

On 20 September, the port engine stopped after a <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> broke down. She got underway temporarily using an auxiliary throttle before severe vibration forced her to stop for six hours while the main throttle was fixed. Four days later, the ships reached the United States and South Carolina {{made her way to}} Philadelphia for repairs. After South Carolina returned to service, she participated in gunnery training, which continued until Germany signed the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the fighting in Europe. In mid-February 1919, South Carolina began the first of four round trips between the United States and Brest, France to bring American soldiers back from Europe. In the course of the voyages, the last of which concluded in late July, the ship had carried over 4,000 soldiers home. She then went to the Norfolk Navy Yard for a lengthy overhaul.|$|E

The exhaust system was overhauled, using a 4-2-1-2 system, meaning four exhaust outlets merging into two pipes, and then joining into a single pipe before splitting into two enlarged, quieter mufflers, which added a few pounds of weight compared to the first generation Hayabusa.

[...] Whilst the 3.6V8 was able to use 95RON (91AKI) fuel, for the 4.2V8, the more expensive 98RON (93AKI) 'SuperPlus' unleaded was required in order to achieve the quoted power output.

2500|$|The vapor-compression {{cycle is}} used in most {{household}} refrigerators {{as well as in}} many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [...] The thermodynamics of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as Freon enters the compressor as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant entropy and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the vapor pressure at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the condenser which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the expansion valve (also called a <b>throttle</b> <b>valve)</b> where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing flash evaporation and auto-refrigeration of, typically, {{less than half of the}} liquid. [...] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Throttle</b> <b>valves</b> in the updraft {{carburettor}} throat {{were controlled}} by an automatic boost control through the throttle linkage {{to maintain the}} selected manifold pressure with changes in altitude. The valves were only partially open during ground and low-level operation to prevent overboosting of the engine. As air density decreases with increased altitude, the <b>throttle</b> <b>valves</b> were progressively opened {{in response to the}} reducing atmospheric pressure. This system provided full power within engine boost limitations up to the critical altitude of 26000 ft.|$|R
60|$|Then a big, loosely-hung figure came shambling {{down the}} ladder, {{and the second}} withdrew. However, he stood among the columns below, and watched his {{superior}} stop and glance at the tube through which the oil flowed before he went about his work again. Robertson was apparently satisfied, and after slouching round the engine-room and unscrewing a little further the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> which turns steam on to the engines, he crawled back to his greasy room. He sloughed off his jacket and boots, and drawing a bottle from beneath the mattress of his bunk poured himself a stiff drink of whisky before he stretched himself out.|$|E
60|$|For {{a time he}} {{had less}} trouble than he expected; but the channel turned at its outer end and wind and swell would strike at him at an awkward angle, {{when he took the}} bend.

50|$|There is no {{mechanical}} linkage between the accelerator pedal and the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> with electronic throttle control.

But just opening or closing the <b>throttle</b> <b>valve</b> by sending a new signal to the electric motor is an open loop condition and leads to inaccurate control. Thus, most if not all current ETC systems use closed loop feedback systems, such as PID control, whereby the ECU tells the throttle to open or close a certain amount.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{precisely}} controlling {{the position of}} a hydraulic actuator using an on/off valve is developed. Since valves exhibit little power loss when they are fully open or fully closed, the proposed system is more efficient than <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> control and can achieve flow variation without the expense or bulk of a variable displacement pump. Mating a pulse-width-modulated (PWMed) on/off valve with a fixed displacement pump and a smoothing accumulator creates a software enabled variable displacement pump. A drawback of using digital valve control for hydraulic systems is that the relatively low speed of the currently available switching valves results in a significant ripple in the pressure and flow rate. We propose a solution to this problem by using a <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> to shield the actuator from the ripple in the output. This creates an effective load sensing system with the <b>throttling</b> <b>valve</b> used only to provide a small known pressure drop between the supply and the load. This approach is significantly more efficient than the conventional technique of using throttling to vary the full flow.
