5|$|The flycatchers {{are small}} birds <b>that</b> <b>fly</b> {{out from a}} perch to catch insects in the air or from the ground. There are about 120 species worldwide, 11 {{of which have been}} {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{method of}} prey capture is {{by means of}} sticky webs. Varying {{placement}} of webs allows different species of spider to trap different insects in the same area, for example flat horizontal webs trap insects <b>that</b> <b>fly</b> up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap insects in horizontal flight. Web-building spiders have poor vision, but are extremely sensitive to vibrations.|$|E

5|$|Climatic and osmotic {{pressure}} places physiological constraints on organisms, especially those <b>that</b> <b>fly</b> and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure {{and are a}} limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by {{osmotic pressure}} gradients. Water pressure {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} maggots such as blowfly larvae (gentles) and {{bluebottle}} larvae (casters) are bred commercially; they are sold as bait in angling, and as food for carnivorous animals (kept as pets, in zoos, or for research) such as some mammals, fishes, reptiles, and birds It {{has been suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>fly</b> larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens, pigs, and fish. However, consumers {{are opposed to the}} inclusion of insects in their food, and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Wing {{elements}} of Istiodactylus {{were used to}} model pterosaur wing-mechanics by Ernest H. Hankin and David M. S. Watson in 1914, and by Cherrie D. Bramwell and George R. Whitfield in 1974, but the details of istiodactylid flight performance have not been studied. Witton suggested that istiodactylids would have been powerful fliers, due to an enlarged area for downstroke musculature attachments and well-developed pectoral and upper arm bones, and they probably spent {{much time in the}} air. Istiodactylids had wing-membranes connected to shortened bodies with short legs and long forelimbs, which may have created large wings with a high aspect ratio and low wing loadings. The wings of the istiodactylid Nurhachius have been compared to those of modern soaring birds (<b>that</b> <b>fly</b> with little flapping), and may have been ideal for low-energy soaring, which is necessary when searching for carrion. Flight is very important to birds that scavenge, as it helps them locate, reach, and eat carcasses before they are found by terrestrial carnivores. The wings of istiodactylids seem to have been shorter than those of other ornithocheiroids, which may have been more adapted to oceanic soaring; their wings may have been more suited for taking off and landing. Modern birds that soar inland have shorter and deeper wings than those that soar over the ocean; the wing shape of istiodactylids indicate that they may have preferred terrestrial settings.|$|E
