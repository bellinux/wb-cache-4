5000|$|Some audiophiles {{believe that}} the {{clipping}} behavior of vacuum tubes {{with little or no}} negative feedback is superior to that of transistors, in that vacuum tubes clip more gradually than transistors (i.e. soft clipping, and mostly even harmonics), resulting in harmonic distortion that is generally less objectionable. In general though, the distortion associated with clipping is unwanted, and is visible on an oscilloscope even if it is inaudible. Even in a <b>transistorised</b> <b>amplifier</b> with hard clipping, the gain of the transistor will be reducing (leading to nonlinear distortion) as the output current increases and the voltage across the transistor reduces close to the saturation voltage (for bipolar transistors), and so [...] "full power" [...] for the purposes of measuring distortion in amplifiers is usually taken as a few percent below clipping.|$|E
50|$|The Cembalet LH has a case profile with a taper {{towards the}} front. It has tapered {{cylindrical}} legs that mount to {{the underside of}} the case. It has a gold hammertone painted aluminium fascia panel below the keys with a lock fitted centrally. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. The word 'Cembalet LH' appears in gold facing upward on the left hand end of the music support ledge. The ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. It has a transistorised pre-amplifier, a small <b>transistorised</b> power <b>amplifier,</b> two small speakers like Pianet L and a knee lever for volume control.|$|R
50|$|The Pianet L has a stepped {{rectangular}} case profile with no lid. It has black {{tubular steel}} legs that mount to {{the underside of}} the case. It has a black painted aluminium fascia panel below the keys. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. It has a <b>transistorised</b> pre-amplifier and <b>amplifier</b> and a knee lever for volume control. It plays through two small internal speakers or through an external amplifier.Available as model L - mains voltage, and model LB - powered by 5 'D' batteries.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{concerns the}} award {{of a contract}} for the supply of 40 broadband transistorised RF 200 W amplifiers for the LHC transverse damper system. Following a market survey carried out among 30 firms in twelve Member States, a call for tenders (IT- 3171 /SL/LHC) was sent on 20 February 2003 to five firms in four Member States. By the closing date, CERN had received two tenders from two firms in two Member States. The Finance Committee is invited {{to agree to the}} negotiation of a contract with THALES (BE), the lowest bidder complying with the specification, for the supply of 40 broadband transistorised RF 200 W amplifiers for the LHC transverse damper system for a total amount of 1 044 819 euros (1 563 049 Swiss francs), not subject to revision, with an option for an additional 20 broadband <b>transistorised</b> RF <b>amplifiers,</b> for an additional amount of 305 740 euros (457 387 Swiss francs), subject to revision for inflation from 1 July 2005, bringing the total amount to a maximum of 1 350 559 euros (2 020 436 Swiss francs), subject to revision for inflation from 1 July 2005. The amounts in Swiss francs have been calculated using the present rate of exchange. The firm has indicated the following distribution by country of the contract value covered by this adjudication proposal: BE - 90 %; FR - 4 %; DE - 4 %; NL - 2 %...|$|R
