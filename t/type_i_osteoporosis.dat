By using these procedures, almost {{any part of}} the skeleton is accessible to such measurements. Total bone is measured by the absorptiometry procedures, trabecular bone by quantitative computed tomography. Several commercial instruments are available for each technique. For clinical use, if decisions are being made based on measurements in a given patient, preferred measurement sites are the spine (for <b>Type</b> <b>I</b> <b>osteoporosis)</b> and hip (for Type II osteoporosis). The newly introduced dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) procedure allows measurements of the spine and hip with the highest precision and accuracy, the lowest radiation dose, and the shortest scanning time...|$|E

For the spine, evidence of a curvilinear relationship was assessed. Regressions of BMD at the hip as a function of age or time elapsed since menopause, were best fitted by a linear relationship. In the population of postmenopausal women who have experienced a vertebral crush fracture, no relationships were observed between spine BMD and age or Tm but the osteoporotic women had a spine BMD significantly lower compared to age-matched normal controls: Z-score = - 1. 2 +/- 0. 6 (mean +/- SD) (p < 0. 0001).

Proteins were extracted from serum samples by weak cation exchange magnetic beads technology, and mass spectra acquisition was done by MALDI-TOF-MS. The visualization and comparison of data sets, statistical peak evaluation, model recognition, and discovery of biomarker candidates were handled by the proteinchip data analysis system software(ZJU-PDAS). The diagnostic models were established using genetic arithmetic based support vector machine (SVM). The SVM result with the highest Youden Index was selected as the model. Combinatorial Peaks having the highest accuracy in distinguishing different samples were selected as potential biomarker. From the two group serum samples, a total of 133 differential features were selected. Ten features with significant intensity differences were screened. In the pair-wise comparisons, processing of MALDI-TOF spectra resulted in the identification of ten differential features between postmenopausal women with osteopenia and postmenopausal women with normal bone mass. The difference of features by Youden index showed that the highest features had a mass to charge ratio of 1699 and 3038  Da. A diagnosis model was established with these two peaks as the candidate marker, and the specificity of the model is 100  %, the sensitivity was 90  % by leave-one-out cross validation test. The two groups of specimens in SVM results on the scatter plot could be clearly distinguished. The peak with m/z 3038 in the SVM model was suggested as Secretin by TagIdent tool. To provide further validation, the secretin levels in serum were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that is a competitive inhibition enzyme immunoassay technique for the in vitro quantitative measurement of secretin in human serum.|$|E
40|$|A pilot {{clinical}} trial was conducted after the in-vivo and in-vitro studies: Eight subjects fulfilled the inclusion criteria were recruited. However, the liver function tests of three subjects out of eight {{were found to}} be abnormal with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, which was not reported in previous toxicity test. The trial was suspended immediately and a follow-up test showed that the elevated AST and ALT level had reverted back to normal within one month after termination of OPR intake. Although we could not accomplish a RCT, the pilot study revealed potential hepatotoxicity of OPR on human beings and it would raise the safety awareness of investigators on the use of herbal remedies in future clinical studies. After the in-vivo and in-vitro studies, a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled {{clinical trial}} (RCT) was planned. Due to a lack of a Chinese version of instrument to measure osteoporosis-specific quality of life, an English version of the Osteoporosis-Targeted Quality of Life Questionnaire (OPTQoL) was translated into Chinese and linguistically validated according to the standard guideline. The newly formed Chinese OPTQoL can be used {{to assess the impact of}} new interventions on quality of life among Chinese osteoporosis patients. Association of the incidence of postmenopausal osteoporosis and Kidney-Vacuity Syndromes in TCM was investigated with the aid of a Kidney-Vacuity Syndromes scoring questionnaire. In the study, postmenopausal women, who suffered from deficiency of kidney "qi" and kidney "essence", had a significantly higher incidence of osteoporosis. These findings strongly supported that replenishing kidney qi and kidney essence was a logical therapeutic principle in the formulation of OPR. In conclusion, this study investigated the use of TCM on the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in a systematic manner. It started from herbal formulation, basic science studies to clinical trial. It revealed beneficial effects of OPR on bones through in-vivo and in-vitro studies and demonstrated certain possible mechanism behind. On the other hand, the hepatotoxicity of OPR on human beings was also exposed and had not been reported in previous toxicity tests. The study provided valuable clinical data for other investigators on the potential hazards of herbal remedies although they had been validated as safe and effective in pre-clinical stage. In search for safe, effective and low-priced medicine, the public have turned their attention to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Extensive experience has been accumulated in TCM regarding the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, which often involves the prescription of kidney-tonifying herbs. Therefore, the aim of the study, firstly, was to explore the association of the incidence of postmenopausal osteoporosis and Kidney-Vacuity Syndromes in TCM, so as to formulate a rational kidney-tonifying herbal formula for osteoporosis research (OPR). Secondly, the effect of the formula was evaluated by in-vitro and in-vivo studies. Thirdly, the Osteoporosis-Targeted Quality of Life Questionnaire was linguistically validated from English to Chinese, which was expected to be one of the outcome measurement tools in future clinical trials. Lastly, a pilot clinical study was performed, which revealed some potential hazards of the formula on human beings which have not been shown in previous works. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder which leads to an increased risk of bone fracture, disability or even death. It has become a major public health threat and the worldwide incidence of osteoporotic fracture is projected to increase two fold within the next 50 years. Postmenopausal women, being affected by a lack of estrogen, face a much higher risk of the disease. This study would therefore focus on <b>type</b> <b>I</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> (i. e. postmenopausal osteoporosis). Although current medications can slow down the bone deterioration process, their side effects and high cost had impaired patients' compliance with long term treatment. The effect of OPR for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was then evaluated by in-vitro and in-vivo studies. In the in-vivo study, an osteoporosis model was established by performing ovariectomy on the four-week-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice. A high bone turnover rate was induced and OPR successfully slowed down the high turnover rate of bones by decreasing bone formation and resorption process without increasing the uterine linings. However, its beneficial effect on bones could not be detected on bone mineral density measurement. The potential mechanism of action of OPR on bones was explored by in-vitro study. OPR was shown to induce cell proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast-like UMR 106 cells. Furthermore, the estrogenic activity of OPR was detected by MCF- 7 cell line, which has been stably transfected with estrogen responsive elements (ERE). OPR was shown to possess an estrogenic activity in a dose dependent manner and was comparable to the positive control at a concentration of 200 and 1000 mug/ml. The induced estrogenic activity by OPR may be associated with the presence of phytoestrogen within the herbal formula. These findings suggested that the beneficial effect of OPR on bones might relate to its direct positive effect on osteoblast and its estrogenic-like activity. Liong, Ching. Adviser: Chun-tao Che.

40|$|Coeliac Disease (CD) is an {{autoimmune}} disease {{in which the}} enzyme gluten causes inflammation and damage to the small intestine. Untreated the condition may predispose symptomatic individuals to serious diseases such as cancer, <b>type</b> <b>I</b> diabetes, <b>osteoporosis,</b> gynaecological problems in women, peripheral and {{central nervous system disorders}} and other {{autoimmune disease}}s. In Europe it is estimated that the condition may affect between 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 people. CD is incurable but symptoms are managed by a gluten-free diet (GFD) for life. Most research looking at CD has focused on the biological basis of the disease rather than the impact of the condition from the individual’s subjective view. The few existing studies suggest that the chronicity of the condition, the limitations imposed by the need to follow a permanent restrictive diet and the risk of other associated diseases can {{have a negative impact on}} health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychological well-being. However, knowledge in this area remains sparse to-date. The aim of this review was to systematically review the literature published within the last decade to investigate the effects of living with CD in respect of psychological well-being and HRQoL. Twenty-one relevant studies were identified and critically reviewed. Attention was paid to the methodology, outcome measures, type of CD and sample characteristics. Difficulties when interpreting and comparing the results of the reviewed studies included differences in: design and measures used, sample populations, country of origin, age group, CD type, duration of GFD and adherence rates. The reviewed data suggest that in addition to a reduced HRQoL, psychological distress, especially self-reported symptoms of depression are commonly found in individuals with CD. Although anxiety symptoms are commonly experienced, these tend to decrease on a GFD. However, depressive symptoms may persist even in treated individuals...|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the GTPase activity of the Ras proteins {{is thought to be}} a key element of signal transduction. Ras proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity and are active in signal transduction when bound to GTP but not following hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Three cellular Ras GTPase-activating proteins (Ras-gaps) which increase the GTPase activity of wild-type (wt) Ras but not activated Ras in vitro have been identified: <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and <b>type</b> II GAP and <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1. Mutations of wt Ras resulting in lowered intrinsic GTPase activity or loss of response to cellular Ras-gap proteins are thought to be the primary reason for the transforming properties of the Ras proteins. In vitro assays show <b>type</b> <b>I</b> and <b>type</b> II GAP and the GAP-related domain of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1 to have similar biochemical properties with respect to activation of the wt Ras GTPase, and it appears as though both <b>type</b> <b>I</b> GAP and NF 1 can modulate the GTPase function of Ras in cells. Here we report the assembling of a full-length coding clone for <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1 and the biological effects of microinjection of Ras and Ras-gap proteins into fibroblasts. We have found that <b>type</b> <b>I</b> GAP, <b>type</b> II GAP, and <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1 show markedly different biological activities in vivo. Coinjection of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> GAP or <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1, but not type II GAP, with wt Ras abolished the ability of wt Ras to induce expression from an AP- 1 -controlled reporter gene. We also found that serum-stimulated DNA synthesis was reduced by prior injection of cells with <b>type</b> <b>I</b> GAP but not type II GAP or <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1. These results suggest that <b>type</b> <b>I</b> GAP, <b>type</b> II GAP, and <b>type</b> <b>I</b> NF 1 may have different activities in vivo and support the hypothesis that while <b>type</b> <b>I</b> forms of GAP and NF 1 may act as negative regulators of wt Ras, they may do so with differential efficiencies...|$|R

BackgroundExtracellular matrix molecules profoundly regulate cell behavior, including proliferation. In glomerulonephritis, <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen accumulates in the mesangium and is constantly structurally modified and degraded {{during the course}} of the disease. MethodsWe studied how two structurally distinct forms of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen, monomer versus polymerized fibrils, affect cell proliferation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and expression of G 1 -phase regulatory proteins in cultured rat mesangial cells (MCs). To analyze the possible involvement of collagen-binding integrins in <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen-derived growth signals further, distribution patterns of integrin chains were examined by immunocytochemistry. ResultsPolymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen completely prevented the increase of DNA synthesis and cell replication induced by 5 % fetal calf serum (FCS) or 25 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in MCs on monomer <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen. Protein expression of cyclins D 1 and E was markedly down-regulated in MCs plated on polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen for eight hours in 5 % FCS, as compared with MCs on monomer <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen. Incubation with 5 % FCS reduced expression of the cdk-inhibitor protein p 27 Kip 1 on monomer but not on polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen. Moreover, polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen markedly reduced cyclin E-associated kinase activity in the presence of 5 % FCS. Polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen diminished the PDGF-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p 42 /p 44 MAPK, but did not affect phosphorylation of PDGF β-receptors. In MCs plated on monomer <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen, α 1, α 2, and β 1 integrin chains were recruited into focal contacts. However, on polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen, α 2 and β 1, but not α 1, integrin chains were condensed into focal contacts. ConclusionsThe growth-inhibitory effect of polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen is characterized by rapid changes of expression and/or activation of MAPK and G 1 -phase regulators and could result from the lack of α 1 β 1 integrin signaling in MCs on polymerized <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen.

40|$|Cell surface heparan sulfate {{proteoglycan}} (HSPG) {{interactions with}} <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen {{may be a}} ubiquitous cell adhesion mechanism. However, the HSPG binding sites on <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen are unknown. Previously we mapped heparin binding to {{the vicinity of the}} <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen N terminus by electron microscopy. The present study has identified <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen sequences used for heparin binding and endothelial cell–collagen interactions. Using affinity coelectrophoresis, we found heparin to bind as follows: to <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen with high affinity (Kd ≈ 150 nM); triple-helical peptides (THPs) including the basic N-terminal sequence α 1 (I) 87 – 92, KGHRGF, with intermediate affinities (Kd ≈ 2 μM); and THPs including other collagenous sequences, or single-stranded sequences, negligibly (Kd ≫ 10 μM). Thus, heparin–type I collagen binding likely relies on an N-terminal basic triple-helical domain represented once within each monomer, and at multiple sites within fibrils. We next defined the features of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen necessary for angiogenesis in a system in which <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen and heparin rapidly induce endothelial tube formation in vitro. When peptides, denatured or monomeric <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen, or <b>type</b> V collagen was substituted for <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen, no tubes formed. However, when peptides and <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen were tested together, only the most heparin-avid THPs inhibited tube formation, likely by influencing cell interactions with collagen–heparin complexes. Thus, induction of endothelial tube morphogenesis by <b>type</b> <b>I</b> collagen may depend upon its triple-helical and fibrillar conformations and on the N-terminal heparin-binding site identified here...|$|R

30|$|Interferon (IFN) {{is thought}} to play an {{important}} role in the vertebrate immune system, but systemic knowledge of IFN evolution has yet to be elucidated. To evaluate the phylogenic distribution and evolutionary history of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs, 13 genomes were searched using BLASTn program, and a phylogenetic tree of vertebrate <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs was constructed. In the present study, an IFNδ-like gene in the human genome was identified, refuting the concept that humans have no IFNδ genes, and other mammalian IFN genes were also identified. In the phylogenetic tree, the mammalian IFNβ, IFNɛ, and IFNκ formed a clade separate from the other mammalian <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs, while piscine and avian IFNs formed distinct clades. Based on this phylogenetic analysis and the various characteristics of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs, the evolutionary history of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs was further evaluated. Our data indicate that an ancestral IFNα-like gene forms a core from which new IFNs divided during vertebrate evolution. In addition, the data suggest how the other <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs evolved from IFNα and shaped the complex <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN system. The promoters of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs were conserved among different mammals, as well as their genic regions. However, the intergenic regions of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN clusters were not conserved among different mammals, demonstrating a high selection pressure upon <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs during their evolution.|$|R

40|$|Many pathogens, {{including}} viruses, bacteria, and protozoan parasites, suppress cellular immune responses through {{activation of}} <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} immune suppression and susceptibility to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is mediated by <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN; however, {{it is unclear how}} <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN suppresses immunity to blood-stage Plasmodium parasites. During experimental severe malaria, CD 4 (+) Th cell responses are suppressed, and conventional DC (cDC) function is curtailed through unknown mechanisms. Here, we tested the hypothesis that <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling directly impairs cDC function during Plasmodium infection in mice. Using cDC-specific IFNAR 1 -deficient mice, and mixed BM chimeras, we found that <b>type</b> <b>I</b> TEN signaling directly affects cDC function, limiting the ability of cDCs to prime IFN-gamma-producing Th 1 cells. Although <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling modulated all subsets of splenic cDCs, CD 8 (-) cDCs were especially susceptible, exhibiting reduced phagocytic and Th 1 -promoting properties in response to <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFNs. Additionally, rapid and systemic IFN-alpha production in response to Plasmodium infection required <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling in cDCs themselves, revealing their contribution to a feed-forward cytokine-signaling loop. Together, these data suggest abrogation of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN signaling in CD 8 - splenic cDCs as an approach for enhancing Th 1 responses against Plasmodium and other <b>type</b> <b>I</b> IFN-inducing pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Innate immune {{responses}} against viral infection, {{especially the}} induction of <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon, {{are critical for}} limiting the replication of the virus. Although {{it has been shown}} that DNA can induce <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon, to date no natural DNA ligand of a virus that induces <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon has been described. Here we screened the genome of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 with mutations at various genomic locations to map the region of DNA that induces <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon. A repetitive region termed the 100 -base-pair repeat region is a ligand that is both necessary and sufficient for the viral genomic DNA to induce <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon. A region colinear with this ligand in the genome of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus also induces <b>type</b> <b>I</b> interferon.
