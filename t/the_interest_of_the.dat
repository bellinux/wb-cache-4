5|$|Freedom to {{move freely}} {{throughout}} the territory of India though reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public, for example, restrictions may be imposed on movement and travelling, so as to control epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Freedom to {{practice}} any profession or {{to carry on}} any occupation, trade or business on which the State may impose reasonable restrictions in <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public.

Also, professional or technical qualifications may be prescribed for practising any profession or carrying on any trade.|$|E
5|$|Freedom {{to reside}} and settle in {{any part of}} the {{territory}} of India, subject to reasonable restrictions by the State in <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public or {{for the protection of the}} scheduled tribes because certain safeguards as are envisaged here seem to be justified to protect indigenous and tribal peoples from exploitation and coercion. Article 370 restricts citizens from other Indian states and Kashmiri women who marry men from other states from purchasing land or property in Jammu & Kashmir.|$|E
25|$|Fabian Tassano has {{questioned}} {{the idea that}} beneficence might in some cases have priority over autonomy.

50|$|The MHRA (and US Food and Drug Administration) {{have been}} criticised {{in the book}} Bad Pharma, and by David Healy in {{evidence}} to <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Commons Health Committee, for having undergone regulatory capture; advancing <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drug companies rather than <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public.|$|R
50|$|Capture: The {{concern here}} is that the {{relationship}} between regulators and the regulated may lead to <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public being neglected. In this situation it is possible for the relationship to become too close, leading to capture. This may result in <b>the</b> regulator protecting <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regulated.|$|R
5|$|Goods-only trains were a rarity, and {{the usual}} {{practice}} was to attach goods wagons to any scheduled passenger services. Whilst the shunting of wagons at intermediate stations no doubt added to <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tourist and occasional traveller, it also added marginally to the journey time.|$|E
5|$|Public or {{representative}} standing {{is standing}} possessed by an applicant who brings a case {{on behalf of}} a larger group of people, or even in <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public. The applicant need not show that a personal right or interest has been infringed. As long as the represented individuals have, or the public has, sufficient interest in the matter, the applicant will be held to have adequate standing to pursue the case.|$|E
5|$|Since the Mantra-Rock Dance {{brought the}} Hare Krishna {{movement}} to the wider attention of the American public, Prabhupada's increased popularity attracted <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainstream media. Most notably, he was interviewed on ABC's The Les Crane Show and lectured on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness on a KPFK radio station program hosted by Peter Bergman. Prabhupada's followers also spoke about their activities on the San Francisco radio station KFRC.|$|E
50|$|Allelengyon was a tax {{imposed by}} the Byzantine Emperor Basil II on <b>the</b> wealthiest landowners <b>of</b> {{abandoned}} and uncultivated land.

50|$|From then onwards, <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> KSU was tremendous. <b>the</b> {{newspapers}} <b>of</b> Kerala {{played a}} crucial role to suit <b>the</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> KSU.

5|$|The {{constitution}} also imposes {{restrictions on}} these rights. The government restricts these freedoms in <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> independence, sovereignty {{and integrity of}} India. In the interest of morality and public order, the government can also impose restrictions. However, {{the right to life}} and personal liberty cannot be suspended. The six freedoms are also automatically suspended or have restrictions imposed on them during a state of emergency.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{effort to}} establish a penal colony was by Archibald Blair who found the remoteness of the island as ideal for such a colony. But his initiative failed to go beyond 1796 as malaria prevented it. The First Indian War of Indian Independence in 1857 rekindled <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British Administration in India {{to establish a}} penal colony in the Andaman Islands for political prisoners.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{academic}} {{consensus that the}} events of the nine-month conflict were a genocide. The atrocities in East Pakistan were the first instances of war rape to attract international media attention, and Sally J. Scholz has written that this was the first genocide to capture <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass media. The women's human rights organisation Bangladesh Mahila Parishat took part in the war by publicising the atrocities being carried out by the Pakistani army.|$|E

5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it {{as a prelude to}} a search for the ships in 2001.

After attracting <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran.

5|$|As {{the rhetoric}} grew more strident, however, the other monarchies started to view events with alarm. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he {{considered}} the situation surrounding his sister, the French Queen Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater and greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarchs of Europe as one {{with the interests of}} Louis and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Burton was reindicted, {{still in}} the circuit court Eastern District of Missouri, on April 13, 1905, and arraigned on June 4 before Judge John Henry Rogers, of the Western District of Arkansas, sitting by designation. The new {{indictment}} had eight counts. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts charged that Burton had agreed to receive compensation from Rialto. The third, fifth, and seventh counts charged that Burton had actually received compensation from Rialto. The counts different only in <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States which was alleged to {{have been involved in}} the matter. Counts four and five were dismissed before trial. Unlike the first indictment, the second alleged that Burton had received $500 in person in St. Louis. The first indictment alleged only compensated representation, the second indictment also alleged an agreement to do so.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient in <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E

5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in the drafting of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Features of the He 111 were {{apparent}} in the Heinkel He 70. The first single-engined He 70 Blitz ("Lightning") rolled off the line in 1932 and immediately started breaking records. In the normal four-passenger version its speed reached 380km/h (230mph) when powered by a 447kW (600hp) BMW VI engine. The He 70 was designed with an elliptical wing, which the Günther brothers had already incorporated into the Bäumer Sausewind before they joined Heinkel. This wing design became a feature in this and many subsequent designs they developed. The He 70 drew <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe, which was looking for an aircraft with both bomber and transport capabilities.|$|E
5|$|In a Hindu {{caste system}} that was conspicuously present, Brahmins enjoyed a privileged {{position}} as providers of knowledge and local justice.

They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in <b>the</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kingdom as they were viewed as persons detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was a useful tool to educate and teach ethical conduct and discipline in local communities. Brahmins were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters (Panchayat).|$|E
