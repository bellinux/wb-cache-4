50|$|Civil disobedience {{is usually}} defined as {{pertaining}} to a citizen's {{relation to the}} state and its laws, as distinguished from a constitutional impasse, in which two public agencies, especially two equally sovereign branches of government, conflict. For instance, if the head of government of a country were to refuse <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> of that country's highest court, it would not be civil disobedience, since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.|$|E
50|$|In this model, the {{vertical}} axis represents {{the level of}} power in the interaction, and the horizontal axis represents connection. Having presented this model, Tannen proposed that in the American paradigm, a sibling relationship would be mapped in the bottom left quadrant, as there is a high level of closeness and a relative equality that is not comparable to the power dynamic in an American parent/child relationship. Using this new model, Tannen argues that connection maneuvers do not only occur independently of control maneuvers. Among other examples, she mentions a wife who refuses to let her husband take over making popcorn by saying “You always burn it”. According to Tannen, the wife’s resistance to her husband’s request is a control maneuver, but by citing a potential undesirable effect for her family (i.e. burnt popcorn), she ties a connection maneuver into her attempt <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Boolean Satistifiability has {{attracted}} tremendous research effort in recent years, {{resulting in the}} developments of various efficient SAT solver packages. Based upon their design architectures, researchers have tried to develop better heuristics to further improve its efficiency, by either speeding up the Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP) procedure or finding a better decision ordering (or both). In this paper, we propose an entirely different SAT solver design concept that is circuit-based. Our solver is able to utilize circuit topological information and signal correlations <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> ordering that is more efficient for solving circuit-based SAT problem instances. In particular, for unsatisfiable circuit examples, our solver is able to achieve from 2 x {{up to more than}} 75 x speedup over a state-of-the-art SAT solver. I...|$|E

40|$|American courts may enforce and {{recognize}} international commercial arbitral awards {{pursuant to the}} New York Convention. An arbitral award can be subject of scrutiny before the courts of the country of the seat of arbitration and courts of the seat of arbitration may annul an award. Once an award is annulled, {{the question is whether}} a decision to annul an award renders it void, or a court outside of the seat of arbitration may refuse to enforce the judgment annulling the award and enforce the award. Courts may treat the judgment annulling an award as a judgment for the purpose of enforcement and recognition. In this view, courts may refuse to enforce a judgment annulling an award if the judgment does not conform with traditional U. S grounds for enforcement of a judgment. The public policy exception is one of the grounds on which courts sometimes refuse <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> annulling an award. Recent decisions in Termorio, Pemex and Thai Lao Lignite have treated judgments annulling an award as judgments and evaluated their validity on public policy grounds. Public policy is the most reliable basis of analysis of the validity of decisions regarding an award. If a decision annulling an award satisfies the requirements of public policy, then the judgment must be enforced and the award is void. In this view, {{there is no need to}} inquire further about the consequences of an annulled award and the control of public policy can provide the best alternative...|$|E
40|$|Within this thesis, the {{argument}} {{will be presented}} that anarchism, which is defined through liberty and liberty in turn is defined as autonomy constitutes a form of government, through the liberty it depends upon. The thesis begins with a textual analysis of Godwin's (who is arguably the first anarchist thinker - in chronological terms) Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (his most prominent work on political thought) {{in an attempt to}} identify the key factors that determine Political Justice within his theory (within his theory justice is understood and defined on an individual basis, which has to be considered in an attempt to define and achieve it). The analysis presented shows that Political Justice is achieved through creating and maintaining a Balance of Power (power is understood to be the means <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision),</b> which exists when there is no entity to hold decision-making power over another entity. The two paths considered (remain ing consistent with Godwin'S argument) towards achieving a Balance of Power are liberty and equality. It is argued that equality is maintained through an external authority and liberty is mai ntained through autonomy and deduced that such a Balance of Power is achievable only through liberty, because autonomy (liberty) allows for individual decisionmaking, which an external authority (equality) do not and individual decision-making is the decisive factor of a Balance of Power. The theories of Stirner, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin and Goldman are analysed to determine if and to what extent autonomy (liberty) is the foundation of the ir respective theories. It is concluded that all the anarchist theories considered are based and dependent upon autonomy (l iberty). It is finally considered whether autonomy (liberty) and the anarchist theories considered are compatible with the concept of government. It is concluded that anarchism is the framework within which anarchy is sustainable, because anarchism provides the frame for autonomy (liberty) to operate within (anarchy) and as such, anarchism is a form of government.

40|$|Users of {{computing}} systems and devices frequently make decisions related to information security, e. g., {{when choosing a}} password, deciding whether to log into an unfamiliar wireless network. Employers or other stakeholders may have a preference for certain outcomes, {{without being able to}} or having <b>a</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>decision.</b> In such situations, systems may build in design nudges to influence the decision making, e. g., by highlighting the employer’s preferred solution. In this paper we model influencing information security to identify which approaches to influencing are most effective and how they can be optimized. To do so, we extend traditional multi-criteria decision analysis models with modifiable criteria, to represent the available approaches an influencer has for influencing the choice of the decision maker. The notion of influence power is introduced to characterize the extent to which an influencer can influence decision makers. We illustrate our approach using data from a controlled experiment on techniques to influence which public wireless network users select. This allows us to calculate influence power and identify which design nudges exercise the most influence over user decisions...|$|R

40|$|Many {{animals can}} choose between {{different}} developmental fates to maximize fitness. Despite {{the complexity of}} environmental cues and life history, different developmental fates are executed in a robust fashion. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans serves as a powerful model to examine this phenomenon because it can adopt one of two developmental fates (adulthood or diapause) depending on environmental conditions. The steroid hormone dafachronic acid (DA) directs development to adulthood by regulating the transcriptional activity of the nuclear hormone receptor DAF- 12. The known role of DA suggests {{that it may be}} the molecular mediator of environmental condition effects on the developmental fate decision, although the mechanism is yet unknown. We used a combination of physiological and molecular biology techniques to demonstrate that commitment to reproductive adult development occurs when DA levels, produced in the neuroendocrine XXX cells, exceed a threshold. Furthermore, imaging and cell ablation experiments demonstrate that the XXX cells act as a source of DA, which, upon commitment to adult development, is amplified and propagated in the epidermis in a DAF- 12 dependent manner. This positive feedback loop increases DA levels and drives adult programs in the gonad and epidermis, thus conferring the irreversibility of the decision. We show that the positive feedback loop canalizes development by ensuring that sufficient amounts of DA are dispersed throughout the body and serves as a robust fate-locking mechanism <b>to</b> <b>enforce</b> <b>an</b> organism-wide binary <b>decision,</b> despite noisy and comple...|$|R
