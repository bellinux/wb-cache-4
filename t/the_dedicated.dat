5|$|In the First World War, {{horses were}} used in combat for cavalry charges, and they {{remained}} the best means for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a devastating effect on the British horse population. As thousands of animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in number {{that they were in}} danger of disappearing. Many breeds were saved by <b>the</b> <b>dedicated</b> efforts of a few breeders who formed breed societies, tracking down remaining animals and registering them.|$|E

5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} serial port, {{designed for}} use with a printer or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external modem port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud modem for communications. As a result, {{for the first time}} a user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster external modem simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces could not be used because they required <b>the</b> <b>dedicated</b> use of both ports. A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the internal modem slot for consumers who needed traditional functions.|$|E

5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new port type, the {{charging}} port, {{as opposed to}} the standard downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and <b>the</b> <b>dedicated</b> charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and charging USB ports, the charging ports should be labeled as such.|$|E

The Atari 2600 game Combat, released in 1977, includes several variations of Tank, including ones with bouncing shots or invisible tanks. Combat was initially developed as a console version of the arcade game, like the cancelled dedicated console version, with additional plane-based game modes added during development. Despite Atari's cancellation of <b>the</b> <b>dedicated</b> console version of Tank, a dedicated console game inspired by Tank was still released in 1977 by Coleco: the Telstar game Telstar Combat! plays four variations of Tank, and was released prior to the Atari 2600 and Combat.|$|E
