40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling of an optical diaphragm behavior for human pulse pressure detection. In this study, {{the comparison between}} {{the performance of the}} polyimide and silicon nitride diaphragm has be analyzed. <b>The</b> effect of <b>diaphragm's</b> radius and thickness on static and frequency response are also investigated. The findings show that <b>the</b> polyimide <b>diaphragm</b> is more sensitive than <b>the</b> silicon nitride <b>diaphragm.</b> <b>The</b> radius of <b>the</b> polyimide <b>diaphragm</b> has more effect on the deflection, sensitivity, and resonance frequency as compared to <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm's</b> thickness.

5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Hump it (or Humping it): During a yell, {{the crowd}} {{leans forward and}} places their hands on their knees to {{maximize}} the amount of air displaced during the scream. The stance forces <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> to assist the lungs.|$|E

That is, <b>the</b> cymbal slotted <b>diaphragm</b> is smaller than <b>the</b> slotted flat <b>diaphragm</b> in stress, so <b>the</b> cymbal slotted <b>diaphragm</b> has a high reliability.|$|R
5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the left ventricle sitting on <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum, through <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The esophagus is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the histomorphological structure of <b>the</b> urogenital <b>diaphragm</b> in elderly women using a modern morphometric procedure. Biopsies were taken from the posterior margin of <b>the</b> urogenital <b>diaphragm</b> of 22 female cadavers (mean age, 87 years) using a 60 -mm punch. Hematoxylin/eosin and Goldner sections were analyzed with the Cavalieri estimator. The mean thickness of <b>the</b> urogenital <b>diaphragm</b> was 5. 5 mm. The main component was connective tissue. All biopsies contained smooth muscle. Eighteen biopsies contained more smooth muscle than striated muscle. In six of 22 biopsies, no striated muscle was found. The ratio of striated to smooth muscle to connective tissue was 1 : 2. 3 : 13. 3. Muscle fibers were dispersed in all parts of <b>the</b> urogenital <b>diaphragm.</b> <b>The</b> urogenital <b>diaphragm</b> of elderly women mainly consists of connective tissue. Smooth muscle was also found but to a lesser extent. The frequently used English term "perineal membrane" for <b>the</b> urogenital <b>diaphragm</b> is justified and well describes our findings in elderly women...|$|R

5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm).</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The {{ligament}} {{contains a}} slender band of skeletal muscle from <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and a fibromuscular band of smooth muscle from the horizontal and ascending {{parts of the}} duodenum. When it contracts, by virtue of connections to {{the third and fourth}} parts of the duodenum, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum widens the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure, allowing movement of the intestinal contents.|$|E
40|$|Laser {{microfabrication}} {{of silicon}} carbide for MEMS applications was explored. 3 C-SiC and 6 H-SiC were laser micromachined using various lasers. 3 C-SiC thin films were patterned using an 800 nm 120 fs Ti:Sapphire laser. Diaphragm structures 100 - 130 ym thick with lateral dimensions ranging from 1 - 2. 5 mm were fabricated in bulk 6 H-SiC using a 1064 nm, 3 ̆c 100 ns, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. <b>The</b> laser micromachined <b>diaphragms</b> were mechanically characterized {{by means of}} nanoindentation and a novel pressure testing apparatus.

5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|The stomach {{produces}} gastric acid, {{a strongly}} acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion. Constriction {{of the upper}} and lower esophageal sphincters help to prevent reflux (backflow) of gastric contents and acid into the esophagus, protecting the esophageal mucosa. In addition, the acute angle of His and the lower crura of <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm</b> helps this sphincteric action.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column.

From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through <b>the</b> <b>diaphragm.</b>|$|E
50|$|These are {{the most}} common type of gas meter, seen in almost all {{residential}} and small commercial installations.

As <b>the</b> <b>diaphragms</b> expand and contract, levers connected to cranks convert the linear motion of <b>the</b> <b>diaphragms</b> into rotary motion of a crank shaft which serves as the primary flow element. This shaft can drive an odometer-like counter mechanism or it can produce electrical pulses for a flow computer.|$|R
