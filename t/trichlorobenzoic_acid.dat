40|$|Of 36 pure isomers (chlorine numbers 1 to 5) of {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} examined, 23 {{compounds}} were metabolized by Alcaligenes sp. strain Y 42, and 33 compounds were metabolized by Acinetobacter sp. strain P 6. The major pathway of many polychlorinated biphenyl isomers examined {{was considered to}} proceed through 2 ', 3 '-dihydro- 2 ', 3 '-diol compounds, concomitant dehydrogenated 2 ', 3 '-dihydroxy compounds, subsequently the 1 ', 2 '-meta-cleavage compounds (chlorinated derivatives of 2 -hydroxy- 6 -oxo- 6 -phenylhexa- 2, 4 -dienoic acids), and then chlorobenzoic acids. The meta-cleavage products were usually converted to chlorobenzoic acids upon further incubation in many polychlorinated biphenyls, but they accumulated specifically in the metabolism of 2, 4 '-, 2, 4, 4 '-, and 2, 5, 4 '-chlorobiphenyls, which are all chlorinated at the 2, 4 '-position in the molecules in common. Dihydroxy compounds accumulated mainly in the metabolism of 2, 6 -, 2, 3, 6 -, 2, 4, 2 ', 5 '-, 2, 5, 2 ', 5 '-, and 2, 4, 5, 2 ', 5 '-chlorobiphenyls by Acinetobacter sp. P 6. The 2, 3, 2 ', 3 '-, 2, 3, 2 ', 5 '-, and 2, 4, 5, 2 ', 3 '-chlorobiphenyls, which are chlorinated at the 2, 3 -position {{of one of the}} rings, were metabolized in a different fashion. Two major metabolites of a chlorobenzoic acid and an unknown compound accumulated always in the metabolism of this group of polychlorinated biphenyls. 2, 4, 6 -Trichlorobiphenyl was metabolized quite differently between the two organisms. Alcaligenes sp. Y 42 metabolized this compound very slowly to <b>trichlorobenzoic</b> <b>acid</b> by the major oxidative route. In contrast, Acinetobacter sp. P 6 metabolized it to a trihydroxy compound via a dihydroxy compound...|$|E
40|$|We have {{characterized}} a biphenyl degrader, Rhodococcus sp. strain RHA 1. Biphenyl-grown {{cells of}} strain RHA 1 efficiently transformed 45 {{components in the}} 62 major peaks of a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture of Kanechlors 200, 300, 400, and 500 within 3 days, which includes mono- to octachlorobiphenyls. Among the intermediate metabolites of PCB transformation, di- and <b>trichlorobenzoic</b> <b>acids</b> were identified. The gradual decrease of these chlorobenzoic acids during incubation indicated that these chlorobenzoic acids would also be degraded by this strain. The effect {{of the position of}} chlorine substitution was determined by using PCB mixtures that have chlorine substitutions mainly at either the ortho or the meta position. This strain transformed both types of congeners, and strong PCB transformation activity of RHA 1 was indicated. RHA 1 accumulated 4 -chlorobenzoic acid temporally during the transformation of 4 -chlorobiphenyl. The release of most chloride in the course of 2, 2 (prm 1) -dichlorobiphenyl degradation was observed. These results suggested that RHA 1 would break down at least some PCB congeners into smaller molecules to a considerable extent...|$|R
