5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that the saga writers had accurate information on details of the battle beyond the sparse accounts in the surviving poems. Nevertheless, starting with Oddr Snorrason, they present an elaborate literary account, depicting the main participants through <b>their</b> <b>words</b> and deeds.|$|E
5|$|Both {{linguistic}} and socio-cultural factors affect {{the rate at}} which vocabulary develops. Children must learn to use <b>their</b> <b>words</b> appropriately and strategically in social situations. They have flexible and powerful social-cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others {{in a wide variety of}} interactive situations. Children learn new words in communicative situations. Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies. Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement, as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school. These children are also generally better liked.|$|E
5|$|Milo and Tock {{leave the}} dungeon. King Azaz hosts {{them at a}} banquet where the guests {{literally}} eat <b>their</b> <b>words,</b> served to them on plates. After the meal, King Azaz lets Milo and Tock talk themselves into a dangerous quest to rescue the princesses. Azaz flatters the Humbug into being their guide, and boy, dog and insect set off for the Mathemagician's capital of Digitopolis as they must gain his approval before they can begin their quest.|$|E
50|$|After the {{capitulation}} of the Dutch armed forces, all {{officers and}} cadets {{were asked to}} give <b>their</b> <b>word</b> of honour not to harm German interests in any way {{as long as the}} Netherlands and Germany were at war. When they gave <b>their</b> <b>word</b> of honour they could go home and live relatively free.|$|R
50|$|Luteyn refused, {{together}} with about 60 other officers, cadets and one {{rating of the}} Dutch navy (stoker Willem de Lange). The officers refusing did so for various reasons. Some did not give <b>their</b> <b>word</b> because they saw it as conflicting with their officer's oath. The majority of officers who didn't give <b>their</b> <b>word</b> of honour were officers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, arguing that according to their regulations it was forbidden to give <b>their</b> <b>word</b> of honour and because the Dutch East Indies were still free at that time, they saw it as their duty {{to remain in the}} fight.|$|R

25|$|The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt avoids {{directly}} implicating itself materially {{in terrorism}} while it supports terrorism with words and encourages it, according to WINEP fellow Eric Trager, who advocated pushing {{them into a}} corner instead of designating them due to issues with materially connecting them to terrorism other than with <b>their</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{languages}} {{were only}} {{represented in the}} original vocabulary {{in so far as}} they were cognate with, or as <b>their</b> <b>words</b> had become widespread in, Esperanto's source languages.

25|$|Another way pulps kept {{costs down}} was by paying authors less than other markets; thus many eminent authors {{started out in}} the pulps before they were {{successful}} enough to sell to better-paying markets, and similarly, well-known authors whose careers were slumping or who wanted a few quick dollars could bolster their income with sales to pulps. Additionally, some of the earlier pulps solicited stories from amateurs who were quite happy to see <b>their</b> <b>words</b> in print and could thus be paid token amounts.|$|E

25|$|It is {{the divine}} {{observation}} of Ecclesiastes the Sonne of David King in Ierufalem, To every thing {{there is a}} season: A time to keepe silence, and a time to speake. Truly it hath {{seemed to be a}} time to keepe silence in some by-gone yeeres in England, when the prudent Ministers of God were necessitated to keepe silence through the evill of the times, having beene made offenders for a word, as if their do had beene conspiracy against the State, and the land not able to beare all <b>their</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{argue that}} Interlingua's source {{languages}} {{include not only}} Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of <b>their</b> <b>words</b> also appear in other languages – still more when derivative forms and loan translations are included. Tests had shown that if {{a larger number of}} source languages were used, the results would be about the same. So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.|$|E
25|$|For example: It is {{reported}} {{by such a}} large number of narrators that Muhammad enjoined Muslims to perform two ra'kat in Fajr, four ra'kat in Dhuhr, Asr and Esha and three ra'kat in the Maghrib prayer, yet the narrations of all the reporters who reported the number of ra'kat are not in the same words. <b>Their</b> <b>words</b> are different and even the events reported by them are different. But the common feature of all the reports is the same: the exact number of ra'kat. The hadith is thus said to be mutawatir in meaning.|$|E

25|$|Idra Rabba {{contains}} {{the discussion of}} nine of Rashbi's friends, who gathered together to discuss great and deep secrets of Kabbalah. The nine are: Rabbi Elazar his son, Rabbi Abba, Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yossi bar Yaakov, Rabbi Yitzchak, Rabbi Chezkiyah bar Rav, Rabbi Chiyya, Rabbi Yossi and Rabbi Yisa. After {{the opening of the}} discussion by Rashbi, the sages rise, one after the other, and lecture on the secret of Divinity, while Rashbi adds to and responds to <b>their</b> <b>words.</b> The lectures in this section mainly explain the words of the Sifra diTzni'uta, in a similar manner as the Gemara explains the Mishnah.|$|E
25|$|For {{its first}} three years, the Russian Free Press went on {{printing}} without selling a single copy and scarcely {{being able to}} get a single copy introduced into Russia; so when at last a bookseller bought ten shillings worth of Baptized Property, the half-sovereign was set aside by the surprised editors in a special place of honor. The death of the emperor Nicholas in 1855 led to a complete change. Herzen's writings, and the magazines he edited, were smuggled wholesale into Russia, and <b>their</b> <b>words</b> resounded throughout the country, as well as all over Europe. Their influence grew.|$|E
25|$|Even {{what we hear}} must be {{attached}} to a visual image. To help recall something we have heard rather than seen, we should attach to <b>their</b> <b>words</b> the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking {{as well as the}} appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.|$|E

25|$|Singing {{has been}} shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to {{neurologist}} Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, {{on the right side of}} the brain. This is casually known as the “singing center.” By teaching stroke victims to sing <b>their</b> <b>words,</b> this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that “regional specificity,” such as that for speech, “may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage.” Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the “singing center” may be retrained to help produce speech.|$|E
25|$|In 1963 Novak {{teamed up}} with Rowland Evans, a former Congressional {{correspondent}} for the New York Herald Tribune, to create the Inside Report, a newspaper column published four times a week. It was also known as Inside Washington. Evans did not know Novak at all except through his reputation when they started. They each had a contrasting public image, with Novak dressing sloppy and Evans' appearing like a diplomat with a refined manner. Their column mixed standard reporting with their own editorial opinions. It began with muted, mostly centrist views, but <b>their</b> <b>words</b> drifted rightward over time. Novak's experience covering the Six-Day War in the field influenced his beliefs towards Evans' pro-Palestinian sympathies.|$|E
25|$|Books number 1 to 9 and 11 {{were written}} by the creator, Robert Arthur, who also {{specified}} ideas for {{a few of the}} other stories. Arthur had been an editor for several book collections attributed to Alfred Hitchcock. The other authors were William Arden (Dennis Lynds), Nick West (Kin Platt), Mary Virginia Carey and Marc Brandel (born Marcus Beresford). All of the authors wrote their own introductions and epilogues, which were dictated purportedly by Hitchcock and later in the series a fictional writer, Hector Sebastian, who supposedly recorded the adventures of the Three Investigators from <b>their</b> <b>words.</b> The illustrators in the series began with Harry Kane and Ed Vebell and include Jack Hearne, Herb Mott, Stephen Marchesi, Robert Adragna and William A.
