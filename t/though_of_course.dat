5|$|In 1992, NOU was on {{tour with}} Bikini Kill, {{and when they}} arrived in Memphis, the found that the {{promoter}} for the show hadn't actually promoted the show. So, while {{out on the town}} flyering the streets and ducking into record stores, NOU ran into Primal Scream, a band which had been in town recording their own album. Primal Scream then decided to attend NOU's show at the Antenna Club, and then proceeded to invite NOU to record with them in the studio the next day. Nation of Ulysses then recorded five songs with Primal Scream in nine hours, <b>though</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> only after a quick errand for some tin foil to smoke a bit of crack, according to Tim Green. These recordings are known as Memphis Demos, and include the demos of N-Sub Ulysses, 50,000 Watts, Mockingbird, Yeah, and Shakedown.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} context may {{be from the}} time of the Bar-Kohba war, AD 132-135 when the penalty for teaching Torah was death, so decreed by Rome. Others trace the dreidel itself to the children's top game Teetotum. However, the dreidel game as we know it arose among the Ashkenazim. It is not a Sephardi tradition, <b>though,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> just like the singing of Maos Tzur, it has been adopted by other, non-Ashkenazi families.|$|E
25|$|During the {{interval}} of Shi'a rule, the Berber people {{appear to have}} moved ideologically, from a popular antagonism to the Sunni east, toward an acquiescence to its orthodoxy, <b>though</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> mediated by their own Maliki law (viewed {{as one of the}} four orthodox madhhab by the Sunni). In addition to the above grievances against the Fatimids, during the Fatimid era the prestige of exercising cultural leadership within al-Maghrib shifted decisively away from Ifriqiya and instead came to be the prize of al-Andalus.|$|E

25|$|During the {{interval}} of generally disagreeable Shi'a rule, the Berber people {{appear to have}} ideologically moved away from a popular antagonism against the Islamic east (al-Mashriq), and toward an acquiescence to its Sunni orthodoxy, <b>though</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> mediated by their own Maliki school of law (viewed {{as one of the}} four orthodox madhhab by the Sunni). Professor Abdallah Laroui remarks that while enjoying sovereignty the Berber Maghrib experimented with several doctrinal viewpoints during the 9th to the 13th centuries, including the Khariji, Zaydi, Shi'a, and Almohad. Eventually they settled on an orthodoxy, on Maliki Sunni doctrines. This progression indicates a grand period of Berber self-definition.|$|E
25|$|All these African {{cultures}} had musical traditions, which survive erratically to {{the present}} day, not always in detail, but in general style. The best preserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the instruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations are quite well preserved. In what other American countries are the religious ceremonies conducted in the old language(s) of Africa? They certainly are in Lucumí ceremonies, <b>though</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> back in Africa the language has moved on. What unifies all genuine forms of African music is the unity of polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call-and-response) and dance in well-defined social settings, {{and the absence of}} melodic instruments of an Arabic or European kind.|$|E
25|$|Matisse {{was visiting}} Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 {{but managed to}} make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and {{remained}} in Nice, in Vichy France. “It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?” Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, <b>though</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> being non-Jewish, he had that option.|$|E

25|$|<b>Though</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> a {{very wealthy}} man, the CPR {{had taken a}} {{significant}} toll on Stephen's personal portfolio. James Hill had ended up better off than him for having held on to his railroad when Stephen had had to liquidate his share in it to ensure {{the completion of the}} CPR. He also regretted having encouraged his associates to invest in the CPR, knowing that Hill's Manitoba Railway was a better opportunity. He was not bitter towards Hill, in fact quite the opposite, remaining as Hill's staunchest ally throughout the remainder of his career. Stephen remained a director of the CPR until 1893, but thereafter showed only glimpses of interest in the railway. He reduced his holdings and even encouraged others to follow suit. Ironically, the principal source of Stephen's vast wealth stemmed from his investments in Hill's railroads.|$|E
500|$|Grossmith also wrote, composed, and {{performed}} in several one-man drawing room sketches, short comic operas or monologues that were {{given at the}} Opera Comique or the Savoy Theatre {{in place of the}} companion pieces when shorter matinee programmes were playing. These works included Beauties on the Beach (1878), Five Hamlets (1878), a revival of his A Silver Wedding (1879), The Drama on Crutches (1883), Homburg, or Haunted by The Mikado (1887–88), and Holiday Hall (1888). In reviewing a matinee performance of The Drama on Crutches, The Times commented, [...] "he not only satirizes the present tendency of fashionable amateurs to join the stage, but also parodies ... the manner of Mr. Irving and other actors of the present day, including himself. [...] The sketch created great amusement, <b>though</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> it depends entirely for its success upon the actor's powers of mimicry." [...] Grossmith also performed in charity events, including as Bouncer in Cox and Box in 1879 at the Opera Comique.|$|E
500|$|Historians have {{debated whether}} defence or revenue {{collection}} was the gatehouse's primary purpose. The Victorian antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley, {{who wrote the}} first history of the bridge and gate in 1902, described the gatehouse as [...] "a little fortress complete in itself, <b>though</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> useless in time of war". [...] Her account contended that the [...] "tower was {{not in any way}} connected with the fortification walls of the town" [...] and that the gatehouse was erected solely [...] "for the purpose of taking tolls". Kissack follows her argument, noting that the gatehouse was ineffective in defensive terms, as the Monnow could easily be crossed on foot upstream. More recent commentators disagree; Soulsby considered the bridge to have a clear defensive purpose, and Michael Rowlands, author of the most recent history of the bridge and gatehouse, argued that the bridge and gatehouse met the dual aims of defensive protection and the collection of tolls.|$|E

500|$|Originally 11 Melbury Road, {{the house}} was renumbered as 31 Melbury Road in 1967. It was the second of two houses in Melbury Road {{designed}} by Shaw, the first, 8 Melbury Road, was designed for another painter Marcus Stone. Fildes and Stone were artistic rivals and each naturally regarded their own Shaw-designed house as superior. Of the construction of Woodland House Fildes wrote in November 1876 that [...] "The house is getting on famously and looks stunning... It {{is a long way}} the most superior house of the whole lot; I consider it knocks Stone's to fits, <b>though</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> he wouldn't have that by what I hear he says of his, but my opinion is the universal one." [...] Fildes moved into the house in October 1877 and it remained his home until his death there in February 1927. Fildes was survived by his wife and six children. [...] In 1959 the London County Council commemorated Fildes at Woodland House with a blue plaque.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{the leading}} advocates of animal rights {{seem to have}} shrunk from basing their claim on the only {{argument}} which can ultimately be held {{to be a really}} sufficient one—the assertion that animals, as well as men, <b>though,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> to a far less extent than men, are possessed of a distinctive individuality, and, therefore, are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that [...] "restricted freedom" [...] to which Herbert Spencer alludes.|$|E
