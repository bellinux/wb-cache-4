40|$|ABSTRACT: User queries {{and their}} {{associated}} clicks have been extensively explored to improve Web search relevance. Very little existing work explores how user clicks {{can be used}} to improve text matching for Web search. In this paper, we treat user queries that result in clicks as off-page annotations.

We propose using the QueryText as a new weighted <b>textual</b> <b>field</b> for Web pages, where the weights are based on user click behavior. We derive two sets of text matching features from the new field – BM 25 F-based features and n-gram features.

40|$|This essay {{positions}} Vanessa Place’s Tragodía (2011) as {{an instance}} of reframing as contemporary feminist cultural critique. An enquiry into allegory, hermeneutics, and the performative use of indifference in Place’s conceptual writing generates insights into new narrative conditions produced by Place’s work. Tragodía does not represent trauma but rather generates trauma through a poetic practice that has a bipartite structure: conceptual writing (allegory) and Place’s performances of the narratives. Place’s performance is read in this analysis as an ancillary act of reframing that {{raises the question of}} what might be at stake in the performative use of indifference. Understood as a strategy of failure, Place’s performance parallels the lack of mediation in the conceptual act of reframing. Positioned counter to the linguistic deformation of the subjects' speech acts and the erasure of affect that occurs in the legal narratives through the act of interpretation, the refusal to interpret implicit in the act of reframing in Tragodía is an ethical gesture, a paratextual pathway to metamorphosis. In its refusal to interpret, Tragodía creates a site of contextual resistance to the oppression of the subjects’ organic narratives by the institutional language of the law, and offers a new <b>textual</b> <b>field</b> of meaning-making...|$|E
40|$|All of us {{are serious}} bibliophiles and biophiles. What {{initially}} drew us together to carry a sustained conversation, which has resulted in writing this paper, is a discovery that in our respective lived experiences of parenting we tried to cultivate in our children biophilia through bibliophilia, imagining {{that there was a}} direct and straightforward connect, almost a causal connection, between the two. Our parenting experience “taught” us otherwise; and now, through this collaborative conversation and writing, we are unpacking, with theoretical aids from the literature, the complex and complicated, not to mention practically challenging, biophilia-bibliophilia connection. This paper captures a reflective exploration and collective sharing of our own life experiment, seeking to create ripples of provocation as well as resonation in the reader. Given this intent, it is fair to declare from the outset that our narrative inquiry work here does not aim to prove, disprove, or even recommend any generalizable pedagogic thesis, if indeed such research intent is possible today in a postmodernity burdened with the understanding that “[t]here can never be a final, accurate representation of what was meant or said—only different textual representations of different experiences” (Denzin, 1997, p. 5).

In defining the Western field of colonial encounter specific critical theorists assist in its deconstruction, accounting {{for the state of}} the field of comparative literature for the last four decades. The theoretical practice that this research performs addresses the comparative hegemony through which other than Western fields are traditionally observed by permitting Quechua theorizations and practices to equally address primarily critical Western theorizations of language practice which elucidate the colonial encounter traversing the long durée of the mutually constitutive relationship of modernity and coloniality especially through the persistence of the Western constructions of Self and Other.

40|$|A central goal of {{scientific}} explanation is {{to account for}} patterns of data. An important way to assess students' abilities to construct scientific explanations is to examine how they use data as evidence. A good deal of cognitive research has explored how students respond to specific pieces of data and evaluate {{them in terms of}} a current theory or belief. This work finds that, from a normative view, students often ignore data that they ought to consider when evaluating claims, or assimilate such data in ways that do not damage their current theories. Researchers differ on whether or not such reasoning reflects an epistemological stance that is fundamentally non-scientific, or is essentially reasonable and consistent with scientific practice. This study examines high school students' efforts to use complex, multi-faceted data sets to construct causal explanations of natural selection phenomena, consistent with the theory of natural selection. The study seeks answers to two questions. What data do students select to use as evidence for their explanations? How do they refer to specific data to justify particular causal claims? Content analyses of explanations examined how students referred to data as evidence: the features of inscriptions (e. g., graphs, field notes) they referred to, and the justifications they gave for the importance of specific data. Students largely cited relevant, but insufficient, data for claims, and preferred numerical data over <b>textual</b> <b>field</b> notes. These and other uses of evidence indicate not just students' understanding of what specific data mean, but their ideas about what counts as persuasive evidence. These findings highlight the need for instruction focused on epistemic criteria for good explanations, in addition to the conceptual relations [...] ...|$|E

UK cases serve to establish the characteristics, causes and consequences of different forms of convergence and formulate a model of convergence. The model will specify the levels of newsroom convergence and the sub-units of analysis which {{will be used to}} collect empirical data from Chinese News Organisations and compare their strategies, practices and results with the UK experience. The literature review shows {{that there is a need}} for more comparative studies of media convergence strategy in general, and particularly in relation to Chinese media.

For this reason, my innovations have three folds: Firstly, to develop a new and comprehensive model of media convergence and a detailed understanding of the reasons why media companies pursue differing strategies in managing convergence across a wide range of units of analysis. Secondly, this study tries to compare the multimedia strategies of media groups under radically different political systems. Since, there is no standard research method or systematic theoretical framework for the study of Newsroom Convergence, this study develops an integrated perspective.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} William Blake's {{engagement with}} the problem of pro- ducing "prophetic" art {{within the confines of the}} fallen world, in which it is necessarily constructed using inherited fallen materials and addressed to a fallen audience. It focuses primarily on the discourse and textuality of Jeru- salem, which it reads as a negotiation of the problem of the need to con- struct prophetic vision in the context of the impossibility of any such pronouncement within history. Jerusalem is examined as a differentiated en- cyclopaedia of Minute Particulars drawn from across Blake's contexts (intel- lectual, historical, cultural, etc) in a text that is a static tissue or weave of found fragments (citations) of fallen experience. This is analysed in relation to the encyclopaedic discourse of Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project, which mediates between idealism and fatalism by addressing the fallen world as it is manifested in the material phenomena of history. Benjarnin's approach is centred around his concept of the dialectical image, which presents material phenomena dialectically so as to trigger a recognition by the audience of the fallen state that they manifest, and the existential potential that fallen occu- pation conceals. This thesis examines the operation of this materialist dia- lectic in Blake's art, as a means of redeeming the contents of the work from fallen (discursive) significance by reactivating the creative imagination of the audience. It focuses on the strategies of decentralisation and fragmenta- tion by which the fallen particulars of Jerusalem are consistently desituated from their fallen settings and placed into a shifting and de structured <b>textual</b> <b>field.</b> This makes possible the active intervention of the audience who, in the act of reading, can resolve particulars into dialectical constellations in which their shared fallen status can become apparent, and thereby be overcome.

To solve this problem, standards for representing educative contents, such as SCORM, have been developed and educative technologies such as learning objects became crucial for reuse and retrieval purposes. In this work we propose the combination of e-Learning and Semantic Web standards to provide semantic metadata, to make educative content processable not only by humans but also by machines, so that the retrieval of educative content becomes more powerful.

It {{has the potential to}} substantially facilitate biomedical research by extracting, linking, and organizing massive amounts of information that occur in biomedical journal articles as well as in <b>textual</b> <b>fields</b> of biological databases. Until recently, much of the work in biological NLP and text mining has revolved around recognizing the occurrence of biomolecular entities in articles, and in extracting particular relationships among the entities. Now, researchers have recognized a need to link the extracted information to ontologies or knowledge bases, which is a more difficult task. One such knowledge base is Gene Ontology annotations (GOA), which significantly increases semantic computations over the function, cellular components and processes of genes. For multicellular organisms, these annotations can be refined with phenotypic context, such as the cell type, tissue, and organ because establishing phenotypic contexts in which a gene is expressed is a crucial step for understanding the development and the molecular underpinning of the pathophysiology of diseases. In this paper, we propose a system, PhenoGO, which automatically augments annotations in GOA with additional context. PhenoGO utilizes a...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 “Making Sense: Race and Modern Vision” explores how race {{as we know}} {{it becomes}} {{visually}} recognizable. It does so by historicizing the perceptual knowledge produced by race and vision and by demonstrating how the relationship between race and vision has come to be regarded as common sensical. In particular the dissertation examines how race has been visually structured by the development of writing practices in the modern transatlantic context. Through the analysis of a wide <b>textual</b> <b>field</b> including fiction, philosophy, and visual art, “Making Sense” traces how race has acquired “visuality” via writing that represents race as self-evidently visible. The central argument is that the practice of writing literally makes sense of race because, tautologically, the visuality of race is represented as existent prior to its discursive presentation. While scholars have offered rich critiques of the role scientific vision has played in defining race (and justifying racial subjection), they have tended to explain the relationship between race and vision as overdetermined. “Making Sense” takes a different approach. It asks how the relationship between race and vision has been generated as common sensical in exploring vision through its historically aesthetic, or, sensorial structure. The story that “Making Sense” tells is narrated across four chapters. The chapters analyze a wide and unusual range of literary, visual, scientific, and philosophical texts that engage in racial discourse, including runaway slave advertisements, Kantian aesthetic philosophy, Darwinian evolutionary theory, turn-of-the-century architectural theories, black modernist fiction, and contemporary visual artwork. This collection of texts, produced in the context of national and global discourses of race, aesthetics, and modernity, is regarded as an archive of common sense vision. “Making Sense” examines how this archive demonstrates and exposes the fundamentally discursive structure and the formalist organization of the visual sense. In tracking the universalizing moves of formalist discourses, “Making Sense” utilizes formal methods, including close reading. This dissertation’s innovation on formal analysis reorients what it means to perform historical scholarship and shows how narrow forms of disciplinary study have produced platitudes about race and vision...|$|E

The Zone is an apocalyptic space of signification where the Rocket serves as another ambiguous Logos.

40|$|Speech, {{ethics and}} the other between Athens and Jerusalem A {{comparative}} study of Plato and Rosenzweig The starting hypothesis of this study consists in the insight that the way of speeking determines what kind of reality can be the object of language {{and what kind of}} relationality is possible. The cultural and ethical world is formed by the way in which she is narrated or spoken of. The hypothesis is worked out in an analysis of the literary genres in The Republic of Plato and The Star of Redemption of Rosenzweig. Both authors give a different appreciation of the possibilities of rhetorics, lyrics, epics and dramatics. 	In The Republic, Plato brings language to a decisive crisis. The form of rhetorics is excluded in favour of the philosophical 'dialogical' way of thinking which is founded on the primacy of the first grammatical person, plural (the we). In the dialogue, one looks for the truth. Therefore, every external critical instance is excluded and the participants of the dialogue become their own judges. Simularly, the epics, lyrics and dramatics are excluded because of their dangerous ontological status and their mimetical character. Within the <b>textual</b> <b>field</b> of philosophy and after the crisis of literature, Plato is able to describe justice as the fulfillment of the own task of each part of the soul within a hierarchical state where everyone fulfills his own task. 	Rosenzweig rehabilitates the literary genres that were rejected by Plato. The dangerous dramatics become the most important form of arts that brings together the epical broath of narration of the lyrical depth of dialogue. In the dramatics, the existence of God, man and world are interrelated with each other. This web of relations forms reality. In this perspective, ethics is not seen as the fulfillment of the own task but as the response of autonomous freedom (first grammatical person) to the call of the alterity (second grammatical person) in favour of the unaccomplished world and fellow man (third grammatical person). The epical life history is confronted with the lyrical depth or hight of existence and results in the dramatical interactions of living. 	Conclusion: The strict rational way of thinking, founded by Plato, leads to a type of ethics where there is no place for the other. The reality of the other can be introduced in philosophical thinking by taking seriously the polysemy of literature that evocates 'unthinkable' dimensions of the reality. The appreciation of language is congruent with the type of ethics and the place of the other. The jewish tradition has another type of speeking, formed by the reality of revelation, than the greek way of thinking. status: publishe...|$|E

Since we are a group specialized in Natural Language Processing, we discarded the visual aspect and we only dealt with the <b>textual</b> <b>fields</b> of the documents. We chose descriptors belonging to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) in order to expand the queries and the documents; therefore, these metadata were supposed to improve the retrieval process, and to be an interlingua between the collection and the topics for the multilingual tasks. MeSH descriptors for query and document expansion could be automatically computed via two strategies. Each document of this collection is provided with several fields describing the image such as title or caption; so we applied a local lexical MeSH categorizer to these fields in order to automatically extract a set of MeSH descriptors.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the intense politicization of Latin American prose fiction in the mid-twentieth century creates a <b>textual</b> <b>field</b> so potent that the smallest narrative units brim with political significance. Through analysis of two mid-century authors, Peruvian José María Arguedas and Mexican Juan Rulfo, I demonstrate how by reading at a smaller scale, with sensitivity to minute manipulations of form, we at once enrich and complicate our understanding of their fiction's aesthetic and political aims. Moving beyond immediately visible formal categories such as plot structure and dialect, I explore how Rulfo and Arguedas deploy subtle, strange, and inventive narrative strategies [...] such as understated descriptive passages and small-scale mimetic lapses [...] in order to lay bare entrenched colonial patterns of thought and behavior and to model pluralistic, egalitarian modes of discourse and perception. This politicized mobilization of the formal categories of fiction is what I call "narrative activism. " Following Bakhtin, I explore novels and short stories as imaginative democracies [...] resonant with the cacophony of dissenting voices [...] built up from the textual grassroots: the double-voiced word or phrase, the quiet shift in narrative perspective. My analysis also draws on classical narratology, feminist narratology, and the new field of unnatural narratology, yet I do not privilege narrative form {{at the expense of}} political concerns. Rather, the dissertation models a method of reading suited to mid-century prose works, whose subtle and complex formal properties constitute the very locus of their engagement with political issues. Though analysis of form has animated prior critical approaches to Rulfo and Arguedas, perhaps most famously in Ángel Rama's account of their fiction as narrative transculturation, I contend that these studies lack the fine-tuned analysis narratology enables and mid-century texts reward. The tools of narratology allow me to isolate and examine textual properties prior critics have not seen in order to bring into clearer focus the political stakes, ambitions, and agency of the mid-century tradition. Across four chapters I offer readings of the politics of form thus conceived, but I also engage the work of such theorists as Susan Sniader Lanser and Geoffrey Galt Harpham to consider how prose fiction from the 1940 s and 50 s [...] conceived by its authors as ethically and politically relevant, then further politicized by its reading public [...] takes readerly transformation as its ultimate end. Chapter One, "José María Arguedas and the Reinvention of Narrative Voice: A New Look at Yawar Fiesta," analyzes Arguedas's reinvention of narrative voice in an overlooked work of mid-century fiction. Chapter Two, "The Politics of Description in Arguedas's Los ríos profundos," complements this focus on narrative voice in Arguedas's work with analysis of the politics of the sensory body as worked out in obscure passages of narrative description. Chapter Three, "The Narratee, The Reader, and the Problem of Judgment in Juan Rulfo's `¡Diles que no me maten!'," argues for the crucial, yet widely unacknowledged, role played by the narratee in the politics of Juan Rulfo's fiction. Chapter Four, "Heteroglossia in Latin American Fiction: Rulfo's Pedro Páramo," argues that heteroglossia constitutes an important mode of narrative activism in Pedro Páramo and relates this claim to Ángel Rama's and Roberto González Echevarría's heteroglossic theories of Latin American fiction. Throughout the dissertation, I demonstrate how attention to small, seemingly marginal details of mid-century fiction illuminates the texts' political commitments in unexpectedly powerful ways...|$|E
40|$|On {{the most}} general, {{theological}} level this dissertation explores the origins, ensuing articulations, and intellectual implications {{of what has}} been characterized as a new Christian "political-historical consciousness" (politisch-historisches Bewusstsein) &mdashthat totalizing reconception of history and ecclesial identity that enabled early Christians to imagine themselves as simultaneously new to {{the world in terms of}} revelation and yet also ancient with respect to God's eternal plan. On the more specific and descriptive level, I propose that a key to mapping the early development of this new historical consciousness comes via detailed analysis of a single term introduced by the apostle Paul into the Christian theological lexicon, the noun mysterion and the particular understanding of history and revelation that is commonly coupled with it, an understanding I refer to in varying ways as the "once hidden, now revealed" mystery schema. It is, I claim, the historical arrangement of this once hidden/now revealed discourse, and thus the comprehensive division of time into adjacent eras of concealment and revelation, that provided Christians of the first two centuries with the intellectual architecture and concomitant discursive schema that formulated and then further legitimized some of the most original claims of Christian theology. Among these claims are, most notably, ecclesiological propositions regarding the status of the Gentiles among the people of God, hermeneutical propositions related to the revisionary Christian readings of Israel's scriptures, and christological propositions about the unified identity of the newly revealed Christ and the creator God of Israel. Insofar as such propositions were named as mysteries [...] which is to say, as realities newly revealed but eternally known by the God of Israel [...] and yet were argued independently of, if not in contradiction of, Torah and other authoritative Jewish writings (see chapters five), or on the basis of Jewish scriptures but without any obvious presence in their "plain sense" (see chapters six and seven), or by appeal to what had become a <b>textual</b> <b>field</b> of authoritative Christian writings (see chapter eight), some sort of new intellectual apparatus was needed to articulate these novel claims. The notion of an eternal mystery previously hidden but recently disclosed to the world, provided just such an apparatus. A detailed lexical analysis of "mystery" in Paul and other early Christian authors should thus provide a helpful constraint for analyzing these larger and less tangible subjects of early Christian thinking about divine revelation and the structure of history. 	To be clear, in training my attention on the word and the "once hidden, now revealed" discourse, I am not presuming some sort of idealized concept-in-word equation (or, in this case, a discourse-in-word equation), the error of nomenclaturism as Saussure termed it. Nor am I suggesting that mysterion had any sort of fixed meaning, much less a totality of meanings to be smuggled into every occurrence. The linguistic axioms that words and things share no inviolable, one-to-one correspondence, and that sentences (or more complex syntactical strucutres), not individual lexemes, are to be regarded as the fundamental units determining meaning should by now be truisms. My focus on mysterion is simply motivated, first, by the observation that when this signifier is used by early Christian authors it most frequently refers to some theological or hermeneutical claim that was previously hidden but is now currently disclosed and thus, second, by the practicality of treating this word as a limiting heuristic for analyzing the more nebulous hidden/revealed discursive formation. This is not to confuse the word for the discourse. Rather it is to use this particular word, which so often appears to be a near technical term for the discourse, as an entry point into it.

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, speech-based {{question}} answering (QA) has become very popular in contrast to pure search engine based approaches on a desktop. Open-domain QA systems are now much more powerful and precise, {{and they can be}} used in speech applications. Speech-based question answering systems often rely on predefined grammars for speech understanding. In order to improve the coverage of such complex AI systems, we reused speech patterns used to generate textual entailment patterns. These can make multimodal question understanding more robust. We exemplify this {{in the context of a}} domain-specific dialogue scenario. As a result, written text input components (e. g., in a <b>textual</b> input <b>field)</b> can deal with more flexible input according to the derived textual entailment patterns. A multimodal QA dialogue spanning over several domains of interest, i. e., personal address book entries, questions about the music domain and politicians and other celebrities, demonstrates how the textual input mode can be used in a multimodal dialogue shell. 1...|$|R

40|$|A patent is a {{contract}} between the inventor and the state, granting {{a limited time}} period to the inventor to exploit his invention. In exchange, the inventor must put {{a detailed description of}} his invention in the public domain. Patents can encourage innovation and economic growth but at the time of economic crisis patents can hamper such growth. The long duration of the application process is a big obstacle {{that needs to be addressed}} to maximize the benefit of patents on innovation and economy. This time can be significantly improved by changing the way we search the patent and non-patent literature. Despite the recent advancement of general information retrieval and the revolution of Web Search engines, there is still a huge gap between the emerging technologies from the research labs and adapted by major Internet search engines, and the systems which are in use by the patent search communities. In this thesis we investigate the problem of patent prior art search in patent retrieval with the goal of finding documents which describe the idea of a query patent. A query patent is a full patent application composed of hundreds of terms which does not represent a single focused information need. Other relevance evidences (e. g. classification tags, and bibliographical data) provide additional details about the underlying information need of the query patent. The first goal of this thesis is to estimate a uni-gram query model from the <b>textual</b> <b>fields</b> of a query patent. We then improve the initial query representation using noun phrases extracted from the query patent. We show that expansion in a query-dependent manner is useful. The second contribution of this thesis is to address the term mismatch problem from a query formulation point of view by integrating multiple relevance evidences associated with the query patent. To do this, we enhance the initial representation of the query with the term distribution of the community of inventors related to the topic of the query patent. We then build a lexicon using classification tags and show that query expansion using this lexicon and considering proximity information (between query and expansion terms) can improve the retrieval performance. We perform an empirical evaluation of our proposed models on two patent datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed models can achieve significantly better results than the baseline and other enhanced models...|$|R
