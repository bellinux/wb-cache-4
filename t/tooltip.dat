Windows Explorer went {{through a number of}} other changes. Larger image and video previews were displayed in a <b>tooltip</b> when the mouse hovered over a file, column-level filtering of results was introduced, and overall performance of Explorer was somewhat improved over build 4015, though the memory leak issues were not entirely resolved. There was also a new analog clock user interface. Batch image processing of images was also introduced, making it possible for a user to rotate a number of images at once.|$|E
25|$|The {{debugger}} allows setting breakpoints (which allow execution to {{be stopped}} temporarily at a certain position) and watches (which monitor the values of variables as the execution progresses). Breakpoints can be conditional, meaning they get triggered when the condition is met. Code can be stepped over, i.e., run one line (of source code) at a time. It can either step into functions to debug inside it, or step over it, i.e., {{the execution of the}} function body isn't available for manual inspection. The debugger supports Edit and Continue, i.e., it allows code to be edited as it is being debugged. When debugging, if the mouse pointer hovers over any variable, its current value is displayed in a <b>tooltip</b> ("data tooltips"), where it can also be modified if desired. During coding, the Visual Studio debugger lets certain functions be invoked manually from the Immediate tool window. The parameters to the method are supplied at the Immediate window.|$|E

40|$|Many health {{professionals}} {{in developing countries}} lack the proper competence for the work they are doing. <b>Tooltips</b> have previously proven to be effective, and may assist such {{health professionals}} in their daily routines entering data to health information systems. By using qualitative and quantitative methods, this thesis aim to research two aspects of tooltips; finding user preference for content types for <b>tooltips</b> and evaluations methods {{to find the most}} effective <b>tooltips,</b> in terms of helping users enter correct data to the system. The target group is health workers in African countries, and especially those who lack the proper competence for the work they are performing. This research has included participants from three African countries, Malawi, South Africa and Ethiopia. Most of our findings are based on Malawian health workers, as they represent a greater share of our participants. We have used questionnaires, a modified question-suggestion approach and a quasi-experiment to explore preferences of <b>tooltips,</b> what <b>tooltips</b> would be effective, what methods one should use to find effective <b>tooltips</b> and whether <b>tooltips</b> have an effect or not. Firstly, we found that most of our participants prefer a range of normal values, instead of explanations, as content type for <b>tooltips.</b> Secondly, we found that <b>tooltips</b> containing explanations outperform those with normal values, in terms of correctness of data entry. Thirdly, we found that low content validity evaluations, such as a questionnaire, could not replace high content validity evaluations, such as field experiments. Lastly, we found that <b>tooltips</b> do have an effect, since the correctness of data entry increased and several participants stated that they learned from the <b>tooltips...</b>|$|R

One of its features is the extensive use of Super <b>Tooltips,</b> which explain in about one paragraph what each function performs. Some of them also use diagrams or pictures.

25|$|A {{vertical}} toolbar {{known as}} the charms (accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen, or pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a screen) provides access to system and app-related functions, such as search, sharing, device management, settings, and a Start button. The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen. The Start button on the taskbar from previous versions of Windows has {{been converted into a}} hotspot in the lower-left corner of the screen, which displays a large <b>tooltip</b> displaying a thumbnail of the Start screen. Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop. Pointing the cursor in the top-left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a thumbnail list of active apps. Aside from the removal of the Start button and the replacement of the Aero Glass theme with a flatter and solid-colored design, the desktop interface on Windows 8 {{is similar to that of}} Windows 7.|$|E
2500|$|The tooltips modeled in {{this work}} are {{intended}} to be used only in carefully controlled environments (e.g., vacuum). Maximum acceptable limits for <b>tooltip</b> translational and rotational misplacement errors are reported in Peng et al. (2006) -- tooltips must be positioned with great accuracy to avoid bonding the dimer incorrectly. [...] Peng et al. (2006) reports that increasing the handle thickness from 4 support planes of C atoms above the <b>tooltip</b> to 5 planes decreases the resonance frequency of the entire structure from 2.0THz to 1.8THz. [...] More importantly, the vibrational footprints of a DCB6Ge <b>tooltip</b> mounted on a 384-atom handle and of the same <b>tooltip</b> mounted on a similarly constrained but much larger 636-atom [...] "crossbar" [...] handle are virtually identical in the non-crossbar directions. Additional computational studies modeling still bigger handle structures are welcome, but the ability to precisely position SPM tips to the requisite atomic accuracy has been repeatedly demonstrated experimentally at low temperature, or even at room temperature constituting a basic existence proof for this capability.|$|E
