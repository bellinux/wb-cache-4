25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected to do <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>learning,</b> so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to feel responsible for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>learning,</b> and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E

The main goal is to encourage students to come up with ideas of <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> <b>learn</b> good reasoning and discussion skills.

25|$|In a {{study on}} Holstein–Friesian heifers {{learning}} to press a panel to open a gate for access to a food reward, the researchers also recorded the heart rate and behavior of the heifers when moving along the race towards the food. When the heifers made clear improvements in learning, they had higher heart rates and tended to move more vigorously along the race. The researchers concluded this was an indication that cattle may react emotionally to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>learning</b> improvement.|$|E

Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a social institution through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive {{in an environment where}} they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>learning.</b>|$|E

500|$|According to Little, Rosenberg's {{early work}} with {{children}} with learning disabilities shows his interest in psycholinguistics and the power of language, as well as his emphasis on collaboration. In its initial development, the NVC model re-structured the pupil-teacher relationship to give students greater responsibility for, and decision-making related to, <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>learning.</b> The model has evolved over the years to incorporate institutional power relationships (i.e., police-citizen, boss-employee) and informal ones (i.e. man-woman, rich-poor, adult-youth, parent-child). The ultimate aim is to develop societal relationships based on a restorative, [...] "partnership" [...] paradigm and mutual respect, rather than a retributive, fear-based, [...] "domination" [...] paradigm.|$|E

2500|$|The Silent Way is a {{discovery}} learning approach, invented by Caleb Gattegno {{in the late}} 1950s. The teacher is largely silent, giving more space {{for the students to}} explore the language. [...] Students are responsible for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>learning</b> and are encouraged to express themselves; beginners talk about what they see, more advanced students talk about their lives and what they think. [...] The role of the teacher is not to model the language but to correct mistakes by giving sensitive feedback. With respect to teaching pronunciation, the Silent Way {{is a good example of}} the Articulatory Approach.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gradual release}} of {{responsibility}} model or GRR {{model is a}} particular style of teaching which is a structured method of pedagogy framed around a process devolving responsibility within the learning process from the teacher to the eventual independence of the learner. This instructional model requires that the teacher, by design, transitions from assuming [...] "all the responsibility for performing a task...to {{a situation in which}} the students assume all of the responsibility". The ideal result is a confident learner who accepts responsibility for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>learning</b> and directs this learning through the cognitive processes involved, moving through the academic spectrum, to independent choice (personalised learning). As Buehl (2005) stated, the GRR model [...] "emphasizes instruction that mentors students into becoming capable thinkers and learners when handling the tasks with which they have not yet developed expertise".|$|E
5000|$|While the magisterial reformers {{wanted to}} {{substitute}} <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>learned</b> elite for the learned elite of the Catholic Church, the radical Protestant groups rejected {{the authority of}} the institutional [...] "church" [...] organization, almost entirely, as being unbiblical. As the search for original Christianity was carried further, it was claimed that the tension between the church and the Roman Empire in the first centuries of Christianity was normative, that the church is not to be allied with government sacralism, that a true church is always subject to be persecuted, and that the conversion of Constantine I was therefore the Great Apostasy that marked a deviation from pure Christianity.|$|R

There {{was not a man}} in Great Britain to whom the emoluments of office would have been more useful. It is one of the standing mysteries in literary biography how Burke could think of entering Parliament without any means that anybody can now trace of earning a fitting livelihood. Yet at this time Burke, whom we saw not long ago writing for the booksellers, had become affluent enough to pay a yearly allowance to Barry, the painter, in order to enable him to study the pictures in the great European galleries, and to make a prolonged residence at Rome. A little later he took a step which makes the riddle still more difficult, and which has given abundant employment to wits who are maximi in minimis, and think that every question which they can ask, yet to which history has thought it worth while to leave no answer, is somehow a triumph of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>learning</b> and dialectic.|$|E

The findings indicate that children in early childhood settings can use ICT to direct <b>their</b> <b>own</b> inquiry <b>learning.</b> Two key factors are identified that enable this.
