40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} {{seasonal}} and spatial variations of nutrients, permanganate index and chlorophyll-a of the Xitiaoxi <b>tributaries.</b> The {{results show that}} most of nutrients, CODMn and chlorophyll-a in dry season are higher than in wet season. The concentrations of TN and NO 3 [...] N show significant higher in the <b>tributaries</b> dominated by woodland. The contents of TP, TDP and chl-a in <b>tributaries</b> influenced by towns are higher than the <b>tributaries</b> located in farmland and woodland. CODMn in mixed-source lands of farmland and towns have the highest concentration, followed by towns and woodland dominated <b>tributaries.</b> The rates of TN/TP indicate that eutrophication in most of <b>tributaries</b> are limited by TP. The correlations between nutrients, CODMn and Chl-a indicate the concentrations of organics and microorganism are associated with nitrogen and phosphorus in waters. Land use {{is the most important}} factor affecting water quality in <b>tributaries</b> of Xitiaoxi watershed. The values of TDP/TP in towns dominated <b>tributaries</b> are higher than other <b>tributaries.</b> Mixed-source lands are the most important factor affecting NH 4 +-N values...|$|R
