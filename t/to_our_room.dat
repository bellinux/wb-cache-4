6000|$|... "You {{should write}} out this history for your grandchildren, Mr. Carvel," [...] he added, as he bade his Swiss light us <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "A strange yarn indeed, captain." ...|$|E
60|$|A bath at Baker Street and a {{complete}} change freshened me up wonderfully. When I came down <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> I found the breakfast laid and Homes pouring out the coffee.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, Monsieur le Capitaine, may I {{trespass}} {{upon your}} generosity to beseech {{you to let}} me take these litigants <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> upstairs, and to leave us alone there for a half-hour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And am I {{to waste}} {{my life and}} grow old ingloriously on that account?' demanded the youth, who had by this time come up <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we'd {{better get}} back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> and get into bed as soon as possible," [...] said Jack. [...] "They may report us, {{and some of the}} professors may come around to investigate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Ned, {{come around}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> to-night {{and give us}} some music just to {{celebrate}} this glorious event!" [...] cried Fred, for Ned Lowe was quite a performer on the mandolin and usually had some very funny songs to sing.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{naturally}} interested me. I {{asked what}} sort of sermons Mr. Mirabel preached. Lady Janeaway said: 'Come up <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> after dinner. The subject is too distressing to be discussed in public.' ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the evening}} of the party Jerry and I went <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> to dress. And there, across at her window in the twilight, sat Miss Ponsonby, crying. I had never seen Miss Ponsonby cry before.|$|E
60|$|We went <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> {{but until}} the small hours the wind of the old traveller's talk could still be heard at {{intervals}} from the kitchen, mingled with occasional shrill explosions of laughter from the listening children.|$|E
60|$|The Palace Hotel, {{with its}} doorway brightly lighted with electricity, proved a {{pleasant}} surprise. It looked clean and bright and new, and the proprietor, a cheerful and self-respecting citizen, was equally reassuring. We went <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> with restored confidence in Oklahoma.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Cliff, [...] "one {{thing is}} certain! I'm {{not going to}} turn any of them out of their warm beds this night; and we might as well go <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> for it must be a good deal after ten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{these things}} drive one to despair. I don't wonder {{the bodies of}} so many genteel strangers {{are found in the}} waters around New York. Shall we try the south side, my dear? or had we better go back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> and rest awhile?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When the {{old woman}} had given us {{the address of the}} person who had the letting of the cottage, and Jone and me had gone <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> I said to him, before we had time to sit down: ...|$|E
6000|$|When we {{told the}} good man that he could stay all night, he was {{extremely}} obliged to us, {{and went to bed}} quite early. After we had fastened the house and had gone <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> my wife said to me, ...|$|E
60|$|We {{both said}} good-night, {{and went up}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> with a new object in view. By our father's advice we had {{resolved}} on keeping diaries, {{for the first time}} in our lives, and had pledged ourselves to begin before we went to bed.|$|E
60|$|The dressing-bell {{rang out}} and we hurried off <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> for Dr. Randall, easy-going enough in some things, was {{strictness}} itself with regard <b>to</b> <b>our</b> punctuality at dinner-time. But no sooner had I seen de Cartienne safely in his room than I softly made my way downstairs again and crossed the yard to the stables.|$|R
6000|$|... "Having already {{mentioned}} to you my own conviction that Magdalen was not herself {{when you saw}} her on Wednesday, I feel tempted to stop here and give you an instance in proof of what I say. The little circumstance happened on Wednesday night, just before we went up <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was {{one o'clock}} {{the next morning}} before Guest and I turned homeward <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> for we had thought it well to separate, and I could tell him what had passed between Lady Dennisford and myself. He heard me without interruption, but I saw his face twitch with anxiety.|$|R
6000|$|... "So you shall, Dan; but I'd rather you wouldn't {{come with}} me now, 'cause there was nothin' said about my bringin' anybody. Keep on with Bill an' Jip, an' I'll go over <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> jest as soon as I get through at the engine-house." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jone {{paid the}} men, {{including}} the two extra shillings, {{and when we}} went up <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> he said, [...] "The next time we go out in two bath-chairs, I {{am going to have}} a chain fastened to yours, and I'll have hold of the other end of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} before he went away--bolted out, I should say. He nodded {{and pointed at the}} curtain <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room.</b> He knew you were there, of course. He seemed to think--he seemed to try to give me to {{understand}} that you were in special--well, danger. You know how he talks." ...|$|E
60|$|One party says--We arrange our lives--even {{the best}} and boldest {{men and women that}} exist, just as much as the most limited--with {{reference}} to what society conventionally rules and makes right. We retire <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> for freedom; <b>to</b> undress, bathe, unloose everything in freedom. These, and much else, would not be proper in society.|$|R
60|$|Retired <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> Laura and I {{talked on}} the same subject until the clock tolled Christmas, and the {{neighbouring}} church bells rang out a jubilation. And, looking out into the quiet night, where the stars were keenly shining, we committed ourselves to rest with humbled hearts; praying, for all those we loved, a blessing of peace and goodwill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, of course! {{we could}} {{get rid of the}} stairs," [...] I agreed. [...] "It would be a bit awkward at first, when we wanted to go to bed. But I daresay we should get used to it. We could have a ladder and climb up <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> through the windows. Or we might adopt the Norwegian method and have the stairs outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't both {{stay here}} all night," [...] said Christian; [...] "if any one comes <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> {{there will be}} nobody to answer. We can't lift these {{pictures}} over the gate. One of us must go back; you can climb over the gate--there {{is nothing to be}} afraid of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{eight o'clock}} on the {{appointed}} evening, several of us professed great weariness, and went <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> leaving the rest sewing virtuously with Miss Cotton, who read Hannah More's Sacred Dramas aloud, {{in a way}} that fitted the listeners for bed as well as a dose of opium would have done.|$|E
60|$|I {{took off}} my {{knapsack}} {{and gave it to}} my wife, who carried it <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> while I went to look for Mr. Gilbert. Fortunately I found him just {{as he was about to}} go up to his chamber. He took my offered hand, but looked at me sadly and gravely.|$|E
60|$|As <b>to</b> <b>our</b> bed <b>rooms,</b> {{you must}} know that all the apartments in this house are named after {{different}} plays of Shakspeare, the name being printed conspicuously over each door; so that the choosing of <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> made us a little sport.|$|R
60|$|So {{we shall}} come back of course, if we live; indeed, we leave this house {{ready to come}} back to, meaning, if we can, <b>to</b> let <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> simply.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first thing}} Charles did on {{receiving}} this strange communication was to bolt downstairs and inquire for the dispatch-box. It {{had just arrived}} by Eagle Express Company. Charles rushed up <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms</b> again, opened it feverishly, and counted his documents. When he found them all safe, {{he turned to me}} with a hard smile. [...] "This letter," [...] he said, with quivering lips, [...] "I consider still more insulting than all his previous ones." ...|$|R
60|$|Clarence had {{not come}} into the drawing-room with them, and while my mother, who had a great {{objection}} to people standing about in out- door garments, sent them up to doff their bonnets and furs, I repaired <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room,</b> and was horrified to find him on my bed, white and faint.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems {{hard to say}} it, but, in my opinion, he {{is better}} under lock and key, for everybody's good, at present. He'd be a {{firebrand}} in the town if he got away. Meantime, let us go <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room.</b> It is about the time when everybody is taking a siesta, and for two hours, thank Heaven! we're certain nothing more can happen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, when Nellie and I got <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>room</b> {{she threw}} herself {{on the bed and}} cried as if her heart was breaking. I couldn't do {{anything}} with her. I wanted {{to find out what it}} was all about, but at first she wouldn't tell me a word. Then she said it was Tom--that he had acted so queerly when they took a walk in the park he had scared her." ...|$|E
60|$|She tripped away by {{the side}} of her maid, turning round more than once to wave her hand to us. Then we hurried along <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms,</b> which were {{at the end of the}} wide, marble-pillared {{corridor}} and opened one into the other. Our portmanteaux had been placed in readiness, so dressing was not a tedious business. I had finished first and lounged in an easy chair, watching Cecil struggle with a refractory white tie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stupid!" [...] cried Uncle John. [...] "We {{never thought}} of the hall-porter. Come back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> sitting <b>room,</b> and we'll have him up in a jiffy." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{went upstairs}} <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>rooms.</b> Charles had {{gathered}} together {{a few friends}} to watch the performance. The Seer entered, wrapt in thought. He was in evening dress, but a red sash round his waist gave a touch of picturesqueness {{and a dash of}} colour. He paused for a moment {{in the middle of the}} salon, without letting his eyes rest on anybody or anything. Then he walked straight up to Charles, and held out his dark hand.|$|R
