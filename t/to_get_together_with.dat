500|$|Sara Stewart of the New York Post {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "Sure, it's not as novel as the first time we were here, but {{directors}} Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud stay true to the clever, slapstick vibe." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Despicable Me 2 feels like an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> some old friends, hang out, and discover what they've been up to." [...] Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The scope of the 'toon espionage-adventure goings-on is surprisingly limited. But the filmmakers so clearly love working on these characters, their creative joy is infectious." [...] Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "The animation is beguiling, particularly when Lucy drives her car into the ocean, transforming it into a submarine that scoots around sharks and fish." [...] Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "While not quite as charming or unique as the original, Despicable Me 2 comes awfully close, extending co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin's delightfully silly sensibility to a bit larger universe." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "It's a credit that the writing can be so funny in the moment, that it takes time to realize there's no cohesive story, zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either the characters in the film or the people watching in the theater." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Darren's {{earliest}} storylines saw him {{and friend}} Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) stand up to bully Mark Gibbs (Colin Parry). Darren becomes friends with Mark {{in an attempt to}} deter Mark's bullying but Mark soon after rapes Luke. Darren takes advantage of the situation and begins a relationship with Luke's girlfriend Mandy Richardson (Sarah Jayne Dunn). Dawson commented on this saying, [...] "Darren liked Mandy even before he went to America so he was gutted when he came back to discover she had started going out with Luke. And all along, Luke knew that Darren wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> Mandy ... Luke has other things on his mind and seems to be ignoring Mandy, so Darren thinks it is the perfect opportunity to make his move". Before Darren asks Mandy out he confronts Luke who [...] "gives him the green light". Dawson opined that although viewers may think Mandy and Darren are being [...] "heartless" [...] they don't know about Luke's attack so are not to blame. Dawson felt that initially the relationship is a [...] "flirty kind of friendship" [...] although Mandy realises she likes Darren and plans to use Darren as a means of reuniting with Luke. As Darren and Mandy spend more time together their relationship [...] "develops". If Darren were to find out about Luke's rape, Dawson felt Darren would help Luke get [...] "revenge" [...] on Mark. He said Mandy would either be [...] "shocked and turn to Darren for support" [...] or [...] "feel guilty about what she's done" [...] and reunite with Luke. Dawson felt if this were to happen Darren would [...] "try to shrug it off" [...] although [...] "deep down, he cares for Mandy". Dawson felt that Darren should become a [...] "hero" [...] to Luke, fixing all his problems which would rectify him beginning a relationship with Mandy.|$|E
