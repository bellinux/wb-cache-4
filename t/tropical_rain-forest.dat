40|$|The {{negative}} effects of roads on wildlife in <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forests</b> are poorly understood. Road construction has high priority in Africa, while negative impacts of roads on wildlife movement often are neglected. This study aims at providing information {{on the effects of}} roads on crossing behaviour of rainforest wildlife. The probability that wild-life would cross forest roads was analysed for association with ten different factors that were linked to road presence or construction. Factors were divided into three classes: vegetation cover, topography and human influence. A trackplot survey was done in southern Cameroon, Africa. Trackplots were laid along a 32 km unpaved logging road that intersects Campo-Ma’an National Park. Tracks of several species were found frequently (e. g. genets and porcupines); while others were found only sporadically (e. g. forest duikers and apes). The actual physical obstacles found along the road (e. g. logs, banks, etc.) were highly negatively correlated with crossing probabilities. For all wildlife species high vegetation cover was positively cor-related to crossing probability. This study indicates that roads have a large impact on wildlife, and suggests which factors could be altered during road construction and maintenance in order to mitigate these impacts...|$|R
40|$|Background : African {{tropical}} rainforests {{are one of}} {{the most}} important hotspots to look for changes in the upcoming decades when it comes to C storage and release. The focus of studying C dynamics in these systems lies traditionally on living aboveground biomass. Belowground soil organic carbon stocks have received little attention and estimates of the size, controls and distribution of soil organic carbon stocks are highly uncertain. In our study on lowland rainforest in the central Congo basin, we combine both an assessment of the aboveground C stock with an assessment of the belowground C stock and analyze the latter in terms of functional pools and controlling factors. Principal Findings : Our study shows that despite similar vegetation, soil and climatic conditions, soil organic carbon stocks in an area with greater tree height (=larger aboveground carbon stock) were only half compared to an area with lower tree height (=smaller aboveground carbon stock). This suggests that substantial variability in the aboveground vs. belowground C allocation strategy and/or C turnover in two similar tropical forest systems can lead to significant differences in total soil organic C content and C fractions with important consequences for the assessment of the total C stock of the system. Conclusions/Significance : We suggest nutrient limitation, especially potassium, as the driver for aboveground versus belowground C allocation. However, other drivers such as C turnover, tree functional traits or demographic considerations cannot be excluded. We argue that large and unaccounted variability in C stocks is to be expected in African <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forests.</b> Currently, these differences in aboveground and belowground C stocks are not adequately verified and implemented mechanistically into Earth System Models. This will, hence, introduce additional uncertainty to models and predictions of the response of C storage of the Congo basin forest to climate change and its contribution to the terrestrial C budget...|$|R

40|$|Large {{seasonal}} {{variation in the}} rate of change in girth of <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forest</b> tree species has been described, but its origin is still under debate. We tested whether this variation might be related to variation in atmospheric relative humidity through its influence on bark water content and thickness. Variation in trunk circumference of 182 adult trees was measured about twice a month in an undisturbed tropical rain forest over 18 mo using dendrometers. Furthermore, a laboratory experiment was conducted to test the direct influence of relative air humidity on bark water content and thickness. In the field, most trees displayed highly positive rates of change in girth {{at the onset of the}} wet season, while a quarter of the trees displayed negative changes during long dry seasons, whatever their total annual growth. This variation was correlated with environmental conditions, particularly with atmospheric relative humidity. Trees with high bark water content and thickness displayed a stronger decrease in girth during the dry season. In the chamber experiment, desiccation induced a decrease in the diameter of the trunk sections in tandem with a decrease in bark water content. As a result, {{seasonal variation}} {{in the rate of}} change in girth of <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forest</b> trees reflects variation in trunk biophysical properties, through the influence of relative humidity on bark properties, but not directly variation in secondary growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} plant species distribution, the {{richness}} of species composition, the distribution of resources among species and the manner of change in these parameters across landscapes are examined in three habitats on North Stradbroke Island. The closed-heath vegetation of a freshwater swamp, the grassland and low closed-forest of a frontal low dune sequence and the closed sclerophyllous forests of inland high dunes are studied {{by a variety of}} statistical techniques, including a new method for determining the degree and scale of microcommunity pattern. Of the three vegetation types, the floristic diversity and complexity of spatial patterning within a small area is highest in the freshwater swamp vegetation. Not only is the scale of spatial variation smallest in this habitat, but the scale of patterning and co-association also becomes smaller as one proceeds into the swamp. The complexity of the vegetation is enhanced by a remarkably high species richness, a very low concentration of dominance and a high degree of intermingling of species. The floristic diversity and complexity of spatial patterning within such a small area of vegetation bears comparison with that of complex <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forest.</b> The swamp vegetation appears to have undergone a high degree of speciation; at the same time, intermixture of species and the small scale of patterning have served as a means of minimizing intraspecific competition.

The Serra do Mar consists of a hilly region along {{the east coast of}} Brazil, with high slopes and many geological structures in a gneiss - migmatitic terrain. In contrast to traditional approaches, this method proposes that structural data (foliation, fractures and bedding planes) and its relation with the slope geometry, is important to be consider in the landslide zonation hazard, along with declivity, relative relief, soil and rock properties, land use and vegetation cover and hydrogeological and climate factors. Results show that slopes with high hazard have the same dip direction of geological structures.

40|$|Few now {{doubt that}} {{successfully}} managing environmental challenges will be central to public {{policy in the}} coming century. Unless the international community can cope with transnational problems such as global warming, destruction of species and <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forests,</b> depletion of oceanic fish stocks, and increasing water scarcity in arid regions, both domestic and international conflicts may easily arise. The problems of international environmental political economy pose increasingly pressing issues for analysts, policy makers, and citizens. Such concerns helped to motivate the project, “The Political Economy of International Environmental Cooperation,” sponsored by the Institute on Global Cooperation and Conflict and generously funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur foundation. The project supported University of California graduate students writing their Ph. D. dissertations on issues of international environmental cooperation. On concluding their dissertation research, the doctoral candidates presented policy papers at a workshop held in Santa Cruz, California. The student-organized workshop brought together these promising young scholars and policy analysts with various senior members of both the academic and international policy community. 	A key intellectual theme {{of the project was}} the (always difficult, always necessary) marriage of theory and policy. However varied the details of international environmental political economy may be, the core problem is always the same: how to induce self-interested, often myopic, decision makers to “do the right thing,” or to behave in ways that minimize environmental damage and/or optimize the utilization of natural resources in the presence of external constraints. Addressing such problems is difficult enough within a polity; forging the transnational cooperation needed to cope with environmental issues confronts still greater obstacles. The papers in this policy paper offer an Aristotelian line-up of earth, fire, air, and water issues. The problems of optimal depletion of forests (Bobenrieth), managing global emissions and related global warming problems (Rich), water negotiations in two different regional settings (Carlisle and Williams), and issues of oceanic fisheries (Potter) all receive close, detailed attention. The volume concludes with an evaluation of their work {{from the perspective of a}} World Bank professional on the policy-making process. The result shows how the interaction of theory and empirical material can generate results helpful to policy makers. We hope that such close work between theoretically grounded, empirically rich policy analysts and professional decision-makers will become increasingly frequent in the years ahead...|$|R
40|$|Local {{skateboard}}ers in Bandung {{still play}} skateboard {{on the streets}} since they consider to not have a designated/adequate space to practice their passion. Although the government addressed this issue by building the 1 st skatepark only in 2014, it ended up being largely neglected/unused for its bad overall design and for being too small for accommodating {{the increasing number of}} skateboarders. The failure of such a skatepark was also due to the wrong/poor quality materials and construction techniques implemented, since no skilled-labor has been exploited. On the other hand, even well-designed/built skateparks sometimes fail to meet skateboarders’ needs. This is {{due to the nature of}} skateboarding, being a creative and evolutive discipline that continuously demands different grounds, obstacles, heights, generally speaking an increasing level of challenges. Currently, skateparks fail to facilitate interactions between skateboarders and other city users, while fostering the already common idea of skateparks as social “ghettos”. Conversely, architects can potentially think the design of a skatepark as an architectural challenge, being an interactive public space with specific topological requisites and social implications. The design target envisions the merging of a skatepark into an architectural multipurpose building. By doing so, the resulting hybrid-building helps skateboarders and cityusers to dialogue, thus becoming an attractive “urban facilitator” of functions in the city on different levels. The skatepark merges at the level of the roof of the hosting building to ensure a certain degree of physical separation while still allowing the two parts to dialogue. The multipurpose building is considered as adaptable since it can host a manifold number of fix functions (mosque, distro shops, bar-lounge, hostel, workshops) as well as pop-up or temporary ones (food stalls, spontaneous meetings, playground for young and elders, skate events) that take place in different periods during the day/week/month. Skateboarders are therefore motivated to make use of both the skatepark as well as the underneath facility. Specifically the workshop rooms will be used to produce custom boards or new skateramps. Furthermore, the hybrid-building is built with “plantation by-products” woods such as coconut tree and rubberwood tree as well as the more typical Indonesian bamboo and sengon. Coherently utilizing these type of woods instead of teak or similar from <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forests</b> results in a more sustainable and cheaper solution that at the same is endowed with an added architectural value and unique “identity” that can only be given by exploiting the right mix of local resources. Moreover, a wooden construction allows the skatepark to be easily flexible/adaptable according to skateboarders’ needs. The skatepark is composed by customizableelements that can be mounted/dismantled with ease in order to achieve a possible ever-changing skateableterrain thus solving the problem of skateparks considered as limiting playground that constrains skateboarders’ expressivity.

40|$|Oxygenic {{photosynthesis}} {{is responsible}} for {{virtually all of the}} biochemical production of organic matter in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the large amount of research on phytoplankton, macroalgae have received less attention despite them being, on a per-area basis, one of the most productive ecosystems on earth. Furthermore, there has been a tendency of studies to measure primary production in single thalli, or monospecific stands. The lack of studies examining in situ production of whole assemblages using photorespirometry, as is common practice in soft-sediment systems, may be related to a lack of suitable apparatus. This research aimed to develop unique techniques and an apparatus for measuring primary production of intact macroalgal assemblages in laboratory and field conditions. Photorespirometry chambers were developed and tested on in situ macroalgal assemblages, giving information on the role of species identity, biodiversity, irradiance and community structure on overall primary production. Furthermore, the successful application of these methods was used to model annual primary production over local and regional scales, as well as the potential effects of human disturbance on production. In this study, photosynthesis-irradiance relationships (P-E curves) of intact intertidal algal assemblages showed no signs of saturation at high irradiance levels, as is typically seen in single species curves. Furthermore, diverse macroalgal assemblages showed a two-stage rise in production, with a significant enhancement of production at high irradiance. Evidence from this study suggests that the three-dimensional structure of natural assemblages, functional diversity and their interaction with a complex light environment {{is responsible for}} the unique P-E curves. The increased efficiency of light use in complex assemblages suggests an important role of species complmentarity in enhancing production with species diversity. This research also shows the potential consequences of disturbance on macroalgal assemblages, with the loss of several species causing a major decline in net production. The methods developed in this thesis have allowed simple modelling of annual rates of primary production and the parameters driving production of macroalgae over long time-scales. Respiration rates have a particularly large influence on production models and indicate that increasing temperature due to climate change could have significant consequences for net carbon fixation of macroalgae. This research gives valuable insight into the production of marine macroalgae and reinforces the notion that they are amongst the most productive systems on earth. These results revealed the importance of examining natural communities, as opposed to randomised assemblages and suggest a vital role of species diversity and community composition. Although there was no functional redundancy of the canopy forming species there did appear to be significant redundancy within the subcanopy assemblage. The identity of subcanopy species had little effect on production, but over longer temporal scales, as species come and go, they may help buffer the communities in terms of primary production. Furthermore, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (primary production), although driven by diversity, is moderated by resource levels. The complex relationship between irradiance, diversity and production shows the importance of resource levels in the enhancement of function with increasing biodiversity. Due to fundamental differences in terrestrial and marine systems, I was able {{to examine the effects of}} discrete levels of irradiance on production, which indicated an important role of complementary light use. This study represents advancements not only in the understanding of primary production in macroalgal assemblages, but also has implications for how diversity may enhance function in other autotrophic systems. The important role of enhanced efficiency of photon capture in multi-canopy layer communities may prove an essential process in ecosystems as diverse as macroalgal beds and <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forests...</b>|$|R
40|$|TerraSAR-X, {{the first}} civil German space-borne {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) satellite, has been successfully launched on 15 th of June, 2007. The main purpose of Synthetic aperture radar systems is to map the Earth-surface in high resolution and {{synthetic aperture radar}}s are often considered as day/night and all-weather imaging systems. Whereas the first argument is true, the second does not hold in every case depending on the operating frequencies as will be shown in more detail. Indeed, recent examples of typical rain-induced signature modification have been recorded with the X-band TerraSAR-X system. It {{is well known that}} the specific attenuation of the signals may be around 1 dB/km assuming a rain-rate of 40 mm/hr and such an occurrence may frequently take place for <b>tropical</b> areas over <b>rain-forest.</b> Attenuation up to 20 dB and beyond may occur through the precipitation volumes in the cases of heavy precipitation, such as the Brazilian rainforest. However, as will be shown, even the northern latitudes are vulnerable to precipitation induced distortions. In Effect, the disadvantage of rain features in SAR imagery {{may turn out to be}} a useful source for assessing precipitation intensity over SAR surveyed areas. For instance, there is a great potential in quantifying precipitation over oceanic surfaces, a problem hitherto only poorly addressed. During the commissioning phase, a total of 12000 SAR-images (scenes) have been investigated for potential “propagation effects” and some scenes have been selected that revealed visible atmospheric effects. In this contribution, we will present recent example of rain cell signatures in SAR-images and we will focus on a particularly interesting example acquired over New York, where the SAR image will be compared with weather-radar data acquired nearly simultaneously (within the same minute). The comparison of the images show a good overall agreement and it can be clearly shown that reflectivities in the weather radar image of 50 dBz may cause visible artefacts in the SAR images. Due to the polarimetric capabilities of TerraSAR-X it was further possible to visualize the polarimetric behaviour of the signal attenuation through extended meteorological targets. The main advantage of assessing weather volumes, using the SAR-method presented here, is the high resolution obtained indirectly from the analysis of propagation effects in SAR-pixels. The methodology permits us to exploit the high ground-resolution of SAR systems (typically 1 m x 1 m) in order to obtain precipitation mapping bearing similar resolutions. The proposed algorithm suggests further studies exploiting data fusions of space-borne SAR measurements with space-borne weather radar measurements in order to improve the intensity mapping of precipitating clouds over Earth-surface...|$|R

40|$|We {{documented}} one of {{the most}} species-rich assemblages of <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forest</b> Auchenorrhyncha, comprising 402 phloem- and xylem-feeding species, by sampling adults from forest vegetation. Further, we reared 106 species from larvae sampled on 14 plant species. Both xylem- and phloem-feeding guilds exhibited wide host-plant ranges, as 74 % of species fed on more than one plant family. In comparison, using data extracted from the temperate-zone literature, phloem-feeders exhibited lower host specificity in Papua New Guinea than in Germany, because in Papua New Guinea they were dominated by generalist Fulgoroidea while in Germany by specialist Membracoidea. The similarity of Auchenorrhyncha assemblages from different plant species was unrelated to the phylogenetic distance between their hosts. Host specificity, abundance and species composition of Auchenorrhyncha assemblages were unrelated to the optimum of their host plant species on succession gradient from secondary to primary forest. Higher host specificity did not lead to greater species richness in Auchenorrhyncha assemblages feeding on different plant species, but the number of species feeding on a particular plant species was a strong predictor of the Auchenorrhyncha abundance on that plant. These patterns suggest that Auchenorrhyncha assemblages on these plant species are not saturated with species and determined by division of limited resources among competitors, but instead are dependent on the number of colonizers from the regional species pool...|$|E

The human cultural history approach and pollen deposit analysis were used for findingthe relationshipbetweenhuman cultureswith thecondition of the forest in the past. The lawuniformity was usedas a basis foranalysis,whichexplainsthatthe presentis the keytothe past. The ancient karst forest was identified frompollen deposition andthe age of deposit was carriedout byradiocarbonanalysis. Thisresearchcontributesto reach forest resources sustainability with respect to recent increasing forest depressiondue toanthropogenic factors. Research indicates that at prehistoric human occupations in the Gunungsewu karst area did not affect the condition of flora. Cultural traits onprehistoric and territorial subsistencecan explain that it is not anthropogenic factors that caused changes in the types of flora. Sincethere was noculture ofexploitation, the extraction of natural resourceswas justperformed tomeet their subsistence. Changes inthe type offlorain the past becomea bio-indicatorof palaeo-climate change on Gunungsewu Karst area. The beginning of forest karst destruction occurs in the periods of Islamicempireandcolonialism, which are known as tenure systems of migration and exploitation of teak by Colonizers. Results of the forest reconstruction along the human prehistory indicated that the lower mountainrain-forestoccurred on Keplek period, then the mixed type of lower mountain rainforest and <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forest</b> occurred on the period of Ngrijangan. In the period of Klepu, the forest type turn into the type of tropical rainforest. Monsoon is the last forest type of residents in the human history since the Hinduism and Buddhism period up to the present...|$|E
40|$|Consumption of {{terrestrial}} leaf litter by stream invertebrates {{is an important}} process, but {{little attention has been}} paid to the influence of leaf diversity on the process. Tropical forests are known to have much greater diversity of plant species than their temperate counterparts, but studies of litter processing in tropical streams have not explicitly addressed this issue. This paper documents the streambed leaf litter composition and diversity of an Australian <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forest</b> stream and the leaf preferences of consumers in the stream. We hypothesized that there would be high diversity of litter in the stream and that the shredders would have broad preferences, given that litterfall of any one species would occur over a restricted period. Leaf litter was characterized by high species diversity (81 species from one stream reach sampled on two occasions). Leaf consumers (‘shredders’) were associated with a relatively broad suite of leaf species (38 species) and did not indicate clear leaf preferences. However, in a laboratory feeding experiment, using the three most common shredder species and some of the most abundant leaf species in the stream, all shredder species exhibited clear preference for a single leaf species (Endiandra bessaphila). Preference for this and other species was affected by the conditioning age of leaves (i. e. the length of time leaves were exposed to leaching and microbial colonization), with conditioned leaves usually being preferred, and previously non-selected leaves becoming more palatable with conditioning. Thus, different successional stages were more important than the identity of leaf species in determining the distribution of shredders among the leaves...|$|E
40|$|In 1950 the Welvaartsfonds (The Prosperity Fund) {{established}} the Lelydorp Project; a pilot scheme to develop sound fulltime family {{farms in the}} Old Coastal Plain. The area was 450, 000 ha of sparsely populated rolling sandy ridges covered with <b>tropical</b> <b>rain-forest.</b> Land development required a general survey of natural conditions and indigenous farming skill, technical research on crops and rotations, and economical studies to define farm types fulfilling economic and social needs. Soils varied. Most were poor, degenerated rapidly after felling vegetation and easily eroded even on slight slopes. Thus farm allocation {{should be based on}} topography and soil conservation. Technical studies were outlined on reclamation, tree crops (citrus, cocoa, coconuts, oil palm), animal husbandry, fodder crops and pasture land, arable crops and crop rotations. On preliminary data, 45 farms of 5. 8 or 11 ha were allocated, concentrating on crops and livestock. Selection, guidance and assistance (machine pool, marketing, credit) of farmers were discussed. As tree crops were not yet bearing, input-output results were only provisional. An analysis of daily, farm by farm, reports of labour use per component (live stock, tree crops, arable land, mixed crops) showed that over the year 1954 on the farms of 11, 8 and 5 ha 1048, 759 and 750 hours, respectively, were spent per ha. For the tree crops these figures were 618, 468 and 364 hours. The larger farms depended more on outside help (51 % of total labour) and could not be considered family farms; the higher labour per ha indicated that they were beyond the farmer's management skill. In future full-time farms between 5 and 8 ha of a simplified type were recommended. Application of the technical results on smaller, part-time farms was advocated. <p/...|$|E
