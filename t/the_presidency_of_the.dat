5|$|Beyond the OULC, Thorpe {{achieved}} <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oxford University Law Society, {{although his}} principal objective was <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oxford Union, an office frequently {{used as a}} stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the presidency. He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster Robin Day. His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist Dick Taverne and the Conservative William Rees-Mogg—to secure the presidency for the Hilary term of 1951.|$|E
