5|$|By the mid-1920s, Victoria worried over <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> her children. Maria, {{her eldest}} {{daughter}} married {{the head of}} one of Germany's mediatized families, Karl, Hereditary Prince of Leiningen on 25 November 1925, Victoria’s 49th birthday. Victoria was at her daughter's bedside when she gave birth to her first child, Emich Kirill, in 1926 (father of claimant to the Russian throne, Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen). She also attended the subsequent births of Maria's children.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{abundance}} of insects and a worldwide concern of food shortages, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations considers that the world may have to, in the future, regard <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> eating insects as a food staple. Insects are noted for their nutrients, having a high content of protein, minerals and fats and are eaten by one-third of the global population.|$|E

5|$|I Corps' {{part in the}} Western Desert Campaign was brief. Its {{headquarters}} opened near Benghazi on 15 February 1941, replacing British XIII Corps. Rowell studied <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> {{an advance}} on Tripoli, but the headquarters was recalled to Egypt on 24 February {{to participate in the}} Battle of Greece. Nonetheless, for his part, Rowell was mentioned in despatches, and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen {{to develop a}} new {{generation}} of combat aircraft that would be capable of supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally {{due to a lack of}} a political support for development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, who had been in regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company. The filing came {{less than two weeks}} after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. His report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 was likely to be.|$|E

5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful quest for the North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen {{saw no reason to}} concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke publicly about <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} lines the pawn push c4–c5 often brings {{positional}} gains to White. In the Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3, after 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 (see diagram at right) White gets the bishop pair and a space advantage. In {{order to build}} up on these potential advantages, the most common plan is to perform a minority attack on the queenside, {{with the goal of}} performing the pawn advance c4–c5 in favourable conditions. This push can yield several advantages to White: it enhances <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> the light-square bishop, it creates a half-open file to attack with the rooks, and it creates an isolated, backward pawn on d6 after the exchange c5xd6.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E
40|$|Participants {{in public}} {{disability}} programs face {{the loss of}} benefits if they work and earn at substantial levels. Policy makers, researchers, and advocates have suggested that <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> benefit loss is, at least in part, {{an explanation for the}} low levels of earnings and work participation among disability program participants; however, research on the actual effects is very limited. The authors estimate <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> benefit loss effects on work participation and earnings of participants in four disability programs using a unique survey. The findings strongly suggest that <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> benefit loss decreases earnings and work participation among disability program participants. Unexpectedly, the authors found little variation in <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> benefit loss effects across programs even though there is substantial cross-program variation in the actual benefit loss that occurs with work participation and increased earnings...|$|R

5|$|Maxwell {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Forest Lodge, New South Wales, on 10 February 1896 to John Maxwell, a labourer, and his wife Elizabeth, née Stokes. A member of the Senior Australian Army Cadets for three years, he worked as an {{apprentice}} boilermaker at an engineering works near Newcastle upon leaving school. For two years, he served {{as a member of the}} Citizens Military Forces, and on 6 February 1915, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force enticed by <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> better pay.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} {{affected the}} quantity and quality of his forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire before Christmas, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were up. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful in part due to British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.|$|E
5|$|Traffic on the opened {{section was}} {{much lower than}} anticipated, and <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> {{building}} {{the rest of the}} canal dwindled, as profits were minimal. However, in 1829 James Green {{turned his attention to the}} link to Taunton. He had been the architect of the Bude Canal, which was built for tub-boats and used inclined planes to change levels, and proposed a similar solution here. The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal had opened in 1827, making navigation from Taunton to Bridgwater easier than on the River Tone. In a report of 1830, Green proposed using vertical lifts instead of inclined planes, and estimated the cost of the canal at £65,000.|$|E

5|$|Blaine {{accepted}} his narrow defeat and {{spent most of}} the next year working on the second volume of Twenty Years of Congress. The book continued to earn him enough money to support his lavish household and pay off his debts. Although he spoke to friends of retiring from politics, Blaine still attended dinners and commented on the Cleveland administration’s policies. By the time of the 1886 Congressional elections, Blaine was giving speeches and promoting Republican candidates, especially {{in his home state of}} Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
5|$|In March 1996, British Aerospace {{promoted}} {{the option of}} establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod MRA4 aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the refurbishment of existing airframes, this was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition rates of the existing aircraft. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on the topic of the Nimrod 2000; British Aerospace were also considering the merits of using a newly developed variant of the General Electric CF34 turbofan powerplant, which General Electric had formally proposed the specific use of to power the type. In June 1996, British Aerospace announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> export sales for the type. British Aerospace argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection would give it entry to the global maritime patrol aircraft market.|$|E
5|$|In summer 969, Sviatoslav {{returned}} to Bulgaria in force, accompanied by allied Pecheneg and Magyar contingents. In his absence, Pereyaslavets had been recovered by Boris II; the Bulgarian defenders {{put up a}} determined fight, but Sviatoslav stormed the city. Thereafter Boris and Roman capitulated, and the Rus' rapidly established control over eastern and northern Bulgaria, placing garrisons in Dorostolon and the Bulgarian capital of Preslav. There Boris continued to reside and exercise nominal authority as Sviatoslav's vassal. In reality he {{was little more than}} a figurehead, retained in order to lessen Bulgarian resentment at and reaction to the Rus' presence. Sviatoslav appears to have been successful in enlisting Bulgarian support. Bulgarian soldiers joined his army in considerable numbers, tempted partly by <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> <b>of</b> booty, but also enticed by Sviatoslav's anti-Byzantine designs and probably mollified by a shared Slavic heritage. The Rus' ruler himself was careful not to alienate his new subjects: he forbade his army from looting the countryside or plundering cities that surrendered peacefully.|$|E
