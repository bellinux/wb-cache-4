5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} <b>tethered</b> <b>flight,</b> {{performed}} by XP831, {{was conducted at}} Dunsfold; {{at this stage of}} development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine meant it could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first <b>tethered</b> <b>flight</b> without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E

50|$|On June 14, 2013 two <b>tethered</b> <b>flights</b> were performed. The {{first firing}} was soft aborted when the vehicle exceed its safety zone {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} in the fuel load. The 2nd firing was successful. This counts as a restarting of the engine. During the second flight, the vehicle successfully switched from using its primary Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to the secondary IMU.|$|R
25|$|In 1857 Lowe {{built and}} piloted his first balloon in <b>tethered</b> <b>flight</b> {{at a small}} farm in Hoboken, New Jersey. Thadâ€™s father joined in the balloon making {{business}} and had become an accomplished aeronaut himself. In 1858 the Lowes built the larger balloon Enterprise and several others.|$|E
25|$|LaMountain's {{contributions}} and successes were minimal. However, he did {{attract the attention}} of General Benjamin Butler at Fort Monroe. LaMountain operated at Fort Monroe for a while with the battered Atlantic and was actually accredited with having made the first effective wartime observations from an aerial position. He also obtained use of a balloon, the Saratoga, which he soon lost in a windstorm. LaMountain advocated free flight balloon reconnaissance, whereas Lowe used captive or <b>tethered</b> <b>flight,</b> remaining always attached to a ground crew who could reel him in.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{designated}} YHO-2 by the U.S. Army, {{then later}} re-designated HZ-1 and named [...] "Aerocycle", the prototype {{made its first}} <b>tethered</b> <b>flight</b> on 22 November 1954, with its first free flight taking place in January 1955 at the Brooklyn Army Terminal. Over 160 flights totaling more than 15 hours of flight time were conducted, {{and the results of}} this early test flight program were considered promising enough that a dozen examples of the type were ordered (serial numbers 56-6928 to 56-6939). Predictions were made that the craft could provide transport to a modern version of the old horse cavalry, providing airborne [...] "eyes and ears" [...] for the Army.|$|E

25|$|The {{company has}} {{received}} $60 {{million from the}} U.S. Department of Defense to develop the concept, resulting in a prototype named Dragon Dream which underwent systems tests and some <b>tethered</b> <b>flights</b> in late 2013.

2500|$|The XBQM-108A {{undertook}} its first, <b>tethered</b> <b>flight</b> on September 29, 1976. The flight, using fuel supplied {{through the}} tether from [...] drums, was successful and {{demonstrated that the}} VATOL flight profile for unmanned vehicles was practical. However, the project was cancelled before further testing could be conducted; the XBQM-108A conducted no free flights, or transitions to horizontal flight.|$|E
2500|$|Sikorsky also {{continued}} his earlier work on vertical flight. On February 14, 1929, he filed an application to patent a [...] "direct lift" [...] amphibian aircraft which used compressed air to power a direct lift [...] "propeller" [...] and two smaller propellers for thrust. On June 27, 1931, Sikorsky filed {{for a patent}} for another [...] "direct lift aircraft", and was awarded patent #1,994,488 on March 19, 1935. His design eventually culminated in the first (<b>tethered)</b> <b>flight</b> of the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300 on September 14, 1939, with the first free flight occurring on May 26, 1940.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Sikorsky also {{continued}} his earlier work on vertical flight {{while living in}} Nichols, Connecticut. On February 14, 1929, he filed an application to patent a [...] "direct lift" [...] amphibian aircraft which used compressed air to power a direct lift [...] "propeller" [...] and two smaller propellers for thrust. On June 27, 1931, Sikorsky filed for a patent for another [...] "direct lift aircraft", and was awarded patent No. 1,994,488 on March 19, 1935. His design plans eventually culminated in the first (<b>tethered)</b> <b>flight</b> of the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300 on September 14, 1939, with the first free flight occurring eight months later on May 24, 1940. Sikorsky's success with the VS-300 led to the R-4, which became the world's first mass-produced helicopter, in 1942. Sikorsky's final VS-300 rotor configuration, comprising a single main rotor and a single antitorque tail rotor, {{has proven to be}} one of the most popular helicopter configurations, being used in most helicopters produced today.|$|E
50|$|Flight {{control in}} the fly is {{believed}} to be mediated by inputs from the visual system and also the halteres, a pair of knob-like organs which measure angular velocity. Integrated computer models of Drosophila, short on neuronal circuitry but based on the general guidelines given by control theory and data from the <b>tethered</b> <b>flights</b> of flies, have been constructed to investigate the details of flight control.|$|R
50|$|The 1901 Wright Glider was {{the second}} of the brothers' {{experimental}} gliders. They tested it over the Kill Devil Hills, four miles south of Kitty Hawk. The glider was similar to the 1900 version, but had larger wings. It first flew on July 27, 1901, and was retired on August 17. During this time it made between 50 and 100 free flights, in addition to <b>tethered</b> <b>flights</b> as a kite.|$|R

50|$|The jet exhaust is {{transparent}} and usually not visible in air. But {{in cold weather}} the water vapor, which is {{a large part of}} the steam-gas mixture, condenses soon after it leaves the nozzle, enveloping the pilot in a cloud of fog (for this reason, the very first <b>tethered</b> <b>flights</b> of the Bell Rocket Belt were carried out in a hangar). The jet exhaust is also visible if the fuel is not decomposed completely in the gas generator, which can occur if the catalyst or the hydrogen peroxide is contaminated.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tethered</b> <b>flights</b> at White Waltham were {{followed}} by the first free flight in January 1954, but a full transition from helicopter to autogyro flight was not achieved until March 1955, piloted by John N. Dennis. System proving continued and by September 1956, 190 transitions and 140 autorotative landings had been completed. Development of inflight rotor drive restart procedure resulted in several power-off autorotational landings until the method was perfected. The Jet Gyrodyne was underpowered and could carry sufficient fuel for only 15 minutes of flight; on occasion external fuel tanks were carried to increase endurance.|$|R
