500|$|That {{night he}} {{received}} word to expect an attack {{the following day}} by British capital ships escorted by {{a large number of}} destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship [...] and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans by surprise. Koellner {{had not been able to}} reach Tårstad and Lieutenant Commander (Fregattenkapitän) Alfred Schulze-Hinrichs, the ship's captain, had decided to anchor near Djupvik on the south side of the fjord instead. As the British ships approached, Koellner was spotted by the Supermarine Walrus amphibian from Warspite and the leading British destroyers were fully prepared when they came around the headland behind which Koellner was hiding. The range was so close, , that the three British ships were able to use their light automatic weapons to silence the German ship's guns and they set her on fire as well as blowing off her bow with a torpedo. The [...] semi-armor-piercing shells from Warspite went through the ship without detonating, but visibly <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> over each time. Thirty-one crewmen were killed, and 34 wounded, but none of the British ships were even damaged. Erich Koellner was scuttled shortly afterwards by detonating a depth charge in her auxiliary machinery spaces. In the aftermath of the battle, 155 of the ship's crew, including Schulze-Hinrichs, were taken prisoner by Norwegian forces. The captured crewmen were first incarcerated in Vardøhus Fortress in Finnmark and later transferred to Skorpa prisoner of war camp in Troms until released after the end of the Norwegian Campaign. The wreck was raised and scrapped in 1963.|$|E
60|$|She went on {{painting}} in silence. From where I stood I {{could see her}} profile. Her chin was <b>tilted.</b> <b>Her</b> expression was determined.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} she stood before him with quickened breathing, the colour ebbing and flowing in her cheeks. Then she looked past him, and <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> chin forward.|$|E
60|$|LADY MARY (<b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> nose). I don't {{say that}} it's {{for want of}} asking.|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (<b>Tilting</b> <b>her</b> {{straw hat}} over her eyes.) You grown-up! Pooh! You're a baby.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is to be}} {{master of}} Gordon's Pride, my dear," [...] says her father, smiling and <b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> chin; [...] "we shall have no such persons as factors here." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl sat up very {{straight}} and <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> chin in the air. [...] "I would not wed with a walking diamond-mine," [...] she said. [...] "I {{will not have}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now this {{question}} vexed them, for were he {{to return to}} his mother they should lose his music, so the Queen <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> nose contemptuously and said, 'Pooh! ask for a much bigger wish than that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Joe," [...] {{was all she}} whispered. But the {{happiness}} and welcome in that whisper could never have been better expressed in longer speech. Then slightly, ever so slightly, she <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> sweet face up to his.|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. Then your lady is pleased. (A pause.) D'you {{know that}} we're two solemn, serious, grown-up people--CAPT. G. (<b>Tilting</b> <b>her</b> straw hat over her eyes.) You grown-up! Pooh! You're a baby.|$|R
6000|$|She laughed, <b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> chin; and {{her voice}} began at once to sing, as if at the {{scarcely}} opened door of her throat, and a tune so plain it seemed but the words speaking:-- ...|$|R
50|$|Some mothers {{may choose}} the all-fours {{position}} instinctively. It {{can help the}} baby turn around {{in the case of}} a malpresentation of the head. Since this position uses gravity, it decreases back pain, as the mother is able to <b>tilt</b> <b>her</b> hips.|$|R
60|$|The girl but <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> chin a {{bit higher}} in the air--even her back proclaimed her utter {{contempt}} for her captors. Finally Menelek restored quiet by the simple expedient of a frown, whereupon each loyal guest exchanged his mirthful mien for an emulative scowl.|$|E
6000|$|She {{stood before}} her work eying it intently for several minutes; then, with an {{expression}} of great contempt for the whole thing, she suddenly <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> cherished Venus on to the floor, gave the classical face a finishing crunch, and put on her hat in a decisive manner, saying briefly to the dismayed damsels,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Then she {{marched to}} the one {{washstand}} in the room, <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> head {{this way and that}} before the wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it, dampened her fingers with her tongue, perfected the circle of a little lock of hair that was pasted against her forehead, then began to busy herself with the slops.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wall-eye let her surge too soon," [...] said Jefferson. [...] "He {{was getting}} an extra turn on, and nipped his hand in. She has 'most wrung it off him. Handspike your anchor {{where you can}} <b>tilt</b> <b>her</b> clear before we slack cable." ...|$|R
50|$|In Mermaid (1911, watercolour, 25 x 36 cm), {{the subject}} {{sits on a}} rock by the seashore. The water is turquoise, and the sky filled with purplish clouds. The mermaid <b>tilts</b> <b>her</b> head and looks toward the viewer, as she {{arranges}} her long blonde tresses.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Skinner's hands worked, and {{she dropped}} the onions. [...] "Reely, Sir," [...] she protested, [...] "I don't hardly know, Sir, what you mean. My daughter, Sir, Mrs. Caddles, 'as a baby, Sir." [...] And she made an {{agitated}} curtsey and tried to look innocently inquiring by <b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> nose to one side.|$|R
60|$|Annette rose. Her {{face was}} pink, her chin <b>tilted.</b> <b>Her</b> eyes sparkled {{with the light}} of battle. She left the room and started to mount the stairs. No spectator, however just, could have helped feeling a pang of pity for the wretched man who stood {{unconscious}} of imminent doom, possibly even triumphant, behind the door at which {{she was on the}} point of tapping.|$|E
6000|$|The {{old woman}} now laid her folded arms on her knees, and smoked obliviously. The little girl lingered a moment, {{and then ran}} off {{laughing}} to her mother, and pulled her skirt. [...] "Wasn't it funny, mamma? She thought Mr. Halleck was my papa!" [...] She hung forward by the hold she had taken, as children do, and <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> head back to look into her mother's face. [...] "What is Mr. Halleck, mamma?" ...|$|E
60|$|Billie {{had been}} {{standing}} near the wall, inspecting {{a portrait of the}} late Mr. Josiah Appleby, of which the kindest thing one can say is that one hopes it did not do him justice. She now shrank back against this wall, as if she were trying to get through it. The edge of the portrait's frame <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> hat out of the straight, but in this supreme moment she did not even notice it.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Kenton {{had gone}} to Ellen's room again when she had got the judge off upon his mission. She rather flung in upon her. [...] "Oh, you are up!" [...] she apologized to Ellen's back. The girl's face was towards the glass, and she was <b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> head to get {{the effect of the}} hat on it, which she now took off.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Anna Vivian of Anna Vivian and Company touring Pantages Circuit, ca. 1910 - 1919. The woman stands against a painted backdrop with a flowered purse in her hands. Her dress is lightly-colored with a protruding back side which reaches {{down to her}} shins leaving her lightly-colored heals and stockings visible. She faces the left while <b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> ringlet-topped head towards the foreground...|$|R
6000|$|She painted away, {{screwing}} {{her eyes}} almost shut and getting {{very close to}} her picture. He had never thought her so plain; she was letting her mouth hang open. He wondered why she was so charming; but when she stepped back rhythmically, <b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> pretty head this way and that, he saw why: it was her unfailing grace. She suddenly remembered her mouth and shut it to say, [...] "Well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a moment," [...] cried Juliet Bingham, and she gulped {{the last}} draught of her {{lemonade}} upon a final morsel of sponge-cake, and was {{down at the}} piano while still dusting the crumbs from her fingers. She struck the refractory sheet of music flat upon the rack with her palm, and then <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> head over her shoulder towards Langbourne, who had risen with some vague notion of turning the sheets of the song. [...] "Do you sing?" ...|$|E
60|$|A high velvet hat, audaciously {{turned up}} in front, {{with a bunch of}} pink roses and a {{sweeping}} plume, was cocked over one ear, and, with her curls braided into a club {{at the back of her}} neck, Rose's head looked more like that of a dashing young cavalier than a modest little girl's. High-heeled boots <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> well forward, a tiny muff pinioned her arms, and a spotted veil, tied so closely over her face that her eyelashes were rumpled by it, gave the last touch of absurdity to her appearance.|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Barker, though inexperienced in love, {{was a good}} fighter. The best of the sex are. She {{dropped into}} the rocking-chair, and began rocking {{backwards}} and forwards while still tugging at her gloves, and said, in a gradually warming voice, [...] "I certainly shall not magnify Mr. Van Loo's silliness to that importance. And I have yet to learn {{what you mean by}} talking about a rendezvous! And I want to know," [...] she continued, suddenly stopping her rocking and tilting the rockers impertinently behind her, as, with her elbows squared on the chair arms, she <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> own face defiantly up into Mrs. Horncastle's, [...] "how a woman in your position--who doesn't live with her husband--dares to talk to ME!" ...|$|E
50|$|Tilting and nipping—while {{swimming}} slowly, {{the female}} <b>tilts</b> <b>her</b> body downwards towards the substrate; from the tilted position, the female takes up {{a mouthful of}} substrate and drops her body {{to the bottom of}} the habitat. The female then expels the substrate and may nip two or three more times from the horizontal position. This action has been interpreted as food-seeking, and has been observed in other species as a signal for the moment of spawning.|$|R
60|$|There are {{few things}} sweeter {{in this world}} than the guileless, hot-headed, intemperate, open admiration of a junior. Even {{a woman in her}} blindest devotion does not fall into the gait of the man she adores, <b>tilt</b> <b>her</b> bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat, or interlard her speech with his pet oaths. And Charlie did all these things. Still it was {{necessary}} to salve my conscience before I possessed myself of Charlie's thoughts.|$|R
5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and <b>tilting</b> <b>her</b> hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. The male then uses his thumbs to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be very quiet during the copulation process. Once the process is over the male dismounts the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl would}} have been {{striking}} in any company. Neale thought her neither beautiful nor pretty, but he kept on looking. Her arms were bare, her dress cut very low. Her face offered vivid contrast to the carmine on her lips. It was a round, soft face, with narrow eyes, dark, seductive, bold. She <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> {{head to one side}} and suddenly smiled at Neale. It startled him. It was a smile with the shock of a bullet. It held Neale, so that when she crossed to him he could not move. He felt rather than saw Hough return to his side. The girl took hold of the lapels of Neale's coat. She looked up. Her eyes were dark, with what seemed red shadows deep in them. She had white teeth. The carmined lips curled in a smile--a smile, impossible to believe, of youth and sweetness, that disclosed a dimple in her cheek. She was pretty. She was holding him, pulling him a little toward her.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that the}} queen was {{at ease in}} her mind once more, and measurably happy, her wine {{naturally}} began to assert itself again, and it got a little the start of her. I mean it set her music going--her silver bell of a tongue. Dear me, she was a master talker. It would not become me {{to suggest that it}} was pretty late and that I was a tired man and very sleepy. I wished I had gone off to bed when I had the chance. Now I must stick it out; there was no other way. So she tinkled along and along, in the otherwise profound and ghostly hush of the sleeping castle, until by and by there came, as if from deep down under us, a far-away sound, as of a muffled shriek --with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl. The queen stopped, and her eyes lighted with pleasure; she <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> graceful head as a bird does when it listens. The sound bored its way up through the stillness again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Him lack for friends!" [...] and she <b>tilted</b> <b>her</b> head {{up with a}} frank pride-- [...] "why, Washington, you can't name a man that's {{anybody that}} isn't fond of him. I'll tell you privately, that I've had Satan's own time {{to keep them from}} {{appointing}} him to some office or other. They knew he'd no business with an office, just as well as I did, but he's the hardest man to refuse anything to, a body ever saw. Mulberry Sellers with an office! laws goodness, you know what that would be like. Why, they'd come from {{the ends of the earth}} to see a circus like that. I'd just as lieves be married to Niagara Falls, and done with it." [...] After a reflective pause she added--having wandered back, in the interval, to the remark that had been her text: [...] "Friends?--oh, indeed, no man ever had more; and such friends: Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Johnston, Longstreet, Lee--many's the time they've sat in that chair you're sitting in--" [...] Hawkins was out of it instantly, and contemplating it with a reverential surprise, and with the awed sense of having trodden shod upon holy ground-- ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "An Evening Song" by Max Ring, depicting a woman reading sheet music in a meadow, [s. d. ]. The woman is shown in full figure at center, dressed in {{what appears to be}} a bridal gown. She <b>tilts</b> <b>her</b> head back and rolls her eyes to the sky, while holding a sheaf of sheet music in her hands, as well as a violin, which she carries by the neck. In the background, a clearing is visible, moving back towards thicker forest...|$|R

50|$|In {{the morning}} they're found. The police believe Alma {{committed}} suicide {{because she felt}} guilty for killing Monique and that Gloria found her and had a stroke. The doctors tell Orson that his mother, though completely paralyzed physically, still has the same mental capacity. Orson feels relief {{that the fact that}} he was an accomplice in Monique’s burial will remain secret and with his mother. He <b>tilts</b> <b>her</b> head so that she can see him walk out of her life for the last time. On leaving the hospital he imagines his future life with Bree.|$|R
