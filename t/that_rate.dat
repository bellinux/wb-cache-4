5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} {{reserves}} of salt in the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At <b>that</b> <b>rate</b> of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.|$|E
5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} {{its body}} mass {{at a rate}} of about 1% a day, much slower than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times <b>that</b> <b>rate.</b> This is thought to be because the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E

These two hypotheses generate a number of testable predictions regarding the anticipation of credit-rating downgrades by the bond market, which we investigate using a new data set of about 2, 000 credit rating migrations from Moody's and Standard & Poor's, and matching issuer-level bond prices. The findings strongly indicate <b>that</b> <b>rating</b> changes {{do not appear to}} be importantly influenced by rating agency conflicts of interest but, rather, suggest <b>that</b> <b>rating</b> agencies are motivated primarily by reputation-related incentives.

25|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{dimension is}} the airfoil chord. In these tests the jet width {{was sufficient to}} keep the vortex shedding coherent across it. On an airfoil {{there would be a}} correlation length less than the wingspan resulting in a number independent dipoles arrayed laterally. The sound power would be diminished somewhat. Since the dipole model is based on the time rate of change of the force, reduction of sound power might be accomplished by reducing <b>that</b> <b>rate.</b> One possible means would be for the opposite sides of the surface to gradually sense each other spatially prior to the trailing edge and thus reduce the rate at the edge. This might be done by a section of graduated porous or flexible materials.|$|E

These new SD160s started to enter service in November 2006. In December 2006, CT extended the order by seven cars to a total of 40 cars, which had all been delivered by the spring of 2008.
