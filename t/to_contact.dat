5|$|Altman {{was then}} {{instructed}} <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> Newark Liberty International Airport, a directive he agreed to. However, {{he did not}} contact the tower at Newark. It later transpired that, in acknowledging the instruction <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> Newark, Altman had read back the wrong frequency (127.8MHz instead of 127.85), an error that the controller did not correct. Soon after, a controller at Newark who was concerned about aircraft in the Piper's path contacted the Teterboro controller and asked the him to attempt to re-establish contact. All attempts <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> Altman and change his aircraft's heading were unsuccessful. After the failure <b>to</b> <b>contact</b> Altman, a radar alert about a possible collision occurred in both the Newark and Teterboro towers. However, the two controllers did not remember seeing or hearing this alert.|$|E
