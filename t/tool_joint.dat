5000|$|Tubes and {{tool joints}} are welded using rotary inertia or direct drive {{friction}} welding. The tube is held stationary while the <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> is revolved at high RPMs. The <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> is the firmly pressed onto the upset {{end of the}} tube while the <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> is rotating. The heat and force during this interaction weld the two together. Once the [...] "ram horns" [...] or excess material is removed, the weld line can only be seen under a microscope. Inertia friction welding is the traditional proven method. Direct drive friction welding is controlled and monitored up to 1000 times a second, resulting in a fine quality weld that does not necessary need a full heat treat quench and temper regime.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{drill pipe}} {{is made from}} the welding {{of at least three}} {{separate}} pieces: box <b>tool</b> <b>joint,</b> pin <b>tool</b> <b>joint,</b> and the tube. The green tubes are received by the drill pipe manufacturer from the steel mill. The ends of the tubes are then upset to increase the cross sectional area of the ends. The tube end may be externally upset (EU), internally upset (IU), or internally and externally upset (IEU). Standard max upset dimensions are specified in API 5DP, but the exact dimensions of the upset are proprietary to the manufacturer. After upsetting, the tube then goes through a heat treating process. Drill pipe steel is commonly quenched and tempered to achieve high yield strengths (135 ksi is a common tube yield strength).|$|E
50|$|Elevators, as {{developed}} for the drilling industry, are a hinged device with handles {{that are used to}} wrap around the <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> of drill pipe, casing or lift nipples (for collars) to facilitate the lifting or lowering of them singly or of the drill string as a whole.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> (connectors) {{are also}} {{received}} by the manufacturer as green tubes. After a quench and temper heat treat, the <b>tool</b> <b>joints</b> are cut into box (female) and pin (male) threads. <b>Tool</b> <b>joints</b> are commonly 120 ksi SMYS, rather than the 135 ksi of the tube. They generally are stiffer than the tube, increasing {{the likelihood of a}} fatigue failure at the junction. The lower SMYS on the connection increases the fatigue resistance. Higher strength steels are typically harder and more brittle, making them more susceptible to cracking and subsequent stress crack propagation.|$|R

50|$|To latch {{around a}} piece of {{pipework}} a set of elevators need a precise internal diameter, with an appropriately profiled shoulder to accommodate the lower profile of a <b>tool</b> <b>joint.</b> The latch mechanism has to prevent opening under radial loads of up to hundreds of tons. For some purposes (casing elevators, and loading pipe {{into and out of}} the derrick), the elevators also need to resist cross-axial loads of the weight of the pipe joints.|$|E
50|$|Drill pipe {{makes up}} the {{majority}} of the drill string back up to the surface. Each drill pipe comprises a long tubular section with a specified outside diameter (e.g. 3 1/2 inch, 4 inch, 5 inch, 5 1/2 inch, 5 7/8 inch, 6 5/8 inch). At each end of the drill pipe tubular, larger-diameter portions called the tool joints are located. One end of the drill pipe has a male ("pin") connection whilst the other has a female ("box") connection. The <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> connections are threaded which allows for the make of each drill pipe segment to the next segment.|$|E
50|$|On 20 March 2011, DNV {{presented}} their {{report to the}} US Department of Energy. Their primary conclusion was that while the rams succeeded in partly shearing through the drill pipe they failed to seal the bore because the drill pipe had buckled out of the intended line of action of the rams (because the drill string was caught at a <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> in the upper annular BOP valve), jamming the shears and leaving the drill string shear actuator unable to deliver enough force to complete its stroke and fold the cut pipe over and seal the well. They did not suggest any failure of actuation as would be caused by faulty batteries. The upper section of the blow out preventer failed to separate as designed due to numerous oil leaks compromising hydraulic actuator operation, and {{this had to be}} cut free during recovery.|$|E

5000|$|The huge main {{plant for}} Hughes Tool located in Houston, Texas, {{fronting}} Harrisburg Blvd., {{had grown to}} be one of the biggest oil tool manufacturers in the World. It had the latest, largest, and most automated equipment for foundries, forging, heat treating, and machining anywhere. At its peak during the Texas Oil Boom, it was a center for manufacturing, design, research, metallurgy, and engineering for oil field technologies. This included the drill bit (well) and <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> product lines critical for oil and gas drilling, some of the first technologies for ram blast bits for drilling in mines, geothermal drilling, and a hydraulic powered jackhammer known as the Hughes Impactor. It also manufactured a line of truck and crane-mounted earth augering machines ("diggers") that were most commonly used to produce holes up to a depth of about 120 ft for building and bridge foundations. It even had a fully functioning drilling simulator inside its main research lab where production or prototype drill bits could be tested on any kind of rock at temperatures and pressures normally encountered in actual drilling operations. In 1972, Howard Hughes sold the Hughes Tool Company; it had been the consistently profitable part of his empire, and produced the profits that built all the rest from the very beginning. This became the [...] "new" [...] Hughes Tool Company while the remaining divisions of the business were placed in a new holding company, the Summa Corporation.|$|E

Failure reason of tool-joint pin was researched through visual inspection, mechanical properties testing and working condition analysis.

Accumulated debris blocked mud’s circulation channel and leaded to poor circulation. The dramatic friction between the <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> and accumulated debris leaded tool joint’s local temperature to risen significantly, and reduced its carrying capacity.

40|$|Abstract. A 4 inch {{drill pipe}} {{assembly}} {{has been developed}} {{that can be used}} for drilling 6 inch diameter holes. Normally, 6 inch diameter holes are drilled with 3 - 1 / 2 inch pipe with 4 - 3 / 4 inch OD tool joints because the tool joints for 4 inch pipe are too large. In most cases, the pipe size is based on the strength balance between the pipe and <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> and 5 inch or 5 - 1 / 4 inch OD tool joints are usually welded to 4 inch pipe. A 5 inch OD <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> is too large for an overshot in a 6 inch diameter hole. A 4 inch drill pipe assembly with a 4 - 3 / 4 inch OD <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> has been developed that can be used in 6 inch diameter holes. Four inch pipe has a number of advantages over 3 - 1 / 2 inch pipe such as more torsional and tensile strength and improved hydraulics. Less pump flow is required for the same annular velocity and there is a lower pressure loss in the pipe. This paper will discuss:! The pipe development program. !

Initially, the fatigue properties were determined through small-scale tests performed in an optic-mechanical fatigue apparatus.

40|$|Drill-pipe {{tool joints}} in {{extended}} reach wells often suffer a shear failure. In view of this, an ultra-high torque double-shoulder pipe joint was designed {{according to the}} deformation compatibility relation of the drill-pipe <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> under torque. It is structurally characterized by long primary and secondary shoulders, small thread taper and large fillet radius of bottom tooth. First, a 3 D numerical simulation model was established {{for this type of}} joint, named the XSJ joint here, based on the principle of virtual work, the Von Mises yield criterion and the nonlinear contact theory. Second, orthogonal optimization was performed on its key structural parameters by means of the orthogonal optimization method. The optimal combination of key structural parameters of the XSJ joint is taper 1 : 16, thread pitch 6. 55  mm, guiding surface angle 29 °, bearing surface angle 28 °, and tooth height 3. 755  mm. Finally, the bearing performance and fatigue performance of this <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> and the API <b>tool</b> <b>joint</b> were calculated and compared using the Simulia Abaqus fe-safe software. Compared with the API <b>tool</b> <b>joint,</b> the XSJ joint is better, and its tensile strength, torsion strength, bending strength and compression strength increase by 10. 65 %, 62. 5 %, 2. 75 % and 52 %, respectively. Its tension compression fatigue life, bending fatigue life, torsion fatigue life and composite fatigue life increase by 1. 19 times, 1. 74 times, 550 times and 28. 79 %, respectively. It is concluded that the designed XSJ joint is significantly improved in term of torsion capacity while its tension strength, bending strength and compression strength are not decreased, so it can better meet the drilling conditions of extended reach wells.

30|$|A stuck {{drill string}} {{results in a}} major {{non-productive}} cost in extended reach drilling engineering. The {{first step is to}} determine the depth at which the sticking has occurred. Methods of measurement have been proved useful for determining the stuck points, but these operations take considerable time. As a result of the limitation with the current operational practices, calculation methods are still preferred to estimate the stuck point depth. Current analytical methods do not consider friction and are only valid for vertical rather than extended reach wells. The numerical method is established to take full account of down hole friction, <b>tool</b> <b>joint,</b> upset end of drill pipe, combination drill strings and tubular materials so that it is valid to determine the stuck point in extended reach wells. The pull test, torsion test and combined test of rotation and pulling can be used to determine the stuck point.
