60|$|While we {{were still}} in the way with these pious folk we touched our midday halt, a wayside teahouse notched {{in a corner of the}} road {{commanding}} a panoramic view over the sea. The place was kept by a deaf old lady and her <b>tailless</b> <b>cat.</b> The old lady's peculiarity was personal; the cat's was not. No self-respecting cat in this part of Japan could possibly wear a tail. The northern branch of the family has long since discarded that really useless feline appendage. A dog in like circumstance would be sadly straitened in the expression of his emotions, but a cat is every whit a cat without a continuation.|$|E
50|$|Knutsson {{has said}} that the <b>tailless</b> <b>cat</b> Pelle was based on a real cat he had himself known for a summer in his childhood, but also that the cat was his own alter ego. Maja Gräddnos is {{supposedly}} based on his own wife Erna. Måns is generically evil with elements fetched from Hitler and Mussolini. The other cats were all caricatures of people among Knutsson's own circle of friends and acquaintances in Uppsala.|$|E
50|$|Individuals not {{conforming}} to a strictly defined physical norm are either killed or sterilised and banished to the Fringes, a lawless and untamed area still rife with {{animal and plant}} mutations. Arguments occur over the keeping of a <b>tailless</b> <b>cat</b> or the possession of oversized horses. These are deemed {{by the government to}} be legitimate breeds, either preexisting or achieved through conventional breeding. The government's position is considered both cynical and heretical by many of the orthodox frontier community.|$|E

50|$|The Manx taillessness gene is {{dominant}} and highly penetrant; kittens from two Manx parents are generally born without any tail. Being homozygous for (having two copies of) the gene is usually lethal in utero, resulting in miscarriage. Thus, <b>tailless</b> <b>cats</b> can carry only one {{copy of the}} gene. Because {{of the danger of}} having two copies of the taillessness gene, breeders avoid breeding two entirely <b>tailless</b> Manx <b>cats</b> together. Because neither parent carries the tailless allele, a fully tailed Manx bred to another fully tailed Manx results in all fully tailed kittens.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>tailless</b> <b>cats</b> {{such as the}} Manx cats {{may develop}} megacolon, which is a {{recurring}} condition causing constipation that can be life-threatening to the cat if not properly monitored. It is a condition in which, due to absence of a tail, the smooth muscle that normally contracts to push stools toward the rectum loses its ability to do so.|$|R
50|$|The {{name of the}} {{promontory}} Spanish Head on {{the coast}} of the island is often thought to have arisen from the local tale of a ship of the Spanish Armada foundering in the area, though {{there is no evidence to}} suggest this actually occurred. Folklore has further claimed that a <b>tailless</b> <b>cat</b> swam ashore from said shipwreck, and thus brought the trait to the island. However, tailless cats are not commonly known in Spain, even if such a shipwreck were proven.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Manx" [...] {{name for}} the shortened, taller-wheeled, more maneuverable VW Beetle mods refers to and derives from the comparably stubby Manx cat breed, colloquially called [...] "stubbins"; they are short-spined and stub-tailed-to-tailless, long-legged, and known for their turning ability while chasing. The Meyers Manx logo {{prominently}} features a Manx cat. The <b>tailless</b> <b>cat</b> in the logo, as featured on the hood ornament, is stylized after a passant heraldic lion, its right forepaw brandishing a sword. The name also suggests racing fitness, as the already globally renowned, British-manufactured Norton Manx motorcycle dominated the Isle of Man TT, Manx Grand Prix and other Isle of Man-based (i.e. Manx) international races from the 1940s to the early 1970s. (The Meyers Manx itself, despite its name, has no direct connection to the Isle of Man.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Manx cats {{have been}} {{exhibited}} in cat shows, as a named, distinct breed (and {{with the modern}} spelling [...] "Manx"), since the late 1800s. In that era, few shows provided a Manx division, and exhibited specimens were usually entered under the [...] "Any Other Variety" [...] class, where they often could not compete well unless [...] "exceptionally good in size and markings". Early pet breeding and showing expert Charles Henry Lane, himself {{the owner of a}} prize-winning rare white rumpy Manx named [...] "Lord Luke", published the first known (albeit informal) breed standard for the Manx in his 1903 Rabbits, Cats and Cavies, but noted that already by the time of his writing [...] "if the judge understood the variety" [...] a Manx would be clearly distinguishable from some other <b>tailless</b> <b>cat</b> being exhibited, [...] "as the make of the animal, its movements and its general character are all distinctive." [...] Not all cat experts of the day were favourable toward the breed; in The Cat: Its Points and Management in Health and Disease, Frank Townend Barton wrote in 1908: [...] "There is nothing [...] to recommend the breed, [...] the loss of the tail in no way enhances its beauty." ...|$|E
6000|$|Deeply {{impressed}} with the belief (laugh at it if you will) that I was {{in the presence of}} a being of more than mortal endowments, I was withdrawing, when my glance fell on his weird familiars,--two <b>tailless</b> <b>cats.</b> This prodigy made me shudder, and I said, in tones of the deepest awe and sympathy, 'Poor puss!' ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tailless</b> <b>cats,</b> {{then called}} [...] (apparently both {{singular}} and plural) in colloquial Manx language, were {{known by the}} early 19th century as cats from the Isle of Man (Mann), hence the name, where they remain a substantial but declining percentage of the local cat population. The taillessness arose as a natural mutation on the island, though folklore persists that <b>tailless</b> domestic <b>cats</b> were brought there by sea. They are descended from mainland stock of obscure origin. Like all house cats, including nearby British and Irish populations, they are ultimately descended from the African wildcat (F. silvestris lybica) and not from native European wildcats (F. s. silvestris), of which the island has long been devoid.|$|R
50|$|Populations of <b>tailless</b> <b>cats</b> {{also exist}} in a few other places in Europe, most notably Cornwall, only 250 mi from the Isle of Man. A {{population}} on the small, isolated Danish peninsula (former island) of Reersø in the Great Belt {{may be due to}} the arrival on the island of cats of Manx origin, by ship. Similar cats are also found in Crimea, a near-island peninsula in the Black Sea, though whether they are genetically related to maritime Manx cats or are a coincidentally similar result of insular genetic diversity limitations, like the unrelated Kuril Islands Bobtail, Karelian Bobtail, Japanese Bobtail, and Indonesian Lombok cats, is unknown. The Manx gene may be related to the similarly dominant tail suppression gene of the recent American Bobtail breed, but Manx, Japanese Bobtails and other short-tailed cats are not used in its breeding program, and the mutation seems to have appeared in the breed spontaneously. Possible relation to the Pixie-bob breed, which also ranges from rumpy to fully tailed, is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|Although tail {{suppression}} (or {{tail length}} variety) {{is not the}} sole characteristic feature of the breed, the chief defining one of the Manx cat is its absence of a tail to having a tail of long length, or tail of any length between the two extremes. This is a naturally occurring, cat body-type mutation of the spine, caused by a dominant gene. As with the sometimes-tail-suppressed Schipperke dog and Old English Sheepdog, tail suppression does not [...] "breed true" [...] in Manx cats. Attempting to force the tailless trait to breed true by continually breeding <b>tailless</b> Manx <b>cats</b> to <b>tailless</b> Manx <b>cats</b> has led to increased negative, even fatal genetic disorders (see below). Tail length is random throughout a litter of kittens. Manx to non-Manx breeding will usually produce some Manx-type tail varieties in kittens. Whether the shorter tailed kittens of these varieties are labeled Manx {{is up to the}} breed standard consulted. Manx cats' tails are classified according to proportional tail length as kittens (the proportion does not change after birth): ...|$|R
5000|$|Cats {{often use}} their tail to communicate. Cats holding their tail {{vertically}} generally indicates positive emotions such as happiness or confidence; the vertical tail {{is often used}} as a friendly greeting toward human beings or other cats (usually close relatives). A half-raised tail can indicate less pleasure, and unhappiness is indicated with a tail held low. In addition, a cat's tail may swing from side to side. If this motion is slow and [...] "lazy", it generally indicates that the cat is in a relaxed state, and {{is thought to be}} a way for the cat to search and monitor the surroundings behind it. Cats will twitch the tips of their tails when hunting or when irritated, while larger twitching indicates displeasure. A stalking domestic cat will typically hold its tail low to the ground while in a crouch, and twitch it quickly from side to side. This tail behavior is also seen when a cat has become [...] "irritated" [...] and is nearing the point of biting or scratching. They may also twitch their tails when playing. Sometimes during play, a cat, or more commonly, a kitten, will raise the base of their tail high and stiffen all but the tip into a shape like an upside-down [...] "U". This signals great excitement, to the point of hyperactivity. This may also be seen when younger cats chase each other, or when they run around by themselves. When greeting their owner, cats often hold their tails straight up with a quivering motion that indicates extreme happiness. [...] A scared or surprised cat may erect the hairs on its tail and back. In addition, it may stand more upright and turn its body sideways to increase its apparent size as a threat. <b>Tailless</b> <b>cats,</b> such as the Manx, which possess only a small stub of a tail, move the stub around as if they possess a full tail.|$|R
50|$|In 1964 the car became {{available}} as the 1800S with a cut off, square back (called a 'Manx tail' after the similarly <b>tailless</b> breed of <b>cat)</b> and round rear light clusters from the Ford Cortina. The chassis {{used for the}} 1800S and all subsequent Granturas was a very slightly modified version that allowed more space for the engine to fit in. This was an alteration made to the Grantura chassis to allow it also {{to be used as}} the basis for the new Griffith, a car that sported a V8 engine which was larger both in capacity and physical dimension.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the early}} days of breed {{recognition}} in the late 19th century, Manx show cats have been rumpy through stumpy specimens, with stubby and longy Manx not qualifying to be shown except in the [...] "Any Other Variety" [...] or household pet class. Kittens with complete tails may be born in a purebred Manx litter, having not inherited the taillessness appearance at all. Depending on the country and cat organization referenced, rumpy, rumpy risers and stumpies are the only Manx cat tail types that fit the breed standard for Manx cats. The longer cat tail lengths seen in some Manx cats are considered a breed fault, although they occur as naturally in the breed, but not as often, as the shorter tails. Although these longer tail types are of purebred Manx ancestry, they do not possess the dominant gene so cannot pass it on. However, since the Manx tail mutation gene is dominant, these longer-tailed purebred Manx cats may still be used in breeding programs and may even be considered in an effort to help avoid the fatal spinal deformities that sometimes result in <b>tailless</b> Manx <b>cats.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{argument}} for the permanence of species, drawn from the identity with those now living of cats, birds, and other animals preserved in Egyptian catacombs, was good enough as used by Cuvier against St.-Hilaire, that is, against the supposition that time brings about a gradual alteration of whole species; but it goes for little against Darwin, unless it be proved that species never vary, or that the perpetuation of a variety necessitates the extinction of the parent breed. For Darwin clearly maintains--what the facts warrant--that the mass of a species remains fixed {{so long as it}} exists at all, though it may set off a variety now and then. The variety may finally supersede the parent form, or it may coexist with it; yet it does not in the least hinder the unvaried stock from continuing true to the breed, unless it crosses with it. The common law of inheritance may be expected to keep both the original and the variety mainly true as long as they last, and none the less so because they have given rise to occasional varieties. The <b>tailless</b> Manx <b>cats,</b> like the curtailed fox in the fable, have not induced the normal breeds to dispense with their tails, nor have the Dorkings (apparently known to Pliny) affected the permanence of the common sort of fowl.|$|R
