5|$|Design {{work on the}} Type 34-class destroyers {{began in}} 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the {{armament}} limitations of the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships {{more powerful than the}} French and Polish destroyers then in service, but <b>the</b> <b>design</b> grew as the Kriegsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> work appears to have been rushed and not well-thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of <b>the</b> <b>design,</b> the high-pressure boilers, were an over-complicated design that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships.|$|E

Fraser's design is admired today, and has been used on commemorative coins and the gold American Buffalo series.|$|E

5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as <b>the</b> <b>design</b> team {{wanted to create a}} world that felt {{believable}} for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>design</b> team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far Cry and Crysis. As <b>the</b> <b>design</b> team felt that Far Cry and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed.|$|E

3000|$|Figure 6 {{presents}} the results of standard errors of the regression coefficients for the SMI and MMI methods. The plots show the ratio of the squared standard errors of regression coefficients from <b>the</b> three rotation <b>designs</b> over <b>the</b> original <b>design.</b> First, we observe almost all the ratios are larger than one as expected because the standard errors from <b>the</b> rotation <b>designs</b> have to account for the uncertainty due to missing data, while <b>the</b> original <b>design</b> does not contain any missing data, resulting in smaller standard errors. Second, we observe that the ratios of variables are much larger using MMI method than SMI method. This is also expected because multiple imputation results in larger standard errors than the single imputation. Third, for the scales in the common block, the ratios are much closer to one than the scales in rotation blocks because there is no missing data in the common block scales. Finally, across <b>the</b> <b>designs,</b> we observe that the ratios from <b>the</b> three-form <b>design</b> are smaller than those for <b>the</b> PBIB <b>design</b> and <b>the</b> two-form <b>design.</b> For <b>the</b> SMI method, none of the standard errors from <b>the</b> three-form <b>design</b> is 100 % larger than from <b>the</b> original <b>design,</b> however 30 % of the ratios in <b>the</b> PBIB <b>design</b> and 10 % in <b>the</b> two-form <b>design</b> are larger than two.
