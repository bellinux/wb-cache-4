5|$|A Love Surreal explores {{different}} stages of love in a cycle of slow-burning songs that Bilal deliberately wrote for female listeners. Its songs eschew <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> societal themes of Airtight's Revenge in favor of upbeat songs about cultivating a romance and meditative laments on its dissolution. Bilal {{wanted to make the}} album sound multidimensional and drew on the surrealist art of Salvador Dalí for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall {{was the result of}} an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles {{to pursue a}} career in the fashion {{industry}} in May 2006, Conrad was commissioned to star in her own spin-off series The Hills, which chronicled <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> professional lives of her and friends Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, and Whitney Port. During its production, she attended the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising and held positions with Teen Vogue and Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution.

Consequently, the conflict became the central focus of the series, and was carried through each subsequent season in which Conrad appeared.|$|E

5|$|At her Silver Jubilee in 1977, {{the crowds}} and {{celebrations}} were genuinely enthusiastic, but in the 1980s, public criticism {{of the royal family}} increased, as <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny. Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that {{the usage of}} <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> computer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Internet can improve efficiency in the agricultural sector. Despite the fact that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have evolved rapidly, the farmers are lagging behind {{in the use of}} ICTs. This study examines the factors that affect <b>the</b> usage of <b>personal</b> computers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Internet by Cypriot farmers, by analyzing data from 526 farmers, selected by using the stratified random sampling method. Logit models are used to examine the socioeconomic characteristics of Cypriot farmers that may affect the usage or not, of <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> computer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Internet. The results showed that 60. 6 % of them use <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> computer <b>and</b> 54. 2 %o use the Internet.

5|$|Several {{interconnected}} themes {{run through}} Szabó’s films, {{the most common}} being the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> the political or historical. On the personal level, his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues, but political/historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives. In an interview in 2008, Szabó said, “My mother once told me, ‘We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful, but our life was destroyed by politics and history.’” The political/historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid-20th century Hungarian and Central European history—Nazism, the Second World War, and, in Hungary—or, more accurately, Budapest—the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust, the Communist takeover, and the 1956 Revolution. Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} sea {{in human}} culture has been {{important}} for centuries, as people experience the sea in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous. Human responses to the sea {{can be found in}} artforms including literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted the sea. Symbolically, the sea has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. In the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolises <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>and</b> the collective unconscious in dream interpretation.|$|E
