25|$|Unbeknownst to General Baratieri, Emperor Menelik {{knew his}} troops had {{exhausted}} {{the ability of}} the local peasants to support them and had planned to break camp the next day (2 March). The Emperor had risen early to begin prayers for divine guidance when spies from Ras Alula, his chief military advisor, brought him news that the Italians were advancing. The Emperor summoned the separate armies of his nobles and with the Empress Taytu beside him, ordered his forces forward. Negus Tekle Haymanot commanded the right wing, Ras Alula the left, and Rasses Makonnen and Mengesha the center, with Ras Mikael {{at the head of the}} Oromo cavalry; the Emperor and his consort remained with the reserve. The Ethiopian forces positioned themselves on the hills overlooking the Adwa valley, in perfect position to receive the Italians, who were exposed and vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>crossfire.</b>|$|E

In dead ground behind the ridge, field artillery was deployed in rows and artillery observers watched from positions on the ridge, with a perfect view of the German front position, which ran along the higher slopes of three spurs, which descend south-west from the main ridge, where each trench had a distinct white chalk parapet.

2500|$|Harris, also in 2009, {{wrote that}} the Fourth Army had {{continued}} the offensive with the three corps {{on the right to}} close up to the second position but was too slow to occupy Mametz Wood before 4 July and Haig toured the corps headquarters urging them forward. Harris criticised the Fourth Army headquarters and the corps headquarters for inadequately commanding the resulting operations. Corps commanders delegated to divisions, which sometimes delegated to battalion commanders and caused a lack of co-ordination. Attacks were supported by small amounts of artillery and attacks on narrow fronts created untenable salients vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>crossfire</b> from un-engaged units on the flanks, although German counter-attacks were just as prone to failure. The attacks on Contalmaison {{and the rest of the}} Fourth Army front cost the British [...] but in the circumstances of early July, the rushed and disjointed attacks, might have been better than a delay to organise a deliberate attack, which could take a week and would have allowed the defenders to recover. Harris suggested that from [...] the British lacked aggression. The attacks from [...] added to German problems and closing up to the second position was a considerable, if costly, victory. After 1 July, the Germans found themselves in a [...] "meat grinder", when the British artillery was rapidly increasing in effectiveness, much assisted by RFC artillery-observation aircraft. German counter-attacks were even worse prepared than British equivalents and most were repulsed.
