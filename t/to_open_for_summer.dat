25|$|By 1962, the Magic Mile {{had long}} been a {{challenge}} to maintain, so the Timberline's operator {{replaced it with a}} double Riblet lift. The new lift had a midway station for loading and unloading, which allowed the lower mountain <b>to</b> remain <b>open</b> when harsh winter weather closed the upper mountain, and the upper mountain <b>to</b> remain <b>open</b> <b>for</b> mid-to-late <b>summer</b> skiing when little snow remained on the lower mountain.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1989, just before the lodge was <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> its <b>summer</b> season, {{structural}} engineers advised the National Park Service that the Great Hall was unsafe. It was so unstable they feared it might collapse from its own weight, bringing down {{the rest of the}} lodge with it. This forced the National Park Service to close the lodge pending renovation. After two years of planning, construction began in 1991. Some original materials were salvaged for reuse, but most of the original building had deteriorated to the point it could not be saved or reused. However, the Great Hall was carefully dismantled. The rest of the building was gutted and a steel support structure, modern utilities and fire suppression system were installed, and guest rooms were upgraded to modern hotel standards. The renovation was completed in the fall of 1994 at a cost of $15 million. On 20 May 1995, Crater Lake Lodge reopened to the public.|$|R

The dining and dancing portions of the nighclub had been moved into the new addition while the illegal gambling activities (such as roulette, poker, baccarat and chuck-a-luck) remained in the steel door protected basement portion of the old building. By the early 1950s the local authorities were under pressure from the state of Michigan to curb all local gambling in the northern sections the state. After a series of raids by the Michigan State Police, the Michigan Liquor Control Commission decided to remove the Club's license to sell alcohol in the fall of 1953. Without that license, Gerhart decided not <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>for</b> the <b>summer</b> 1954 season. The two large structures in rural Harbor Springs, Michigan stayed dormant until June 12, 1962. That is when it reopened under new owners to become the teen and collegiate nightclub named, the CLUB PONYTAIL.9 ...|$|R
50|$|Prior {{to their}} arrival on the French Riviera, {{the region was}} {{experiencing}} a period when the fashionable only wintered there, abandoning the region during the high summer months. However, {{the activities of the}} Murphys fueled the same renaissance in arts and letters as did the excitement of Paris, especially among the cafés of Montparnasse. In 1923 the Murphys convinced the Hotel du Cap <b>to</b> stay <b>open</b> <b>for</b> the <b>summer</b> so that they might entertain their friends, sparking a new era for the French Riviera as a summer haven. The Murphys eventually purchased a villa in Cap d'Antibes and named it Villa America, where they resided for many years. When the Murphys arrived on the Riviera, lying on the beach merely to enjoy the sun was not a common activity. Occasionally, someone would go swimming, but the joys of being at the beach just for sun were still unknown at the time. The Murphys, with their long forays and picnics at La Garoupe, introduced sunbathing on the beach as a fashionable activity.|$|R
