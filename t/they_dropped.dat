This was the only successful air-launched torpedo attack by the U.S. during the entire battle.|$|E

At the Night of Champions pay-per-view, DiBiase won the World Tag Team Championship in his first match in WWE, after Rhodes betrayed Holly, revealing himself to be DiBiase's partner. After holding the title for just over a month, <b>they</b> <b>dropped</b> them to John Cena and Batista on the August 4 episode of Raw. The following week, DiBiase and Rhodes used their rematch clause to regain the title.|$|E

After their tour in Puerto Rico ended, Don Kent returned to singles wrestling, and Costello refocused on managing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} match of January, Benfica lost to Sporting CP and {{underwent}} another erratic period, losing two more league matches in February. A home win against Liverpool motivated them; they beat Porto and eliminated the reigning title-holders from the Champions League. This success was not replicated domestically; in mid-March, Benfica lost further {{ground in the}} Primeira Liga and were eliminated from the Portuguese Cup. Koeman's side recovered, but they were eliminated by Barcelona from the Champions League and failed to overtake Sporting when <b>they</b> <b>dropped</b> seven points in three match-days. At {{the end of the}} season, Koeman left the club by mutual consent.|$|E

After attacking a mass of cavalry at Ain es Sir they returned to base by flying over the Wadi Fara road. Here <b>they</b> <b>dropped</b> their remaining bombs on a column of 50 motor lorries, moving eastwards along the road towards the Jisr ed Damieh bridge over the Jordan River. A direct hit on one of the lorries blocked the road and in the late afternoon another two Bristol Fighters continued this attack.|$|E

5|$|United were unbeaten {{from their}} first 10 league games of the 1985–86 campaign, and unbeaten {{from their first}} 15, and seemed destined to win the First Division title. However <b>they</b> <b>dropped</b> off in mid-season and won just six of their final 18 games to end the season in fourth place, 12 points behind champions Liverpool. The press blamed the decline in form on the club's {{drinking}} culture and Ron Atkinson's lax disciplinary attitude, though in his autobiography Whiteside denies that this was to blame, and states that stories of the player's drinking sessions were exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1957–58 season, Craig was made captain for Australia's Test tour to South Africa, making him the {{youngest}} captain in Test history at the age of 22years and 194days, with Harvey as his deputy. The appointment came despite his mixed batting form during the New Zealand tour. The selectors further demonstrated their view to the future when <b>they</b> <b>dropped</b> veteran Ray Lindwall altogether. The average age of Craig's team was {{two and a half years}} younger than the Australian squad sent to England in 1956, and they had only one player over the age of 30, whereas the 1956 team had five members over the age of 30. As a result of the team's relative inexperience, they were judged by critics to be the worst to have left Australian shores. Craig joined his team in Johannesburg after flying in from London, where he had been working for six months as a pharmacist, with the approval of the Australian board.|$|E
5|$|Benfica began March with an away game in Braga. They lost 3–1 {{in their}} first league loss since December. <b>They</b> <b>dropped</b> to fourth place in the standings. On the {{following}} Saturday, Benfica visited Belenenses and lost {{for a second time}} in a row. A week later, Benfica received Paços de Ferreira at home. The match ended with a 3–2 win for the visitors and Benfica dropped to fifth place. They were now eleven points behind leader Boavista. In the last game of March, Benfica faced Campomaiorense on the road. With a 1–1 draw, the team avoided losing all of their matches in March. However, their need to get points was aggravated, especially if they wanted to qualify for the European competitions.|$|E

After their 9–6 loss against the Tigers, Alabama dropped to No.4 in all but the BCS {{standing}} where <b>they</b> <b>dropped</b> to No.3. The Crimson Tide regained their No.2 ranking in all of the polls after Oklahoma State was upset by Iowa State, and retained the No.2 position {{through the end of the}} regular season to qualify for the BCS National Championship Game. After their victory over LSU in the BCS National Championship Game, Alabama was selected No.1 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of Strachan {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Brown's former Hibs boss Tony Mowbray became Celtic manager. Brown underwent surgery during pre-season in an attempt to rectify his ankle problem, but this didn't work, and he played matches despite not being fully fit. Celtic had a fairly good start to their league campaign, going into the first Old Firm match four points ahead of Rangers, but they lost 2–1. Celtic beat Dynamo Moscow in Champions League qualifying, but then lost the play-off to Arsenal, which meant that <b>they</b> <b>dropped</b> into the Europa League group stage. The 1–0 home defeat by Hamburg on 22 October 2009 was Brown's last action of the year, as Celtic initially chose to rest him in another effort to heal the ankle injury. This proved unsuccessful, and he underwent a second operation in Rotterdam to try and clear up his ankle injury.|$|E
5|$|Force B {{commenced}} its attack {{after the}} Tallboy Lancasters had completed theirs {{so that the}} shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot Tirpitz due to the smokescreen, <b>they</b> <b>dropped</b> the mines on the battleship's estimated position. These weapons did not cause any damage. The smokescreen over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew {{from being able to}} assess the results of their bombing, though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also pleased to see a column of black smoke rising through the smokescreen. However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to a mile from the battleship. Tirpitzs anti-aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on the bombers throughout the attack. However, only four Lancasters suffered any damage.|$|E

5|$|In New Zealand, Neighbours is {{broadcast}} on TV2 at 6:30 pm weekdays. In October 2010, it began airing episodes {{at the same}} pace as Australia. The show was initially broadcast by TVNZ in 1988, but by 1996 it {{was removed from the}} schedule. TV4 (now C4) picked the show up and began broadcasting it from 1997. <b>They</b> <b>dropped</b> it in 2000 and it returned to TV2 in 2002. Repeats of the previous day's episode of Neighbours were formerly shown at 2:30 pm weekdays and are now shown at 11.00 am weekdays. The show moved to 5:25 pm weeknights on TV One in late 2007. After a couple of months, the show moved to 3:50 pm weekdays. The show eventually moved back to TV2. The TV2 website offers viewers the chance to watch episodes online with its OnDemand service.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc {{returned}} to Florida in 1978 {{and was given}} a title reign as the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship after defeating Mr. Uganda on December 18. He held the belt for two weeks before dropping it to his old kayfabe rival Dick Slater. He was soon a champion again, however, as he and Thor the Viking were booked to win the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship in early 1979. <b>They</b> <b>dropped</b> the belts to Killer Karl Kox and Jimmy Garvin, but LeDuc soon regained the title by teaming with Pak Song. LeDuc and Song vacated the title shortly after winning it, but LeDuc teamed with yet another partner, Don Muraco, to win the belts back later that year.|$|E

They won the tag team title by defeating Scotty the Body and The Grappler on August 26. After an inconclusive rematch on September 9, {{the title was}} vacated and another rematch was ordered; the Southern Rockers regained the belts one week later. They held the title until PNW ordered it vacated again on November 4 after a match against Brian Adams and Jeff Warner; once again, Doll and King won a rematch the following week to regain the championship. <b>They</b> <b>dropped</b> the title to Adams and The Grappler on December 14 but regained the belts by winning a rematch on January 27, 1990.|$|E
