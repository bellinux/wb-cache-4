40|$|Abstract. The {{classical}} {{theory of}} dynamical systems {{arose in the}} context of the study of differential equations. In recent years the study of these systems has been extended beyond discrete or continuous (real) phase groups or semigroups to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> of more general topological groups or semigroups. Let S be a semitopological semigroup, not necessarily discrete. An action of S on a compact phase space can then be extended to a compactification associated to the space of left norm continuous functions on S such that all minimal flows are flow isomorphic to quotients of this compactification. Furthermore we can associate a subgroup of the maximal group to each min-imal flow. In [7] a new topology is defined on this extended acting semigroup such that these associated subgroups are precisely the closed subgroups in this topology. Since these subgroups are of significant importance in tower constructions of flows, in this paper we will look at pertinent structural theorems {{in the context of}} this new topology. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} a {{mathematical}} model of two-dimensional resin flow through fiber reinforcements in compression resin transfer molding (CRTM) is presented. The pre-form is partially filled by resin during the injection phase. Then it is compressed by the mo-bile {{upper part of the}} mold. The resin flow in the fiber bed is governed by Darcy's law according to the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> in saturated porous media. The consolidation of the satu-rated preform is described by the total mass conservation equation. A filling algorithm based on resin conservation on a deformable grid is used to advance the flow front at each time step. Resin pressure and velocity are calculated by the finite element method. The accuracy ofthe model is verified by evaluation of the resin mass balance, calculation of the resin pressure and progression ofthe flow front in time. Comparison ofpredicted results with analytical so-lutions is also presented. KEY WORDS: CRTM, consolidation, finite elements, filling algorithm. 1...|$|E

In this thesis we generalise this result for discrete groupoids, proving that every uniformly bounded cocycle into a finite von Neumann algebra is cohomologous to a unitary cocycle. The corresponding result for cocycles into finite dimensional algebras was proved in (Zim 3). We also derive some equivalent definitions of amenability of group actions and provide a new proof of a result of Zimmer regarding uniformly bounded cocycles on amenable G-spaces. We develop some machinery in order to prove these results. This is the theory of G-flows in which we explore the actions of groupoids on Borel fields of sets.

Flow Theory is based on discrete and nondeterministic mathematics, rather than the customary continuous or probabilistic mathematics. The theory features two types of flows: smooth and uniform, and eight types of flow operators. We prove that, if the input flow {{to any of these}} operators is smooth or uniform, then both the internal buffer and delay of that operator are bounded. Linear networks of flow operators are introduced, and their internal buffers and delays are derived from the internal buffers and delays of their constituent operators. We extend Flow Theory {{so that it can be}} used in analyzing cyclic networks and networks of multiflows. Since many rate-reservation protocols can be represented as linear networks of flow operators, we use Flow Theory to prove that a number of these protocols (Stop-and-Go, Hierarchical Round-Robin, Weighted Fair Queueing, Self-Clocking Fair Queueing, and Virtual Clock) require bounded buffering and introduce bounded delay...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{pioneering}} work of Maxwell and Boltzmann in the 1860 s and 1870 s, {{a major challenge}} in mathematical physics has been the derivation of macroscopic evolution equations from the fundamental microscopic laws of classical or quantum mechanics.

The rigorous derivation of macroscopic transport equations is thus not only a conceptual exercise that establishes their consistency with the fundamental laws of physics: the possibility of finding deviations and corrections to classical evolution equations makes this subject both intellectually exciting and relevant in practical applications. The plan of these lectures is to develop a renormalisation technique that will allow us to derive transport equations for the kinetic limits of two classes of simple dynamical systems, the Lorentz gas and kicked Hamiltonians (or linked twist maps).
