5|$|One of the {{featured}} matches on the under-card was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H {{would have to}} defend the title against the fans' choice of three possible opponents: Chris Benoit, Edge, or Shawn Michaels. At Unforgiven, Raw's previous pay-per-view event, Triple H defeated Randy Orton to capture the World Heavyweight Championship. The following night on Raw, Triple H had a celebration thrown in his honor, complete with women, confetti, streamers and a giant cake. Orton, however, sought revenge by coming out of <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> assaulting the three members of Evolution, Triple H's stable with Ric Flair and Batista, which Orton had previously been a part of. On the October 4 episode of Raw, {{it was announced that}} because Orton has not won the opportunity to challenge Triple H, fans would be able to choose between three potential contenders for Triple H's World title at Taboo Tuesday. Chris Benoit and Edge were revealed as two of the candidates. Shawn Michaels, however, competed in a qualifying match, which saw him defeat Christian, to become the third candidate. On the October 18 episode of Raw, a standard match involving three wrestlers, called a Triple Threat match, was scheduled between Benoit, Edge, and Michaels. Edge won the match after he pinned Benoit by using the ring ropes for unfair leverage. During the match, Michaels legitimately injured his left knee, tearing his meniscus.|$|E
25|$|When Mario, Luigi, Blue Toad, and Yellow Toad {{are celebrating}} Princess Peach's {{birthday}} in her castle, a large cake appears. Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings emerge from <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> trap Peach inside. The cake is loaded onto Bowser's airship {{and it takes}} off, with Mario, Luigi, and the two Toads giving chase. The Toads in the castle grant them access to the new items, the Propeller Mushrooms and Penguin Suits.|$|E
25|$|Recently, nèi fēi {{have become}} more {{important}} in identifying and preventing counterfeits. Menghai Tea Factory in particular has begun microprinting and embossing their tickets {{in an effort to}} curb the growth of counterfeit teas found in the marketplace in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some nèi fēi also include vintage year and are production-specific to help identify <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> prevent counterfeiting through a surfeit of different brand labels.|$|E

He said, with more feeling than before--"Thank you--thank you kindly." [...] But he laid down <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> <b>and</b> seated himself absently--drearily unconscious of any distinct benefit towards which <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> letters, or even Dolly's kindness, could tend for him.|$|R

25|$|Bĭng: The tea cake itself. Tea cakes {{or other}} {{compressed}} pu'er {{can be made}} up of two or more grades of tea, typically with higher grade leaves on the outside of <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> lower grades or broken leaves in the center. This is done to improve the appearance of the tea cake and improve its sale. Predicting the grade of tea used on the inside takes some effort and experience in selection. However, the area in and around the dimple of the tea cake can sometimes reveal the quality of the inner leaves.|$|E
25|$|The three {{serial killers}} ineptly destroy <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> {{fail to make}} a new one. Satan's {{assistant}} Demonius finds a cake the exact size and shape of an Acura TSX as a last-minute substitute. Satan is infuriated that he did not receive the right cake. When Demonius points out that his guests are having fun regardless, Satan flies into a rage. The guests get upset and start to leave, and Satan realizes that, in trying to have a party like the girls on My Super Sweet 16, he became like one of them. He tells the crowd that he is sorry and invites everyone into the party, including the Catholic priests. Having arrived in Los Angeles, Butters uses a make-up mirror to summon Biggie Smalls to the party, who asks Butters to come in with him as thanks.|$|E
25|$|Halloween cake is {{prepared}} with Halloween symbols and themes. It may be prepared with orange and black coloration in <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> icing, because orange {{is a traditional}} color associated with Halloween, such as the color of pumpkins, which are used to create jack-o'-lanterns. Black is another traditional Halloween color, and black coloration may be used on graveyard-themed cakes, among others. Food coloring {{may be used in}} the icing to color it. Carrot cakes are sometimes prepared as Halloween cakes, per their orange coloration. They are sometimes prepared as a spice cake, as a chocolate cake, as a pudding cake, and as a cheesecake. Halloween cake may be prepared as a layer cake, and also as cake pops and cupcakes. It may be displayed as part of the Halloween decorations during the holiday. Candy corn may be used as a cake decoration, as well as candy pumpkins.|$|E

25|$|Going {{into the}} new year, the rivalry widened on the January 1 episode of SmackDown. LayCool {{interfered}} in a match between James and Beth Phoenix and attacked James after; Phoenix responded by chasing away LayCool but giving the Glam Slam to James as well. The following week Phoenix defeated Layla but afterward LayCool assaulted her together until James saved Phoenix. On January 22's SmackDown, in an unusually long segment for the Divas, LayCool held a leaving party for James complete with a pig-shaped cake. Originally Maria came out to defend champion James, but James also appeared to answer LayCool. After a brawl broke out, Phoenix {{arrived on the scene}} appearing to come to their aid only to assist LayCool in attacking James and Maria. McCool hit James with <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> poured punch over her. LayCool continued to deride James, with Layla dressing up in a fatsuit with a pig mask and losing to McCool in a faux match for the Women's Championship as Piggie James. LayCool's boasting would be their downfall at the Royal Rumble, however, when Layla came out in the Piggie James outfit. James used this to her advantage, when she attacked Layla which distracted McCool allowing her to be pinned in under a minute, losing the Women's Championship. On the February 12 episode of SmackDown, LayCool defeated James in a non-title handicap match made by SmackDown Consultant Vickie Guerrero, who had been accidentally humiliated by James backstage.|$|E
500|$|Portal was {{acclaimed}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} original games of 2007, despite criticisms of its short duration and limited story. The game received praise for its originality, unique gameplay and dark story with a humorous series of dialogue. GLaDOS, voiced by Ellen McLain in the English-language version, received acclaim for her unique characterization, and the end credits song [...] "Still Alive", written by Jonathan Coulton for the game, was acclaimed for its original composition and humorous twist. Excluding Steam download sales, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release, spawning official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> portal gun, a standalone version, titled , on the Xbox Live Arcade service in October 2008, which added an additional 14 puzzles to the gameplay, and a sequel, Portal 2, which was released in 2011, adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode.|$|E
500|$|The episode's action {{revolves}} around the practical joke involving <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and,</b> in particular, viewers' attempts to guess what has caused injury, as {{they know that the}} paramedic will be coming. Both Angela and the alcoholic Carol are [...] "ticking time-bomb". Angela is the central character, and is similar to a more anxious version of Sue Brockman, Skinner's character from Outnumbered. She is stressed and obsessive-compulsive, but aspirational, fastidious, and dutiful. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau compared Ashbourne's characterisation of Carol to Elizabeth Taylor's characterisation in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; as the episode progresses, Carol becomes increasingly abusive. Commentators variously described Pat as [...] "appalling", [...] "tiresome", an [...] "irritating tit" [...] and [...] "an insufferable booby". For Chris Bennion, writing in The Independent, Pat's character is more complex: [...] "Behind Pat's cheesy jokes and schoolboy tomfoolery lies a desperately sad and dignified man, standing by and caring for a wife whose love for him has long gone." [...] Pat and Carol, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, have a more honest relationship than Jim and Angela, despite the problems in their relationship.|$|E

500|$|To start {{marketing}} American Life, Madonna {{performed the}} American Life Promo Tour.

Spears appeared on stage atop of a giant wedding cake, wearing a wedding gown and veil; she sang the first few lines of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] before Aguilera appeared from behind <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> <b>and</b> joined her. Madonna then emerged from the cake wearing a black coat and hat and started singing [...] "Hollywood" [...] before proceeding to kiss Spears and Aguilera on the lips.

Feminist author Camille Paglia described the moment as great; she noted that the kiss was like Madonna saying to Spears, [...] "I'm passing the torch to you." [...] However, according to her, Spears could not take advantage of the kiss as later her career and lifestyle came under immense media scrutiny and criticism. Paglia said that [...] "literally from that kiss, from that moment onward, Britney has spiraled out of control. It's like Madonna gave her the kiss of death!" [...] Madonna commented on the kiss; [...] "I am the mommy pop star and she is the baby pop star. And I am kissing her to pass my energy on to her."
