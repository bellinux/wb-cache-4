40|$|Spring brake {{orthosis}} (SBO) concentrates purely on {{the knee}} to generate the swing phase of the paraplegic gait with the required hip flexion occurring passively {{as a consequence of}} the ipsilateral knee flexion, generated by releasing the torsion spring mounted at the knee joint. Electrical stimulation then drives the knee back to full extension, as well as restores the spring potential energy. In this paper, genetic algorithm (GA) and its variant multi-objective GA (MOGA) is used to perform the search operation for the ‘best’ spring parameters for the SBO spring mounted on an average sized subject simulated in the sagittal plane. Conventional torsion spring is tested against constant torque <b>type</b> <b>spring</b> in terms of swing duration as, based on first principles, it is hypothesized that constant torque spring would be able to produce slower SBO swing phase as might be preferred in assisted paraplegic gait. In line with the hypothesis, it is found that it is not possible to delay the occurrence of the flexion peak of the SBO swing phase further than its occurrence in the natural gait. The use of conventional torsion spring causes the swing knee flexion peak to appear rather faster than that of the natural gait, resulting in a potentially faster swing phase and hence gait cycle. The constant torque <b>type</b> <b>spring</b> on the other hand is able to stretch duration of the swing phase to some extent, rendering it the preferable spring type in SBO...|$|E

Five different drying pressures, 0. 7, 2. 9, 4. 5, 6. 7, and 15 kPa, were applied during the preparation of fiber-fiber cross test pieces. The nominal overlap area of each fibre-fibre cross was measured in a transmission light microscope. A tensile tester was used to record the loaddeformation behavior of each fiber-fiber cross. The final results of the interfibre bond strength were defined by both the overlap area and the maximum force of each bond. The results showed that {{the influence of}} drying pressure to the average strength were very weak, although a maximum could be seen at 2. 9 kPa of drying pressure. Moreover, the results suggested the overall trend of decreasing strengths at very high drying pressures. Finally, a statistical significance study of the results was presented.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to identify weather-based variables in pre- and post-anthesis time windows for predicting major Fusarium head blight (FHB) epidemics (defined as FHB severity ≥ 10 %) in the United States. A binary indicator of major epidemics for 527 unique observations (31 % of which were major epidemics) was linked to 380 predictor variables summarizing temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall in 5 -, 7 -, 10 -, 14 -, or 15 -day-long windows either pre- or post-anthesis. Logistic regression models were built with a training data set (70 % of the 527 observations) using the leaps-and-bounds algorithm, coupled with bootstrap variable and model selection methods. Misclassification rates were estimated on the training and remaining (test) data. The predictive performance of models with indicator variables for cultivar resistance, wheat <b>type</b> (<b>spring</b> or winter), and corn residue presence was improved by adding up to four weather-based predictors. Because weather variables were intercorrelated, no single model or subset of predictor variables was best based on accuracy, model fit, and complexity. Weather-based predictors in the 15 final empirical models selected were all derivatives of relative humidity or temperature, except for one rainfall-based predictor, suggesting that relative humidity was better at characterizing moisture effects on FHB than other variables.

Our objectives were to investigate the utility of boosted regression trees (BRTs) for predictive modeling of FHB epidemics in the United States, and to compare the predictive performances of the BRT models with those of logistic regression models we had developed previously. The data included 527 FHB observations from 15 states over 26 years. BRTs were fit to a training data set of 369 FHB observations, in which FHB epidemics were classified as either major (severity ≥ 10 %) or non-major (severity < 10 %), linked to a predictor matrix consisting of 350 weather-based variables and categorical variables for wheat <b>type</b> (<b>spring</b> or winter), {{presence or absence of}} corn residue, and cultivar resistance. Predictive performance was estimated on a test (holdout) data set consisting of the remaining 158 observations. BRTs had a misclassification rate of 0. 23 on the test data, which was 31 % lower than the average misclassification rate over 15 logistic regression models we had presented earlier. The strongest predictors were generally one of mean daily relative humidity, mean daily temperature, and the number of hours in which the temperature was between 9 and 30 °C and relative humidity ≥ 90 % simultaneously. Moreover, the predicted risk of major epidemics increased substantially when mean daily relative humidity rose above 70 %, which is a lower threshold than previously modeled for most plant pathosystems.

40|$|This {{collection}} of research examines how {{changes in the}} sensory landscape, mediated by both odor and hydrodynamic properties, impact odor-mediated predator-prey interactions in salt marsh communities. I approached this research using an interdisciplinary framework that combined field and laboratory experimentation to address issues of scale and make connections between predator behavior and patterns of predation in the field. I explored a variety of interactions mediated by changes in the sensory landscape including; indirect effects of biotic structure on associated prey, predator responses to patches of prey with differing density and distribution, and dynamic interactions between predators and prey distributions. I found that biotic structure (oyster reefs [Crassostrea virginica]) has negative indirect effects on associated hard clam prey (Mercenaria mercenaria) through the addition of oyster reef odor cues that attract predators (blue crabs [Callinectes sapidus] and knobbed whelks [Busycon carica]) and increase foraging success near the structural matrix. Variation {{in the structure of}} patch-scale prey odor plumes created by multiple prey results in predator-specific patterns of predation as a function of patch density and distribution which are mediated by differences in predator sensory ability. There is a potential negative feedback loop between blue crab predators and hard clam prey distributions; clam patches assume random within-patch distributions after exposure to blue crab predators, making the detection of patches by future blue crab predators more difficult. Sensory landscapes are also mediated by water flow, which transports prey odor plumes downstream to predators. Characterization of water flow in small-scale estuary systems indicates that values of turbulent flow parameters are highly context specific and depend on both tidal <b>type</b> (<b>spring,</b> neap, normal) and site. Wind and tidal range seem to be good predictors for wave components and turbulent components of fluctuating flow parameters, respectively, although the strength of their predictive ability is dependent on time scale. Modifications of the sensory landscape through changes in structurally-induced turbulence, mixing of individual plumes from multiple prey, and bulk velocity and turbulence characteristics need to be considered when formulating predictions as to the impact of predators on naturally occurring prey populations in the field.

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of Defra project OF 0165. The main {{attached}} report starts with a more detailed and comprehensive Executive Summary, from which these paragraphs have been extracted. Previous studies suggest widespread positive responses of biodiversity to organic farming. Many of these studies, however, have been small-scale. The purpose of this project was to test the generality of responses to arable organic farming (i. e. cereal-growing farms) in England through a multi-taxa study {{of a large number}} of farms. Abundance and diversity of higher plants, spiders, carabid beetles, wintering birds and bats were measured on matched pairs of organic and conventionally managed farms. Extent and potential quality of non-crop habitat were also measured. Two key issues addressed by the project were (a) whether biodiversity differences between organic and conventional systems arise from amount and management of non-crop habitat or from differences in crop management systems and (b) the importance of duration under organic management. Plants and invertebrates were examined in 89 pairs of cereal fields (target fields). Birds and bats were studied at a larger spatial scale, extending over several fields on each study farm. Virtually all suitable organic farms in England were studied. The farm pairing procedure was purely geographical and not based on any attributes of either system. Target fields were stratified by cereal <b>type</b> (<b>spring</b> or winter sown) and by age since conversion. Habitat and management comparisons were carried out at landscape, farm and field scales using data collected in the field and existing landscape datasets (Land Cover Map 2000 and CS 2000 field survey data). Within England, organic farms tended to be located to the south of the wheat-growing region, in areas with more grassland than conventional farms. It is difficult to disassociate many landscape level variables from farming system. Organic arable farms were more often mixed farms than their conventional counterparts, leading to smaller field sizes, livestock-proof hedges, diverse rotations and greater extents of grassland. Hedges on organic farms occurred at higher density (length per unit area) and were taller, wider and less gappy than those on conventional farms. All these factors are likely to enhance many components of biodiversity. By contrast, conventional farms were more likely to contain stubble and naturally regenerated set-aside which can be beneficial to wildlife. This study has confirmed that organic systems do generally support higher levels of biodiversity but that the differences are often quite small. Some, but not all, differences in biodiversity between systems appear to be a consequence of differences in habitat quantity. Plants and invertebrates appear to be responding mainly to crop management practices that are intrinsic to the system. Birds and bats benefit from increased quantities of various non-crop habitats and higher diversity of habitats on organic but this does not account for all differences between systems in these groups. Few relationships with duration of organic management were detected. This may be partly because it was not possible to account for pre-conversion management. We highlight the potential value to biodiversity on conventional farms of non-crop habitat management (especially hedges), mixed farming and the incorporation of ‘organic’ field margins. High priority areas for future related research include the potential biodiversity benefits of organic livestock farming, long-term controlled studies on responses to conversion, and the effect of extent of organic management at larger scales...|$|E
