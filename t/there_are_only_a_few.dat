5|$|Several details {{contribute}} {{to the fact that}} <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and zirconium makes it possible to use zirconium for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium-free zirconium in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.|$|E

5|$|There {{are more}} than 150 {{important}} fossil sites from the Jurassic, the majority in Eastern Europe and North Asia.

In North America <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> sites with fossil records of insects from the Jurassic, namely the shell limestone deposits in the Hartford basin, the Deerfield basin and the Newark basin.|$|E

5|$|The {{three main}} {{industries}} on Svalbard are coal mining, tourism, and research. In 2007, there were 484 {{people working in}} the mining sector, 211 people working in the tourism sector and 111 people working in the education sector. The same year, the mining gave a revenue of NOK2.008 billion (227,791,078 USD), tourism NOK317 million (35,967,202 USD) and research NOK142 million (16,098,404 USD) In 2006, the average income for economically active people was NOK494,700; 23% higher than on the mainland. Almost all housing {{is owned by the}} various employers and institutions and rented to their employees; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> privately owned houses, most of which are recreational cabins. Because of this, it is nearly impossible to live on Svalbard without working for an established institution.|$|E
5|$|The katipo is an {{endangered}} species and has recently become threatened with extinction. It is estimated that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand katipo left in about 50 areas in the North Island and eight in the South Island, making it rarer than some species of kiwi. A number of reasons have contributed to its decline; the major factors appear to be loss of habitat and declining quality of the remaining habitat. Human interference with their natural habitat has been occurring {{for over a century}} following European settlement. Coastal dune modification resulting from agriculture, forestry, or urban development along with recreational activities like the use of beach buggies, off-road vehicles, beach horse riding and driftwood collection have destroyed or changed areas where katipo lives. The introduction of many invasive exotic plants has also contributed to the decline of suitable habitat.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of lower {{government}} funding, Canadian cities have to recover a much higher share of their costs out of operating revenues.
