LED daytime running lamps, an aggressive body kit with large frontal air intakes, black-painted 'single frame grille' and a lower spoiler lip complete the new look from the front. The axle track has been widened by 66 mm, with bolder and wider wheel arch extensions, polished 19-inch alloys, wider side sills and 255-section tyres are {{the highlight of the}} side profile.

5000|$|Rutkiewicz {{had been}} told she would be shot. Meanwhile, she {{found out she was}} {{carrying}} <b>twins.</b> <b>Polish</b> doctors befriended her and persuaded the Germans to postpone her execution till after the babies were born, twins being a [...] "medical opportunity" [...] for Nazi doctors. Rutkiewicz gave birth on 16 February 1944 to a boy and a girl. She soon learned through the prison underground that her husband had no idea what had become of her and was desperately trying to find out. With the help of a criminal prisoner, she managed to have a photograph taken of herself with the babies, which she then was able to smuggle to her husband in Auschwitz. As the war progressed and the Nazis began to sense defeat, their focus was on destroying documents and the evidence of their crimes. Despite fears she would soon be executed, Maria Rutkiewicz was able to leave the prison with her babies in summer 1944.|$|R

Structural equation models were fitted to estimate heritability and showed the range to which individual differences in coping are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The model was extended, using a Cholesky (triangular) decomposition, to examine genetic and environmental covariance. The environmental correlations were generally low (maximum r/. 24), whereas some of the genetic correlations were considerably higher (maximum r/. 52) ...|$|R

In 2002, 18-inch nine-spoke RS wheels became a no-cost option.|$|R
40|$|Introducing fine {{precipitates}} is {{an important}} way to enhance the properties of transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels. In present work, two V-Ti microalloyed TRIP steels containing aluminum with different content were compared. The average size, size distribution and numbers of vanadium-titanium carbides in samples cold rolled, quenched after being held at 800 °C and quenched after intercritical annealing at 800 °C and being held at bainitic isothermal transformation temperature of 400 °C were investigated by using the technique of carbon extraction replica, <b>twin</b> jet chemical <b>polishing</b> thinning and transmission electron microscopy. The carbides were identified to be (Ti,V) C precipitates in steel A and VC in steel B respectively, precipitated mainly from ferrites grains. The average equivalent radius was 3 ~ 6 nm. Comparison of the experimental results in A and B steel revealed low carbon diffusion rate caused by aluminum inhibited the coarsening of vanadium-titanium carbides. The experimental results also showed that VC carbides dissolution occurred during the intercritical annealing at 800 °C...|$|R
40|$|Body Mass Index (BMI) and skinfolds {{are common}} {{indicators}} of adiposity. Many {{studies have shown}} relationships between the BMI in childhood and adolescence and the BMI in adulthood. Similar correlations were observed for the skinfolds, although {{they tend to be}} lower. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate changes with age in the genetic variance and heritability of the BMI and skinfolds among <b>Polish</b> <b>twins</b> born between 1959 and 1965. Observations involved male and female monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins, who were measured annually between 8 and 18 years of age. Body Mass Index and skinfold thicknesses at the triceps (TSF), subscapular (SSF) and suprailiac (SIF) sites were measured. Genetic variance and heritability were estimated for individual skinfold thicknesses, the sum of three skinfolds (SUMSF) and BM, separately by age classes for both sexes. Intraclass correlations were significantly higher for MZ twins than for DZ twins in both sexes and across all ages. Heritability estimates were significant for all indicators of adiposity, but varied with age and had different ranges for boys and girls. Estimates of genetic variance were significant for all indicators of adiposity and were higher for girls than for boys...|$|R
