40|$|In {{the present}} work {{a study on}} {{cavitation}} of hull appendages, such as stabilizer fins or rudders, is presented. The {{attention is focused on}} tip related cavitation and especially on tip vortex cavitation. Devices, such as end plates and <b>tip</b> <b>fairing,</b> commonly adopted to reduce this phenomenon are analyzed trough experiments and numerical calculations. Various solutions are compared underlining their advantages and shortcomings, considering the effect on cavitation inception and vortex intensity. With this aim, a model of control surface was fitted with different end plates and with a <b>tip</b> <b>fairing</b> and tested at various angles of attack. Experiments were carried out in the cavitation tunnel of the University of Genoa while CFD computations were performed by CETENA. Moreover a comparison between experiments and numerical results is presented showing the relation existing between the two different approaches. As a result a simplified technique to predict cavitation phenomenon by means of numerical simulations calibrated with experimental results is outlined...|$|E
50|$|The first {{important}} US {{decision in}} this field {{was that of the}} Ninth Circuit in Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp. Kelly complained, among other things, that Arriba's search engine used thumbnails to deep link to images on his Web page. The court found that Arriba's use was highly transformative, in that it made available to Internet users a functionality not previously available, and that was not otherwise readily provided — an improved way to search for images (by using visual cues instead of verbal cues). This factor, combined with the relatively slight economic harm to Kelly, <b>tipped</b> the <b>fair</b> use balance decisively in Arriba's favor.|$|R

40|$|The authors' {{theory on}} the tip-clearance loss of {{centrifugal}} impellers {{is modified to}} include variation of gas density in the impeller. Furthermore, a relationship between two empirical parameters in the theory is derived to reduce freedom of adjustment. In order to compare experimental data in the literature with prediction, examination was made regarding accuracy of data {{and the way to}} determine the corresponding flow rates at different <b>tip</b> clearances. <b>Fair</b> agreement between data and prediction was observed. These examples demonstrated effect of various parameters on tip clearance loss as follows. The clearance loss of high pressure-ratio compressors is less than that of low pressure-ratio compressors if the tip clearance ratio at the impeller exit is given. The clearance loss becomes smaller as the flow rate is reduced and also at a reduced shaft speed in cases of high pressure-ratio compressors. The equations in the theory clearly show these tendencies...|$|R

5000|$|First, she {{rejected}} that sampling {{was a personal}} (rather than commercial) use. Sampling on Napster is not a personal use {{in the traditional sense}} that courts have recognized — copying which occurs within the household and does not confer any financial benefit on the user. See, e.g., Sony, 464 U.S. at 423, 449-50, 104 S.Ct. 774. Instead, sampling on Napster amounts to obtaining permanent copies of songs that users would otherwise have to purchase; it also carries the potential for viral distribution to millions of people. Defendant ignores critical differences between sampling songs on Napster and VCR usage in Sony. She also commented that, Even if the type of sampling supposedly done on Napster were a non-commercial use, plaintiffs have demonstrated a substantial likelihood that it would adversely affect the potential market for their copyrighted works if it became widespread. See Sony, 464 U.S. at 451, 104 S.Ct. 774. Plaintiffs claim three general types of harm: a decrease in retail sales, especially among college students; an obstacle to the record company plaintiffs' future entry into the digital downloading market; and a social devaluing of music stemming from its free distribution. ... Any potential enhancement of plaintiffs' sales due to sampling would not <b>tip</b> the <b>fair</b> use analysis conclusively in favor of defendant. Indeed, courts have rejected the suggestion that a positive impact on sales negates the copyright holder's entitlement to licensing fees or access to derivative markets.|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{versatile}} and reliable in-situ devices, cone penetrometers have been extensively used in soil exploration (e. g. soil classification, soil profiling, back-calculation of soil properties etc.) both experimentally and theoretically over the past 80 years. To improve its site accessibility, reduce the required sample size with minimal boundary effects, or model soil penetration by plant roots or earthworms, cone penetrometers with various sizes are often employed both in the field and laboratory. Consequently, size-dependent performance may appear, and this is {{one of the}} subjects of this research. A series of cone penetration tests with three sized cone penetrometer (12 mm, 6 mm, 3 mm) on the Leighton Buzzard sand with two fractions (E and C) was performed at the 1 g condition. Evident size effects were observed both in the cone tip resistance and shaft friction. To account for the observed size-dependent behaviour, theoretical methods based on the cavity expansion theory were developed in addition to the available experimental findings. Firstly, a size-dependent quasi-static cavity expansion solution was developed by improving the conventional cavity expansion theory incorporating with a strain gradient theory of plasticity. A stiffer response is modelled for a smaller cylindrical/ spherical cavity with this solution. Based on the analogy of cone penetration and quasi-static cavity expansion, the developed size-dependent expansion solution for spherical cavities was employed to quantify the size effect in the cone <b>tip</b> resistance, and <b>fair</b> good agreements were achieved between the theoretical prediction and experimental results. Subsequently, the scale effect observed in shaft friction resistance was explained in terms of the interface frictional strength and mobilised lateral soil stress. The size-dependent interface frictional strength was discussed based on the available experimental data of other researchers, and an improved solution based on the elastic cylindrical cavity expansion solution was derived to quantify the size dependency of the mobilised lateral stress on the shaft. In the light of above discussions, dominating factors influencing the size-dependent behaviours in the cone penetration test are summarised. The other objective of the present research was to model the mechanical interaction between a growing root tip and the surrounding soil. Two elastic solutions for computing the stress and displacement fields around a displacement-controlled ellipse were developed based on the complex variable theory of elasticity and Fourier series method. By assuming the axial cross section of a root tip as a half-ellipse, the two-dimensional soil response to a short-term growing root tip was discussed with the derived elastic solutions. Benefits of radial swelling of the root tip to its axial penetration were summarised, and an approximate analytical method to estimate the soil resistance mobilised by a short-term root growth was suggested and employed in the present root tip-soil interaction analyses. In addition, influences of the additional shear stress in the process of static and quasi-static cavity expansion were analysed with an elastic-perfectly-plastic model. For Tresca materials, a non-equal initial stress field was considered in the static stress solution, and a quasi-static expansion solution was then derived for a cavity deforming in a hydrostatic stress field considering the material compressibility. The static stress solution is capable of calculating the stress redistribution around a circular rotating probe, and the large-strain quasi-static solution may be useful in theoretical predictions of the tip resistance of a rotating penetrometer (or pile) which has been often utilised in needle cone penetration tests for modelling the root tip elongation. Then the introduced methods in above solutions were applied to the static stress analysis of a circular cavity surrounded by the Mohr-Coulomb material under a non-equal stress field. Based on the conformal mapping function proposed by Detournay and Fairhurst (1987), both a loading and unloading analysis were carried out with the derived analytical solution. It can provide a simple method to predict the plastic failure zone and calculate the stress redistribution around a circular excavation (e. g. tunnel, pipeline) either under loading or unloading...|$|R
