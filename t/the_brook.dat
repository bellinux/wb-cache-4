5|$|Brook Farm {{was named}} for <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> that ran near the {{roadside}} and that eventually went to the Charles River. It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, {{turned out to be}} difficult to farm.|$|E
5|$|The Plenty Brook now {{passes through}} the town's {{drainage}} system, allowing buildings to be built over the top. <b>The</b> <b>brook</b> has been prone to flooding during heavy rain, especially in inland areas, which regularly causes problems for {{people living in the}} Eddington area in southern Herne Bay.|$|E

50|$|Mount Chamberlin is {{the third}} highest peak in <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> Range, Alaska, USA. Located in {{what are known as}} the Franklin Mountains of <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> Range, Mount Chamberlin is 30 mi west-northwest of Mount Isto, the tallest peak in <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> Range. Mount Chamberlin is within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and was named for Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin (1843-1928), {{geologist}} of the Peary Auxiliary Expedition of 1894. Previously believed to be the highest peak in <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> Range, in 2014 new measurement technology established that Mount Chamberlin {{is the third}} highest peak in the range.|$|R
50|$|Farrington Lake is {{a scenic}} {{freshwater}} reservoir in Middlesex County, New Jersey near Milltown, New Jersey. Created by a dam on <b>the</b> Lawrence <b>Brook,</b> {{a tributary of}} the Raritan River, the lake is in fact a widened section of <b>the</b> Lawrence <b>Brook.</b> Its main tributaries are <b>the</b> Ireland <b>Brook,</b> <b>the</b> Beaverdam <b>Brook,</b> and <b>the</b> Oakeys <b>Brook.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Avery Homestead {{is located}} {{on the west side of}} Ledyard, Connecticut and faces south on Avery Hill Road. The house overlooks 100 acres (40.46 hectares) of stone-walled pasture land that extends south to Stoddards Wharf Road. The two-story house has a shed to the {{immediate}} east and a two-story barn to the southeast. Past the barn is a farm pond that is located in a small valley formed by Billings-Avery Brook. <b>The</b> <b>brook</b> extends west for a mile (about 1.6km) before joining the Thames River.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Brook</b> Avenue station {{just east}} of Third Avenue–138th Street on the IRT Pelham Line would be reconstructed to allow a {{cross-platform}} interchange. Further north, {{there would be a}} connection with the IRT Pelham Line near Westchester Avenue at the Whitlock Avenue station, and station platforms north to Pelham Bay Park would be narrowed and lengthened to accommodate the longer and wider B Division trains from the Second Avenue Subway. IRT local service on the Pelham Line would terminate at Hunts Point Avenue one stop south.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{playing fields}} to the south, the A1 briefly becomes Market Place, a former street market that {{has evolved into}} a short stretch of shops, then becomes Falloden Way – built between 1914 and 1924 as part of a {{programme}} of planned extensions to Hampstead Garden Suburb, and runs on an embankment due to a dip in the ground caused by Mutton Brook, a tributary of the River Brent, which runs parallel to the road immediately to the south for its entire length. The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following <b>the</b> <b>brook,</b> and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood – two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Brooks</b> {{had many}} players {{that went on}} to Major League Baseball playing time to varying degrees of success. <b>The</b> 1935 <b>Brooks</b> {{featured}} 10 players that would reach the Major Leagues and five players that had already accumulated Major League service time {{for a total of}} 15 players that had already reached or would reach the Major Leagues out of 43 players that played for <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> that year. <b>The</b> 1936 <b>Brooks</b> had 19 players that had either already reached or would reach the Major Leagues out of the 35 players that played for <b>the</b> <b>Brooks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to have once entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross <b>the</b> <b>brook,</b> had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, <b>the</b> <b>Brook</b> Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E
5000|$|Brooks Camp is {{a visitor}} {{attraction}} and archeological site in Katmai National Park and Preserve, {{noted for its}} opportunities for visitors to observe Alaskan brown bears catching fish in the falls of <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> River during salmon spawning season. <b>The</b> <b>Brooks</b> River connects Lake Brooks and Naknek Lake over about 2 km. This natural choke point for salmon runs made it an attractive location for prehistoric Alaskans, who occupied the area from 4500 BP. The Aglegmut Eskimo people lived along <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> River in historical times. <b>The</b> <b>Brooks</b> River Archeological District, which includes Brooks Camp, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993.|$|R

5|$|Moore {{returned}} to London in 1911, where, {{with the exception}} of frequent trips to France, he was to spend {{much of the rest of}} his life. In 1913, he travelled to Jerusalem to research for his next novel, <b>The</b> <b>Brook</b> Kerith (1916). The book saw Moore once again embroiled in controversy, as it was based on the supposition that a non-divine Christ did not die on the cross but instead was nursed back to health. Other books from this period include a further collection of short-stories called A Storyteller's Holiday (1918), a collection of essays called Conversations in Ebury Street (1924) and a play, The Making of an Immortal (1927). Moore also spent considerable time revising and preparing his earlier writings for new editions.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} was never financially stable and had difficulty profiting from its agricultural pursuits. By 1844, <b>the</b> <b>Brook</b> Farmers adopted a societal model {{based on the}} socialist concepts of Charles Fourier and began publishing The Harbinger as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism. Following his vision, the community members began building an ambitious structure called the Phalanstery. When the uninsured building was destroyed in a fire, the {{community was}} financially devastated and never recovered. It was fully closed by 1847. Despite the experimental commune's failure, many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience positively. Critics of the commune included Charles Lane, founder of another utopian community called Fruitlands. Nathaniel Hawthorne was {{a founding member of}} Brook Farm, though he was not a strong adherent of the community's ideals. He later fictionalized his experience in his novel The Blithedale Romance (1852).|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest of}} those {{research}} institutes {{is a nonprofit}} research organization {{referred to as the}} Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI). GTRI provides sponsored research in a variety of technical specialties including radar, electro-optics, and materials engineering. Around forty percent (by award value) of Georgia Tech's research, especially government-funded classified work, is conducted through this counterpart organization. GTRI employs over 1,700 people and had $305 million in revenue in fiscal year 2014. The other institutes include: the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering & Bioscience, the Georgia Tech Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology, the Georgia Tech Strategic Energy Institute, <b>the</b> <b>Brook</b> Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems, the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute, the Institute of Paper Science and Technology, Institute for Materials and the Institute for People and Technology.|$|E

5|$|Three days of {{cold weather}} and rain preceded the offensive. On 15 April Lieutenant Colonel Edmond Van der Meersch led {{an attack on}} <b>the</b> <b>brook.</b> One Belgian {{lieutenant}} went scouting alone in no man's land and {{was killed in an}} ambush. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by snipers concealed in the bush. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were lost. Three Italians and an estimated 40 Eritrean ascari were killed, with approximately 70 ascari wounded.|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
25|$|Between Eastleigh and Southampton, <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> and its {{immediate}} surrounds form a green corridor which is reportedly home to roe deer, lizards, kingfishers, wasp spiders and slowworms. In the meadows beside <b>the</b> <b>brook,</b> badgers {{have been seen}} foraging for worms. There have also been claims that <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> supports important species such as the great crested newt and otters.|$|E

25|$|The {{continued}} {{movement of}} both residents and businesses into the Stony Brook valley brought calls to contain <b>the</b> <b>brook,</b> prevent floods, and provide sewer drainage. During the 1870s, <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> was deepened and contained within wooden walls, but the spring thaw resulted in flooding of surrounding streets, {{and a new}} effort. Work continued until 1908, when <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> was placed into a shallow culvert from Forest Hills to its present outlet in the Boston Fens, behind the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In the following years, <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> that once defined the industrial heart of Jamaica Plain was largely forgotten, until it was memorialized by the new Stony Brook Orange Line station at Boylston Street.|$|E
