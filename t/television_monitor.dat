5|$|The final {{match was}} a Pinfalls Count Anywhere {{match for the}} WWE Championship, as John Cena defended against The Great Khali. Khali had control {{for most of the}} contest, {{performing}} a spin kick and a leg drop onto Cena. The contest went into the crowd, as Khali hit Cena with a <b>television</b> <b>monitor.</b> Cena gained the advantage, swinging the boom camera by the crew set into Khali. Cena attempted to perform the FU, but Khali blocked it with his elbow. Khali regained the upper hand, scoop slamming Cena onto a crane. Cena fought back while on the crane and performed an FU to Khali off the crane onto the arena floor. Cena got the pinfall and the victory.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster <b>television</b> <b>monitor</b> inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E

25|$|Ubuntu Touch is, by now, an {{unofficial}} version of Ubuntu developed for smartphones and tablets which was announced then-official by Cannonical on 2 January 2013. Ubuntu Touch was released to manufacturing on 16 September 2014. The first device {{to run it}} was the Galaxy Nexus. A concept for a smartphone running Ubuntu for Phones was published on Ubuntu's official channel on YouTube. The platform allows developing one app with two interfaces: a smartphone UI, and, when docked, a desktop UI; a demo version for higher-end Ubuntu smartphones was shown that could run a full Ubuntu desktop when connected to a monitor and keyboard, which was to ship as Ubuntu for Android. Ubuntu for Tablets was previewed at 19 February 2013. According to the keynote video, an Ubuntu Phone {{will be able to}} connect to a tablet, which will then utilize a tablet interface; plugging a keyboard and mouse into the tablet will transform the phone into a desktop; and plugging a <b>television</b> <b>monitor</b> into the phone will bring up the Ubuntu TV interface.|$|E
25|$|Lucy and Desi had {{originally}} {{decided that the}} series would air on a biweekly basis, much like The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. Philip Morris, however, was insistent that the show air weekly, thus diminishing the possibility of Lucy continuing her film career alongside a television show. Another problem lay {{in the fact that}} Philip Morris wanted the series to originate from New York rather than Hollywood. At the time, most television shows were produced from New York with live broadcasts of the show airing for eastern and Midwest audiences. West Coast viewers were able to view live programs only through low-quality kinescopes, which derived their images by using a 35mm or 16 mm film camera to record the show from a <b>television</b> <b>monitor.</b> As videotape had not yet been developed, kinescopes seemed to be the only practical means to allow a live show to reach television markets on the West Coast. Complicating matters was that kinescopes were not available for immediate re-broadcast as in 1951 no coast-to-coast cable system was yet in service. Shows had to be sent to Hollywood, which delayed their airings for West Coast audiences by nearly a week. The process operated in the reverse for the few programs that originated live in Hollywood, such as The Ed Wynn Show, thus making blurry kinescopes of these shows the only available print for eastern audiences. Most sponsors, including Philip Morris, found this to be undesirable as most of the television audience lived east of the Mississippi at the time.|$|E

500|$|CTW's {{researchers}} were {{strongly influenced by}} behaviorism, a popular movement in psychology during the late 1960s; therefore, many methods and tools used were primarily behavioral. Palmer developed [...] "the distractor", which he used to test if the material shown on Sesame Street captured young viewers' attention. Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory and shown an episode on a <b>television</b> <b>monitor</b> and a slide show next to it. The slides would change every seven seconds; researchers recorded when the children's attention was diverted from the episode. They were able to assess almost every second of Sesame Street this way; if an episode captured children's interest 80–90 {{percent of the time}}, producers would air it. However, if it only worked 50 percent of the time they would change (or remove) content.|$|E

Angle hit Big Show with a <b>television</b> <b>monitor,</b> causing him to fall through a broadcast announce table. Later, Big Show executed a Chokeslam on JBL but JBL placed his foot on the ropes to void the pinfall. Big Show tackled JBL through the barricade and performed a flapjack to Angle onto a chair. Luther Reigns, Mark Jindrak and Doug and Danny Basham attacked Big Show as Orlando Jordan helped JBL back into the ring. JBL executed a Clothesline from Hell on Angle to retain the title.|$|E
500|$|Palmer and his team's {{approach}} to researching the show's effectiveness was innovative; {{it was the}} first time formative research was conducted in this way. [...] For example, Palmer developed [...] "the distractor", which he used to test if the material shown on Sesame Street captured young viewers' attention. [...] Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory; they were shown an episode on a <b>television</b> <b>monitor</b> and a slide show next to it.

[...] They were able to record almost every second of Sesame Street this way; if the episode captured the children's interest 80–90% of the time, the producers would air it, but if it only tested 50%, they would reshoot. [...] By the fourth season of the show, the episodes rarely tested below 85%.|$|E

Cena {{came out on the}} flatbed of a semi truck with a DJ on a {{turntable}} mixing his theme song. During the match, both Cena and JBL were able to get in offense. One part of the match saw Cena backdrop JBL through the announce table. Shortly after, JBL hit Cena with a steel chair which caused Cena to bleed from his forehead. Back in the ring, JBL hit Cena with a Clothesline from Hell thrice. Cena later hit JBL with a Five Knuckle Shuffle and a FU. Later in the match, up the ramp area, Cena threw JBL face first through a <b>television</b> <b>monitor.</b> The match ended when JBL said [...] "I quit", as Cena prepared to hit him with an exhaust pipe, which came from the semi truck that was at the ramp area. As a result, Cena retained the WWE Championship. Despite the match being over, Cena then hit JBL with the exhaust pipe. Because of the amount of blood Cena lost, the pay-per-view was rated TV-MA on WWE Network On Demand.|$|E

500|$|One of the inspirations {{behind the}} {{creation}} of the game was technological advances that made it possible to implement certain elements that could not be done in previous Mario games. Satoru Iwata explained that [...] "since 1996, when Mario appeared in 3D in Super Mario 64, it's always been hard for players to judge how to jump and hit a block floating in a 3D space," [...] musing that the Nintendo 3DS autostereoscopy allowed for this issue to be fixed. The development team, which only had experience developing on consoles rather than handhelds, first tried playing Super Mario Galaxy 2 on a small <b>television</b> <b>monitor.</b> When it was found that Mario was too small to see and thus difficult to control, 3D Lands camera system and level terrain needed to be designed for viewing on the small Nintendo 3DS screen, making it easier for players to keep track of Mario. Certain aspects of gameplay were inspired by Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda franchise, including the way that the camera functioned during certain moments. Ideas that were ultimately not incorporated into 3D Land included a pro skater suit for Mario, the ability to change Mario's size to the extreme, and a feature that replaces Princess Peach's face with a photographed face. The game's title was chosen as an homage to the Super Mario Land games released on the Game Boy.|$|E

This led to a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match between the two at [...] on December 14, during which a <b>television</b> <b>monitor</b> blew up in Ambrose's face, allowing Wyatt to win the match. The feud concluded when Wyatt beat Ambrose in the first ambulance match held on the January 5, 2015 episode of Raw. Ambrose's booking during his feuds with Rollins and Wyatt was criticized by commentators, including James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch, who stated that although [...] "he's a utility main eventer", his lack of victories indicated {{that he was not}} a guy WWE was positioning [...] "for a 2-3 year sustained run on top".|$|E
2500|$|During the Attitude Era, {{in which}} the WWF moved towards a more [...] "adult" [...] product, the Legion of Doom was placed into a storyline {{incorporating}} Hegstrand's real-life drug addiction and alcoholism, against the wishes of both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis. The storyline found the Legion of Doom crumbling as Hawk repeatedly showed up to matches apparently drunk or {{under the influence of}} drugs, and began demonstrating suicidal tendencies. In order to stabilize the team, a third member, Puke, was introduced. This led to the conclusion of the storyline, in which a suicidal Hawk {{climbed to the top of}} the TitanTron, the giant <b>television</b> <b>monitor</b> erected during episodes of WWF's Raw Is War to show match highlights to fans in attendance. Puke, supposedly attempting to rescue Hawk, climbed after him, only to apparently throw Hawk over the side (with a special effect being used to make it appear as though fans could see Hegstrand's body plunging a fatal distance behind the screen); Puke then revealed that he had been enabling Hawk's drug addiction in order to kill him and take his place in the Legion of Doom. Being forced to act out Hegstrand's personal demons onscreen eventually proved too much for both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis, and both men quit the company shortly after the [...] "Puke killed Hawk" [...] incident.|$|E
