5|$|The {{capybara}} has a heavy, barrel-shaped {{body and}} short head, with reddish-brown fur {{on the upper}} part of its body <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> yellowish-brown underneath.

5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not change color. Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction {{but it has a}} different color and is not hairy at the margin of the cap. L.flavidus has a yellowish cap but does not have a hairy margin.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a mild {{taste with}} a {{slightly}} bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, it is not recommended, as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy. There {{are a number of}} other mushrooms that appear at the same time and in the same areas as L.subdulcis that are preferable to it, including L.mitissimus, meaning that L.subdulcis is not particularly useful as a foodstuff. The milk is one of distinguishing features, having a sweet taste <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> bitter in the mouth, with L.subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continues}} east through fields before intersecting MD 328 (New Bridge Road). Past this intersection, MD 404 crosses {{over the}} Choptank River. It continues east as a limited-access road with a diamond interchange at MD 313 (Greensboro Road) and MD 619 (Sixth Street), where some businesses are located. MD 313 forms a concurrency with MD 404 {{and the two}} routes turn south, heading along {{the eastern side of}} Denton through woodland and then past residential neighborhoods. It turns to the southwest, heading into woods and intersecting MD 404 Bus. (Franklin Street/Gay Street) at an at-grade intersection. MD 313 and MD 404 continue as a surface road <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> south and heads through some commercial areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E
5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> {{out to be the most}} valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E
5|$|With Sorsha {{as their}} {{temporary}} hostage, they {{escape to the}} castle of Tir Asleen, but discover that its inhabitants have all been frozen by Bavmorda and the castle is overrun by trolls. The castle is stormed by Kael's army. During Kael's assault on the castle, Sorsha realizes she also loves Madmartigan and decides to join him and Willow in opposing her mother's army. Willow accidentally turns a troll into an eborsisk, a massive, fire-breathing, two-headed monster-like dragon <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> the tide of the battle, and Airk arrives with his army to assist. However, Kael captures Elora and returns to Nockmaar, where he reports Sorsha's betrayal to Bavmorda.|$|E

5|$|Jim briefly {{transfers}} to Stamford branch after Pam confirms {{her commitment to}} Roy. Corporate is later forced to merge the Stamford branch and staff into the Scranton branch. Included in the transfer to Scranton are Karen Filippelli, with whom Jim has developed a relationship, and the anger-prone Andy Bernard. Pam is newly single after calling off her marriage and relationship to Roy prior to the merger, and Jim's unresolved feelings for her and new relationship with Karen lead to shifting tensions amongst the three. Meanwhile, Michael and Jan's relationship escalates which causes them both to behave erratically on the job while Dwight and Angela continue their secret relationship. In the season's finale, Jim, Karen, and Michael interview for a corporate position <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> out to be Jan's, who is fired that day for poor performance. Jim wins and rejects the offer off-screen, opting instead to return to Scranton without Karen and asks Pam out on a date, which she joyfully accepts. In the final scene, we learn Ryan has been awarded Jan's job due to his business school credentials.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vinosus, {{formerly}} {{considered a}} variety of L.sanguifluus, is quite similar in appearance. In general, L.vinosus can be distinguished by the more vinaceous-red color (lacking orange tones) of its cap, stipe, and gills, the more distinctly downwards-tapered stipe, and the more intense staining of the latex on the cap tissue. The two species can also be distinguished microscopically by differences in the ornamentation of their spore surfaces. L.vinosus has an incomplete reticulum on the spore surface, with ridges that have a wider degree of variation in thickness. Another potential lookalike, L.semisanguifluus, has a characteristic orange latex <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> wine-red in 5–10 minutes after exposure to air. Compared to L.sanguifluus, the fruit bodies of L.semisanguifluus are smaller, have tinges of violet in the cap, and develop a greenish discolouration with age.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E

5|$|There is {{reliance}} on repetition of themes within {{the plot of}} Thalaba. Three times he attained a paradise <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> out to be false, and {{this is followed by}} the death of a woman who are gone until the very end when Thalaba is awarded entrance into a true paradise. The seeking out of mythic figures to guide him onto the next part of the tale is equally repetitive and has little result for the plot. Various instances of the sorcerers and sorceresses are added to the story to emphasise the evil of magic along with tempting Thalaba with power. However, the emphasis on magic hides the moral within Thalaba's temptations. Although Thalaba does achieve his goal through moral submission, many of the quests and actions are arbitrary and repetitive. As such, they take away from any Islamic truth that could be found within the actions.|$|E
5|$|A lead {{scientist}} for a pharmaceutical company is {{killed by a}} blue powder <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> his bones into dust. The Fringe division traces {{the source of the}} package which contained the powder to a former Marine; when they search his home, Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds the man nearby and gives chase, but the man is hit by a car and knocked into a coma. Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind to learn of any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable to control his telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being able to read the mind of Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering if he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E
5|$|Rachel is {{the leading}} female character, and tragic heroine of the game. She and her twin sister, Alma, are afflicted with a blood curse <b>that</b> <b>turns</b> humans into fiends. Believing {{that there is no}} cure for their condition, Rachel seeks to kill Alma to redeem her sister's soul. The {{relationship}} between the sisters and the Greater Fiend Doku, who cursed them, serves as a plot device to drive the game forward, with Rachel occasionally needing to be rescued by Ryu. Although not a player-controlled character in Ninja Gaiden, in a few sections of the Ninja Gaiden Sigma remake she is controllable. Two other characters assist the player in the game. Ayane, a young female ninja and one of the DOA regular cast members, acts as a guide throughout Ninja Gaiden by supplying advice and objectives to the player. Muramasa, a bladesmith, has shops scattered throughout the game world where players can purchase useful items and upgrades for Ryu's weapons. Muramasa also gives quests and relates back-stories and other crucial information; for example, he tells Ryu how he can obtain the item required to upgrade his Dragon Sword to its full potential. Players have the option to customize the appearance of player characters, with selectable costumes for Ryu and hairstyles for Rachel.|$|E
