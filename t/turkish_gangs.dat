25|$|In 2014, {{the annual}} report into {{organized}} crime, presented in Berlin by interior minister Thomas de Maizière, {{showed that there}} were 57 <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs</b> in Germany. According to the report, alongside their more traditional fields of drug smuggling, gangs are also increasingly turning their attention to burglary, car theft and fraud.

25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{fire in the}} Greek {{quarter was}} started by <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs</b> under their leader Yöruk Ali, once they {{took control of the}} city. The gangs entered the quarter in the morning of 30 June and burnt it down after having looted the houses, killing the occupants. Irrespective of age or sex, a number of Greek inhabitants encountered by the gangs as they roamed through the town were ruthlessly killed. Around 2000 or 3000 inhabitants were robbed but not killed. They had managed to take refuge in the French convent before the gangs arrived, after which they sought the protection of Colonel Şefik Bey, Commander of the small Ottoman Division present in the city.|$|E
2500|$|The {{colonization}} {{lasted from}} 1718 till 1724, when {{the town was}} settled mostly by Germans, but the Serbs never stopped arriving. The military frontier in Potisje was displaced. In the following years Italians, Frenchmen, Romanians arrived and then the Catalans from Barcelona, who settled in the present “Dolja”. The town was called “New Barcelona”. But the life was difficult in this marsh area with many contagious diseases, {{so many of them}} died and still many left. The permanent dangers for the newcomers were the <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs,</b> who drove very often into the town plundering and killing people.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 the <b>Turkish</b> <b>gang</b> leader Necati Arabaci {{was sentenced}} to 9 {{years in prison for}} pimping, human trafficking, assault, extortion, weapons {{violations}} and racketeering. His gang of bouncers controlled the night clubs in Cologne's entertainment district, the Ring, where they befriended girls in order to exploit them as sex workers. After Arabaci's arrest, informants overheard threats against the responsible prosecutor, who received police protection and fled the country in 2007 when Arabaci was deported to Turkey.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band has}} been accused—despite many protests—of extreme right-wing tendencies, with their 1981 song [...] "Türken raus" [...] cited as an example. This song was written during their punk phase, {{and the band}} says it was written as a {{reaction}} to a specific <b>Turkish</b> <b>gang</b> with whom they often fought. Critics claim that the song does not refer to a specific group, but demands that [...] "all Turks have to go". The band contends that it was only an example of their primitive way of thinking at that time. The 1983 song [...] "Deutschland den Deutschen" [...] ("Germany For Germans") is also often mentioned; however, the band says that this song was also written in reaction to their experiences on the street.|$|R

2500|$|Neo-Nazi {{attacks on}} Turks have persisted {{through to the}} twenty-first century. Between 2000 and 2006 several Turkish shopkeepers were {{attacked}} in numerous cities in Germany. The attacks were popularly called the [...] "Bosphorus serial murders" [...] (Bosporus-Morde) or the [...] "Döner murders" [...] (Dönermorde) - which saw eight Turks and one Greek killed. Initially, the German media suspected that <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs</b> were behind these murders. However, by 2011 it came to light that the perpetrators were in fact the neo-Nazi group the National Socialist Underground. Moreover, this neo-Nazi group were also responsible for the June 2004 Cologne bombing which resulted in 22 Turkish people being injured.|$|E

5000|$|In The Independent, the {{commentator}} Paul Vallely {{pointed out}} that there was a danger of the media, fuelled on a toxic mixture of [...] "combination of depravity and self-righteous indignation", peddling vicious stereotypes about Pakistani Muslim culture. He {{pointed out that}} these sexual crimes were not confined to Pakistani Muslims or directed purely against white victims: a <b>Turkish</b> Muslim <b>gang</b> in London had targeted a Bangladeshi girl and in the Rochdale case one Pakistani Muslim perpetrator had raped a member of his own community.

50|$|While ethnically Zaza {{groups are}} not {{noteworthy}} in Turkey itself, large Alevi Zaza immigrant communities have formed in Great Britain and Germany. Criminal gangs from these communities have links with other Turkish and Kurdish crime bosses and {{are involved in}} drug trafficking and contract killing. An example in London is the brutal turf war between <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs,</b> such as the so-called Tottenham Boys and the Hackney Turks. The Tottenham Boys and Hackney are mainly <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs,</b> but they have also some Kurdish members.|$|E

50|$|Transferring Armenian conscripts {{from active}} combat to passive, unarmed {{logistic}} sections {{was an important}} precursor to the subsequent genocide. As reported in The Memoirs of Naim Bey, {{the execution of the}} Armenians in these battalions was part of a premeditated strategy of the CUP. Many of these Armenian recruits were executed by local <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs.</b>|$|E
50|$|The penose {{concerns}} organized criminal {{groups with}} ties to the country of the Netherlands itself. Due to immigration there are strong Turkish, Chinese, Yugoslav, Russian, Albanian and Italian communities in the Netherlands. Criminal outfits such as the Turkish mafia, Triads, Serbian mafia, Russian Mafia, Albanian Mafia, and the 'Ndrangheta are not regarded {{as a part of}} the traditional Penose, although they're an active part of the Dutch criminal underworld nonetheless. The reason why Surinamese, Antillean, Moroccan and Ambonese groups are considered to be a part of the Penose is because their criminal groups were formed and based in the Netherlands, whereas the <b>Turkish</b> or Serb <b>gangs</b> are part of a criminal group based in their home country.|$|R
40|$|In their {{interactions}} with students who were immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, teachers at the Gesamtschule (comprehensive secondary school) in Osnabruck during the 1998 - 1999 school year took for granted that these students could not be German. The teachers assumed and expected that their Auslander (foreigners / non-citizens) and Aussiedler (German re-settlers from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union: literally, those who "settled out") students would be other than German, or ambiguously German. Nonetheless, the teachers expected them to be participatory German citizens {{and not to be}} other than supposedly liberal Germans. These contradictory assumptions and expectations existed concurrently and informed each other. This study of one people's views and constructions of others acknowledges the role played by both categorisations of others and group identification in processes of identity formation. In focussing on the teachers' social categorisations of their Auslander and Aussiedler students, I have contributed to knowledge of the role played by social categorisation of others in the nationhood and national identities of Germans in the late twentieth century. Enmeshed in an understanding of nationhood as indigeneity, the teachers sometimes stereotyped their Auslander and Aussiedler students as <b>Turkish</b> machos, Russian-speaking <b>gang</b> members or polarised them as liberal or fundamentalist. These categorisations were variously reinforced or challenged in the teachers' interpretations of {{their interactions}} with them. Reified stereotypes were evident and reinforced when the teachers' interpretations sought to represent others in terms that were familiar, and hence a great deal of potential cultural difference was avoided so as to render the foreign comprehensible. Stereotypes were unsettled when the teachers aimed to understand others on the others' own terms and allowed cultural difference to, challenge shared assumptions. While the teachers typically operated with an essentialist understanding of culture they frequently implied a processual understanding of culture. Despite my subjects' assumptions and expectations that their Auslander and Aussiedler students were other than German or ambiguously German they expected them to be active German citizens. This expectation and others - that they learn the German language, conform to civic and democratic values, and participate in German public life - constituted a form of liberalism, but a liberalism which was sometimes ethnicised. The teachers sometimes assumed liberalism to be essential to some ethnic groups and not to others. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

50|$|In {{other reports}} {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that Turkey replaced Asia as the most important transit point for heroin, and it is estimated that 80% of heroin intercepted by British authorities belongs to <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs.</b> A recent spate of murders in London in 2009 have been linked to a heroin drugs war involving rival Turkish and Turkish-Kurdish gangs in north London. It is believed that the feud is between two organised drug gangs, the Turkish 'Tottenham Boys' and the 'Bombarcilar' or 'Bombers' from Hackney. The Bombers were led by Abdullah Babysin who was said to be Britain's largest importer of heroin, he was convicted in 2006.|$|E

50|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Ottoman Empire in World War I the {{peninsula}} was occupied by Great Britain. At the end of 1920 control of the region was ceded to Greek troops. The advance of the Greek forces in June-July 1920 eastwards, outside of the 'Smyrna zone', brought an inter ethnic conflict in the Izmit district between Turkish and Greek regulars and some Circassian mercenaries, the latter acting in a subordinate role according to Toynbee. Turkish irregulars responded by excoriating Christian villages in the Iznik region, east of Yalova and outside the area controlled by the Greek forces. In the nearby city of Iznik, some 539 Greeks, 20 Armenians and 18 Jews were killed on 15 August 1920. Greek and Armenian survivors from deportations of World War I who had returned to their villages were also subject of atrocities, massacres and village burnings by <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs.</b> Most of these atrocities happened in villages east of lake Iznik. The documents in the Ottoman archives accuse the Christian emigres of committing the same atrocities and this is agreed by the western allied report. During the battles in spring 1920 between Turkish and Greek forces, the Greek advance failed.|$|E
50|$|Selim Aga, {{according}} to his own account, was born in Taqali valley controlled by a chief whose main possessions were the three wells. The people of Taqali practised primitive agriculture and sheepherding, their faith combined Islam with pagan Sun worship. Selim, the oldest boy in the family, was prepared by the father to plow his own farmland; he was abducted by slaveholders when herding the livestock. He and his fellow prisoners were forced to march away from Taqali, relayed between numerous Sudanese, Arab and <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs</b> of slaveholders. After six months' service to one exceptionally vicious slaveholder, Selim {{was taken over by}} a new owner (his seventh) who set up a caravan heading to Dongola. After a brief stay there, Selim was sold again; he ended up on a slave market in Cairo. His ninth master was a European (identified as Mr. P in Selim's book); his tenth was Robert Thurburn (Mr. R. T.), British consul in Alexandria. The new owners taught Selim basic English, took him {{on a tour of the}} Cataracts of the Nile, and then prepared for the journey to Britain via Malta, Messina, Naples and the land route to Dover Strait.|$|E
5000|$|As a crown province, Banat belonged {{directly}} to the Vienna court. The first governor, appointed by the Emperor, was Count Claudius Mercy. By the imperial edict on September 12, 1718, Banat was divided into 13 districts, with the main administration in Timișoara at its head. The District of Banat included a few settlements: Idjoš, Arač, Bečej, Itebej, Elemir, Ečka and Aradac. The first chief of this district was Titus Vespanius Slucki. After the Turkish forces and Turks families had withdrawn, the land was left devastated without labour, which could till the soil and paid taxes. That’s why the Austrian court tried to settle Banat as soon as possible. [...] The colonization lasted from 1718 till 1724, when the town was settled mostly by Germans, but the Serbs never stopped arriving. The military frontier in Potisje was displaced. In the following years Italians, Frenchmen, Romanians arrived and then the Catalans from Barcelona, who settled in the present “Dolja”. The town was called “New Barcelona”. But the life was difficult in this marsh area with many contagious diseases, {{so many of them}} died and still many left. The permanent dangers for the newcomers were the <b>Turkish</b> <b>gangs,</b> who drove very often into the town plundering and killing people. [...] In the summer of 1738 there was the great plague. The Count Mersy wanted to turn marshes into fertile soil and he began to regulate the Begej River. In the middle and down course of the river a long canal was built, to make the river traffic possible between Bečkerek and Timișoara. On the first of November 1745 Sebastian Krazeisen began to make beer in the first brewery and that meant the first start of the industrialization. In the same year the first Serb’s school was mentioned. [...] On 6 June 1769 Maria Theresa granted the Community of Great Bečkerek, the privilege of becoming the trading centre. By this privilege the whole social-economic life of the former Bečkerek was regulated and it got the status of the town. In 1769 the first hospital was built. In 1779, by the new organization of Torontál County, Bečkerek became its centre. The city was briefly restored to Ottoman administration from 1787 to 1788 during Austro-Turkish War (1787-91). In the 18th century it developed into thriving economic and cultural centre, but the great fire destroyed {{a large portion of the}} town in 1807. The town was soon rebuilt. The fire came from the brewery, on 30 August 1807. After the fire a new regulation of streets had been done, houses had been built from stronger materials, roads had been rebuilt. The river traffic was especially intensive. The theatre building with an attractively decorated hall was built in 1839. In 1846 the Grammar School was opened and in 1847 the first printing shop.|$|E
