5|$|Ashton Court {{has been}} {{the site of a}} manor house since the 11th century, and has been {{developed}} by a series of owners since <b>then.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> 16th to 20th centuries it was owned by the Smyth family with each generation changing the house. Designs by Humphry Repton were used for the landscaping in the early 19th century. It was used as a military hospital in the First World War. In 1936 it was used as the venue for the Royal Show and, during the Second World War as an army transit camp. In 1946 the last of the Smyth family died and the house fell into disrepair before its purchase in 1959 by Bristol City Council.|$|E
5|$|Firearms {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly. Gunpowder {{seems to have been}} widely known by the 13th century. The Europeans, Arabs, and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and <b>then</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's plan envisaged {{that the}} Allies would throw many troops to envelop his right flank {{in order to}} cut the French {{communication}} line from Vienna. As a result, the Allies' centre and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable. To encourage them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his own caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon's main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite the Heights. According to the plan, the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, <b>then</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Heights they would launch a decisive assault {{to the center of}} the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} side of Kenongo Island is another one-storeyed {{circular}} structure that forms another artificial island in the past called Gumuling Well (Sumur Gumuling). These one-storeyed building can only be entered via the underwater tunnel. The building was used as a mosque. A niche in the wall of this building was used as a mihrab. The central area of this building is an elevated platform where four staircases meet, and <b>then</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> platform, one staircase reach the first floor. On the ground level of this platform is a small pool that was used for Muslim ritual ablution.|$|E

By 1908 this small community celebrated held its first High Holiday services in the Orthodox Community Center, space which was rented by Agudath Israel. In 1912, they named themselves Congregation Etz Ahayem ("Tree of Life"), writing a constitution in Ladino. Temple Beth Or gave them a Torah scroll, and in 1916 they formally incorporated.

Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the {{travellers}} are welcomed {{by the human}} inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travels to the Lonely Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing a great cup and learning of a weakness in Smaug's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruder, sets out to destroy the town. A thrush had overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability and reports it to Lake-town defender Bard. His arrow finds the chink and slays the dragon.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorities}} {{responded to}} the chaos with emergency legislation; the Ordinance of Labourers was passed in 1349, and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempted to fix wages at pre-plague levels, making {{it a crime to}} refuse work or to break an existing contract, imposing fines on those who transgressed. The system was initially enforced through special Justices of Labourers and <b>then,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1360s onwards, through the normal Justices of the Peace, typically members of the local gentry. Although in theory these laws applied to both labourers seeking higher wages and to employers tempted to outbid their competitors for workers, they were in practice applied only to labourers, and then in a rather arbitrary fashion. The legislation was strengthened in 1361, with the penalties increased to include branding and imprisonment. The royal government had not intervened in this way before, nor allied itself with the local landowners in quite such an obvious or unpopular way.|$|E
