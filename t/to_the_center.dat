5|$|Between 1994 and 2009, {{the city}} had a declining and aging {{population}} compared to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as young people moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> {{of the country for}} education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city.

5|$|Consider a {{particle}} moving under an arbitrary central force F1(r) whose magnitude depends {{only on the}} distance r between the particle and a fixed center.

Both of these coordinates, r(t) and θ1(t), change with time t as the particle moves.|$|E

5|$|NGC 362 {{is another}} {{globular}} cluster in Tucana with an apparent magnitude of 6.4, 27,700 light-years from Earth.

Unusually for a globular cluster, its orbit takes it very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the Milky Way—approximately 3,000 light-years. It was discovered in the 1820s by James Dunlop. Its stars become visible at 180x magnification through a telescope.|$|E

5|$|The first {{project to}} {{describe}} {{the shape of the}} Milky Way and the position of the Sun was undertaken by William Herschel in 1785 by counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the Solar System close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> Using a refined approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about 15kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70kiloparsecs and the Sun far from the center. Both analyses failed {{to take into account the}} absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane, but after Robert Julius Trumpler quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters, the present picture of our host galaxy, the Milky Way, emerged.|$|E

The loss of the left wing caused the aircraft to roll left, whereupon the fuselage and the right horizontal stabilizer collided with the separated wing. The initial separation was caused either by a wind gust in excess of operating velocity, or a similar lower-velocity gust after the material had become fatigued.|$|E
