25|$|Golwalkar {{describes}} {{the mission of}} the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the revitalisation of the Indian value system based on universalism and peace and prosperity to all. Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the worldview that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> one family, propounded by the ancient thinkers of India, is considered as one of the ideologies of the organisation.|$|E
25|$|Edgar, in his madman's guise, {{meets his}} blinded {{father on the}} heath. Gloucester, not {{recognising}} him, begs Tom to lead him to a cliff at Dover so that he may jump to his death. Goneril discovers that she finds Edmund more attractive than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience—he is disgusted by the sisters' treatment of Lear, and the mutilation of Gloucester, and denounces his wife. Goneril sends Edmund back to Regan; receiving news of Cornwall's death, she fears her newly widowed sister may steal Edmund and sends him a letter through Oswald. Now alone with Lear, Kent leads him to the French army, which is commanded by Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. At Regan's instigation, Albany joins his forces with hers against the French. Goneril's suspicions about Regan's motives are confirmed and returned, as Regan rightly guesses the meaning of her letter and declares to Oswald {{that she is a}} more appropriate match for Edmund. Edgar pretends to lead Gloucester to a cliff, then changes his voice and tells Gloucester he has miraculously survived a great fall. Lear appears, by now completely mad. He rants that <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> corrupt and runs off.|$|E
6000|$|And {{everywhere}} {{now through}} the city-set earth, save in the administered [...] "black belt" [...] territories of the tropics, the same cosmopolitan social organisation prevailed, and everywhere from Pole to Equator his property and his responsibilities extended. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> civilised; <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> dwelt in cities; <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> his property....|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> said to {{be filled}} with living beings. In all the three parts, there is the {{existence}} of very small living beings called nigoda. Nigoda are of two types: nitya-nigoda and Itara-nigoda. Nitya-nigoda are those which will reborn as nigoda throughout eternity where as Itara-nigoda will be reborn as other beings too. The mobile region of universe (Trasandi) is one Rajju wide, one Rajju broad and fourteen Rajju high. Within this, there are animals and plants everywhere where as Human beings are restricted to 2.5 continents of middle world. The beings inhabiting lower world are called Naraki (Hellish beings). Deva (roughly demi-gods) live in whole of the top and middle world and top three realms of lower world. Living beings are divided in fourteen classes (Jivasthana) : 1. fine beings with one sense. 2. Crude beings with one sense. 3. beings with two sense. 4. beings with three sense. 5. Beings with four sense. 6. beings with five sense without mind. 7. beings with five sense with a mind. These can be under-developed or developed which makes it a total of fourteen. Human beings get any form of existence and are the only ones which can attain salvation.|$|E
500|$|Color {{printing}}: By {{at least}} the Yuan Dynasty, China had invented color printing for paper. British art historian Michael Sullivan writes that [...] "the earliest color printing known in China, and indeed in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world,</b> <b>is</b> a two-color frontispiece to a Buddhist sutra scroll, dated 1346".|$|E

500|$|Eleven {{weeks before}} the Beatles' arrival in the U.S. President JohnF. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The nation was in mourning, in fear, and in disbelief. The {{assassination}} came after a fifteen-year build-up of Cold War tension. The motivation and identity of the assassin would be doubted by many Americans for decades, despite the Warren Commission's issued report in September 1964. As the United States tried to restore a sense of normality, teenagers in particular struggled to cope, as their disbelief began {{to be replaced by}} a personal reaction to what had happened: in school essays, teenagers wrote that [...] "then it became real", and [...] "I was feeling <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> going to collapse on me", and [...] "I never felt so empty in all my life".|$|E
500|$|In 1964, Smythe {{opposed the}} Lester Pearson government's plan {{to replace the}} {{traditional}} Canadian flag with a completely new design. He wrote to Pearson, whom he had known since the 1920s: [...] "In the Olympic Games, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> represented and when Canada sometimes wins a Gold Medal everybody knows, when the Red Ensign (see Canadian Red Ensign) is raised to the masthead, that Canada has won." [...] Smythe disagreed that a new flag would help to unify the country. Smythe switched his support to John Diefenbaker. Smythe wrote over 300 letters to Members of Parliament. In 1965, he unsuccessfully lobbied for the Red Ensign to be flown at the Gardens instead of the new Flag of Canada. Harold Ballard ordered the new flag flown because calls were more than three to one in favour of the new flag.|$|E
500|$|On December 31, 1999, a pizza {{delivery}} {{boy named}} Philip J. Fry delivers a pizza to [...] "Applied Cryogenics" [...] in New York City {{only to discover}} that the order was actually a prank call. Dejected and demoralized, he stops in the deserted lab to eat the pizza while outside <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> getting ready to celebrate the beginning of New Year. At midnight, Fry falls into an open cryonic tube and is frozen as it immediately activates. He is defrosted on Tuesday, December 31, 2999, in what is now New New York City. He is taken to a fate assignment officer named Leela, a purple-haired cyclops. To his misfortune, Fry is assigned the computer-determined permanent career of delivery boy, and flees into the city when Leela tries to implant Fry's career chip designating his job.|$|E
5000|$|Israel Joshua Singer, another famous Yiddish novelist, {{once said}} of Der Nister that [...] "had writers of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>been</b> {{given a chance}} to read his work, they would have broken their pens.” ...|$|R

500|$|In a {{directive}} letter dated 30 July 1942, Ostojić urged all Chetnik commanders to [...] "develop the strongest possible {{oral and written}} propaganda". He stated that, [...] "the people must be persuaded that the Chetniks are their only friends {{and that it is}} from them that they can expect freedom and a happy life" [...] and instructed the Chetniks to [...] "work day and night and maintain the spirit of the people". He wrote, [...] "the hour of freedom is near. Allied aid for the Chetniks is assured, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> admiring them." [...] In August, he launched a counterattack against Ustaše troops returning to Foča as the Italians withdrew their garrisons from the hinterland. The Chetniks feared the Ustaše were about to unleash another round of genocidal violence on the Serb population in the area. At least 2,000 local Muslims were subsequently killed in Foča by forces under Ostojić's command.|$|E
500|$|On 11 August 1586, {{after being}} {{implicated in the}} Babington Plot, Mary was arrested while out riding and taken to Tixall. In a {{successful}} attempt to entrap her, Walsingham had deliberately arranged for Mary's letters to be smuggled out of Chartley. Mary was misled into thinking her letters were secure, while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham. From these letters {{it was clear that}} Mary had sanctioned the attempted assassination of Elizabeth. She was moved to Fotheringhay Castle in a four-day journey ending on 25 September, and in October was put on trial for treason under the Act for the Queen's Safety before a court of 36 noblemen, including Cecil, Shrewsbury, and Walsingham. Spirited in her defence, Mary denied the charges. She told her triers, [...] "Look to your consciences and remember that the theatre of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> wider than the kingdom of England". She protested that she had been denied the opportunity to review the evidence, that her papers had been removed from her, that she was denied access to legal counsel and that as a foreign anointed queen she had never been an English subject and thus could not be convicted of treason.|$|E

2500|$|According to Heckler, Kempton {{had written}} a letter {{on the day she}} had died, of which she had managed only four lines, [...] "Mother. forgive me. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> against me. I really meant no harm...".|$|R
25|$|The {{basis for}} Heinsius's Historical and Political-Geographic Atlas of <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>was</b> a {{translation}} of the Grand Dictionnaire Géographique Et Critique of Antoine-Augustin Bruzen de La Martinière.

2500|$|Simcha Zissel {{taught that}} <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> a {{classroom}} {{where one can}} learn to improve one’s character and increase one’s belief in God.

2500|$|The {{government}} of Brazil {{issued a statement}} saying: [...] "His role in the economic, social and political recovery of his country was remarkable, as his commitment {{in the struggle for}} the South American integration."

Kirchner was a great friend of Brazil".|$|E
2500|$|Mircea Eliade {{discussed}} initiation as {{a principal}} religious act by classical or traditional societies. He defined initiation as [...] "a basic change in existential condition," [...] which liberates man from profane time and history. [...] "Initiation recapitulates the sacred history of the world.

2500|$|In July 2009, Barron {{stated that}} the Gaza Strip section of the Palestinian Territories was “a virtual death camp, {{the same kind of}} {{conditions}} the Nazis imposed on the Jews.” 11 months later he stated, [...] "There’s too many children and women and innocent men of Gaza dying because you’re isolating them and not allowing anything in. It's like having a concentration death camp. It’s horrible, and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> and should be outraged.” ...|$|E
