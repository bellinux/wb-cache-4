5|$|While in prison, George Orsborne lent {{his name}} to a ghost-written account of the Girl Pat adventure, which {{repeated}} {{the claim that the}} vessel had been sent out inadequately equipped and provisioned.

Likewise, nothing came of an announcement in 1938 that Orsborne would lead an expedition to the Caribbean and up the Amazon.|$|E
5|$|Koji Sugimoto, main {{programmer}} for characters, {{said that}} {{the complexities of the}} PlayStation 2 hardware made mastering it difficult, but more rewarding because <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>on</b> Yuna's sleeves to the depiction of shine and shadow could be rendered more realistically. Final Fantasy X was the first game that allowed for 3-D model rendering of backgrounds that increased the presentation, including small details like grass blowing in the wind and cloud movement. Takayoshi Nakazato decided to abandon the typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction. Final Fantasy Xs spatial presentation of Spira is tied to progression; with a player's progress being marked through the panoramic introduction and depiction of the area upon first entry. Chiharu Minekawa, the supervising sound editor, commented that the transition in sound from one environment to the next was done seamlessly in order to mimic the natural surroundings of these environments as the player moved through them.|$|E

500|$|There were {{significant}} privacy {{concerns about the}} database. The Foundation for Information Policy Research produced a report in November 2006, Children’s Databases – Privacy and Safety, saying the database guidelines ignored family values and privacy, and that <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>on</b> the database needs to be 'looked at carefully'.

Terri Dowty, one of the report's authors, replied, 'it's an appalling aspersion to throw {{at some of the}} leading academics in this field. I'm astonished they are challenging the evidence we used since much of the evidence in the report is from the Government itself.' Action on Rights for Children said that the proposals invaded a child's right to privacy given by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, while the Joint Committee on Human Rights said that the 'serious interference' with the rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – the right to respect for private life – seemed to be 'difficult to justify'. Liberty, a civil liberties interest group, said governments should not interfere with family life, warning against complacency 'about the importance of privacy in a free society'.
