40|$|Southern blot {{hybridization}} {{with the}} Ca 3 probe and the C fragment of the Ca 3 probe {{was used to}} assess the genetic relatedness of Candida albicans strains from one patient with recurrent C. albicans infection in whom the same strain was maintained, one patient in whom <b>the</b> <b>infecting</b> strain was replaced, and their male sexual partners. In the patient in whom <b>the</b> <b>infecting</b> strain was maintained, <b>the</b> <b>infecting</b> strain exhibited a minor genetic change in each successive episode of Candida vaginitis. These genetic changes occurred in the C-fragment bands of the Ca 3 hybridization pattern. In the patient in whom <b>the</b> <b>infecting</b> strain was replaced by another infecting strain, a transition infection involved a genetically mixed <b>infecting</b> population, and <b>the</b> replacement strain appeared to have originated from the oral cavity of the male partner. The results demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>infecting</b> strains of recurrent Candida vaginitis are not genetically stable, that drug treatment can result in the selection of variants of <b>the</b> previously <b>infecting</b> strain or replacement by a genetically unrelated strain, and that the male partner can be the source of a replacement strain.

40|$|Cure {{of female}} cattle with venereal {{vibriosis}} by systemic immunization with killed Campylobacter fetus cells in incomplete Freund adjuvant was investigated. Heifers <b>infected</b> in <b>the</b> cervicovaginal {{area with a}} cloned population of C. fetus venerealis were vaccinated subcutaneously 14 and 24 days thereafter with <b>the</b> <b>infecting</b> strain in incomplete Freund adjuvant. Six of eight vaccinated heifers were free of infection 25 to 48 days postinfection. One of the cured animals had an intercurrent infection which precluded interpretation of a vaccine effect. All controls remained infected 48 to 51 days postinfection, when the experiment was terminated. In vaccinated animals, agglutination titers against whole cells of <b>the</b> <b>infecting</b> strain reached peaks varying from 1, 280 to 20, 480 in serum and from 20 to 5, 120 in cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) within days 24 to 32 postinfection. No consistent relationship was noted between levels of whole cell antibodies in serum and those in CVM. Evidence for the occurrence of antigenic variation in the organism after vaccination was sought by comparing the agglutinability of <b>the</b> <b>infecting</b> strain and CVM isolates in serum and CVM extracts. Serum samples of most cured heifers agglutinated whole cells prepared from isolates of the respective heifers {{to the same extent}} as cells of <b>the</b> <b>infecting</b> strain.

Due {{to the lack of}} artificial light sources in the game's world, the team was forced to work with natural light. To achieve high quality lighting, they used lightmaps. The use of lightmaps led to various problems, such as the discontinuities in the lighting; this was fixed by slightly modifying the texel intensities. When characters were added to scenes, they initially looked out of place; the addition of a shadow generally fixed this.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>The</b> <b>INFECT</b> project aims {{to advance}} our {{understanding}} of the pathophysiological mechanisms in necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). <b>The</b> <b>INFECT</b> observational study is part of <b>the</b> <b>INFECT</b> project with <b>the</b> aim of studying the clinical profile of patients with NSTIs and correlating these to patient-important outcomes. With this protocol and statistical analysis plan we describe the methods used to obtain data and the details of the planned analyses. Methods: <b>The</b> <b>INFECT</b> study is a multicentre, prospective observational cohort study. Patients with NSTIs are enrolled in five Scandinavian hospitals, which are all referral centres for NSTIs. The primary outcomes are the descriptive variables of the patients. Secondary outcomes include identification of factors associated with 90 -day mortality and amputation; associations between affected body part, maximum skin defect and Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score and 90 -day mortality; 90 -day mortality in patients with and without acute kidney injury (AKI) and LRINEC score of six and above or below six; and association between affected body part at arrival and microbiological findings. Exploratory outcomes include univariate analyses of baseline characteristics associations with 90 -day mortality. The statistical analyses will be conducted in accordance with the predefined statistical analysis plan. Conclusion: Necrotizing soft tissue infections result in severe morbidity and mortality. <b>The</b> <b>INFECT</b> study will be the largest prospective study in patients with NSTIs to date and will provide important data for clinicians, researchers and policy makers on the characteristics and outcomes of these patients. </p...|$|R
