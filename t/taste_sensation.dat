25|$|The {{facial nerve}} {{controls}} {{a number of}} functions, such as blinking and closing the eyes, smiling, frowning, lacrimation, salivation, flaring nostrils and raising eyebrows. It also carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, via the chorda tympani nerve (a branch of the facial nerve). Because of this, people with Bell's palsy may present with loss of <b>taste</b> <b>sensation</b> in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue on the affected side.|$|E
25|$|As {{with nearly}} all {{anesthetic}} drugs, thiopental causes cardiovascular and respiratory depression resulting in hypotension, apnea and airway obstruction. For these reasons, only suitably trained medical personnel should give thiopental {{in an environment}} suitably {{equipped to deal with}} these effects. Side effects include headache, agitated emergence, prolonged somnolence, and nausea. Intravenous administration of sodium thiopental is followed instantly by an odor and/or <b>taste</b> <b>sensation,</b> sometimes described as being similar to rotting onions, or to garlic. The hangover from the side effects may last up to 36 hours.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{the sense}} of taste is {{conveyed}} via three of the twelve cranial nerves. The chorda tympani is responsible for <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> from the anterior {{two thirds of the}} tongue, the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) is responsible for <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the vagus nerve (X) carries some <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> {{from the back of the}} oral cavity.|$|R
2500|$|The tongue {{can also}} feel other sensations not {{generally}} {{included in the}} basic tastes. These are largely detected by the somatosensory system.

25|$|The ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular {{branches}} {{leave the}} skull through three separate foramina: the superior orbital fissure, the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale, respectively. The ophthalmic nerve (V1) carries sensory {{information from the}} scalp and forehead, the upper eyelid, the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the nose (including {{the tip of the}} nose, except alae nasi), the nasal mucosa, the frontal sinuses and parts of the meninges (the dura and blood vessels). The maxillary nerve (V2) carries sensory information from the lower eyelid and cheek, the nares and upper lip, the upper teeth and gums, the nasal mucosa, the palate and roof of the pharynx, the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve (V3) carries sensory information from the lower lip, the lower teeth and gums, the chin and jaw (except the angle of the jaw, which is supplied by C2-C3), parts of the external ear and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve carries touch-position and pain-temperature sensations from the mouth. Although it does not carry <b>taste</b> <b>sensation</b> (the chorda tympani is responsible for taste), one of its branches—the lingual nerve—carries sensation from the tongue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} drug-related dysgeusia {{can often be}} {{reversed}} by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication. In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from hypertension was being treated with valsartan. Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of eprosartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication. When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned. In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed amlodipine in order to treat his hypertension. After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of <b>taste</b> <b>sensation</b> and numbness in his tongue. When {{he ran out of}} his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine. Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his <b>taste</b> <b>sensation.</b> Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred. These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the [...] "de-challenge" [...] and [...] "re-challenge" [...] that took place in both instances. It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Each papilla in an {{enlarged}} {{photograph of the}} tip of the tongue was identified electrically as belonging to one of the four basic <b>taste</b> <b>sensations.</b> The temperature coefficient of the threshold for electrical stimulation was observed for single papillae. The results seem to divide the four basic <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> into two different groups: sour-salty and sweet-bitter. This is the same division that has been reported with other methods. METHODS OF DETERMINING THE TASTE THRESHOLD Investigating the threshold for chemical stimulation of the tongue, we found that threshold observation for chemical <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> is more difficult than analogous measurements for hearing and the vibratory senses. The main difficulty is the adaptation of <b>taste</b> <b>sensations.</b> The smallest chemical stimulus presented to the tongue immediately raises the threshold (Bdkdsy, 1965), {{and it is difficult to}} follow this rise. Adaptation depends on concentration, presentation time, temperature, etc. The threshold observations become unreliable, mainly because of the difficulty of making sure that it is always exactly the same group of papillae that is being stimulated.

50|$|A single {{taste bud}} is {{composed}} of four different types of cells, and each taste bud has at least 30 to 80 cells. Type I cells are thinly shaped, usually in the periphery of other cells. They also contain high amounts of chromatin. Type II cells have prominent nuclei and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple mitochondria and large vesicles. Type I, II, and III cells also contain synapses. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the taste bud. Every cell in the taste bud forms microvilli at the ends. In humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve cranial nerves. The chorda tympani is responsible for <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> from the anterior {{two thirds of the}} tongue, the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) is responsible for <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the vagus nerve (X) carries some <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> {{from the back of the}} oral cavity.|$|R

50|$|The nerves {{supplying}} the palatine tonsils {{come from the}} maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve via the lesser palatine nerves, and from the tonsillar branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve continues past the palatine tonsil and innervates the posterior 1/3 of the tongue to provide general and <b>taste</b> <b>sensation.</b> This nerve {{is most likely to}} be damaged during a tonsillectomy, which leads to reduced or lost general sensation and <b>taste</b> <b>sensation</b> to the posterior third of the tongue.|$|E
50|$|Taste {{helps to}} {{identify}} toxins and maintain nutrition. Five basic tastes are recognized today: salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami. Salty and sour <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> are both detected through ion channels. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastes, however, are detected {{by way of}} G protein-coupled taste receptors.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of neglect and/or extinction in taste is less explored than olfaction, {{even though in}} humans the ability to localize taste stimuli presented on the tongue has been previously described. In {{the case of a}} patient with a wide parietal-occipital tumor, tactile extinction on the upper limbs and extinction of <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> on the left part of the tongue where seen when two tastes were presented simultaneously on each hemitongue. The results of the assessment revealed there is unimodal taste extinction and displacement of <b>taste</b> <b>sensations</b> under crossmodal taste-tactile stimulation. In particular, when a touch was delivered to the right hemi-tongue and a taste was applied on the left hemi-tongue, the patient repeatedly reported bilateral taste stimulation, thus surprisingly extinguishing the right touch and partially misplacing the left taste stimulus. Gustatory extinction also seems to occur consequently to a severe tactile extinction.|$|R
