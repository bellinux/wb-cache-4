The results show that, the viscosity and <b>tack</b> <b>of</b> ink are both decrease {{with the amount of}} varnish and viscosity reducer increase. But varnish has a little effect on tack. Adding different proportion of varnish, ink-transferring ratio will reach best when the proportion of varnish is 2 %. when addition more than 4 %,the ink-transferring ratio will decrease instead. Adding different proportions of viscosity reducer, ink-transferring ratio will reach best when the proportion of viscosity reducer is 4 %. When the amount of viscosity reducer more than 6 %,the ink-transferring ratio will reduce instead...|$|R
