5|$|Initially, coach Simpson was not informed; when {{he found}} out, he was angry that the ACB had not trusted him enough <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> his players had done. Captain Mark Taylor was also aware of the issue {{by the time he}} took the team to the West Indies, as were vice-captain Ian Healy and Waugh's brother Steve.|$|E
5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was now {{seen to be}} intrusive. Unlike most women of the time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
5|$|Kadaj confronts Rufus Shinra, who reveals he {{possesses}} the box containing Jenova's remains. He attempts to destroy it, but Kadaj manages {{to save it}} and flees the city with his companions. Yazoo and Loz are apparently destroyed along the way by an explosive planted by Shinra's agents. Cloud chases Kadaj down and engages him in battle, ultimately subduing him. Outmatched, Kadaj opens Jenova's box and fuses with its contents, transforming into Sephiroth. He then tells Cloud {{that he will be}} able to use the life essences of Geostigma sufferers to achieve complete domination over the planet. He and Cloud then fight, and throughout the whole encounter, Sephiroth appears to have the upper hand, flinging Cloud repeatedly into walls and finally impaling him through the shoulder. He asks Cloud <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> he most cherishes so that he can have the pleasure of taking it away. To this, Cloud replies that he cherishes everything, then pulls out Sephiroth's sword and deals him a hail of devastating blows. Sephiroth's spirit departs, leaving behind the mortally wounded Kadaj. As he lies dying in Cloud's arms, a healing rain starts falling across the land, curing the people of their Geostigma. Yazoo and Loz appear and confront Cloud; he charges at them, and they set off a massive explosion engulfing the three.|$|E

Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend.

25|$|Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl, a mestizo {{historian}} and descendant of Coanacoch, wrote {{an account of}} the executions in the 17th century partly based on Texcocan oral tradition. According to Ixtlilxóchitl, the three lords were joking cheerfully with one another because of a rumor that Cortés had decided to return the expedition to Mexico, when Cortés asked a spy <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> they were talking about. The spy reported honestly, but Cortés invented the plot himself. Cuauhtémoc, Coanacoch, and Tetlepanquetzal were hanged as well as eight others. However, Cortés cut down Coanacoch, the last to be hanged, after his brother began rallying his warriors. Coanacoch did not have long to enjoy his reprieve, as Ixtlilxóchitl wrote that he died a few days later.|$|E
500|$|In the Poetic Edda poem Vafþrúðnismál, the god Odin, {{disguised}} as [...] "Gagnráðr" [...] faces {{off with the}} wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir in a battle of wits. Among numerous other questions, Vafþrúðnir asks Odin <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> {{the name of the}} plain is where the gods and Surtr will meet.

500|$|According to Suetonius, {{a number}} of omens had foretold Domitian's death. Several days prior to the assassination, Minerva had {{appeared}} to the emperor in a dream. [...] She announced {{that she had been}} disarmed by Jupiter and could no longer give Domitian her protection. [...] According to an auspice he had received, the Emperor believed that his death would be at midday. [...] As a result, he was always restless around that time. On the day of the assassination, Domitian was distressed and repeatedly asked a servant <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> time it was. The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon. Apparently put at ease, the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees.

500|$|The British {{followed}} in rapid pursuit. [...] As they advanced, the British light troops signalled with bugle calls, which to Colonel Joseph Reed were {{reminiscent of a}} fox hunt, and seemed to him to be intended as an insult. [...] Probably about this time, the Second and Third battalions of British light infantry, along with the 42nd Highlanders were ordered up as reinforcements. Reed, who had met Knowlton, rode to Washington <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> {{was going on and}} encouraged him to reinforce the rangers. Instead of retreating, Washington, in what Edward G. Lengel calls [...] "an early glimmer of the courage and resolve that would rally the Continentals from many a tight spot later on", [...] devised a plan to entrap the British light troops. Washington would have some troops make a feint, in order to draw the British down into an area of open ground known as 'The Hollow Way', and then send a detachment of troops around to trap the British.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to another}} tradition, the devil {{appeared}} to Cain and instructed {{him how to}} exact revenge on Abel. [...] "Hit Abel's head with a stone and kill him", whispered the devil to Cain. After the murder, the devil hurried to Eve shouting: [...] "Eve! Cain has murdered Abel!". Eve {{did not know what}} murder was or how death felt like. She asked, bewildered and horrified, [...] "Woe to you! What is murder?". [...] "He [...] does not eat. He does not drink. He does not move [...] ", answered the Devil. Eve burst out into tears and started to wail madly. She ran to Adam and tried <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> happened. However, she could not speak because she could not stop wailing. Since then, women wail brokenheartedly when a loved one dies. A different tradition narrates that while Cain was quarreling with Abel, the devil killed an animal with a stone in Cain's sight to show him how to murder Abel.|$|E
2500|$|By 1915 the {{cultural}} {{changes and the}} economic effects of the war finally took its toll on Camera Work. The number of subscribers dwindled to just thirty-seven, and both the costs and even {{the availability of the}} paper on which it was printed became challenging. Coupled with the public’s decreased interest in pictorial photography, these problems simply became too much for Stieglitz to bear. He published issue 47 in January, 1915, and devoted most of it what Steichen referred to as a [...] "project in self-adulation". Three years earlier Stieglitz had asked many of his friends <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> his gallery [...] "291" [...] meant to them. He received sixty-eight replies and printed all of them, unedited (including Steichen’s previously mentioned opinion), in issue 47. As another sign of the changing times, only four of the comments came from photographers – all of the rest were from painters, illustrators and art critics. It was the only issue that did not include an illustration of any kind.|$|E
