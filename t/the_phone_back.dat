50|$|This phone has a known LCD screen defect {{that causes}} the screen to cease functioning. T-Mobile was aware of this and only {{temporarily}} halted sales before putting <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> on the market, regardless of the problem never being fixed. Upon further investigation, it appears as though the connector to the LCD becomes worn down and the protective layer breaks due to friction from operation of the slider.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{devices have}} {{an issue that}} causes <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> <b>back</b> panel to come off. The issue {{may be due to}} the glue used for the back panel or the {{expanding}} battery pack that could be a fire hazard. Motorola is offering replacements for affected devices.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>phone</b> was {{withdrawn}} from sale in November 2009 by two major British retailers due to complaints from customers. However, {{the problem was}} found only in UK editions of <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and was probably caused by carrier-specific customizations. The following software update released by Sony Ericsson provided a fix and <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> was <b>back</b> for sale at those two retailers.|$|R
50|$|New {{software}} {{is transferred to}} <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> installed, and put into use. It is often necessary to turn <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> off and <b>back</b> on for the new programming to take effect, though many phones will automatically perform this action.|$|R
50|$|On 16 August 2007 {{the show}} {{finished}} prematurely after <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> lines went down, requiring hosts Mills and Garonzi to stall the contest and fill-in for 30 minutes. As they couldn't get <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> lines <b>back</b> up in time, the last 30 {{minutes of the}} show's schedule {{was replaced by a}} repeat of Keynotes, a short lived game show that aired on Nine in the summer of 1992.|$|R
50|$|Steve Moneghetti (Mona) devised {{this session}} with his coach Chris Wardlaw over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> in 1983 {{when he was}} just 20. He wanted a solid fartlek session, one that would help improve his speed as well as {{endurance}} and stimulate an ability to change pace mid-run, something that helped later on his career when tackling the Africans, who had a habit of surging mid-race. A session would consist of: 2×90sec, 4×60sec, 4×30sec, 4×15sec with a slower tempo recovery of the same time between each repetition. The session takes 20 minutes in total.|$|E
50|$|At his job, Sid {{asks his}} boss for his paycheck in advance but the boss refuses. Seeing as €30 {{will be the}} only money he is able to raise, Sid goes to a dinky shop run by Patrick Vo. After some haggling, Sid gets a cellphone, a sleek red phone with two {{protruding}} horns at the top. The phone comes to life in his hands, which astonishes the shopkeeper who has been trying to turn it on ever since he got it. He tries to take <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> so he can sell it for more money, but Sid runs away.|$|E
50|$|Connor sees Wong on {{the news}} and recognizes him as Esther's murderer. Bennie learns that Samantha is already taken by Wong's {{right-hand}} man, Willie, and his men, threatening to kill her if Bennie refuses to bring <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> to Hong Kong. Connor parts ways with Bennie, giving him evidence {{that could lead to}} Wong's arrest. Reaching Hong Kong, unfortunately the plan doesn't go well when the phone denies access to Wong's thumbprint, meaning that Wong is not Matador at all. Bennie is detained but he later escapes with Connor's help and follows a clue to the whereabouts of Samantha.|$|E

50|$|Gwen and Jack {{go to the}} Roberts' {{household}} {{to investigate}} and are met by a distraught Jan. While she attends to a phone call, Gwen and Jack examine the telephone used by Bob the previous night. Jack notes the vintage appearance of the phone while Gwen's scans reveal that there are faint signs of residual Rift energy.

50|$|One day, when Geena {{is walking}} along the road, Jay and his brother happen to be {{managing}} some poles. One of the poles nearly falls on Geena, but Jay lunges at her and pushes {{her out of the}} way before it can crush her. Geena, disgusted at this, hurries along, leaving her phone behind. Jay sees the phone and takes it, but his brother Dean repossesses it. Jay then takes <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> and gives it to Geena, who then thanks him for saving her life. She then gives him her phone number, and they begin to meet up regularly.|$|E
50|$|AT&T also {{strictly}} enforced policies {{against using}} telephone equipment by other manufacturers on their network. A customer {{who insisted on}} using a telephone not supplied by the Bell System had to first transfer the phone to the local Bell operating company, who leased <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> to the customer for a monthly charge {{in addition to a}} re-wiring fee. In the 1970s when consumers increasingly bought telephone sets from other manufacturers, AT&T changed the policy for its Design Line telephone series by selling customers the phone housing, retaining ownership of the internal mechanical and electrical components, which still required paying AT&T a monthly leasing fee.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this design project is to design a system for {{silencing}} cellular <b>phones</b> within <b>the</b> physical vicinity of the device. This system shall be constructed in two parts: a client to be run on <b>the</b> cellular <b>phone</b> and a device to activate/deactivate the client within a given proximity. The client shall be responsible for controlling the ringer of <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> <b>The</b> connection between <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and base device shall be via Bluetooth ™ technology. The device shall be designed {{to be placed in}} an entrance/exit. The first pass through shall cause the client to deactivate the ringer of <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> <b>The</b> second pass through shall cause the client to return <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> settings <b>back</b> to their previous state. This project was determined to be feasible from the standpoint of both hardware and software design...|$|R
50|$|A witness {{called police}} at 15:34 {{to report a}} person in a police uniform holding a pistol in his hand, {{entering}} an unmarked vehicle. Information—including the vehicle's license plate number and description of the suspect—was written on a yellow note, and hand delivered to the police operations central where it lay for twenty minutes before <b>the</b> witness was <b>phoned</b> <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> license plate number was not transmitted on the police radio until two hours later.|$|R

What the row had been about he didn't say, but {{apparently}} she was pretty well fed up. She wouldn't let him come near her, refused to talk on <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and sent <b>back</b> his letters unopened.|$|R
5000|$|The third-generation Moto G has a 5-inch display with HD {{resolution}} of 1280x720p and features Corning Gorilla Glass 3, a 13-megapixel camera {{similar to the}} one from the Nexus 6 with many features including HDR imaging and an on-screen exposure setting option, a quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor, and the latest version of Android, 6.0.1 [...] "Marshmallow". <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> is removable, and made of textured plastic. The back also comes in multiple colors available in Motorola's Moto Maker website. The Moto G 3rd-generation is water resistant through the use of nano-coating and internal rubber gaskets, giving it an IPX7 rating. This water resistance gives the phone the ability to be submerged in up to one meter (or about three feet) of water for 30 minutes at a time with the back cover secured correctly. The low-end model comes with 8GB of storage and 1GB of RAM, while the high-end model comes with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. This phone also features a 2470 mAh Li-ion non-removable battery. Both models support LTE.|$|E
5000|$|The hooded figure reveals {{himself to}} be Peter who, with the {{assistance}} of his siblings, staged all the terrifying events to frighten Fanny into running away and giving them freedom to participate in their pre-planned activities. As the [...] "murdered" [...] Sharon rises from the couch, Peter explains, [...] "she tried to kill me" [...] and the returned Jimmy adds, [...] "she did that to herself — she tried to stab Peter with that knife", while Peter tells him to switch the lights and <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> on and, upon checking Fanny's body, states, [...] "she's dead". Nancy exclaims, [...] "we killed her!" [...] as Peter protests, [...] "I just pushed her away". As they start to discuss what story would be most believable to tell the police, the phone rings. Peter picks up and hears an ominous voice, [...] "the sentence is death… on Judge Coogan's children… and the execution is tonight". In front of the house, The Atoner is seen standing with his cruciform staff, which now appears to loom at least twelve feet high. The lights in the house are suddenly extinguished and Peter's voice is heard emitting a piercing scream.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Goodies" [...] was {{directed}} by Benny Boom. It shows Ciara and her friends driving in an Oldsmobile 442 convertible along the Atlanta, Georgia streets to the local car wash. It features cameo appearances by BoneCrusher, Monica, Rasheeda, Jazze Pha, Young Jeezy, Lil Jon and among others. Ciara filmed the video for 27 straight hours with director Benny Boom. It begins with Ciara coming out her house. Her friend screams out, [...] "What up dawg?!" [...] and Ciara replies the same way. Ciara's sister then runs outside saying that Jazze Pha is on the phone. Jazze tells Ciara {{that they are going}} to the carwash to hang out and Ciara says she will also be coming along. She then gives <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> to her sister and tells her to stay out of her room. The song then begins and Ciara starts singing her intro once Petey Pablo raps his verse. During this intro, we see Ciara going along with her friends driving to the carwash. On her way there she meets a few young men and invites them to the carwash. She then arrives to the carwash and meets up with different people, including Monica. During the song, Ciara dances in front of a blue and white background with her backup dancers. This scene is where Ciara first does the [...] "Matrix," [...] her signature move. The extended version of the video includes Ciara full-length dance with the backup dancers, and also features more of her and Monica duo shot.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} One X, the Evo 4G LTE {{utilizes}} three capacitive keys {{on the front}} of <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> for <b>the</b> <b>Back,</b> Home, and Recent Apps functions, along with a power button and volume rocker. Unlike the One X, the Evo 4G LTE also features a camera button.

Rob orders her to call the police, which she does. As she collapses, she sees the body of Julie Rose. Mr. Murray arrives and rips the handset out of <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> taking her <b>back</b> downstairs to Dr. Lewis.|$|R
5000|$|For me, music {{comes at}} all times of the day. When I get a riff, {{sometimes}} its a complete riff and I can just play it and there it is, sometimes its half a riff and I have to tweak it. Sometimes its just a rhythm or a note selection. Or sometimes its just something that I hum in my head. But it can come from anywhere, and I {{put it on my}} phone, and I make sure <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> is f***ing <b>backed</b> up.|$|R
5000|$|A drama {{version of}} the music video, which {{excludes}} the intercut sequences of choreographed dancing, was released on May 15, 2009. The video opens with a scene of a girl returning her ring to Kibum. A loud heart beat sounds when Kibum painfully walks away with the ring in his hand. Kibum passes by Han Geng, who somberly {{looks down at his}} phone. He whispers [...] "It's you, it's you, it's only you for me, it's you" [...] in Korean and walks away. Donghae appears behind him and walks down the street, followed by Kyuhyun who walks after him. Kyuhyun walks past a car parked in a street intersection, and Yesung walks out of the street. Leeteuk appears behind Yesung, playing with a necklace. As he walks {{toward the end of the}} street, Siwon hesitantly walks toward a phone booth. Ryeowook rushes past him holding a bouquet of flowers. As he smells the flowers, he whips past Kang-in who is sitting down at a table angrily reading a letter. Kyuhyun appears again and quickly unbuttons his jacket, checking the time on his watch. He walks by Eunhyuk, who is spraying graffiti on the wall with the words [...] "Only 4 U." [...] Kang-in walks into a coffee shop and passes by Sungmin who is writing a letter. Shindong walks out of the coffee shop, passing by Ryeowook who has been waiting in front of the shop. Ryeowook angrily throws down his bouquet of flowers, looks at his watch, and walks away. He passes by Han Geng, who is emotionally talking through his phone. Han Geng walks past Yesung and Eunhyuk doing a handshake in an alleyway, and Yesung walks past Sungmin, who is now mailing his letter. Kyuhyun quickly walks past Sungmin and passes by Heechul in the middle of the street, who is sitting on his motorcycle and taking off his helmet. The rest of the Super Junior members appear walking by Heechul, and Siwon is now shouting through the phone. He slams <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> and hits the phone booth. Donghae angrily walks by and steps back as the camera pans toward the rest of the Super Junior members standing behind Heechul. As Heechul whispers the same words Han Geng whispered in the beginning of the video, Kibum holds his ring to his heart and the rest of the members follow while stand at the end of the video.|$|E
40|$|In {{an episode}} in the second season of Felicity (the {{breakthrough}} television series that would launch creator J. J. Abrams to the successes of Alias, Lost, and M:i:III) {{one of the characters}} acquires a video game, much to the derision of his college friends. Noel's attempt to complete the game's quest becomes an amusing subplot in an otherwise serious episode. Eventually, his flatmate Elena joins the game, believing her "superior intellect" will overcome a mere "game. " It is interesting watching these two, ostensibly the most intelligent characters in the show, become obsessed over a period of days. They stop going to class, don't sleep, barely eat, and ignore their friends. They make desperate telephone calls to unknown contacts for help, engaging in conversations that make them sound like junkies looking for a fix. They finally get the number of someone who can help them, but when the directions fail. Noel screams at the person on the phone. Bewildered, he hands <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>back</b> to Elena, contemptuously exclaiming, "He's crying!" to which she replies, "Well, he's seven years old!" The game is packed up and put away ("Crash," 2 - 5) ...|$|E
50|$|On the Wednesday before <b>the</b> concert, Wonder <b>phoned</b> <b>back,</b> {{asking whether}} there was still space for him. Hollingsworth told him there was a 25-minute slot - time that had {{originally}} been kept open for Prince and Bono to sing a duet together but which the two singers turned down. Wonder agreed the booking. This was never announced but {{was to be a}} surprise for the audience. In the event, the singer caused a major backstage drama when the equipment used to play his pre-recorded music was lost. He refused to play {{and walked out of the}} stadium - though he returned later using Whitney Houston's instruments.|$|R

Additionally it could record AAC audio directly from its internal FM radio, or through its built-in 2.5 mm (3/32") audio jack to another format with the extension [...]rel which only <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> could play <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> music player on <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> also has a built-in equalizer with several pre-sets to fine-tune the music being played.|$|R
2500|$|The same day, Apple {{revealed}} {{that it had}} discussed with the FBI four methods to access data in the iPhone in early January, {{but one of the}} more promising methods was ruled out by a mistake during the investigation of the attack. After <b>the</b> shooter's <b>phone</b> had been recovered, the FBI asked San Bernardino County, the owner of <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> to reset <b>the</b> password to the shooter's iCloud account in order to acquire data from the iCloud backup. However, this rendered <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> unable to <b>back</b> up recent data to iCloud unless its pass-code is entered.
