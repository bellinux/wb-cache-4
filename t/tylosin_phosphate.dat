40|$|<b>Tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> is a {{macrolide}} commonly {{administered to}} cattle in North America {{for the control}} of liver abscesses. This study investigated the effect of in-feed administration of <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> to cattle at subtherapeutic levels and its subsequent withdrawal on macrolide resistance using enterococci as an indicator bacterium. Faecal samples were collected from steers that received no antibiotics and steers administered <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> (11 ppm) in-feed for 197 d and withdrawn 28 d before slaughter. Enterococcus species isolated from faecal samples were identified through sequencing the groES-EL intergenic spacer region and subject to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, identification of resistance determinants and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiling. Tylosin increased (P 0. 05) between treatments on d 225. This suggests that antibiotic withdrawal prior to slaughter contributes {{to a reduction in}} the proportion of macrolide resistant enterococci entering the food chain. Among the 504 enterococci isolates characterised, E. hirae was found to predominate (n= 431), followed by E. villorum (n= 32), E. faecium (n= 21), E. durans (n= 7), E. casseliflavus (n= 4), E. mundtii (n= 4), E. gallinarum (n= 3), E. faecalis (n= 1), and E. thailandicus (n= 1). The diversity of enterococci was greater in steers at arrival than at exit from the feedlot. Erythromycin resistant isolates harboured the erm(B) and/or msrC gene. Similar PFGE profiles of eryR E. hirae n pre- and post-antibiotic treatment suggests the increased abundance of eryR enterococci after administration of <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> reflects selection for strains that were within the bovine gastrointestinal tract of cattle at arrival...|$|E
40|$|Three {{hundred and}} eighty-four pigs, mean initial live weight of 20. 8 kg, were {{assigned}} randomly {{to groups of}} 24 (12 females, 12 castrated males). Each group was randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments consisting of the same commercial barley-based diet, {{with or without the}} addition of <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The barn where the animals were housed operates as an all-in all-out facility, and all pigs arrived on the same day as {{part of a group of}} 960 pigs. No new pigs were introduced into the facility during the period of this trial and pigs were sent to market over a 4 -week period upon achieving a live weight of 110 kg. The pigs were weighed at the beginning of the trial and when they left the facility for slaughter. Feed consumption and incidence of disease, mortality, or both were recorded daily. At slaughter, carcass backfat depth over the last rib, 6. 5 cm ventral to the dorsal midline (P- 2 site); loin depth; carcass weight; predicted lean yield; and grade index were recorded. The sow herd supplying pigs to the unit was known to be free of the major swine diseases such as swine influenza, mycoplasma pneumonia, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), necroproliferative enteritis, and ascarids. A strict biosecurity protocol was employed to minimize the risk of introducing disease organisms into the unit. Prior to this study, no subtherapeutic antibiotics had been used in this facility. <b>Tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> supplementation had no significant effect on final weight, days on test, total gain, and daily gain. In both treatments, the pigs reached a mean market weight of 110. 2 kg within 94. 1 days, resulting in daily gains of the order of 950 grams per day. Due to the design of the trial, it was difficult to measure significant feed consumption effects. Feed consumption and conversion appeared to be similar for pigs in both treatment groups. At slaughter, <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> supplementation appeared to significantly increase lean muscle content of the carcass as measured by loin muscle depth (P = 0. 04). Mortality rates and the number of underweight pigs sent to market were low for this trial. Mortality was similar for both treatments; however, more of the control pigs than of the <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> fed pigs were underweight when sent to market. From the results of this study, it appears that pigs of fast growing genotypes fed adequate diets and housed in a biosecure environment do not require dietary <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> supplementation in order to maximize growth. There is some indication that <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> supplementation may improve lean content of the carcass in pigs housed in such an environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{was to investigate the}} manipulation and regulation of post-weaning growth in the pig. Specific objectives, as reflected in the individual chapters of this thesis, were to investigate the basis for differences in post-weaning growth rate and the modification of growth achieved through the use of two feed additives: <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> (TP) and ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC). In the first experiment, 18 cannulated barrows (initial BW = 32. 6 ± 1. 2 kg) were utilized to evaluate the impact of TP on energy and nutrient digestibility in growing pigs fed corn-soybean meal or corn-soybean meal-distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) based diets. Results of this study indicated that the ileal digestibility of all indispensible AA, except leucine, and the apparent total tract digestibility of energy and fiber was lower (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in corn-soybean meal-DDGS-based diets than in corn-soybean meal-based diets. <b>Tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> did not affect digestibility of AA or digestibility and gastrointestinal tract flow of energy (P 3 ̆e 0. 10). A second experiment was conducted to determine if a higher fiber diet alters the response of finishing pigs to TP and RAC in terms of N and water utilization and energy digestibility using 72 gilts (initial BW = 107. 4 ± 4. 2 kg) housed in individual metabolism pens. Ractopamine HCl improved ADG (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001), feed efficiency (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001), and N retention (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and tended to increase daily water intake (P 3 ̆c 0. 10), and the response to RAC was similar in both corn-soybean meal based and corn-soybean meal-DDGS based diets. <b>Tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> tended to increase ADG in pigs fed corn-soybean meal based diets (P 3 ̆c 0. 10), but not in diets containing 30...|$|E
40|$|Macrolides are the {{first-line}} treatment against bovine respiratory disease, and {{are also}} used to treat infections in humans. The macrolide, <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate,</b> is often included in the diet of cattle as a preventative for liver abscesses in many {{regions of the world}} outside of Europe. This study investigated the effects of administering macrolides to beef cattle either systemically through a single subcutaneous injection (therapeutic) or continuously in-feed (subtherapeutic), on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Mannheimia haemolytica and Enterococcus spp. isolated from the nasopharynx and faeces, respectively. Nasopharyngeal and faecal samples were collected weekly over 28 days from untreated beef steers and from steers injected once with tilmicosin or tulathromycin or continuously fed <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> at dosages recommended by manufacturers. Tilmicosin and tulathromycin were effective in lowering (P < 0. 05) the prevalence of M. haemolytica, whereas subtherpeutic tylosin had no effect. M. haemolytica isolated from control- and macrolide-treated animals were susceptible to macrolides as well as to other antibiotics. Major bacteria co-isolated with M. haemolytica included Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus spp., Acinetobacter spp., E. coli and Bacillus spp. With the exception of M. haemolytica and P. multocida, erythromycin resistance was frequently found in other isolated species. Both methods of macrolide administration increased (P < 0. 05) the levels erythromycin-resistance enterococci in faeces. Development of resistance to injectable macrolides in bacteria isolated from the nasopharynx was species dependent. Therapeutic administration of tilmicosin and tularthromycin selected for macrolide resistant bacteria within both the respiratory and intestinal tract, whereas suptherapeutic administration of tylosin only selected for macrolide resistance in enteric bacteria...|$|E

The impact of dietary supplementation with <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> on small intestinal microbial profiles was investigated in growing pigs, and compared with the microbial profile of pigs fed flaxseed or its fractions. Eighteen ileal-cannulated barrows (33. 1 +/- 2. 4 kg) received either the control diet (C, wheat, peas and soybean meal), or C plus 22 mg/kg <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> (T), 20 % whole flaxseed (WF), 18 % hot-water extracted flaxseed (HWE), 4 % flaxseed hulls (H), or 8 % flaxseed oil (O) during three 21 -d periods in a change over design. Ileal digesta (100 mL) was collected on d 16 and 17 of each period. Two chaperonin- 60 universal target (cpn 60 UT) libraries were constructed from pooled ileal digesta DNA extracted from the C and T diets. A total of 1634 nucleotide sequences were determined, and 117 different cpn 60 UT sequences identified. Microbial diversity was greatest in the C library compared to T. Taxonomic composition between libraries differed, and included Lactobacillales (94 % of C and 86 % of T sequences), Enterobacteriaceae (3 % of C and 13 % of T), Clostridiales, Bacillales and Bifidobacterium taxa. T had a reduced ratio of Lactobacillales: Enterobacteriaceae sequences (6 : 1) compared to C (35 : 1). Lactobacilli: enterobacteria plate count ratios were highest in WF compared to C or T diets. Lactobacillus johnsonii genomes detected by qPCR were increased by 17. 2 and 12 %, in T and WF diets, respectively, compared to C. Numbers of L. amylovorus genomes were 25 % lower in the H diet compared to C. Numbers of Escherichia coli and Streptococcus alactolyticus genomes were unaffected by dietary treatment, despite differences in library clone frequency for these species. Increased L. johnsonii colonization with tylosin suggests possible probiotic properties of this bacterium. Only inclusion of whole flaxseed resulted in a similar increase in L. johnsonii. Overall, ileal microbial profiles of growing pigs were similar and remained mostly unaffected by dietary tylosin or flaxseed inclusion...|$|E
40|$|Necrotic {{enteritis}} (NE) is {{a worldwide}} poultry disease {{caused by the}} alpha toxin-producing bacterium Clostridium perfringens. Disease risk factors include concurrent coccidial infection and the dietary use of cereal grains high in nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), such as wheat, barley, rye, and oats. Outbreaks of NE can be prevented or treated {{by the use of}} in-feed antibiotics. However, the current debate regarding the prophylactic use of antibiotics in animal diets necessitates a better understanding of factors that influence intestinal colonization by C. perfringens as well as the pathophysiological consequences of its growth. We report a study with a chick model of NE, which used molecular (16 S rRNA gene [16 S rDNA]) and culture-based microbiological techniques to investigate the impact of the macrolide antibiotic <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> (100 ppm) and a dietary NSP (pectin) on the community structure of the small intestinal microbiota relative to colonization by C. perfringens. The effects of tylosin and pectin on mucolytic activity of the microbiota and C. perfringens colonization and their relationship to pathological indices of NE were of particular interest. The data demonstrate that tylosin reduced the percentage of mucolytic bacteria in general and the concentration of C. perfringens in particular, and these responses correlated in a temporal fashion with a reduction in the occurrence of NE lesions and an improvement in barrier function. The presence of pectin did not significantly affect the variables measured. Thus, it appears that tylosin can control NE through its modulation of C. perfringens colonization and the mucolytic activity of the intestinal microbiota...|$|E
40|$|Mannheimia haemolytica {{isolated}} from feedlot cattle were tested for tulathromycin resistance. Cattle were sampled {{over a three-year}} period, starting 12 months after approval of tulathromycin for prevention and treatment of bovine respiratory disease. Nasopharyngeal samples from approximately 5, 814 cattle were collected when cattle entered feedlots (N = 4) and again from the same cattle after ≥ 60 d on feed. The antimicrobial use history for each animal was recorded. Mannheimia haemolytica was {{isolated from}} 796 (13. 7 %) entry samples and 1, 038 (20. 6 %) ≥ 60 d samples. Of the cattle positive for M. haemolytica, 18. 5 %, 2. 9 %, and 2. 4 % were administered therapeutic concentrations of tulathromycin, tilmicosin, or tylosin tartrate, respectively. In addition, 13. 2 % were administered subtherapeutic concentrations of <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> in feed. In years one and two, no tulathromycin-resistant M. haemolytica were detected, whereas 5 isolates (0. 4 %) were resistant in year three. These resistant isolates were collected from three cattle originating from a single pen, were all serotype 1, and were genetically related (≥ 89 % similarity) according to pulsed-field gel electrophoreses patterns. The five tulathromycin-resistant isolates were multi-drug resistant also exhibiting resistance to oxytetracycline, tilmicosin, ampicillin, or penicillin. The macrolide resistance genes erm(42), erm(A), erm(B), erm(F), erm(X) and msr(E) -mph(E), were not detected in the tulathromycin-resistant M. haemolytica. This study showed that tulathromycin resistance in M. haemolytica from a general population of feedlot cattle in western Canada was low and did not change {{over a three-year period}} after tulathromycin was approved for use in cattle...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of antimicrobial agents {{on the development}} of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Campylobacter isolates recovered from 300 beef cattle maintained in an experimental feedlot was monitored over a 315 -day period (11 sample times). Groups of calves were assigned to one of the following antimicrobial treatments: chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine (CS), chlortetracycline alone (Ct), virginiamycin, monensin, <b>tylosin</b> <b>phosphate,</b> and no antimicrobial agent (i. e., control treatment). In total, 3, 283 fecal samples were processed for campylobacters {{over the course of the}} experiment. Of the 2, 052 bacterial isolates recovered, 92 % were Campylobacter (1, 518 were Campylobacter hyointestinalis and 380 were C. jejuni). None of the antimicrobial treatments decreased the isolation frequency of C. jejuni relative to the control treatment. In contrast, C. hyointestinalis was isolated less frequently from animals treated with CS and to a lesser extent from animals treated with Ct. The majority (≥ 94 %) of C. jejuni isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin, but more isolates with resistance to tetracycline were recovered from animals fed Ct. All of the 1, 500 isolates of C. hyointestinalis examined were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. In contrast, 11 %, 10 %, and 1 % of these isolates were resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, and ampicillin, respectively. The number of animals from which C. hyointestinalis isolates with resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline were recovered differed among the antimicrobial treatments. Only Ct administration increased the carriage rates of erythromycin-resistant isolates of C. hyointestinalis, and the inclusion of CS in the diet increased the number of animals from which tetracycline-resistant isolates were recovered. The majority of C. hyointestinalis isolates with resistance to tetracycline were obtained from cohorts within a single pen, and most of these isolates were recovered from cattle during feeding of a forage-based diet as opposed to a grain-based diet. The findings of this study show that the subtherapeutic administration of tetracycline, alone and in combination with sulfamethazine, to feedlot cattle can select for the carriage of resistant strains of Campylobacter species. Considering the widespread use of in-feed antimicrobial agents and the high frequency of beef cattle that shed campylobacters, the development of AMR should be monitored as part of an on-going surveillance program...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJames S. DrouillardSince the 1960 ’s liver abscess {{incidence}} and severity {{have been identified}} as a problem associated with feeding high concentrate finishing rations to feedlot cattle. Liver abscesses lead to decreased feedlot performance and decreased carcass value. <b>Tylosin</b> <b>phosphate</b> is a macrolide antibiotic commonly used by feedlots throughout the United States and has been shown to successfully control liver abscesses. In 2013, the FDA issued Guidance for Industry # 213, which encourages reduced usage of medically important classes of antibiotics, such as macrolides, in animal feed. This will be achieved by implementing veterinary oversight of these drugs via Veterinary Feed Directives (VFD). Thus, it is of importance to find alternative strategies to reduce usage of tylosin in finishing rations to control liver abscesses. One strategy that has been suggested is increasing dietary roughage concentration. However, this isn’t a viable option as increasing dietary roughage concentration not only leads to a decline in feedlot performance, hot carcass weight, and dressing percentage, but also has an environmental impact. Available research has also indicated that increasing dietary roughage has no impact on liver abscess incidence or severity. Our research objective was therefore to identify alternative strategies to reduce liver abscess incidence. Our first trial evaluated the impact of antioxidants on liver abscess {{incidence and}} severity. Treatments consisted of a control treatment (basal diet containing 200 IU/d α-tocopherol acetate), and an antioxidant treatment (basal diet containing 2000 IU/d α-tocopherol acetate and 500 mg/d crystalline ascorbate). Treatments were randomly assigned to 390 crossbred heifers. No differences in feedlot performance were detected; however, there was a tendency for improved feed intake (P = 0. 075) and feed efficiency (P = 0. 066) for heifers that received the antioxidant treatment. An increased number of yield grade 3 carcasses (P = 0. 03) and fewer yield grade 1 carcasses (P < 0. 01) was observed in the antioxidant treatment group. No differences were detected between treatments for other carcass characteristics or liver abscess incidence and severity. Another trial evaluated intermittent tylosin feeding and its impact on liver abscess incidence and antimicrobial resistant Enterococcus spp. when compared to continuous tylosin feeding. One of 3 treatments were randomly assigned to 312 crossbred steers: negative control (no tylosin fed throughout the feeding period); positive control (tylosin fed throughout the feeding period); or intermittent treatment (tylosin fed intermittently throughout the feeding period: 1 week on, 2 weeks off). Fecal samples were collected on day 0, 20, and 118 to characterize antimicrobial resistant Enterococcus spp. By design, the intermittent treatment consumed 60 % less tylosin than the positive control group. No differences were detected between treatments for feedlot performance. Liver abscess incidence was greatest for the negative control, and least for the positive control and intermittent treatments, with no difference being detected between the latter two treatments (P = 0. 716). Antimicrobial resistance was unaffected by treatment, but was affected by sampling time. We concluded that supplementing antioxidants is not a viable option to reduce liver abscess incidence and severity, and that tylosin usage can be decreased without adversely affecting performance or liver abscess incidence...|$|E
