The {{following}} game naturally {{appears in}} the situations that some service providers benefit from pairwise allocations on a network, such as the kidney exchanges between hospitals. A graph G {{and a set of}} m agents 1, 2, [...] .,m are given. The vertex set is decomposed into a disjoint union Vi so that Vi are the vertices of agent i. The agents first reveal their vertices, and then the mechanism finds a matching on the disclosed vertices. The social welfare function is the size of this matching. Indeed, agent i is interested in maximizing <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> vertices <b>of</b> <b>Vi</b> that are matched. Therefore, agent i may hide a subset of her vertices V ′i ⊆ Vi and reveal Vi V ′i, and after the run of the mechanism, privately add a matching on her unmatched vertices, V ′i, into the solution. Hiding the vertices may harm the social welfare, and thus, the mechanism wants to avoid. Ashlagi et al. at EC’ 10 [1] preset a 2 -approximation randomized truthful mechanism for this problem. This is the best known result in this setting with multi-players. However, we note that the variance of the utility of some agents in this mechanism may be as large as Ω(n 2), which is not acceptable by real agents. In this paper we resolve this issue by providing a 2 -approximation randomized truthful mechanism in which the variance of the utility of each agent is at most 2 +. Interestingly, we could apply our technique to design a deterministic mech-anism so that, if an agent deviates from the mechanism, she does not gain more than 2 dlog 2 me. We call such a mechanism almost truthful. Indeed, in a practical scenario, an almost truthful mechanism is likely to imply a truthful mechanism. We believe that our approach can be used to design low risk or almost truthful mechanisms for other problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Collective {{oscillations}} of lattices of locally-coupled chaotic Rössler oscillators are {{studied with}} regard to the dynamical scaling of their phase interfaces. Using analogies with the complex Ginzburg-Landau and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equations, we argue that phase coherence should be lost in the infinite-size limit. Our numerical results, however, indicate possible discrepancies with a Langevin-like description using an effective white-noise term. Spatially-extended, extensively-chaotic dynamical systems with local interactions generically exhibit some collective coherence emerging out of strong local chaos which seems to persist even in the infinite-size limit. This longrange order in far-from-equilibrium, deterministic systems often {{takes the form of a}} simple, effectively low-dimensional, temporal evolution of spatiallyaveraged quantities. Usually referred to as non-trivial collective behavior, this phenomenon has been studeid mostly in discrete-time lattice systems such as coupled map lattices and cellular automata [1]. In a recent paper, though, a continuous-time model was investigated in this context [2]. It concluded from numerical experiments that two-dimensional lattices of diffusivelycoupled chaotic Rössler systems may show collective oscillations, or long-range rotating order (LRRO). In this Paper, we look at this result in a new light, by making use of the properties of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation (KPZE) [3], a universal model for fluctuating interfaces.

In 7 of the 12 O VI systems, O VI, Lyβ and C IV lines have similar equivalent widths, and are probably photoionized. In each of the remaining 5 systems, O VI has larger equivalent widths than those detected for Lyβ and C IV. These systems are labeled as high ionization and are likely to be due to collisional ionization. These would be the first QSO absorption systems known to be collisionally ionized. Assuming that the O VI lines are on the linear part of the curve of growth, we estimate the lower limit of the cosmological mass density, Ω(O V I) ≥ 1 × 10 − 8 h − 1 100. Since O> O VI, if the mean cosmic metallicity, Z, were below 6 × 10 − 4 solar, then the accompanying Hydrogen and Helium would account for all baryons in the universe.

This problem arises in structural biology, when one aims at nding the pairwise contacts between the proteins of a protein assembly, given the lists of proteins involved in sub-complexes. We present four contributions. First, using a reduction of set cover, we establish that MCI is APX-hard.

In this study, we use the FUSE satellite to search 129 known Lyα absorption systems at z < 0. 15 toward 31 AGN for corresponding absorption from higher Lyman lines and the important metal ions O VI and C III. We detect O VI in 40 systems over a smaller range of column density (logNOVI = 13. 0 – 14. 35) than seen in H I (log NHI = 13. 0 – 16. 0). The co-existence <b>of</b> O <b>VI</b> and H I suggests a multiphase IGM, with warm photoionized and hot ionized components. With improved O VI detection statistics, we find a steep distribution in O VI column density, dNOVI/dNOVI ∝ N − 2. 2 ± 0. 1 OVI, suggesting that numerous weak O VI absorbers contain baryonic mass comparable to the rare strong absorbers. Down to 30 m˚A equivalent width (O VI λ 1032) we find an absorber frequency dNOVI/dz ≈ 17 ± 3. The total cosmological mass fraction in this hot gas is at least ΩWHIM = (0. 0022 ± 0. 0003) [h 70 (ZO/ 0. 1 Z⊙) (fOVI/ 0. 2) ] − 1 where we have scaled to fiducial values of oxygen metallicity, O VI ionization fraction, and Hubble constant. Gas in the WHIM at 105 − 6 K contributes at least 4. 8 ± 0. 9 % of the total baryonic mass at z < 0. 15. We then combine empirical scaling relations for the observed “multiphase ratio”, NHI/NOVI ∝ NHI 0. 9 ± 0. 1, and for hydrogen overdensity in cosmological simulations, NHI ∝ δ 0. 7 H, with the H I photoionization correction to derive the mean oxygen metallicity, ZO ≈ (0. 09 Z⊙) (fOVI/ 0. 2) − 1 in the low-z multiphase gas.

This review briefly {{discusses}} {{the use of}} UV absorption lines in the spectra of low-redshift QSOs {{for the study of}} the physical conditions, metallicity, and baryonic content of the low−z IGM, with emphasis on implications for the missing baryons problem. Current results on the statistics and baryonic content of intervening, low−z O VI and Lyα absorption-line systems are presented with some comments on overlap between these two classes of absorbers and consequent baryon double-counting problems. From observations of a sample of 16 QSOs observed with the E 140 M echelle mode of STIS, we find 44 intervening O VI absorbers and 14 associated O VI systems (i. e, systems with zabs ≈ zem). This sample implies that <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> intervening O <b>VI</b> absorbers per unit redshift is dN/dz(O VI) = 23 ± 4 for lines with rest equivalent width> 30 m˚A. The intervening O VI systems contain at least 7 % of the baryons if their typical metallicity is 1 / 10 solar and the O VI ion fraction is ≤ 0. 2. This finding is consistent with predictions made by cosmological simulations of large-scale structure growth. Recently, a population of remarkably broad Lyα lines have been recognized in low−z quasar spectra. If the breadth of these Lyα features is predominantly due to thermal motions, then these H I absorbers likely harbor an important fraction of the baryons.

The O VI systems unambiguously trace hot gas only in one case. For the 4 other O VI systems, photoionization and collisional ionization models are viable options to explain the observed column densities <b>of</b> the O <b>VI</b> and the other ions. If the O VI systems are mostly photoionized, {{only a fraction of the}} observed O VI will contribute to the baryonic density of the warm-hot ionized medium (WHIM) along this line of sight. Combining our results with previous ones, we show that there is a general increase <b>of</b> N(O <b>VI)</b> with increasing b(O VI). Cooling flow models can reproduce the N-b distribution but fail to reproduce the observed ionic ratios. A comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> O I, O II, O III, O IV, and O VI systems per unit redshift show that the low-z IGM is more highly ionized than weakly ionized. We confirm that photoionized O VI systems show a decreasing ionization parameter with increasing H I column density. O VI absorbers with collisional ionization/photoionization degeneracy follow this relation, possibly suggesting that they are principally photoionized. We find that the photoionized O VI systems in the low redshift IGM have a median abundance of 0. 3 solar. We do not find additional Ne VIII systems other than the one found by Savage et al., although our sensitivity should have allowed the detection of Ne VIII in O VI systems at T (0. 6 - 1. 3) x 10 ^ 6 K (if CIE applies).

Compared with no ranibizumab treatment, the model predicted that ranibizumab 0. 3 mg every 4 weeks would reduce <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> individuals with <b>VI</b> from 11 438 (95 % simulation interval [SI], 7249 – 16 077) to 6304 (95 % SI, 3921 – 8981), a 45 % (95 % SI, 36 %– 53 %) reduction at 2 years. Ranibizumab would reduce <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> incident eyes with VA worse than 20 / 40 from 16 910 (95 % SI, 10 729 – 23 577) to 9361 (95 % SI, 5839 – 13 245), a 45 % (95 % SI, 38 %– 51 %) reduction. Ranibizumab was estimated to reduce <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> individuals with legal blindness by 75 % (95 % SI, 58 %– 88 %) and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> incident eyes with VA of 20 / 200 or worse by 76 % (95 % SI, 63 %– 87 %). ConclusionsThis model suggests that ranibizumab 0. 3 mg every 4 weeks substantially reduces prevalence <b>of</b> <b>VI</b> and legal blindness 2 years after initiating treatment among Hispanic and non-Hispanic white individuals in the United States with central-involved DME that has caused vision loss...|$|R

It is intermediate between the classical value iteration (VI) and policy iteration (PI) methods, and it {{is closely related to}} optimistic (also known as modified) PI, whereby each policy evaluation is done approximately, using a finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>VI.</b> We review <b>the</b> theory of the method and associated questions of bias and exploration arising in simulation-based cost function approximation. We then discuss various implementations, which offer advantages over well-established PI methods that use LSPE(ł), LSTD(ł), or TD(ł) for policy evaluation with cost function approximation. One of these implementations is based on a new simulation scheme, called geometric sampling, which uses multiple short trajectories rather than a single infinitely long trajectory...|$|R
