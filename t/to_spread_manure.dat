5000|$|In {{the farming}} {{communities}} of Ohio, fertilization of fields was possible {{only by the}} distribution of animal excrement, usually mixed with bedding straw to create a semi-solid mixture of manure. The task of shoveling and distributing the manure was backbreaking {{and there were many}} attempts made to mechanize this process. One such example was a patent by a Daniel Merrell in 1886 for a mechanized [...] "manure spreader". [...] There were a number of other patent filings prior to the onset of the 20th century. In 1899 John M Kramer, Fred Heckman and Henry Synck, Jr., all of whom lived in the small farming community of Maria Stein, OH were awarded a patent for a device <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>manure</b> which they named a [...] "manure distributor". Synck subsequently worked with his future father-in-law, Joseph Oppenheim, to develop the first practical manure spreader. Oppenheim's 1900 invention was so successful that it spawned a major manufacturing company, the New Idea Spreader Works, later renamed the New Idea Farm Machinery Company in 1899. New Idea celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1999 as a division of AGCO. Synck's role in the evolution of manure spreader and other farm machinery technology is well documented by a steady stream of patents that not only describe improvements to the manure spreader, but also other farm machinery from 1899 to 1939.|$|E
40|$|Current {{environmental}} regulations related to manure management are generally {{based on the}} number of livestock per farm, or a farm’s position in a watershed. Such approaches often do not consider biophysical factors, such as soils and weather, and socio-economic conditions that affect farmer management of manure. Results from various studies of representative Wisconsin dairy farms show that policies based on farm size may not provide the desired outcome of improved manure management. For example, farms with small herd size collect less manure than large farms. Also, although most Wisconsin dairy farms operate sufficient cropland area for recycling manure, farmers use only a fraction of their cropland base <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>manure.</b> Farmers in the northeast part of the state spread manure on 23 % of their total cropland base verses 44 % in the southwest region.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{economic}} and environmental effects to hog finishing farms from residual taxes/standards and restrictions on manure application and stocking density. Economic effects are {{measured in terms of}} net farm income and land prices, while levels of ammonia and excess nitrogen and phosphorus proxy the environmental effects. Any environmental policy requiring the need for additional land comes at a small cost to farmers who have access to adequate neighboring land. If this is not the case, then manure application and stocking density restrictions are expensive since the producer is basically forced to either purchase land or reduce hog production levels. Key Words: land value, manure application restrictions, stocking density Public concerns over the environmental consequen-ces of livestock production and the concentration of that production in larger farm units has led to more numerous, and increasingly more stringent, regu-lations on farm practices. These regulations have evolved from simple ex ante restrictions, such as minimum separation distances of new barns from waterways, to ex post controls or incentives on man-agement practices. Although there is a geographical disparity in the extent of the legislation among countries and jurisdictions (Beghin and Metcalfe, 2000), nutrient management standards and/or stock-ing density restrictions are becoming part of the regulatory constraints facing livestock farmers. For example, confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in the United States will not be able <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>manure</b> at a rate greater than the crop nutrient demands.

40|$|As regards environment, the {{information}} to be provided to the decision maker or to the manager must be clear, accurate, unambiguous, and ideally it should be the result of the aggregation of a great number of data or parameters. For example, the person in charge of the security of a municipality must have at his disposal an information of the type "all or nothing" to be able to decide if the population must be evacuated {{in the event of a}} severe pollution. However, that very simple information should be the result of a calculation based on several time series of pollutant concentration values and of meteorological data. Even the farmer who wants to know if it is the right time <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>manure</b> without affecting too much the environment must have a single information which should be the aggregation of some complex variables. The lecture presents the concept of some "integrated index", already used to assess the quality of the environment. For example, Organic Pollution Index combines 4 laboratory measurement values of pollutants in water to make a single index characterising the global pollution in a river. Some apparatus are able to compute the integrated index "on line" and to supply directly to the user the value of the medium quality. For example, the PMV index estimates globally the thermal comfort in a building from the on line measurement of 5 parameters. FUL has designed some "smart sensors" or "smart instrument" aiming at supplying such index. Two applications are presented. The first one concerns the measurement of soil quality by means of a porous sensor combining in a single index the measurement of temperature, salinity and water contents. But the lecture develops particularly a second application which exploits the principle of the "electronic nose" to assess, in a single "signature", the quality or the intensity of an environmental odour. Such instrument, equipped with an array of "non specific" gas sensors, should be able, after a suitable learning phase, to recognise the odour source and to monitor it continuously in the field. The instrument response is thus a "pattern", similar to an integrated index, directly related to the annoyance, as felt by neighbouring people. It gives thus an information which can be handled by a manager, and which is more rich than individual pollutant concentration values. FUL has tested such instrument in the environment. The results are promising : a first design of electronic nose was able to recognise 5 odorous sources in the environment, and a portable instrument has been used to monitor the odour around a landfill site. The same concept is now tested to appraise as a whole the indoor air quality in different buildings. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In 1996, the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) {{published}} a report entitled Integrated Animal Waste Management. One {{of the recommendations}} in that report was to “change animal diets to decrease nutrient outputs” (CAST 1996, 1). Since that time, concentration of animal production units has continued, public concern about the environmental effects of animal manure has increased, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed more restrictive requirements for concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO regulations). Progress has been made since 1996 to decrease nutrient outputs by animals through diet modification and nutrition. The current study describes the existing technological advancements, the decrease in nutrient outputs possible, the degree of acceptance by poultry and livestock producers, {{and the potential for}} further technological advancements. This study focuses on two nutrients and addresses two environmental concerns. The nutrients are nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Nitrogen is a part of amino acids (AAs) that form proteins required by all animals; animals consume protein and AAs and then excrete various forms of N. Phosphorus is a mineral nutrient required for bone growth and many important bodily functions. But these nutrients, if directly discharged into surface water in runoff or deposited in water from aerial emissions, can cause significant water pollution. The first environmental concern is the volatilization of N {{in the form of a}}mmonia (NH 3) from animal manures. Volatilized ammonia returns to the land or water via rainfall, dry precipitation, or direct absorption. Volatilized ammonia also can contribute to odor problems. Although ammonia may be beneficial as a fertilizer for agricultural fields, it may not be beneficial in other ecosystems. Manure in the form of a slurry when injected into the soil will have minimal losses of ammonia. The higher the N content of the manure, the greater the risk of ammonia loss. For example, most beef cattle are produced in open feedlots. Ammonia losses can represent as much as 70 % of the N excreted by those cattle. The second environmental concern is manure nutrient distribution. Manure is an excellent fertilizer for crop production. If manure nutrients are applied at rates equivalent to plant needs, then environmental impacts are minimal. If manure is applied at higher rates, however, N can leach into groundwater and P can build up in the soil and contaminate the surface water, harming the environment. As livestock and poultry units have increased in size, it has become more expensive to return manure to the cropland where the feed for the animals originated. The manure distribution problem can be local, regional, national, or even international. For example, approximately one-half of the corn grown in Nebraska is exported to other states or to foreign countries. Although there are many cattle feedlots in Nebraska, there is more than enough land on which <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>manure.</b> Conversely, if midwestern corn is exported to Texas for cattle production, to North Carolina for swine production, or to Delaware for broiler production, it is difficult to return the nutrients to the land where the crops originated. Decreasing the N and P excreted by poultry, swine, or cattle can minimize these two concerns. In the past, there has been little pressure to decrease excretion, so livestock and poultry producers have typically overfed protein (N) and P. Researchers have made key advances in this field during the past decade. Source reduction is the logical starting point to lessen the environmental impact. Significant changes are occurring, but more can be accomplished...|$|E

Even so, manure that is produced on operations that cannot fully apply it to their own land at agronomic rates accounts for 60 percent of the Nation’s manure nitrogen and 70 percent of the manure phosphorus.

25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction.

Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.|$|R

For this rea-son, the technical process of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> was studied using various methods of scientific research and analysis. The focus was primarily on improving the working principles of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading,</b> using so−called wide−angle manure spreaders. Results of the analysis of material transport along the rotor revealed the most relevant parameters of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading.</b> It was found that friction is not the most important parameter. The initial position of pieces of manure and the rotational frequen-cy of the rotor are far more important. The coefficient of friction between the rotor and pieces of manure has a minimum influ-ence on the tangential speed of a piece on the rotor, which in turn also means a minimum influence on the range of spreading. The initial position of the piece on the rotor has an influence on the tangential speed and travel of the piece on the rotor. The tangential speed of the piece as it departs from the rotor is influenced by the size of rotor and the rotational frequency of the rotor.

In current paper is shown how inorganic fertilizer use influences the use and exchange of organic nitrogen. Because of the mutual interdependency between organic and inorganic nitrogen emission rights (or quota), inorganic nitrogen use limits the emission rights for organic nitrogen.
