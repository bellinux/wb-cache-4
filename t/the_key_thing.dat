50|$|Shown {{are only}} 20 encoded bits (5 parity, 15 data) but the pattern {{continues}} indefinitely. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> about Hamming Codes {{that can be}} seen from visual inspection is that any given bit is included in a unique set of parity bits. To check for errors, check all of the parity bits. The pattern of errors, called the error syndrome, identifies the bit in error. If all parity bits are correct, there is no error. Otherwise, the sum of the positions of the erroneous parity bits identifies the erroneous bit. For example, if the parity bits in positions 1, 2 and 8 indicate an error, then bit 1+2+8=11 is in error. If only one parity bit indicates an error, the parity bit itself is in error.|$|E

50|$|The {{exhibition}} organised at Galerie de Berri in May 1942, Vivrel - peinture récentes, featured thirty-one paintings {{illustrating the}} diversity of the genres he worked in throughout his career. The artist limited himself to still lifes only when the weather prevented him from getting out of the studio. He painted them without regret, though, since <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> for him was simply not to stop painting. In old age he recognised that painting had always acted on him like a drug. In the same interview this perfectionist admitted to having destroyed many of his paintings that he found imperfect. This rigour confirmed what critics had seen in him when he was ‘virtually an unknown’: ‘taste, a good eye and accomplishment’ - and this was notwithstanding the illustrious elders, Pierre Bonnard, Henri Lebasque and Pablo Picasso, exhibited alongside Vivrel at Galerie Th. Briant in 1933. Continuing to paint as long as he drew breath, André-Léon Vivrel died in Montmartre on 7 April 1976.|$|E

5000|$|Ottaviani {{was opposed}} in his {{movements}} for a rapid council by German Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne. Frings often clashed with Ottaviani on which direction the council should take. In this, he was assisted by [...] "a then progressive firebrand" [...] who was [...] "dissatisfied {{with many of}} the answers offered by the Church's official authorities", a young theological advisor named Joseph Ratzinger, who would later become prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and then Pope Benedict XVI. Frings had heard a lecture of the young Ratzinger on issues the upcoming council could address. It seemed to Frings that Ratzinger had set forth a complete agenda for the council that was exactly what Frings himself had in mind. Frings had Ratzinger prepare the text of a lecture that Frings was to give in Rome. After the lecture, which Pope John XXIII complimented warmly, Frings told the Pope that he did not deserve credit for the speech, as it was written by one of his priests. Pope John admitted that he too delegated much of his work. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> was to select the right person for the job.
