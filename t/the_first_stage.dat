5|$|Despite {{the rule}} changes, {{there were still}} protesters among the spectators; in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> all riders except Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq {{punctured}} due to 125kg of nails spread along the road. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> was won by Louis Trousselier. Trousselier was serving the army, and had requested his commander leave for the Tour de France; this was allowed for 24 hours. After he won <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> and led the classification, his leave was extended {{until the end of}} the Tour. From 60 starting cyclists, only 15 cyclists reached the finish line within the time limit; 15 more reached the finish after the limit and the rest took the train.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} format, the tournament {{consists}} of six stages, with <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> {{taking place in}} early February. The six surviving teams from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> join 26 teams in the second stage, {{in which there are}} eight groups consisting of four teams each. The eight group winners and eight runners-up enter the final four stages, better known as the knockout stages, which ends with the finals anywhere between June and August. The winner of the Copa Libertadores becomes eligible to play in the FIFA Club World Cup and the Recopa Sudamericana.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} league {{championship}} in 1899, Villa's record-breaking average crowd of 21,000 allowed {{the club to}} invest in a two-stage ground improvement programme. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> extended the terrace covering on the Trinity Road side at the cost of £887; the second cost £1,300 and involved re-laying all terracing around the track to remedy a design flaw that caused poor sightlines {{for the majority of the}} crowd. In 1911, Villa bought the freehold of the ground for £8,250, the office buildings in the old aquarium and car park area for £1,500 and the carriage drive and bowling green for £2,000. This was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> in plans drawn up by Villa director Frederick Rinder that saw the capacity of Villa Park increased to 104,000. In June 1914, another phase of enhancements began at Villa Park to compete with improvements at other grounds around the country, including Everton's Goodison Park, where a new two-tiered stand had just been completed. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> of improvements saw the cycling track removed, new banking at the Holte Hotel End (Holte End), and a re-profiling of all the terracing to bring it closer to the newly squared-off pitch. Rinder turned to the renowned architect Archibald Leitch to design a new Villa Park. Their joint plans included large banked end stands at the Holte and Witton ends and the incorporation of the original Victorian Lower Grounds buildings, including the aquarium and the newly acquired bowling greens. The outbreak of the First World War severely hampered design and construction efforts.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>stage</b> as booster rockets. Another suggestion was {{to mount the}} entire rocket atop a Blue Streak missile, while a third proposal involved replacing the Gamma engines with the more powerful Larch.|$|E

Atlético then faced Colombian side Santa Fe in the round of 16, winning the first leg by 20 and losing the second 10 to advance.
