25|$|A {{borrowed}} chord is {{one from}} a different key than the home key, the key of the piece it is used in. The most common occurrence of this is where a chord from the parallel major or minor key is used. Particularly good examples can be found throughout the works of composers such as Schubert. For instance, for a composer working in the C major key, a major III chord (e.g., an E major chord) would be borrowed, as this chord appears only in the C minor key. Although borrowed chords could theoretically include chords taken from any key other than the home key, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> the term is used when a chord is described in formal musical analysis.|$|E

[...] An impersonal verb form is a verb to which no pronoun has been attached, as carë (sg.) or carir (pl.); carin, [...] "I do (habitually)", is a personal form (with -n, a short suffix for [...] "I, me").

That the film has almost zero-'filmy' humour is also worth noting. It's the logical {{manner in which the}} story unfolds and the very convincing manner in which the characters behave makes it impressive." [...] The critic rated the film three in a scale of five. IndiaGlitz's reviewer rated the film 8/10 and stated, [...] "Drishyam is undoubtedly cladded with exceptional story telling combined with bravura performances. An undoubtedly exceptional film as far the content is concerned, the movie is a must watch for all the audiences of family and thriller movies." [...] In contrast, Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times wrote, [...] "Scripted more or less in a convincing manner and mounted with finesse, writer-director Joseph fleshes out his characters.

On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E
2500|$|Both sides {{came under}} {{criticism}} for their defensive {{approach in the}} final Test — New Zealand for failing to set aside its headaches about the gifts of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma and groom a traditionally seam-friendly wicket, and India for not ramming home its advantage {{over the course of}} the final two days. [...] "A 2-0 victory would have been a more correct index of the difference between the teams," [...] wrote Indian journalist Suresh Menon, bemoaning Dhoni's lack of urgency first in batting on too long in the second innings and then in leading a signally listless and complacent display in the field. [...] The Indian skipper's answer to the first charge was that [...] "a huge score meant that we could keep attacking all the time." [...] As Menon observed, however, strangely, he didn't attack all the time. [...] He didn't tell Harbhajan Singh that the bowler should stop sending down his express deliveries but flight the ball. [...] Post-tea on the fourth day, the whole team appeared over-relaxed and almost casual, as if winning would be just a matter of turning up on the fifth day.A 2-0 victory would have been a more correct index of the difference between the teams. India appeared only too satisfied with a 1-0 win. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> champion teams play, and if India aspire to knock Australia off the perch at the top, they will have to be more ruthless in their approach, more focused, and not so easily satisfied.|$|E

On July 30, 2012, Hamilton released a collaboration mixtape entitled Cinematic Hallucinations: The Bully And The Pet with rapper S.K.E. The Heistman. On August 17, 2012 during an interview Hamilton talked about his change in his music stating [...] "When I was incarcerated, my songs got a little more aggressive, but after I did some time and came back to NYC, I was a little upset at my fans because they were saying some pretty harsh things about me when I was locked up. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> you should approach somebody whos been showing you guys free love". Hamilton also talked about how mental illness and drug use didn't {{have anything to do with}} him taking a step back from music stating [...] "People were blaming insanity because certain details didn't hit the surface, but it had nothing to do with drugs, it had nothing to do with alcohol". Hamilton also discussed about his former deal with Interscope Records stating [...] "MC Lyte said it best it was a fight to get me off Interscope. I put out more projects than the entire Interscope roster from 2008 to 2010, and it took Eminem to come out and trump that, as far as getting physical sales numbers. Interscope had to choose between traditional and the new wave, and I said this new wave costs yall less money and less compromise but it took people on the inside to say to Interscope yall don't know what you're doing with this kid. A lot of the inner workings weren't made clear to me, and I took it very personally". On December 21, 2012 Hamilton released his extended play entitled The Come Down.|$|E
6000|$|Superstition {{and social}} exigency having been thus {{dealt with in}} the first two members of the series, it {{remained}} for [...] "Les Travailleurs de la Mer" [...] to show man hand to hand with the elements, the last form of external force that is brought against him. And here once more the artistic effect and the moral lesson are worked out together, and are, indeed, one. Gilliat, alone upon the reef at his herculean task, offers a type of human industry {{in the midst of the}} vague [...] "diffusion of forces into the illimitable," [...] and the visionary development of [...] "wasted labour" [...] in the sea, and the winds, and the clouds. No character was ever thrown into such strange relief as Gilliat. The great circle of sea-birds that come wonderingly around him on the night of his arrival, strikes at once the note of his pre-eminence and isolation. He fills the whole reef with his indefatigable toil; this solitary spot in the ocean rings with the clamour of his anvil; we see him as he comes and goes, thrown out sharply against the clear background of the sea. And yet his isolation is not to be compared with the isolation of Robinson Crusoe, for example; indeed, no two books could be more instructive to set side by side than [...] "Les Travailleurs" [...] and this other of the old days before art had learnt to occupy itself with what lies outside of human will. Crusoe was one sole centre of interest in the midst of a nature utterly dead and utterly unrealised by the artist; but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> we feel with Gilliat; we feel that he is opposed by a [...] "dark coalition of forces," [...] that an [...] "immense animosity" [...] surrounds him; we are the witnesses of the terrible warfare that he wages with [...] "the silent inclemency of phenomena going their own way, and the great general law, implacable and passive": [...] "a conspiracy of the indifferency of things" [...] is against him. There is not one interest on the reef, but two. Just as we recognise Gilliat for the hero, we recognise, as implied by this indifferency of things, this direction of forces to some purpose outside our purposes, yet another character who may almost take rank as the villain of the novel, and the two face up to one another blow for blow, feint for feint, until, in the storm, they fight it epically out, and Gilliat remains the victor;--a victor, however, who has still to encounter the octopus. I need say nothing of the gruesome, repulsive excellence of that famous scene; it will be enough to remind the reader that Gilliat is in pursuit of a crab when he is himself assaulted by the devil fish, and that this, in its way, is the last touch to the inner significance of the book; here, indeed, is the true position of man in the universe.|$|E

50|$|Lindenthal had a {{difference}} in opinion {{with one of the}} standard engineering practices of the day. Trains were very popular during this time and made up a majority of large bridge building that took place. Trains being as heavy as they were made engineers greatly overcompensate and build bridges that were oversized, bulky, and expensive. Lindenthal pointed out that bridges did not have to support the full load of a train. The train moves across the bridge and displaces its load evenly. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>how</b> the bridges <b>were</b> tested to see if a design worked though. The train’s dead weight was simply added to the bridge, and if it did <b>not</b> hold, it <b>was</b> said to be structurally unstable.
