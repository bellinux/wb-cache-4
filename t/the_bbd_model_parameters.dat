In <b>the</b> <b>BB</b> diabetic-prone rat <b>model</b> of T 1 D, intestinal intraluminal zonulin levels were elevated 35 -fold compared to control BB diabetic-resistant rats.

In those diabetic prone rats that did not progress to diabetes, both intraluminal zonulin and transepithelial electrical resistance were similar to those detected in diabetic-resistant animal controls. Blockade of the zonulin receptor reduced the cumulative incidence of T 1 D by 70 %, despite the persistence of intraluminal zonulin up-regulation.
