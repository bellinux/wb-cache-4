5|$|In 1998, the {{historic}} {{status of the}} barges was {{a concern for the}} Port Authority of Bridgeport Harbor, as the sunken ships interfered with a billion-dollar redevelopment project. Over the years, the barges had deteriorated so that a salvage operation would likely result in them breaking apart. No action had been taken by 2003, but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Berkshire No. 7, the Federal Transit Administration and/or the City of Bridgeport should document the barge with photos and a <b>technical</b> <b>description.</b> Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} investigates the {{perception}} of <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions</b> and of stories where the events are driven by the motivations and emotions of their characters. The study is explorative, using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods and {{with a total of}} 10 participants. The participants accepted the use of stories and strongly preferred stories with emotional and dramatic elements. The study indicates that human-centered stories encourage and facilitate detailed discussions of social aspects and situations of use, whereas <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions</b> may block such discussions. The study indicate that stories are not a reliable mean of changing the attitudes of the readers, and it shows that stories are not better than <b>technical</b> <b>descriptions</b> for communicating factual or technical information...|$|R

25|$|Herman Heine Goldstine {{was born}} in Chicago in 1913 to Jewish parents.

In 1939 Goldstine began a teaching career at the University of Michigan, until the United States' entry into World War II, when he joined the U. S. Army. In 1941 he married Adele Katz, who was an ENIAC programmer and who wrote the <b>technical</b> <b>description</b> for ENIAC. He had a daughter and a son with Adele, who died in 1964.

25|$|In 1957 {{instructors}} and apprentices from the de Havilland Aircraft Company Technical School decided {{to construct a}} replica engine, almost 50 years after the original Iris was built. The Iris Motor Company had long since closed and its records, along with the original engine drawings, were destroyed by German bombing during World War II. Flight magazine had featured {{an article on the}} engine in May 1910 with a detailed <b>technical</b> <b>description</b> and line drawings. This information along with the original designer's memory were used to produce a new set of drawings and components. Several companies involved with the original engine assisted with new parts, Claudel-Hobson supplied the carburettor, Lodge Plugs Ltd the spark plugs and Simms Motor Units assisted with re-conditioning a magneto that had been borrowed from the London Science Museum.|$|E
25|$|When new, {{the units}} were {{initially}} numbered {{in the range}} 001-091, but were later renumbered to 303 001-091 when TOPS was introduced. Each unit consisted of 3-cars coupled together in a semi-permanent formation, and up to four sets could be operated in multiple to form up to a 12-car formation. Although 6-car formations were frequently operated, 9-car formations were operated occasionally. 12-car formations were usually only seen {{as a result of}} train failures or ECS workings to the depots at Shields Road or Hyndland. The two outer carriages of each unit were driving trailers, with an intermediate motor coach containing the motor bogies and electrical equipment. Units operated from the standard 25 kV alternating current (AC) overhead power lines system, with power collection via a Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph on the motor coach. The <b>technical</b> <b>description</b> of the formation is DTSO+MBSO+BDTSO. Individual vehicle numbers are shown below.|$|E
