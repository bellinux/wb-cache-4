5|$|During the sede vacante, as {{the papal}} vacancy is known, certain limited powers {{pass to the}} College of Cardinals, which is convoked by the Dean of the College of Cardinals. All {{cardinals}} are obliged to attend the General Congregation of Cardinals, except those whose health does not permit, or who are over eighty (but those cardinals may choose to attend if <b>they</b> <b>please).</b> The Particular Congregation, which deals with the day-to-day matters of the Church, includes the Cardinal Camerlengo and the three Cardinal Assistants—one Cardinal-Bishop, one Cardinal-Priest and one Cardinal-Deacon—chosen by lot. Every three days, new Cardinal Assistants are chosen by lot. The Cardinal Camerlengo and Cardinal Assistants are responsible, among other things, for maintaining the election's secrecy.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} Arkham City are set {{one year after}} Batman: Arkham Asylum. Quincy Sharp, the asylum's {{erstwhile}} director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of Gotham City. Declaring both the asylum and Blackgate Penitentiary no longer suitable to contain the city's detainees, Sharp's administration orders both facilities closed and he purchases Gotham's most notorious slums, converting them into an immense prison enclosure known as Arkham City. This facility is subsequently placed {{in the care of}} psychiatrist Hugo Strange—who is secretly manipulating Sharp—and monitored by a rogue private military firm, TYGER Security. Strange permits the inmates to do as <b>they</b> <b>please,</b> so long as they do not attempt to escape. A wary Batman maintains his own vigil over the new project, concerned that the chaotic situation there will get out of hand. Meanwhile, the Joker is suffering from a potentially fatal disease caused by his previous consumption of the Titan formula, an unstable steroid serum which turns men into maddened monsters.|$|E

5|$|With the expiry of the copyrights, {{companies}} {{around the}} world have been free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them as <b>they</b> <b>please</b> for almost 50 years. Productions of Pinafore, both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D'Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, such as that of the very successful Essgee Entertainment (formed by Simon Gallaher) in Australia and Opera della Luna in Britain. Since its original production, H.M.S. Pinafore has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most popular comic operas. Productions continue in large numbers {{around the world}}. In 2003 alone, The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company rented 224 sets of orchestra parts, mostly for productions of Pinafore, Pirates and Mikado. This {{does not take into account}} other rental companies and the theatre companies that borrow scores or have their own, or that use only one or two pianos instead of an orchestra. Hundreds of productions of Pinafore are presented every year worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Since the Vocaloid or its vocal {{library is}} {{released}} for producers {{to do as}} <b>they</b> <b>please,</b> some producers think of the Vocaloids as dolls {{and that they can}} make them sing whatever they want. The portrayals of Vocaloids can at times touch controversial issues. Releases put out as young children risk becoming subject to sexual or pedophilic portrayals.|$|E
25|$|Sydney's The Daily Telegraph {{published}} a poll that revealed 83% of respondents thought Ponting {{was not a}} good ambassador for the game. A poll on The Sydney Morning Heralds website revealed that 60% of the public agreed with Roebuck's call for Ponting to stand down. However, neither poll is necessarily reflective of opinion in Australia with anyone in the world can vote as often as <b>they</b> <b>please,</b> and the sample is not random. However, a poll on the Wide World of Sports website revealed 41,000 of the 50,000 respondents did not want Ponting removed.|$|E

25|$|Due to 2012's {{national}} budget cuts, the AHR was removed. The regulation of assisted reproduction was then delegated to each province. This delegation provides provinces {{with a lot}} of leeway to do as <b>they</b> <b>please.</b> As a result, provinces like Quebec, Alberta and Manitoba have put almost the full costs of IVF on the public healthcare bill. Dr. Santiago Munne, developer of the first PGD test for Down's syndrome and founder of , saw these provincial decisions as an opportunity for his company to grow and open more Reprogenetics labs around Canada. He dismissed all controversies regarding catalogue babies and states that he had no problem with perfect babies.|$|E
25|$|In her works, Abramović affirms her {{identity}} through {{the perspective of}} others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message. Abramović's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows the spectators to do as <b>they</b> <b>please</b> with her body, pushing the limits of what one would consider acceptable. This type of representation also reflects key political issues such as BDSM, which complicates and questions the relation between art versus sexuality and public discourse.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules of}} the Senate provide that no senator may make more than two speeches on a motion or bill on the same {{legislative}} day. A legislative day begins when the Senate convenes and ends with adjournment; hence, {{it does not necessarily}} coincide with the calendar day. The length of these speeches is not limited by the rules; thus, in most cases, senators may speak for as long as <b>they</b> <b>please.</b> Often, the Senate adopts unanimous consent agreements imposing time limits. In other cases (for example, for the budget process), limits are imposed by statute. However, the right to unlimited debate is generally preserved.|$|E

In 1620 after the execution of his father he began to call himself the Baron of Muiresk, which in Scotland was considered an illegitimate claim. His brother James, though disinherited from the estate, still had a claim to the title, which was considered to end with his death, as he had no heir. In any case Thomas was not the second son but the third. The second (Robert) had no heirs, either, which did not strengthen {{the case of the}} Dempsters. They were forced to accept the end of their clan; that is, there were no further charters to Dempsters from the king, nor was anyone entitled to be called Baron Dempster or use the coat of arms. Modern Dempsters, of course, may do as <b>they</b> <b>please</b> in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they reside.|$|E

500|$|The Linga Purana also {{mentions}} {{the visit of}} Bhikshatana-Shiva to Deodar Forest to entice the wives of sages, who had taken up austerities [...] "detrimental to the perpetuation of a healthy social order." [...] The scripture mentions Bhikshatana-Shiva's deformed but attractive nude black-red form, his seduction of the sages' wives, and the sages' resulting curse. However, the curse proves fruitless in this version. The confused sages ask Brahma for guidance, who tells them {{the truth about the}} beggar and informs them of the proper way to propitiate Shiva. Returning to the forest, <b>they</b> <b>please</b> Shiva, who had returned to beg for alms. Finally, he enlightens the sages, revealing his true form.|$|E
500|$|The school {{operates}} under a [...] "noncoercive" [...] philosophy {{where students}} are encouraged to develop their own interests and where all learning is self-directed. As such, Brooklyn Free School has no grades, no tests, and no compulsory classes or homework. Students are free to pursue the activities of their interest, such as reading alone or taking a class. Students are free to leave classes as <b>they</b> <b>please.</b> Classes have included philosophy seminars, cheese-tasting, book discussions, business, astrology, psychology, videography, and Tibet. Some classes are taught by volunteers. By law, students are required to attend for 5.5 hours a day.
