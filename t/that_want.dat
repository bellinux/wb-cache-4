5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{announced}} {{the launch of}} IMA Lab, a consulting service within the museum's technology department. IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services to museums and nonprofit organizations <b>that</b> <b>want</b> to use technology to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod Touch that presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures. Steve.museum, for which IMA Lab is the technical lead, is a project that explores social tagging as {{a new way to}} describe collections and make them more accessible.|$|E
5|$|UNITY is {{a secret}} {{international}} organization headquartered somewhere in England that protects humanity from outsiders <b>that</b> <b>want</b> {{to take over the}} world. In 1960, over half of the UNITY's elite agents are murdered by an unknown assassin within a week, leaving UNITY with a critical manpower shortage. They are forced to send UNITY agent Cate Archer and her mentor, Bruno Lawrie, on a series of high-profile missions. Cate is an ex-, and is UNITY's first female spy operative. UNITY's leaders, Jones and Smith, are skeptical of Cate working as a field agent, and have previously relegated her to more mundane assignments. Intelligence reveals that a Russian assassin named Dmitrij Volkov and a new terrorist organization named H.A.R.M. are responsible for the murders of UNITY's former agents. Cate and Bruno embark on a dangerous assignment in Morocco, which later turns out to be an ambush set up by Volkov and his men. Cate manages to escape Morocco whilst Bruno is shot by Volkov. In the UNITY headquarters, Jones and Smith reveal that Volkov killed Bruno simply because he was the traitor, to which Cate reacts with disbelief.|$|E

50|$|In the {{elections}} of 1985, {{under the leadership of}} Pablo González Mariñas and with the active support of CiU, CG won 163,425 votes (13%). After {{the elections}} there were two sectors in the party: one <b>that</b> <b>wanted</b> a pact with the right (People's Alliance) and other <b>that</b> <b>wanted</b> a pact with the left (Socialists' Party of Galicia and the Galician Socialist Party-Galician Left). The sector <b>that</b> <b>wanted</b> a pact with People's Alliance (AP) was the majority, and finally CG enterd the government of Xerardo Fernández Albor.|$|R

25|$|Ethical marketing: Companies that {{ethically}} {{market to}} consumers are placing a higher value on their customers and respecting them {{as people who}} are ends in themselves.

25|$|Another E+Co {{investment}} is SME-RE, which sells biomass gasification systems to industrial clients in rural Cambodia <b>that</b> <b>want</b> {{to reduce their}} usage of diesel for heat and electricity generation.

25|$|Foreign {{companies}} <b>that</b> <b>want</b> {{their stock}} {{to be limited}} to being traded by only certain individuals may set up a restricted program. There are two SEC rules that allow this type of issuance of shares in the United States: Rule 144-A and Regulation S. ADR programs operating under one of these two rules make up approximately 30% of all issued ADRs.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to sexual coercion and the costs that females face, one of their counter-adaptations is the evolution of anatomical protection. Females of some species, such as the water striders, developed morphological shields to protect their genitalia from males <b>that</b> <b>want</b> to forcefully copulate. Some Gerridae females have also evolved abdominal spines and altered the shapes of their abdomens to make them less accessible to males.|$|E
25|$|This {{is common}} with {{companies}} <b>that</b> <b>want</b> to retain brand recognition while {{moving away from}} an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became AT, Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC to de-emphasize the role of frying {{in the preparation of}} its signature dishes, and British Petroleum became BP. Russia Today has rebranded itself as RT. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, Alfredo Lim {{sponsored}} Senate Bill 2224 and Representative Eduardo Gullas sponsored House Bill 5460, {{seeking to}} make ROTC again mandatory. In June 2013, Department of National Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin aired {{a proposal to}} make ROTC once again mandatory for college students, a move ardently being protested by progressive youth groups such as Anakbayan. There have also been reports of schools offering merchant marine courses <b>that</b> <b>want</b> to retain the ROTC program as mandatory, arguing that maritime companies prefer mariners with ROTC training.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the INAO, the {{government}} organization that controls wine appellations in France, {{was preparing to}} make the largest revision of the region's legal boundaries since 1927, in response to economic pressures. With soaring demand and limited production of grapes, Champagne houses say the rising price could produce a consumer backlash that would harm the industry for years into the future. That, along with political pressure from villages <b>that</b> <b>want</b> {{to be included in}} the expanded boundaries, led to the move. Changes are subject to significant scientific review and are said to not impact Champagne produced grapes until 2020.|$|E

International police agencies <b>that</b> <b>want</b> to search the U.S. database can submit a request to the FBI for review. If the request is reasonable and the profile being searched would meet inclusionary standards for a U.S. profile, such as number of loci, the request can be searched {{at the national level}} or forwarded to any states where reasonable suspicion exists that they may be present in that level of the database.|$|E

The infamous green seats (typically off-limits during amateur games) provide a front-row viewing experience directly behind home plate.

25|$|The state Governor {{instructed}} civil {{agencies to}} approve same-sex marriage licenses. On 10 July 2015, 20 same-sex couples were married by Governor Rogelio Ortega in Acapulco. On 13 January 2016, {{the head of}} the Civil Registry of Acapulco announced that all marriages that took place on 10 July 2015 by the Governor and his wife were void and not legal as same-sex marriage is not legal in Guerrero, unless couples are granted amparo beforehand. On 13 February 2016, however, the head of Guerrero's State Civil Registry department announced that same-sex couples could marry in any of the jurisdictions <b>that</b> <b>want</b> to marry the couples and criticised Acapulco's Civil Registry and other civil registries throughout the state for not allowing these kinds of weddings.|$|E

25|$|Although {{some that}} partner with outside {{groups such as}} Oxfam or Planned Parenthood are more structured, most {{organizations}} are highly informal. There is no formal process for forming a student organization at Reed; {{a group of students}} (or a single student) announcing themselves as or just considering themselves a student organization is enough. Groups <b>that</b> <b>want</b> funding from the school's Student Activities office or Student Body Fees, however, must register with Student Activities or through the Student Senate. The Reed archive of comic books and graphic novels, the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room), is well into its fourth decade, and Beer Nation, the student group that organizes and manages various beer gardens throughout the year and during Renn Fayre, has existed for many years. Some organizations, such as the Motorized Couch Collective – dedicated to installing motors and wheels into furniture – have become more Reed myth than reality in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Applications {{communicate}} with the audio driver through Sessions, and these Sessions are programmed through the Windows Audio Session API (WASAPI). In general, WASAPI operates in two modes. In exclusive mode (also called DMA mode), unmixed audio streams are rendered directly to the audio adapter and no other application's audio will play and signal processing has no effect. Exclusive mode is useful for applications that demand {{the least amount of}} intermediate processing of the audio data or those <b>that</b> <b>want</b> to output compressed audio data such as Dolby Digital, DTS or WMA Pro over S/PDIF. WASAPI exclusive mode is similar to kernel streaming in function, but no kernel mode programming is required. In shared mode, audio streams are rendered by the application and optionally applied per-stream audio effects known as Local Effects (LFX) (such as per-session volume control). Then the streams are mixed by the global audio engine, where a set of global audio effects (GFX) may be applied. Finally, they're rendered on the audio device.|$|E
25|$|Many railfans have a {{fixation}} with steam locomotives, which sometimes also fascinate the general public, {{as seen by}} the attendance at stations to view steam-hauled railtours. Sometimes the appeal of trains is nostalgic, recalling an earlier era when the railroads {{played a central role}} in commerce and transportation, and the depot was the center of every town. Nostalgia may also result from the long, lonesome wail of the train's horn, which mimics vocalizations <b>that</b> <b>want</b> for a more simple time reminiscent of home, as heard in country or folk music worldwide. Sometimes the appeal is due to a fondness for large machinery that can be inspected and photographed up close. Sometimes there is an appeal of the scenery of the railroad running through open, uninviting terrain, or the gritty ambiance of the urban train yard. In this case, urban exploration poses a similar appeal. Some people were raised near streetcar tracks or railways. Everyday activities were associated with railroad, which seemed to be a part of life. This may lead to an interest in railcars, how they move, numbering, and other rail systems in the world and how they compare with their native ones. If these people move to another locale, their interest in railroads might be nostalgic.|$|E

So there’s a healthy part <b>that</b> <b>wants</b> to look after you, but there’s also this {{destructive}} part <b>that</b> <b>wants</b> to put everybody else first. <b>That</b> <b>wants</b> to rationalize your feelings, or turn them into anxiety, or turn them in on you and beat you up. All of those things are crippling your life, and we can see in that audition that the anxiety that came out of the fear of feeling your anger actually stopped you getting that job, which you’d held for 3  years, so it’s a very destructive system [Again pointing out and clarifying the system of defences used to defend against hostile, angry feelings and the self-destructive consequences of such a system].|$|R
