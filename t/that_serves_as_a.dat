5|$|In 1840 the Bull Head Turnpike Company built {{a private}} toll road {{known today as}} the Sag Harbor Turnpike, which {{operated}} successfully until a competing railroad line opened in the 1880s. In 1906 the town of Southampton {{took control of the}} now dilapidated road and removed the toll gates. NY114 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and is known in part as the Sag Harbor Turnpike. The bridge carrying NY114 between Sag Harbor and North Haven is an arched bridge <b>that</b> <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> village landmark. In 1999, residents successfully fought state proposals to replace it with a girder bridge. Instead, the bridge was replaced with a new, wider bridge with ornamental lamps that closely resembles the original and is in the same location.|$|E

This is the last curve along NY441 as it follows a linear east–west routing over several small hills to a junction with NY350 west of the hamlet of Walworth, where NY441 terminates. The roadway, however, continues east to Marion as Walworth–Penfield Road, Walworth–Marion Road, and Buffalo Street, a continuous highway maintained by Wayne County as County Route205 (CR205) west of Hall Center Road and Maple Avenue and as CR207 east of those roads.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle {{to save the}} planet, several Halos are able to escape, their own AIs {{enacting}} failsafe protocols. Bornstellar manages to escape {{with the help of}} a young council member and a guard. They escape through the same portal as the Halos but lose power and drift for an unknown amount of time before being recovered by Lifeworkers. The portal has carried them to the Ark, the massive structure <b>that</b> <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> construction site for Halos and also a haven for the Librarian's work. The trio are healed, and Bornstellar meets the Librarian, which brings up conflicting thoughts and feelings, due to his imprint from the Didact. She informs him that the Master Builder executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family. With the news that the Didact is gone, Bornstellar resolves to take his place. The book ends with a narration from the Didact/Bornstellar, revealing that the escaped prisoner was the last Precursor, known as Timeless One. Through a conversation the Didact had long ago, it is learned that the Precursors created the Forerunners, only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate the Precursors, except this one, who now seeks revenge.|$|E
5|$|MD 30 begins {{within the}} Reisterstown Historic District at an {{intersection}} with MD 140, which heads south as Main Street and northwest as Westminster Pike. The state highway heads north as two-lane Hanover Pike through a residential area to a four-way intersection with MD 128 (Butler Road) and unsigned MD 795, a connector between MD 30 {{and the northern}} terminus of I-795 (Northwest Expressway) at MD 140 <b>that</b> <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bypass of Reisterstown for MD 30 traffic. As the highway leaves Reisterstown, Old Hanover Pike splits to the northeast and MD 30 crosses over the Maryland Midland Railway. Old Hanover Pike reconnects with the state highway where the highway briefly parallels CSX's Hanover Subdivision and passes {{to the east of}} the Montrose Mansion and Chapel. At the hamlet of Woodensburg, the old road splits northeast again to follow the railroad through the village of Boring. The railroad and old road return to MD 30 again just north of the state highway's intersection with MD 91 (Emory Road). MD 30 parallels the railroad through the community of Upperco, which is also known as Arcadia, before crossing the BaltimoreCarroll county line.|$|E
