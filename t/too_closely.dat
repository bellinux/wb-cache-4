5|$|For live shows, The White Stripes {{were known}} for Jack's {{employment}} of heavy distortion, {{as well as}} audio feedback and overdrive. The duo performed considerably more recklessly and unstructured live, never preparing set lists for their shows, believing that planning <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> would ruin the spontaneity of their performances.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{the stretch}} of Highway401 {{eastbound}} near Milton and westbound near Whitby had chevrons painted in each lane {{in an effort to}} reduce tailgating, a concept borrowed from France and Britain. Signs advised motorists to keep at least two chevrons apart, in essence warning them not to follow <b>too</b> <b>closely.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} reddish-brown in colour and have greyish pubescence and brown {{coloured}} {{half of the}} bottom. It have small scutellum and round butt. Elytron is coarsely punctured while its head and prothorax is punctured <b>too</b> but <b>closely.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{thought so}} at the time; and, (by way, I suppose, of {{supporting}} my newly assumed philosophical character,) I thought <b>too,</b> how <b>closely</b> the greater number of our virtues are connected with the fear of death, and how little sympathy we bestow on pain, {{where there is no}} danger.|$|R
60|$|Gale {{advanced}} till he {{was close}} to the horse. The cowboy leaned over the saddle and peered into Gale's face. Then, without a word, he sheathed the gun and held out his hand. Gale met a grip of steel that warmed his blood. The other cowboy got off his nervous, spirited horse and threw the bridle. He, <b>too,</b> peered <b>closely</b> into Gale's face.|$|R
5|$|However, the Palladian designs {{advocated}} by Inigo Jones were <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> {{associated with the}} court of Charles I to survive the turmoil of the civil war. Following the Stuart restoration Jones's Palladianism was eclipsed by the baroque designs of such architects as William Talman and Sir John Vanbrugh, Nicholas Hawksmoor, and even Jones' pupil John Webb.|$|E
5|$|In October 2017, Harper {{received}} {{media attention}} for criticizing Justin Trudeau's {{handling of the}} renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement started by the United States under President Donald Trump, stating that Trudeau was too unwilling to make concessions to the U.S., sided <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> with Mexico, and tried to advance left-wing policies through the renegotiations.|$|E
5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over {{the threat of a}} French invasion, Sir Thomas Page surveyed the blockhouse in 1778 and concluded that its guns were <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> packed together and that they could not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, Paul Penkalski and Peter Dodson {{concluded}} that Ceratops, despite being is a nomen dubium because {{the material is}} <b>too</b> meager, appeared <b>closely</b> related to Avaceratops which even may be a juvenile Ceratops; {{there is not enough}} material to prove it.|$|R
60|$|Now Userti {{shifted her}} eyes from me to Seti, {{watching}} him very closely. Seated at his side upon the ground with my writing roll spread across my knee, I, <b>too,</b> watched him <b>closely,</b> and noted that his lips turned white and his face grew fixed and strange.|$|R
6000|$|To prevent {{his doing}} such things, Waldron's mother kept {{him under the}} closest {{possible}} restraint, and would hardly let him go away from her side. She watched him, <b>too,</b> very <b>closely</b> all the time, and worried him with perpetual cautions. It was always, [...] "Waldron, don't do this," [...] or, [...] "Waldron, you must not do that," [...] or, [...] "Waldron, don't go there." [...] This confinement made Waldron very restless and uneasy; so that, on the whole, both he himself and his mother, too, had a very uncomfortable time of it.|$|R
5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach <b>too</b> <b>closely.</b> Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1945, {{the daily}} comic strip Rikki en Wiske started {{to appear in}} the {{newspaper}} De Nieuwe Standaard, after a positive review by the young illustrator Marc Sleen. It was an immediate success, and the first story ran uninterrupted until 15 December 1945. Vandersteen though was disappointed to see the editor had renamed the strip Rikki en Wiske instead of his suggestion Suske en Wiske, and also felt that Rikki <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> resembled Tintin.|$|E
60|$|Now and then, <b>too,</b> hooded and <b>closely</b> swathed forms would flit {{quickly through}} the crowd, {{followed}} by the inquisitive glances of the humbler folk, as the dainty tip of a broidered shoe or the richly wrought hem of a silken kirtle, protruding below the cloak, betrayed the lady of rank and fashion on gay adventure bent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle Davidoff," [...] the Baron {{began in}} French, with a {{lingering}} cadence as he pronounced her name, and a faint tremor {{in his voice}} that thrilled responsively through her inmost being; [...] "Mademoiselle Davidoff, I have been waiting long for this opportunity of speaking to you alone, because I have something of some importance--to me at least, mademoiselle--about which I wish to confer with you. Mademoiselle, will you do me the honour {{to listen to me}} patiently a minute or two? The matter about which I wish to speak to you is one that may concern yourself, <b>too,</b> more <b>closely</b> than you at first imagine." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{team was}} close to {{qualifying}} to the European Championship in 2000, despite being placed in a very strong qualifying group alongside Ukraine, Russia and current world champions France. The game that took place at Stade de France was one that put Icelandic football to a higher standard. After being 2-0 down at half time, to come back <b>too</b> 2-2, and <b>closely</b> losing in additional time 3-2.|$|R
5|$|Opening of {{the first}} Federal Parliament, 9 May – The date 9 May is also {{sometimes}} suggested, the date on which the first Federal Parliament was opened in Melbourne in 1901, {{the date of the}} opening of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra in 1927, and the date of the opening of the New Parliament House in 1988. The date has, at various times, found support from former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, Tony Beddison, and Geoffrey Blainey. However, the date has been seen by some as being <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> connected with Victoria, and its location close to the start of winter has been described as an impediment.|$|E
5|$|Origins was {{developed}} by the United Kingdom branch of Climax Studios, after it was transferred from the United States branch, who faced issues with the game engine and the vision of the game; the script, monsters, and level design were redone, and aspects of Origins atmosphere and gameplay intentionally replicated those of the first Silent Hill game. Origins was generally positively reviewed, although some reviewers wrote that it followed the formula of the series <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> and failed to add anything new. Its PlayStation 2 port received a lower aggregate score, with criticism directed towards its visuals.|$|E
5|$|The Javan rhino is {{much less}} vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, {{particularly}} in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study. Nevertheless, when humans approach <b>too</b> <b>closely,</b> the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.|$|E
60|$|Our ramble {{this morning}} took us again up the Rhymer's Glen, and by Huntley Bank, and Huntley Wood, {{and the silver}} {{waterfall}} overhung with weeping birches and mountain ashes, those delicate and beautiful trees which grace the green shaws and burnsides of Scotland. The heather, <b>too,</b> that <b>closely</b> woven robe of Scottish landscape which covers the nakedness of its hills and mountains, tinted the neighborhood with soft and rich colors. As we ascended the glen, the prospects opened upon us; Melrose, with its towers and pinnacles, lay below; beyond were the Eildon hills, the Cowden Knowes, the Tweed, the Galla Water, and all the storied vicinity; the whole landscape varied by gleams of sunshine and driving showers.|$|R
5000|$|I {{would like}} to extend my warmest {{congratulations}} to Marion Cotillard, who has just received the Oscar for Best Actress for her masterful interpretation of Édith Piaf in La Vie en Rose, directed by Olivier Dahan. Half a century after Simone Signoret, a French artist has received the Best Actress award at the Oscars. It was a good omen that Catherine Allegret, Simone Signoret's daughter, herself {{had a role in}} La Vie en Rose. Marion Cotillard embodies an Édith Piaf who is unsettling in her realism, emotion and passion. Her interpretation brings to life the story of a woman who gave French chanson its acclaim and authenticity; a singer, <b>too,</b> who <b>closely</b> united France and America.|$|R
5000|$|Following PTSD and {{substance}} abuse/dependence, depression {{is the third}} most common psychiatric disorder among incarcerated women. Depression {{and substance}} abuse, <b>too,</b> are <b>closely</b> linked with experiences of victimization or PTSD, and more so for women than for men. In fact, according to the National Comorbidity Survey, women {{are twice as likely}} as men to experience co-occurring PTSD and depression. [...] The prevalence of depression among incarcerated females links to trends within the general population as well. While women are {{more likely than men to}} suffer internalized problems, such as anxiety and depression, men are more likely to be treated for externalized problems such as delinquency, aggression, and substance abuse. This difference coincides with a gendered discrepancy in the experiences of mentally ill offenders once they enter the criminal justice system.|$|R
5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas. Nichols was seen as <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> identified with the wartime Manhattan Project; he had opinions at variance with the commissioners on whether the Director of Military Applications was a staff or a line position; {{and he had a}} strong disagreement with the commissioners over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find another candidate.|$|E
5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.|$|E
5|$|Underwater {{noise from}} shipping, drilling, {{and other human}} {{activities}} is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> or block their lines of travel.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{integral}} of the first Pontrjagin class is given by an integer and it is identified with instanton number for the U(n) gauge theory on noncommutative R 4. Here the dimension of the vector space V that appear in the ADHM construction is called Instanton number. The calculation is done in operator formalism and the first Pontrjagin class is defined by converge series. The origin of the instanton number is investigated <b>closely,</b> <b>too...</b>|$|R
60|$|De Cartienne and Cecil seated {{themselves}} {{at a small}} round table and began to play almost immediately. I drew an easy chair up to the fire, {{and closed my eyes}} as though I intended going to sleep. As a matter of fact, I meant to watch the game, and <b>closely,</b> <b>too.</b> But Fate decided otherwise. I was really very sleepy, and, though I struggled against it, I was obliged to yield in the end. I fell asleep, and it must have been nearly two hours before I was awakened by a touch on my arm.|$|R
60|$|His greed at dinner, <b>too,</b> was <b>closely</b> {{in keeping}} with the greed of Monsieur Rigaud at breakfast. His avaricious manner of {{collecting}} all the eatables about him, and devouring some with his eyes while devouring others with his jaws, was the same manner. His utter disregard of other people, as shown in his way of tossing the little womanly toys of furniture about, flinging favourite cushions under his boots for a softer rest, and crushing delicate coverings with his big body and his great black head, had the same brute selfishness at the bottom of it. The softly moving hands that were so busy among the dishes had the old wicked facility of the hands that had clung to the bars. And when he could eat no more, and sat sucking his delicate fingers one by one and wiping them on a cloth, there wanted nothing but the substitution of vine-leaves to finish the picture.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his return}} from the war, Porto Alegre resumed his {{political}} career. He became an active advocate for {{the abolition of slavery}} and a patron in the fields of literature and science. His death came on 18 July 1875 while again serving in Parliament. He was highly esteemed until the downfall of the monarchy in 1889. Regarded as <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> associated with the fallen regime, Porto Alegre slipped into obscurity. His reputation was eventually rehabilitated to a certain degree by historians, some of whom consider him to be among Brazil's greatest military figures.|$|E
5|$|Zoology is {{discussed}} in Books VIII to XI. The encyclopedia mentions different sources of purple dye, particularly the murex snail, the highly prized source of Tyrian purple. It describes the elephant and hippopotamus in detail, {{as well as the}} value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming <b>too</b> <b>closely</b> attached to their fish.|$|E
5|$|Early {{coverage}} of P.N.03 by GameSpot and IGN highlighted the game's acrobatics and shooting. P.N.03s gameplay was initially {{similar to that}} of Devil May Cry: Vanessa attacked with two pistols and performed acrobatic moves like Devil May Crys protagonist, Dante. Feeling that it resembled Devil May Cry <b>too</b> <b>closely,</b> Mikami altered the game to reward players for performing defensive moves. Mikami wanted Vanessa to use guns, but the developers were unable to complete the animated graphics for weapons in time for release. The guns were substituted by energy bolts fired from the character's hands. In an effort to meet yearly sales goals, Capcom developed P.N.03 quickly and released it in March 2003. Many of Capcom's releases for the year had underperformed. Viewtiful Joe, another Capcom Five title, was delayed into the next fiscal year to decrease the possible sales that had to be offset. After leaving Capcom, Mikami later incorporated ideas he intended for P.N.03 into the 2010 title Vanquish.|$|E
60|$|The {{bedstead}} is {{seen on the}} right. It is surmounted by a heavy cornice, richly {{carved and}} gilded. This cornice, and the embroidered curtains that hang from it, {{must have been very}} magnificent in their day, though now they are faded and tattered by age. The coverings of the bed are also greatly decayed. Only a little shred of the blanket now remains, and that is laid upon the bolster. The rest of it has been gradually carried away by visitors, who for a long time were accustomed to pull off little shreds of it to take with them, as souvenirs of their visit. These depredations are, however, now no longer allowed. That part of the room is now enclosed by a cord, fastened to iron rods fixed in the floor, so that visitors cannot approach the bed. They are watched, <b>too,</b> very <b>closely,</b> wherever they go, to prevent their taking any thing away. They are not allowed to sit down in any of the chairs.|$|R
5000|$|One Corpse Too Many was {{the first}} Cadfael book to be adapted for {{television}} by Carlton Media for distribution worldwide, in 1994. The [...] "Cadfael" [...] series eventually extended to thirteen 75-minute episodes, all of which starred Sir Derek Jacobi as the sleuthing monk. It was directed by Graham Theakson, the screenplay was by Russell Lewis, and the cast featured Sean Pertwee as Hugh Beringar, Christian Burgess as Adam Courcelle and Michael Grandage as King Stephen. The series was filmed mostly in Hungary. The adaptation for One Corpse <b>Too</b> Many stuck <b>closely</b> to the original novel, with only minor plot or script deviations to cater for the different medium.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot explain it; {{nor have}} I the {{smallest}} notion where we are. I have been aloft, {{and there was}} nothing in sight but this cluster of low islets, far or near. I did fancy, for a moment, I saw a speck like a distant sail, off here, to the northward and eastward, but I rather think it was a gull, or some other sea-bird glancing upward on the wing. I mentioned it to the captain when I came down, and he appeared to believe it a mistake. I have watched that light-house <b>closely,</b> <b>too,</b> ever since we came in, and I have not seen the smallest sign of life about it. It is altogether an extraordinary place!" ...|$|R
