I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{roles of}} women in a Puritan society were to be wives and mothers, and provide the family with their {{everyday}} needs. Women were expected to make the clothing for the family, cook the meals, keep the household clean, and teach the children how to live a Puritan lifestyle. All of these tasks alone could keep a woman busy, yet <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> all done, and still would serve their husbands when they arrived home from work. With this being said, Puritan women were hard workers in everything they did.|$|E
25|$|Ford usually {{gave his}} actors little {{explicit}} direction, although on occasion he would casually {{walk through a}} scene himself, and actors were expected to note every subtle action or mannerism; if they did not, Ford would make them repeat the scene until <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> right, and he would often berate and belittle those who failed to achieve his desired performance. On The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Ford ran through a scene with Edmond O'Brien and ended by drooping his hand over a railing. O'Brien noticed this but deliberately ignored it, placing {{his hand on the}} railing instead; Ford would not explicitly correct him and he reportedly made O'Brien play the scene forty-two times before the actor relented and did it Ford's way.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan won the toss against Ireland {{and elected}} to bat, after conceding 370 against India after setting them in. His {{decision}} {{seemed to be}} vindicated {{at the start of}} Bangladesh's innings, with Tamim Iqbal unleashing a flurry of boundaries immediately, to take Bangladesh to 49/0 after 5 overs. Ireland needed a moment of inspiration and <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> from wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien who did a brilliant stumping to send Imrul Kayes on his way. Ireland quickly built on it, with a direct hit from Ed Joyce catching Junaid Siddiqui short, before both Tamim and Shakib were also dismissed softly. Mushfiqur Rahim and Raqibul Hasan staged a recovery then, and at 147/4 in the 34th over, Bangladesh looked well set for a score above 250 until Mushfiqur top-edged a sweep of George Dockrell. This triggered another collapse, and only a late cameo from Naeem Islam took Bangladesh to 205.|$|E
500|$|The prosecution, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} LaRouche {{and his staff}} solicited US$34million in loans since 1983 with false assurances to potential lenders and showed [...] "reckless disregard for the truth". In his opening statement to the trial, Robinson said, [...] "Members of the jury, this case is about money. It's about how the defendants got money, {{and to a lesser}} extent, what they did with that money when <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>it...</b> The defendants, all seven of them, are charged in engaging in a scheme to defraud. That is, to obtain those loans by making false promises, false pretences, saying things to potential lenders which they knew weren't true." ...|$|E
500|$|Hawley did {{not want}} the {{audience}} to {{get to the end of}} the first run and have [...] "no resolution of any kind", and felt that by creating a complete story with a clear ending related to Haller's conflict with the Shadow King, audiences who were confused by the show's complicated narrative would be able to [...] "feel like <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> through the coherent story." [...] Hawley plotted this story out to take only [...] "eight hours", which is why he asked FX for a shorter first season of eight episodes. Hawley noted that the characters' conflict is a metaphor for an internal struggle, given the Shadow King's position as a parasite within Haller's mind. He was also more interested in setting up a longer-running rivalry than having the antagonist be a [...] "villain-of-the-year", and so the season leaves the character to be an external threat to Haller in the second season.|$|E

500|$|Roth's fake trailer {{contained}} {{elements that}} almost earned Grindhouse an NC-17 rating, including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping, bouncing on a trampoline and getting {{stabbed in the}} vulva, and three decapitations; the first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in a exaggerated manner, the second occurs as the victim's girlfriend performs fellatio on him, and the last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim. According to Roth, [...] "Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature, watching it all jammed together non-stop makes it more shocking. But {{we had a great}} discussion with the ratings board. <b>They</b> <b>got</b> <b>it.</b> Once they saw it with all the bad splices and the distress and scratches they were fine with it."

He was no longer interested in October, and Adam Berg was being looked at to direct. In April 2011, Tim Miller was hired to make his directorial debut with the film, after working on the visual effects for some of the X-Men films. Reynolds had also closed a deal with Fox to produce the film. Miller was hired in part because of his work creating animated short films, including the Academy Award-winning Gopher Broke and a DC Universe Online trailer which was [...] "epic and cinematic, everything [...] their comic book movies to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Stanley Schmidt was an {{assistant}} professor of physics when he became editor of Analog, and his scientific background was well-suited to the magazine's readership. [...] He avoided making drastic changes, and continued the long-standing tradition of writing provocative editorials, though he rarely discussed science fiction. In 1979 he resurrected [...] "Probability Zero", a feature that Campbell had run in the early 1940s that published tall tales—humorous stories with ludicrous or impossible scientific premises. [...] Also in 1979 Schmidt began a series of columns titled [...] "The Alternate View", an opinion column that was written in alternate issues by G. Harry Stine and Jerry Pournelle, and which is still a feature of the magazine as of 2016, though now with different contributors. [...] The stable of fiction contributors remained largely unchanged from Bova's day, and included many names, such as Poul Anderson, Gordon R. Dickson, and George O. Smith, familiar to readers from the Campbell era. [...] This continuity led to criticisms within the field, Bruce Sterling writing in 1984 that the magazine [...] "has become old, dull, and drivelling... It is a situation screaming for reform. [...] Analog no longer permits itself to be read." [...] The magazine thrived nevertheless, and though part of the increase in circulation during the early 1980s may have been due to Davis Publications' energetic efforts to increase subscriptions, Schmidt knew what his readership wanted and made sure <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>it,</b> commenting in 1985: [...] "I reserve Analog for the kind of science fiction I've described here: good stories about people with problems in which some piece of plausible (or at least not demonstrably implausible) speculative science plays an indispensable role".|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{the game}} was more free-form, {{allowing}} players to purchase new powers at any point during the game, but the developers {{found it difficult to}} create a challenging game on that basis, particularly as they could not design missions calling for specific powers that the player may not have at that time. This evolved into the scheme of presenting new powers to the player {{over the course of the}} game, with the developers created guiding rules for which powers were ultimately included in the game and when: the power had to be useful and add something unique to the game, the player would need a chance to use that power immediately after <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>it,</b> and the power would need to be enjoyable to use. The team employed frequent reviews of when these powers were introduced to the player as other gameplay elements were added to the game. Not all powers were necessarily offensive; the [...] "postcognition" [...] power, allowing the player to see the psychic echo of a dead person of where they were before their death, was added as the team found there was an element of fun in tracking the echo through the crowded city. Some powers were cut from the game. One power, gained through the Evil karma path, was called [...] "Minionize", and would have allowed Cole to control the minds of civilians and force them to join him in battle. Although the power was [...] "decidedly evil and very fun to watch", the team felt it wasn't useful to the game, though they managed to retain a hint of it in one of the Evil side missions. Though the team had tested each of the core missions individually with the powers that the player would have based on the game's storyboard, they found that play-testers, who played the missions back-to-back, found the game lacked a variety of combat situations. The developers revisited all the combat scenarios from this feedback to alter the combat layouts as well as adding new enemies, a step that Bridges believes the game [...] "benefited greatly" [...] from. The ability to use Cole's electrical powers to ride along Empire City's elevated train rails was a last-minute addition during the last month of development based on a play-tester's suggestion.|$|E
