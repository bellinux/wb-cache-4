40|$|State <b>takeovers</b> <b>of</b> {{local school}} districts {{represent}} {{one of the most}} recent kinds of education reform. Americans favor both local control over education and state <b>takeovers</b> <b>of</b> failing schools. African American leaders tend to oppose takeovers, but survey data suggest that African American citizens support greater state influence over local education. To explain these paradoxes, this study examines conditions under which jurisdictions support state intervention. It concludes that opposition to this reform emanates from jurisdictions where large percentages of African American voters turn out at high rates. The percentage of a jurisdiction’s schools eligible for <b>takeover</b> because <b>of</b> academic deficiencies exerts a statistically insignificant effect on aggregate-level votes for intervention...|$|R

Supporters first considered forming a breakaway club in 1998 during an attempted <b>takeover</b> <b>of</b> Manchester United by BSkyB. The creation of F.C.

5|$|After World War II many Polish sport clubs resumed slowly their activity. After the {{communist}} <b>takeover</b> <b>of</b> power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948 communists began to curb number of {{organizations in the}} country and tried to achieve the state of only several active nationwide organizations. Therefore, many Polish clubs after 1948 stopped their activity. The ones who still operated were subjected to rising pressure since 1951. Last independent Polish organizations were dissolved in 1952.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} year, the water crisis in Flint, Michigan has {{illustrated}} the potential negative impact that state <b>takeovers</b> <b>of</b> local governments can have.

He finds that these takeovers led to increased representation for Latinos – who had lower levels of political empowerment – on school boards, and poorer representation for blacks...|$|R

40|$|Between 1990 and 2002 a wave <b>of</b> <b>takeovers</b> was {{observed}} in the North American and European energy utilities market. We analyze the impact <b>of</b> these <b>takeovers</b> on market power, studying 70 <b>takeovers</b> <b>of</b> US-American and 69 <b>takeovers</b> <b>of</b> German energy utilities by applying event study methodology. Stock price reactions of acquiring and target firms {{as well as of}} their competitors are used as an indicator for market power. While we do not find any significant results pointing in this direction for transactions in the US, our findings clearly indicate that the potential to increase market power is indeed an important motive for takeovers within the German energy utilities market. acquisitions, energy utilities, market power, oligopoly, regulation...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} real-options model <b>of</b> <b>takeovers</b> and {{disinvestment}} in declining industries. As product demand declines, a first-best closure level is reached, where overall value is maximized by closing {{the firm and}} releasing its capital to investors. Absent <b>takeovers,</b> managers <b>of</b> underleveraged firms always close too late, although golden parachutes may accelerate closure. We analyze the effects <b>of</b> <b>takeovers</b> <b>of</b> under-leveraged firms. <b>Takeovers</b> by raiders enforce first-best closure. Hostile takeovers by other firms occur either at the first-best closure point or too "early". Closure in management buyouts and mergers of equals happens inefficiently "late".
