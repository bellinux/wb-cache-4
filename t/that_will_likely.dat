5|$|Perry and Whitford {{returned}} to Aerosmith in 1984 {{and the band}} signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It {{was not until the}} band's collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described {{as one of the most}} remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year, except 2008. After 47 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music, but is embarking on a farewell tour <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> last several years.|$|E

500|$|After {{surviving}} a bite {{from the}} Infected, Ellie is tasked to Joel to be escorted to the Fireflies. Initially annoyed by Joel's surliness, Ellie starts {{to feel a}} strong attachment to him. After experiencing a traumatizing encounter in the Winter, in which Ellie is nearly raped and murdered by a band of cannibals, she becomes withdrawn and introverted. When Joel finally gets her to the Fireflies, it is discovered {{that she has a}} mutant strain of the Cordyceps fungus growing on her brain, which may be used to create a vaccine; in order to extract the fungi, an operation on Ellie's brain is required, <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> kill her. While she is being prepared for surgery, Joel makes his way to the operating room and carries her to safety. When Ellie awakens from unconsciousness, Joel lies by telling her that the Fireflies found many other subjects, and had stopped looking for a cure. Ellie later confronts him about it, demanding to know the truth. When he reassures her that he is telling the truth, she replies with [...] "Okay".|$|E
500|$|... "Springsteen" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from many music critics. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave the song five stars out of five, calling it [...] "the best song {{from one of}} 2011's top country albums." [...] Matt Bjorke of Roughstock also gave the song five stars of five, writing that [...] "the strong, sing-a-long lyrics and driving, percussive melody brings Eric Church to an accessibility that he's previously never had." [...] Noah Eaton of Country Universe gave it an A-, {{saying that it is}} [...] "a gorgeous, bittersweet anthem-to-be <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> leave even some more hardened hearts simultaneously smile and cry listening." [...] Eaton went on further to say that this song would propel Church's career to the next level. American Songwriter chose the song for its Lyric of the Week feature, for the week of June 11, 2012.

2500|$|The basic game of Hearts {{does not}} include card passing, but the most common {{variants}} do. Before each hand begins, each player chooses three cards, and passes them to another player. The main objectives of passing are to try to become [...] "short" [...] or [...] "void" [...] in a suit, and thus able to play off-suit when that suit is led; or to rid one's hand of [...] "dangerous" [...] cards <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> force that player to take a trick containing penalty points, such as the Ace, King, or Queen of any suit (especially spades and hearts). There are many variations on passing; the most common (popularized by computer versions) rotates passing through four deals; on the first deal, players pass to the left, the second deal to the right, the third across the table. On the fourth deal no cards are passed; the cycle of four deals is then repeated.|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post {{journalist}} Carlos Lozada {{wrote in}} a review that on reading the book, it was [...] "striking to see the full argument unfold and realize that you don't {{have to be a}} zealot to imagine some version of it happening". He concluded: [...] "Lichtman's case for impeachment is plausible, certainly, but it is far stronger as an argument for why Americans never should have elected Trump in the first place. Yet we did. So it may not be too soon for this book, after all. It may be too late." [...] Joy Lo Dico reviewed the book for the London Evening Standard writing: [...] "His argument races through 200 pages, with steam for more." [...] New York Journal of Books contributor Basil Smilke Jr. reviewed the book favorably, writing: [...] "The Case for Impeachment is a good backdrop for conversations <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> remain a part of our national dialogue for some time – or if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought." [...] AM Joy host Joy-Ann Reid said it was a [...] "fascinating book," [...] particularly because Lichtman {{had been one of the}} only prognosticators to correctly predict Trump would win the 2016 election. Joe Scarborough on Morning Joe called the book [...] "liberal catnip".|$|E
2500|$|Despite its {{international}} success, Star Trek Beyond {{was met by}} critics who were less taken with the film. Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film 1½ stars out of 4 and he commented that the filmmakers [...] "should have called it Star Trek Into Drowsiness." [...] Smith later added, [...] "Beyond is tepid when it’s trying to be emotional, moronic when it’s trying to be thrilling and unfunny when it’s trying to be non-unfunny. It lacks a storytelling module: Things just click into place when needed, as when Kirk commands Scotty to rev up a busted old spaceship, Scott says it’s impossible, and 14 seconds later everything is ready to rip." [...] James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave 2½ stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one; The action sequences are frenetic, kinetic, and at times incoherent. This isn’t unexpected; it’s Lin’s trademark. But the plot, credited to Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it’s also instantly forgettable." [...] Dave Robinson of outlet Crash Landed writes that [...] "Star Trek Beyond fails to push beyond its own roots and becomes just another very safe sci-fi popcorn movie in an increasingly crowded market, <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> have you leaving the theatre feeling exactly as you entered." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+ and wrote, [...] "ith Beyond, it feels like just another summer tentpole with not enough going on underneath the tent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} prey to {{predator}} communication is the pursuit-deterrent signal. Pursuit-deterrent signals occur when prey indicates to a predator that pursuit would be unproﬁtable because the signaler {{is prepared to}} escape. Pursuit-deterrent signals provide a beneﬁt to both the signaler and receiver; they prevent the sender from wasting time and energy ﬂeeing, and they prevent the receiver from investing in a costly pursuit that is unlikely to result in capture. Such signals can advertise prey’s ability to escape, and reﬂect phenotypic condition (quality advertisement), or can advertise that the prey has detected the predator (perception advertisement). Pursuit-deterrent signals have been reported {{for a wide variety}} of taxa, including ﬁsh (Godin and Davis, 1995), lizards (Cooper et al., 2004), ungulates (Caro, 1995), rabbits (Holley 1993), primates (Zuberbuhler et al. 1997), rodents (Shelley and Blumstein 2005, Clark, 2005), and birds (Alvarez, 1993, Murphy, 2006, 2007). A familiar example of quality advertisement pursuit-deterrent signal is stotting (sometimes called pronking), a pronounced combination of stiff-legged running while simultaneously jumping shown by some antelopes such as Thomson's gazelle in the presence of a predator. At least 11 hypotheses for stotting have been proposed. A leading theory today is that it alerts predators that the element of surprise has been lost. Predators like cheetahs rely on surprise attacks, proven by the fact that chases are rarely successful when antelope stot. Predators do not waste energy on a chase <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> be unsuccessful (optimal foraging behaviour). [...] Quality advertisement can be communicated by modes other than visual. [...] The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex foot-drumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. [...] The foot-drumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys vibrations through the ground that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit.|$|E
