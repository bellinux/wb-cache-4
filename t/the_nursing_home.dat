5|$|On 11 January 2006, Venerable Ho died peacefully in {{her sleep}} at the Man Fut Tong Nursing Home, at about 9:30pm, just one month before turning 98. Until being {{hospital}}ised in November 2005, she had cooked for and looked after herself and played {{an active role in}} running both the temple and <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home.</b> During her hospital stay, she suffered a stroke, which affected her speech and paralysed the left side of her body.

5|$|The doctor tells Scully that Emily {{is getting}} worse. A {{woman from the}} {{adoption}} agency arrives and wants to stop Scully from making decisions for Emily. Mulder connects {{the names of the}} women in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> to recent births and finds that Dr. Calderon was treating them. Emily reacts badly to being placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Mulder finds medical records with Scully's name on them at <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home,</b> along with a live fetus in a refrigerated chamber. Mulder finds Calderon entering soon after, and Detective Kresge arrives as well. Mulder and Kresge confront Calderon, who attacks Kresge. Despite Mulder's warning Kresge shoots Calderon, whose wounds cause him to spew green blood which incapacitates Kresge. Mulder quickly leaves the building to avoid being affected by the blood. Calderon morphs into Kresge, and deceives Mulder and escapes. Mulder returns to the hospital, where Emily has gone into a coma. Days later Emily has died. Mulder visits Scully at the funeral chapel, telling her that Kresge is recovering and all evidence at <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> and Prangen is gone. The only evidence left is Emily's body, but the agents instead find sand bags in her coffin along with Scully's cross necklace, which she had previously given to Emily.|$|E
40|$|Absenteeism is a {{community}} problem when {{one looks at the}} amount of money spent because of it, an amount that could have been used on other more important matters. For this thesis I set out to study absenteeism in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> here in my town, Trondheim. I wanted to study <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> with relatively low absenteeism rate and <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> with relatively high absenteeism rate to see if I could find differences that could explain the differences in their absenteeism rates. Interviews were used to gather data from four different <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in Trondheim, and the participants were the manager and two caregivers from each <b>nursing</b> <b>home,</b> a total of twelve participants. A qualitative analysis approach was chosen to analyze the data I had obtained in order to increase my understanding of them, and the findings indicate that the differences between <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> are there. <b>The</b> results indicate that there are individual, leadership and organizational differences. Individually, the employees from <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> with low absenteeism rate handle stressful situations better and they are healthier than those from <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> with high absenteeism. On the leadership’s side, the managers from <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> with low absenteeism have more insight into the employees every day work situation; they are more visible, supportive and protective of the employees than the managers of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> with high absenteeism. Organizationally, <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> with low absenteeism use fewer substitutes and they distribute the available caregivers better on the different shifts. Based on this study’s findings, absenteeism is a complex problem that requires commitment from each member and collaboration between {{all the members of the}} organization if it is to be kept at the acceptable. </p...|$|R

5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits {{of people who have}} died in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down on them and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E

After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E

He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier and healthier, which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; {{according}} to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his team-mates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12operations at <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> to which he was taken. His condition worsened {{to the point where the}} doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, other than to say he was in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.|$|E

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{describe}} and analyse how the involvement of relatives is conditioned in <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> from different critical perspectives. Gender perspectives, discourse analysis and intersectional theory are applied, based on social constructionist ontology. The thesis comprises three qualitative papers and data are based on ethnographically-focused fieldwork in three municipal <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in <b>the</b> form of formal/informal interviews, participating observations and the analysis of documents. Based on gender perspectives, the routines and reasonings among nursing staff were studied and thematically analysed in relation to how these conditioned the involvement of relatives in the daily caring activities (I). In the second study (II), <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff were interviewed in groups to describe, discursively analyse and identify the biopolitical meaning in the “involvement discourse” that was collectively constructed in the speech of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff concerning <b>the</b> involvement of relatives. In the last study (III), interviews with relatives were thematically analysed {{in the context of}} intersectional theory about their involvement in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> <b>The</b> findings show that the conditions for relatives’ involvement were dynamic and constantly in re-negotiation, but also conservative and inflexible. This placed relatives in both privileged and unprivileged social positions in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> which were relevant for their involvement. The relatives were considered to be “visitors”, which conditioned the characteristics and levels of involvement in the care of the residents and was linked to gendered notions of the division of labor, both within the groups of relatives and between nursing staff and relatives (I). The involvement of relatives was conditioned by the biopolitics of an “involvement discourse” that prevailed in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes.</b> This built upon family-oriented rhetorics and metaphors that upheld and legitimised notions about relatives. The relatives were considered to be members of the “old” family in relation to the “new” family represented by <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff (II). <b>The</b> relatives described how they were positioned in a betweenship, squeezed between different competing social musts from the older family members, <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> as institutions and <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff (III). Inverting the prevailing picture of the involvement of relatives would make it possible to consider <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> staff as pedagogical, professional and caring “visitors” in <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> for <b>the</b> benefit of the residents and their relatives. This could be achieved through a constructive change management which emphasises <b>the</b> learning of <b>nursing</b> staff, their responsibility and the emotions of relatives, along with a focus on alternative notions of involvement, where relatives are included in the development of quality of care in Swedish <b>nursing</b> <b>homes...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} cost-efficiency in Switzerland’s <b>nursing</b> <b>homes,</b> an issue of concern to policy makers because of {{the rapid growth of}} elderly care expenditure and the aging of the population. <b>The</b> fact that <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in Switzerland exist in different institutional forms, private for-profit, government and non-profit status, raises the issue of their relative cost efficiency. A panel data of 17 public and 19 nonprofit <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> operating over <b>the</b> 9 -year period from 1993 to 2001, in one of the 26 Swiss cantons, Ticino, is studied. Ticino’s <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> are heavily regulated and monitored by the canton’s authorities. However, given that in public firms there are more bureaucratic constraints and agency problems, one can expect a relatively low level of cost-efficiency. In this paper the effect of institutional form on efficiency is studied using a translog stochastic cost-frontier model. Several specifications are used to study the robustness of the results. The results suggest that the institutional form influences the efficiency of <b>the</b> studied <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in that non-profit foundations {{are likely to be more}} cost-efficient than <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> operated by government administration. The results also suggest that a great majority of <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>homes</b> in <b>the</b> sample do not fully benefit from the scale economies.
