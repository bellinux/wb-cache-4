25|$|While {{the onset}} of the Cold War helped spur {{interconnectedness}} between Canada and Latin America the erosion of Soviet power in the late 1980s gave way to an even more robust partnership. By 1985 <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>empire</b> was becoming increasingly bankrupt and unable to promote socialist ideology abroad. For many leftist Latin American states this generated a significant void in support for their vast nationalist/leftist movements. Thus, from the altering world balance came the proliferation of peace talks, the emergence of new economic regimes, and increasingly intertwined relations between the Northern and the Southern Western hemisphere. Canada’s policies towards the region revolved around this new economic order that saw the distribution of power slipping from a bipolar system to multiple states, organizations, and corporations.|$|E
25|$|The controversies {{surrounding}} Hilberg’s book {{were perhaps}} {{the main reason}} why its Polish translation was released only {{after the collapse of}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>empire,</b> five decades after its original publication. The year Hilberg died, he refused an offer to have a shortened version published in translation, insisting that particularly in Poland, where so much of the Holocaust took place, only the full text of his work would suffice. The complete three-volume edition translated by Jerzy Giebułtowski was released in Poland in 2013. Dariusz Libionka from IPN, who led the book launch seminars in various cities, noted that the stories of defiance so prevalent in Poland can no longer be told without his perspective which includes the viewpoint of Holocaust bureaucracy. Reportedly, the last document Hilberg signed before his death was the release form allowing {{for the use of the}} word annihilation (as opposed to destruction) in the Polish title.|$|E

500|$|Innis's trip to Moscow and Leningrad came {{shortly before}} U.S.–Soviet rivalry {{led to the}} hostility of the Cold War. Innis lamented this rise in {{international}} tensions. He saw <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Empire</b> as a stabilizing counterbalance to the American Empire's emphasis on commercialism, the individual and constant change. For Innis, Russia was a society within the Western tradition, not an alien civilization. He abhorred the nuclear arms race, seeing it as the triumph of force over knowledge, a modern form of the medieval Inquisition. [...] "The Middle Ages burned its heretics", he wrote, [...] "and the modern age threatens them with atom bombs." ...|$|E
500|$|With Hitler's approval, Himmler re-established the Einsatzgruppen in the lead-up to {{the planned}} {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union. In March 1941, Hitler addressed his army leaders, detailing his intention to smash <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Empire</b> and destroy the Bolshevik intelligentsia and leadership. His special directive, the [...] "Guidelines in Special Spheres re Directive No. 21 (Operation Barbarossa)", read: [...] "In the operations area of the army, the Reichsführer-SS has been given special tasks on the orders of the Führer, in order to prepare the political administration. These tasks arise from the forthcoming final struggle of two opposing political systems. Within the framework of these tasks, the Reichsführer-SS acts independently and on his own responsibility." [...] Hitler thus intended to prevent internal friction like that occurring earlier in Poland in 1939, when several German Army generals had attempted to bring Einsatzgruppen leaders to trial for the murders they had committed.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of strong {{nationalist}} and separatist movements inside the USSR's republics, Gorbachev tried to avert a dissolution of the Soviet Union in the post-Cold War era. A March 1991 referendum, boycotted by some republics, resulted in a majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the union as a renewed federation. Gorbachev's power was greatly diminished after Russian President Boris Yeltsin played a high-profile role in facing down an abortive August 1991 coup d'état attempted by Communist Party hardliners. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the remaining twelve constituent republics emerged as independent post-Soviet states. The Russian Federation—formerly the Russian SFSR—assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and is recognized as the primary legal successor of the Soviet Union. In summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated: [...] "The collapse of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>empire</b> was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological and economic significance." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Soviet Science Academy {{would be}} pitted against the Communist Academy {{in terms of}} status. Both of them would compete in terms of {{relevancy}} and official recognition by the party. These organizations would struggle within the bureaucracy to gain more resources and respect during the late 1920s. Until party leader [...] Avel Safronovich Enukidnze would be placed in charge of it and he made it superior to the Soviet Academy by declaration. However, the Communist Academy would fade in the 1930s because it was seen as promoting the older Bolshevik ideals and would cease to exist ending the competition between the two. This period of completion though led to a restructuring in the Soviet Sciences Academy {{in order to better}} it so {{that it would not be}} seen as obsolete. It came close in the late 1920s to dissolving the Science Academy but would stop short of it because they decided it was important to have a singular scientific institute. The reasons for nearly destroying it had to do with the danger of thinking minds under the Soviet system and the concern that they did not uphold the right sort of ideals. They would decide that the Science Academy was necessary for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Empire</b> and decided not destroy it but rather to rework the system. This would eventually lead to the Soviet Science Academy dominating as they found it continued to be useful as a way of competing with the West.|$|E
