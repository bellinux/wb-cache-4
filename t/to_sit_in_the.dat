5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{representative}} peers {{were those}} peers {{elected by the}} members of the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of Ireland <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British House of Lords. Until 1999, all members of the Peerage of England held the right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords; they did not elect a limited group of representatives. All peers who were created after 1707 as Peers of Great Britain and after 1801 as Peers of the United Kingdom held the same right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|The Peerage Act 1963 allowed all Scottish peers <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords; it also {{permitted}} all Irish peers <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons for any constituency in the United Kingdom, {{as well as}} to vote in parliamentary elections, {{without being}} deprived of the remaining privileges of peerage.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{aircraft}} was fully booked, a passenger was allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jump {{seat in the}} cockpit. The passenger had no connection with the airline, but was granted permission by the captain via acquaintance in the airline. Several of the other passengers were employees in Widerøe and shouldaccording to the airline's rulesinstead have been seated there. From Namsos to Brønnøysund there were available seats in the cabin, but the jump seat passenger continued <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cockpit. The commission felt that the passenger's conversation with the captain drew his attention and concentration away from his duties at a critical point of the flight. This also disrupted communication between the two pilots, resulting in the mutual control being disrupted.|$|E

5|$|Under the Peerage Act 1963, all Scottish peers {{procured}} {{the right}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, {{and the system}} of electing representative peers was abolished. Scottish as well as British and English hereditary peers lost their automatic right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper House {{with the passage of}} the House of Lords Act 1999. During the debate on the House of Lords Bill, a question arose as to whether the proposal would violate the Treaty of Union. In suggesting that the Bill did indeed violate the Articles of Union, it was submitted that, prior to Union, the Estates of Parliament, Scotland's old, pre-Union parliament, was entitled to impose conditions, and that one fundamental condition was a guarantee of representation of Scotland in both Houses of Parliament at Westminster. It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act of 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way to rescind the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do.|$|E
5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, {{if he or she}} does not already have a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} party does not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stand behind the dugout. Before kick-off, the players were introduced to the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E

5|$|In April 1989, Bush {{arranged}} {{for a group of}} investors to purchase a controlling interest in the Texas Rangers baseball franchise for $89M and invested $500K himself to start. He then served as managing general partner for five years. He actively led the team's projects and regularly attended its games, often choosing <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open stands with fans. Bush's sale of his shares in the Rangers in 1998 brought him over $15million from his initial $800,000 investment.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi {{said that}} she was ready to work with any party in Finland. When pressed by the media she {{said that she}} would not rule out working with the True Finns pending {{cooperation}} on negotiating a government platform. The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two parties are ideologically too far from each other <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{was allowed}} to elect sixteen {{representative}} peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland sat for a single term, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into existence as a Dominion in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued {{to be entitled to}} sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords.|$|E

It was well-received, with audiences reportedly squeezing into the cinema {{to the extent that}} people had <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aisles. Internationally, the film was released in Hong Kong and Macau on 20 October and in Singapore and Malaysia on 10 November 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{residential}} college Bruce Hall {{was named}} in his honour, and he remained {{active in the}} life of the university until his retirement from the position in 1961. Bruce sat as director on many corporate boards in retirement, notably the National Bank of Australia, P and the National Mutual Life Association. In 1947 he became the first Australian <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords (Sir John Forrest had been granted a peerage but died before it could be invested).|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{car in front of}} a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E

5|$|On 9 August 1941, RAF ace Douglas Bader {{bailed out}} over St Omer, France. Bader {{was well known}} to the Luftwaffe {{and at the time}} of his capture had been {{credited}} with 22 aerial victories. Galland himself claimed two Spitfires on that date. Galland and JG 26 entertained Bader over the next few days. Owing to the significant stature of the prisoner, Galland permitted Bader, under escort, <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cockpit of a Bf 109. Apparently, despite losing one of his tin legs in the aircraft, Bader, in a semi-serious way, asked if they wouldn't mind if he took it on a test flight around the airfield. Galland replied that he feared Douglas would attempt to escape and they would have to give chase and shoot at each other again, and declined the request.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} {{presided over by}} ICJ Vice-President Judge Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, {{alongside}} 13 other judges and two ad hoc judges appointed by the two countries. The judges were Raymond Ranjeva from Madagascar, Shi Jiuyong from the People's Republic of China, Abdul G. Koroma from Sierra Leone, Gonzalo Parra Aranguren from Venezuela, Thomas Buergenthal from the United States, Hisashi Owada from Japan, Bruno Simma from Germany, Peter Tomka from Slovakia, Ronny Abraham from France, Kenneth Keith from New Zealand, Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor from Mexico, Mohamed Bennouna from Morocco and Leonid Skotnikov from Russia. As the Bench of the Court did not include any judges of the nationality of either party, the parties exercised their right to choose judges ad hoc <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case. Singapore appointed Pemmaraju Sreenivasa Rao from India, and Malaysia Christopher John Robert Dugard from South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Turf Moor saw {{its first}} {{international}} women's match on 4 September 2003 when England achieved a 1–0 victory over Australia. Two years later, England U20 drew 2–2 with Netherlands U20, with former Burnley midfielder Richard Chaplow captaining the England side. On 25 May 2007, Turf Moor hosted a friendly international between England B and Albania. Although {{the game was}} not officially recognised as a full international, a number of England first-team players played in the game. In October 2007, a Barco video wall was installed in the Cricket Field End, {{which at the time}} accommodated visiting supporters. At the start of the 2009–10 season, a new PA system was installed and the big screen was moved to allow home fans <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cricket Field Stand for the club's inaugural season in the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{returned}} to parliament in 1931, Bruce's service in the Lyons Government was brief. Instead he pursued an international career, accepting appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom in 1933. Bruce became an influential figure in British government circles and at the League of Nations, emerging as a tireless advocate for international cooperation on economic and social problems, especially those facing the developing world. Particularly passionate on improving global nutrition, Bruce {{was one of the}} key figures in the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, serving as the first chairman of its governing council. He was the first Australian <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords, as well as the first Chancellor of the Australian National University. Although his diplomatic career went largely unnoticed in Australia, he continued throughout his life in London to vociferously advocate for Australian interests (particularly during World War II) and asked that his remains be returned to Canberra when he died in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Although the Offaly revolt was {{followed}} by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir Antony St Leger, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, who would remain into the post past Henry's death. Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's. The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, The 4th Earl of Kilmorey (a peer from an Ulster family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans. In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish peers to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish peers the right to stand for election to the House of Commons, and to vote at parliamentary elections.|$|E
