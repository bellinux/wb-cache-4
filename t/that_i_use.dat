But that's not necessarily how it's perceived by everybody else, which I do understand." [...] "I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [...] it’s not something that I would like to do solely." [...] She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles— it was [...] "assumed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> a chamber pot and wear bloomers"—but that her action career [...] "kind of took off a little too much." ...|$|E

Everybody can't articulate about their method, and I can't, if I have a method—and Jane sometimes says <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> the Method, that is, the capital letter Method, without being aware of it.

2500|$|Obama and Clinton {{were in a}} {{statistical}} dead heat in Texas, according to a poll released February 25, 2008. During Obama's sweep of February's post-Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, the March 4 primaries of Texas and Ohio were seen as a firewall for the Clinton campaign. In early polls for these states, Clinton held double digit leads in polls for those states, {{but by the end}} of February Obama had started to erode Clinton's lead in her key demographics, and her lead had been reduced to single digits in some polls. In response to Obama's increases, Clinton's campaign began to increase their attacks on him, including an accusation of plagiarism due to similarities in Obama's campaign speeches and campaign speeches of Obama's campaign's national co-chair and Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, although Patrick specifically stated he told Obama to use it. During the February 21, CNN-Univision debate in Austin, Texas Obama responded to the accusation by saying, [...] "The notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs, who gave me the line and suggested <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> it, I think is silly." [...] Clinton received a round of boos from the crowd when she responded, [...] "Lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change you can believe in; it's change you can Xerox." ...|$|E
