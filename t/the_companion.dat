5|$|Arrian and Plutarch {{claimed that}} Alexander was {{speechless}} by this point, implying {{that this was}} an apocryphal story.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>companion</b> star is a dense {{white dwarf}} star. This {{category}} of stellar object {{has reached the}} end of its evolutionary life span and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion. Instead, under normal circumstances, a white dwarf will steadily radiate away its excess energy, mainly stored heat, growing cooler and dimmer over the course of many billions of years.|$|E

5|$|Bessel roughly {{estimated}} {{the period of}} <b>the</b> <b>companion</b> of Sirius to be about half a century; C. A. F. Peters computed an orbit for it in 1851. It was not until 31 January 1862 that Alvan Graham Clark observed a previously unseen star close to Sirius, later identified as the predicted companion. Walter Adams announced in 1915 {{that he had found}} the spectrum of Sirius B to be similar to that of Sirius.|$|E

5|$|Cataclysmic or {{explosive}} {{variable stars}} {{are those that}} undergo {{a dramatic change in}} their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from <b>the</b> <b>companion</b> star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported the color of <b>the</b> <b>companion</b> as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E
5|$|Fielding's sixteenth play, The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd, {{replaced}} The Covent Garden Tragedy as <b>the</b> <b>companion</b> play to The Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised {{adaptation of}} Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui. It first ran on 23 June 1732 {{and was later}} revised in 1732; both versions were very successful. The plot deals with a young girl pretending to be mute {{to avoid having to}} marry a man she does not like while her doctor is really a man pretending to be a doctor to con the other characters.|$|E

50|$|The new {{community}} of seminarians and priests adopted <b>the</b> name <b>Companions</b> of <b>the</b> Cross, after Fr. Bedard {{used the phrase}} in a homily for the Feast of the Triumph of the Cross. In February 1988 Archbishop Plourde granted <b>the</b> <b>Companions</b> of <b>the</b> Cross recognition as a Public Association of the Faithful. In 1999 <b>the</b> first <b>Companions</b> of <b>the</b> Cross ministries outside of the Archdiocese of Ottawa were established at St. Timothy’s Parish and York University Catholic Chaplaincy in Toronto, Ontario and Queen of Peace Parish in Houston, Texas. In 1999, <b>the</b> <b>Companions</b> of <b>the</b> Cross assumed leadership of the Catholic Charismatic Center in Houston. <b>The</b> <b>Companions</b> were formally established as a Society of Apostolic Life in 2003.|$|R
40|$|We perform N-body {{simulations}} of young triple systems {{consisting of two}} low-mass companions orbiting around a significantly more massive primary. We find that, when the orbits of <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> are coplanar and not too widely separated, {{the chance of a}} collision between <b>the</b> two <b>companions</b> can be as high as 20 per cent. Collisions between one of <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> (always <b>the</b> less massive) and the primary can also occur in systems with unequal-mass <b>companions.</b> <b>The</b> chance of collisions is a few per cent in systems with more realistic initial conditions, such as with slightly non-coplanar orbits and unequal-mass <b>companions.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> start widely separated then collision are very rare except in some cases when the total mass of <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> is large. We suggest that collisions between members of young multiple systems may explain some unusual young multiple systems such as apparently non-coeval companions. ...|$|R
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. <b>The</b> <b>companion</b> will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Halo Legends was {{originally}} {{to be released}} on February 9, but launch was pushed back a week to February 16. The compilation comes in three different retail packages: a standard DVD release with all the episodes, a two-disc special-edition which contains additional commentary, and the Blu-ray Disc edition, featuring the special-edition features and {{a summary of the}} Halo storyline. The film's United States premiere was held at the AMC Metreon in San Francisco on February 10, with <b>the</b> <b>companion</b> soundtrack released by Sumthing Distribution the day previous.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2009, July 3, 2009, and August 8, 2009, {{use of the}} NIFS {{integral}} field spectrograph with ALTAIR {{allowed the}} astronomers {{to collect data on}} the spectrum of the faint object and its star.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>companions</b> travel across <b>the</b> northlands towards Silverymoon, encountering barbarian tribes, an {{eccentric}} wizard family (the Harpells) {{and the soldiers}} of Nesme, who react to Drizzt with hostility, forcing <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> to divert across the Evermoors, {{also known as the}} Trollmoors, an ordeal that almost makes an end of them. Upon reaching Silverymoon, Drizzt is again shunned, but <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> are directed by Lady Alustriel to the Herald's Holdfast, where they obtain the final clues to the location of Mithril Hall.|$|R
5000|$|Each novel usually {{begins with}} <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> {{arriving}} at a frequently unknown redoubt by MAT-TRANS. If the situation is impossible or hostile <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> can use <b>the</b> [...] "last destination" [...] feature of the transporter {{to return to the}} sending location. If the redoubt is unknown then <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> usually explore, looking for weapons and supplies which they rarely find. Sometimes they are lucky and find a working shower or stored food which they always utilize or take. The story picks up speed once the characters leave the redoubt and explore the surrounding countryside. Frequently <b>the</b> <b>companions</b> are captured or forced into a confrontation with the local barons. Each novel reveals a little of the characters' history, motivations and the regional location where they arrived.|$|R

5|$|The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town {{was written}} during 1729. The first press {{announcement}} of the play appeared on 18 March 1730 in the Daily Post, stating {{that it was in}} rehearsal. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper shortly afterwards mentioning restricted seating and high ticket prices, suggesting that the play was expected to be a popular entertainment. It opened on Easter Monday, 30 March 1730, at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and shortly thereafter was billed alongside The Cheats of Scapin. The last act was later made into <b>the</b> <b>companion</b> piece to Hurlothrumbo for one show.|$|E
