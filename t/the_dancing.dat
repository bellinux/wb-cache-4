5|$|The {{texts and}} artwork of Jainism show Indra as a dancer, {{although}} not identical but generally resembling <b>the</b> <b>dancing</b> Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly {{in their respective}} mudras. For example, in the Jain caves at Ellora, extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of Tirthankaras {{in a manner similar}} to Shiva Nataraja. The similarities in the dance iconography suggests that there may be a link between ancient Indra and Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, {{such as those of}} <b>the</b> <b>dancing</b> armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was a feature of the international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.|$|E

5|$|The red-and-white spotted {{toadstool}} is {{a common}} image in many aspects of popular culture. Garden ornaments and children's picture books depicting gnomes and fairies, such as the Smurfs, often show fly agarics used as seats, or homes. Fly agarics have been featured in paintings since the Renaissance, albeit in a subtle manner. In the Victorian era they became more visible, becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings. Two {{of the most famous}} uses of the mushroom are in the video game series Super Mario Bros. (specifically two of the power-up items and the platforms in several stages), and <b>the</b> <b>dancing</b> mushroom sequence in the 1940 Disney film Fantasia.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics who praised the liveliness {{of the track}} and noted the consistency with other songs performed by Martin. It peaked at number five on the US Hot Latin Songs and became Martin's 23rd top-ten single on the chart. An accompanying music video, directed by Kátia Lund and Lívia Gama of Bossa Nova Films, was shot in Rio de Janeiro. It features Martin singing and dancing on the beach accompanied by around 100 other people. Martin performed the song on several occasions including at the 2014 Latin Billboard Music Awards and on season eighteen of <b>the</b> <b>Dancing</b> with the Stars US series.|$|E
5|$|While both {{settings}} seem {{to suggest}} that Madonna's characters live in the barrio and may be Latina themselves, the portrayal of Madonna in <b>the</b> <b>dancing</b> scenes (lush, flashy, colorful) contrasts with the Latinos in the street (sparsely worn out dresses). She dances around and even flirts but does not get really involved with them as the last scene shows Madonna dancing off the screen. The video symbolizes the link between Latino culture and Catholicism. The two characters symbolize the restrained and passionate sides of Catholicism, which author Rettenmund has described as Madonna's take on the religion.|$|E

5|$|Beyoncé dances seductively {{towards the}} men as scenes of Beyoncé wearing several outfits are seen, {{the first of}} which is a white evening gown as she grasps the chains of two chained hyenas. As the {{confrontation}} escalates, Beyoncé appears next to several flaming vehicles, and she undergoes another costume change. Returning to the main plot, the video shows Beyoncé in front {{of a small group of}} her female army, wearing a yellow ensemble and black heeled-boots. As <b>the</b> <b>dancing</b> commences, scenes of the two clashing armies are seen while Beyoncé writhes in sand. The females, now an even larger group, are shown dancing, using powerful and emphatic movements, in front of the male army with alternating costumes and several flags in the background. The video ends with the front line of females confronting the men face to face, raising their right arms and saluting to them as Beyoncé rips off the male general's badge, placing it on herself.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Ox, {{catching}} him alone, reveals Georges's true parentage, and persuades him {{to drink}} a magic potion {{that allows him to}} go beyond the limits of the probable and journey through the impossible.

A family friend, <b>the</b> <b>dancing</b> master Tartelet (from The School for Robinsons), is seduced by the opportunity to travel and drinks his own share of the potion before anyone can stop him. Ox sets off with all three travelers, while Volsius makes secret plans to come along and protect Georges from Ox's influence. Along the way, another Dane, Axel Valdemar, also gets mixed up into the journey and becomes a friend of Tartelet.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preliminary}} study for The World Before the Flood {{now in the}} York Art Gallery, the broad structure {{is similar to that}} of the finished work, but the focus is more strongly on the central group of women.

In the finished work, she gestures outwards from the circle, creating a clear narrative flow in the positions of the figures: from the single men on the left, to the man choosing a wife, to the group of dancing women, to the couple leaving the circle of dancers to join the reclining lovers on the far right.|$|E

5|$|Music {{and singing}} were {{important}} in England during the medieval period, {{being used in}} religious ceremonies, court occasions and to accompany theatrical works. Singing techniques called gymel were introduced in England in the 13th century, accompanied by instruments such as the guitar, harp, pipes and organ. Henry IV sponsored an extensive range of music in England, while his son Henry V brought back many influences from occupied France. Carols became an important form of music in the 15th century; originally these had been a song sung during a dance with a prominent refrain — the 15th century form lost <b>the</b> <b>dancing</b> and introduced strong religious overtones. Ballads were also popular from the late 14th century onwards, including the Ballad of Chevy Chase and others describing the activities of Robin Hood. Miracle plays were performed to communicate the Bible in various locations. By the late 14th century, these had been extended into vernacular mystery plays which performed annually over several days, broken up into various cycles of plays; a handful have survived into the 21st century. Guilds competed to produce the best plays in each town and performances were often an expression of civic identity.|$|E
5|$|Swigmore University, which Moe attends in the episode, is {{a parody}} of Skidmore College. The {{professor}} working at Swigmore University is based on Professor Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr. from the television series The Paper Chase. Moe's new bar M is a parody on the luxury boutique hotel W in New York City that Gould had visited once. The monitors showing eyeballs are based on similar decorations found in the elevators in the St Martin's Lane hotel, where the Simpsons staff hosted a Simpsons festival. The doorman in front of M was modeled after special effects creator and actor Greg Nicotero. The dance that Homer, Carl and Lenny perform in Moe's bar is a takeoff on <b>the</b> <b>dancing</b> in the comedy/drama film Coyote Ugly, in which the dancers performed on the bar counter, much like Homer, Carl and Lenny do in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} the land of Aloadin, who owns a great garden paradise, and he is invited to feast with the people, but he is unwilling to imbibe alcohol or be taken in by <b>the</b> <b>dancing</b> women that seek to entice him. The temptations {{overwhelm}} him {{to the point where he}} can no longer tolerate them and he flees. Shortly after leaving, he discovers one of the women being attacked by a man wanting to have his way with her. It is revealed that the woman was Oneiza, who was captured, and that Aloadin was a sorcerer. After saving Oneiza, Thalaba is determined to stop the sorcerer and he ends up killing him. Following this, they are praised by a Sultan that Aloadin wanted to kill, and Thalaba decides to marry Oneiza. Before they can finish their marriage, she dies and Thalaba is left to mourn over her grave. While mourning, a spirit that appears to be Oneiza begins to haunt Thalaba and claim that God disapproves of the young warrior. However, Moath comes and is able to recognise the spirit as a vampire. After killing the vampire, the real Oneiza comes to guide Thalaba onwards.|$|E
