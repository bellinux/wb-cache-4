The softwareof measurement system for the transmission line debugging was designed. The transmission line is based on wireless communication. <b>This</b> <b>software</b> <b>of</b> measurement system is composed of acquisition controller software system and center station software system. The measurement system realized the function of data storage, waveform display, data analysis, automatic report generation and others. The field experiments were conducted at a 500 kV substation in a Power Grid. The experimentproved the validity and reliability of the measurement system. The measurement system can avoid complex wiring work in substation debugging field, thus improve theexperimental efficiency...|$|E
