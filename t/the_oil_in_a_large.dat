5000|$|A {{water vapor}} {{explosion}} creates a high volume of gas without producing environmentally harmful leftovers. The controlled explosion of {{water has been}} used for generating steam in power stations and in modern types of [...] steam turbines. Newer steam engines use heated oil to force drops of water to explode and create high pressure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> controlled chamber. The pressure is then used to run a turbine or a converted combustion engine. Hot oil and water explosions are becoming particularly popular in concentrated solar generators, because the water can be separated from <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> closed loop without any external energy. Water explosion is considered to be environmentally friendly if the heat is generated by a renewable resource.|$|R
