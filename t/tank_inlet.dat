40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. A {{need was}} {{identified}} to test multi–layer vacuum super insulation (MLVSI) used in cryogenic applications for hydrogen storage. The study {{focuses on the}} application of commercially available MLVSI to a locally patented liquid hydrogen cryogenic storage system. This led to an investigation {{of different types of}} multi–layer vacuum insulation configurations, as well as further research on <b>tank</b> <b>inlet</b> coupling configurations. It includes the manufacturing of a liquid nitrogen testing cryostat to be able to test and evaluate the system performance. The first set of tests was based on the development of an inlet coupling configuration to limit heat transfer through the inner <b>tank</b> <b>inlet,</b> of a double cryogenic tank system in order to reduce gas boil–off. The couplings were manufactured {{in the form of a}} bellow to handle cryogenic vacuum levels, while ensuring low heat transfer rates between inner and outer tanks. It was found that various coupling designs can be considered to limit gas boil–off. The second set of tests was conducted on a specific MLVSI configuration to determine its effectiveness to insulate the spherical header surface of a typical hydrogen storage vessel. The installation procedure, to limit heat transfer and boil–off due to edge effects in this configuration was investigated. It was found that insulation–overlap–edge effects will always have an impact on insulation performance when a spherical header of a storage vessel is insulated, due to its specific geometry. A time efficient way to install MLVSI on such a spherical header is presented and evaluated. Further investigations were carried out by combining findings into one single system to determine the performance of an optimised insulated cryogenic system. It was found that copper plate discs installed between the vanes of a bellowed inlet/outlet nozzle is the most promising to limit heat transfer to the cryogenic fluid. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} master {{thesis is}} to analyse and develop design methods for {{building}} integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) technology at the Green Energy Laboratory (GEL) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in China. PV/T technology generates electrical and thermal energy in a smaller area, compared to solely PV panels and solar collectors. For a PV panel, the electrical efficiency will decrease when the surface temperature increases, typically during peak solar irradiation. The air or water circulating in the PV/T component cools the PV surface, maintaining higher efficiency and thus higher energy generation. A water based PV/T component has been calibrated and validated according to measurements conducted in Shanghai, China. Furthermore, the component was used to model a PV/T façade at the south wall of GEL. A façade integrated PV/T system utilising air as heat transfer medium was also modelled, but not validated, as no measurements were available for this component. The BIPV/T systems were optimised for five parameters; dead band, storage tank size, mass flow rate, <b>tank</b> <b>inlet</b> height from heat source and <b>tank</b> <b>inlet</b> height from mains water supply. Simulations have been conducted to analyse the effect of building integration, both on the building energy demand and the BIPV/T system operation. Simulations were carried out for the same building model with air based BIPV/T system, water based BIPV/T system, air based PV/T system, water based PV/T system and PV façade (BIPV). The results show that PV/T integrated to the building façade has negligible effect on the total energy demand of the building. The electrical efficiency was highest for the air based BIPV/T system and the water based BIPV/T showed the largest amount of collected thermal useful energy. The BIPV showed the highest electrical solar fraction, as {{a significant amount of}} fan energy required for operation of the air based BIPV/T system results in reduced solar fraction for that system...|$|E

The PCM cold storage tank was coupled with the evaporator to store the excess cooling capacity of ejector cooling system and provide cooling effect when the ejector did not operate. Medium temperature source (from solar collector or industrial waste) at temperature of 120 °C was the main driving force for ejector cooling system.

Current methods of sealing the tanks were shown to be inadequate but were improved by sealing the <b>tank</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet using plastic sheeting and adhesive tape. Application rates of 3 · 33 g of phosphine per tonne of grain (as currently recommended in Swaziland) were more than adequate, provided the tanks were well sealed.

However, the pattern of gas release and subsequent decay in concentrations were similar for "Tiny Bags" and tablets. As {{a result of the}} high degree of gas tightness which can be achieved using metal grain tanks, the recommended application rates for phosphine could be reduced.

40|$|Chlorine is {{extensively}} used {{to disinfect}} drinking water supply. However, {{the design of}} chlorine contact tank is usually based on the volume displacement criterion, paying attention that detention time {{would be at least}} of half an hour. This criterion relies upon the assumption that plug-flow conditions hold along the tank. However, the existence and arrangement of baffles in the tank, and the <b>tank</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet configurations can result in a much more complex flow pattern, where turbulent mixing, dead-zones and short-circuiting exist. This situation could result in an inefficient use of chlorine due to the formation of potentially carcinogenic compounds, which originate from residual chlorine in the tank. Further some bypassing allows some out-coming flow with less of the standard amount of contact with the chlorine dose. Therefore, understanding hydrodynamics and mass-transfer characteristics within a contact tank is very useful. The objective of the paper is to present the preliminary results of a numerical study undertaken to investigate hydrodynamics and turbulent transport and mixing inside a contact tank.

40|$|A {{properly}} designed, installed ao 1 d maintained {{septic tank}} system is an approved method of sewage treatment for private residences in rural or urban areas where public sewage treatment {{systems are not}} available. The components of a septic system are the house sewer, the septic tank and the absorption field, as illustrated in Figure 1. Sewage flows to the septic tank through the house sewer. In the septic tank, the solids are separated from the liquids, undergo anaerobic digestion and are stored as sludge {{at the bottom of}} the tank. The liquid (septic tank effluent) flows to the absorption field where it percolates into the soil. The soil acts as a final treatment by removing bacteria, pathogens and fine particles. All household wastes and normal amounts of cleaning materials, including soaps, detergents, bleaches, drain cleaners and other mild chemical preparations, can be tolerated by a septic system. Roof drains and foundation drains should not be connected to the septic tank system. These sources of clear water only overload the septic system and may cause premature failure of the absorption field. Septic Tank Location The site of a septic tank is usually determined by the location of major bathroom and kitchen plumbing within the home and by the slope of the land. Locate septic tanks at least 15 feet (4. 5 m) from the foundation walls and approximately straight out from the point where the house sewer pipe goes through the wall. Table 1 gives minimum distances between the septic tank system and water lines, property lines and surface water supplies. Locate the septic tank out of high traffic areas where excessive loads may damage the tank top. Keep clear of areas subject to flooding, ponding or surface drainage from surrounding areas. The location should be accessible to a driveway or other acceptable route so a tank truck can be driven close enough to pump out the sludge and clean the tank. Do not locate septic tanks under sidewalks or patios where the tank is inaccessible for pumping. Consider the possibility of future expansion and locations for additions, such as sidewalks, patios, garages and storage buildings, before selecting the tank site. Sizing and Septic Tank Construction The minimum septic tank size for any installation is 1, 000 gallons (3, 800 I). For more than 3 bedrooms, add an additional capacity of 250 gallons (950 I) per bedroom. Garbag 3 disposals add an extra load to the system, requiring about 25 percent additional tank capacity. Minimum tank capacities are listed in Table 2. Septic tanks must be watertight and constructed of sound and durable materials that are not subject to excessive corrosion, frost damage, cracking or buckling due to settlement or back filling. Common construction materials include concrete, fiberglass and steel. Minimum liquid depth of the tank should be 4 feet (1. 2 m). The inlet should not be less than 2 inches (5 cm) above the liquid level. Many septic tank shapes are satisfactory and the shape may depend on the type of material used.

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} hot water withdrawal from the storage tank of a solar system on the utilization percentage of solar heat gain, the mixing characteristics of hot water inside the storage <b>tank</b> with different <b>inlet</b> velocities of the supply cold water is studied by numerical simulations in this work. A parameter, called the entrainment factor, is introduced as an indication to quantify the water mixing in the tank. The useful thermal energy removal from the <b>tank</b> for different <b>inlet</b> velocities of the supply cold water is calculated and analyzed. The numerical simulation results show that {{an increase in the}} inlet velocity of the supply cold water will result in a larger entrainment factor and stronger water mixing in the tank. Hence the extent of water mixing is a key factor to determine the useful energy removal from the <b>tank</b> and the <b>inlet</b> velocity of the supply cold water is the main factor to determine the entrainment factor. The water discharging curves are obtained under different operation conditions and it is found that the temperature of the discharged water undergoes three stages: stable high-temperature stage, rapid decrease stage and stable low temperature stage, and the time durations of these stages are related with the inlet velocity. The useful energy removal from the tank under various operation conditions is calculated, and a relation to estimate such energy is obtained.
