5|$|Several {{groups of}} starfish, {{including}} Valvatida and Forcipulatida, possess pedicellariae. In Forcipulatida, such as Asterias and Pisaster, they occur in pompom-like tufts {{at the base}} of each spine, whereas in the Goniasteridae, such as Hippasteria phrygiana, the pedicellariae are scattered over the body surface. Some are thought to assist in defence, while others aid in feeding or in the removal of organisms attempting <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> the starfish's surface. Some species like Labidiaster annulatus, Rathbunaster californicus and Novodinia antillensis use their large pedicellariae to capture small fish and crustaceans.|$|E

5|$|The Miami and Pottawatomie nations {{returned}} to Indiana following the war. Other tribes, {{such as the}} Algonquian Lenape, were pushed westward into the Midwest from the East Coast by encroachment of European colonists. Around 1770 the Miami invited the Lenape <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> the White River. The Shawnee arrived in present-day Indiana after the three other nations. These four nations were later to be participants in the Sixty Years' War, a struggle between native nations and European settlers {{for control of the}} Great Lakes region. Hostilities with the tribes began early. The Piankeshaw killed five French fur traders in 1752 near the Vermilion River. But the tribes also traded successfully with the French for decades.|$|E
5|$|The first archaeological {{evidence}} for human foraging on Madagascar dates to 2000BC. Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350BC and AD550 by Austronesian peoples arriving on outrigger canoes from Borneo. These were joined around AD 1000 by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa. Other groups continued <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more sub-groups {{of which the}} largest are the Merina of the central highlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} Xocolo and Amatique, {{backed by the}} threat of Spanish action, persuaded a {{community}} of 190 Toquegua <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> the Amatique coast in April 1604. The new settlement immediately suffered a drop in population. In 1628 the towns of the Manche Ch'ol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Francisco Morán as their ecclesiastical head. Morán moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements.|$|E

5|$|The revolt {{developed}} from local disturbances {{in the first}} half of 1437. The villagers from Daróc, Mákó and Türe (Dorolțu, Macău and Turea) assaulted the abbot of Kolozsmonostor at Bogártelke (Băgara) in March. In Alsó-Fehér County and around Déva (Deva), the serfs gathered into small bands and attacked the noblemen's manors. Peasants from Alparét and Bogáta (Bogata de Sus) were the first <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> the top of the nearby Mount Bábolna in May or June. Being surrounded by high cliffs and dense forests and crowned by a plateau of about , the mountain was an ideal place for defence. Following the Taborites' military strategy, the rebels established a camp on the flat summit of the mountain.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 TGS event, it was {{revealed}} that Hope's silver hair was meant for Lightning, but when her hair color was decided as pink, Hope received the silver hair coloring instead. Hope's Academy uniform for XIII-2 was designed by Hideo Minaba. While he was portrayed as sensitive and vulnerable in XIII, for XIII-2, the game's director wished to portray Hope as a more mature, authoritative person. According to Toriyama, how Hope matured, as seen through Lightning's eyes, formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns. He was originally going to have a third unique design for the game, but the team eventually decided <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> his original teenage appearance. In a later interview, he said that while the character was much liked by the team, he felt that Hope lacked the heroic image that could make him a leading character. Watanabe later said that he felt Hope helped complete Lightning's character and enable her to grow as a person. Hope is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|In 1698, Zanzibar {{became part}} of the {{overseas}} holdings of Oman, falling {{under the control of the}} Sultan of Oman. In 1832, or 1840 (the date varies among sources), Said bin Sultan moved his capital from Muscat in Oman to Stone Town. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations, using the island's slave labour. Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom Said encouraged <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> the island. After his death in 1856, two of his sons, Majid bin Said and Thuwaini bin Said, struggled over the succession, so Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate principalities; Thuwaini became the Sultan of Oman while Majid became the first Sultan of Zanzibar. During his 14-year reign as Sultan, Majid consolidated his power around the East African slave trade. His successor, Barghash bin Said, helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and largely developed the country's infrastructure. The third Sultan, Khalifa bin Said, also furthered the country's progress toward abolishing slavery.|$|E

5|$|In 376, a large band of Goths asked Emperor Valens for {{permission}} <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> the southern {{bank of the}} Danube River on terms similar to the Franks. The Goths were also accepted into the empire as foederati; however, they rebelled later that year and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Adrianople. The heavy losses that the Roman military suffered during this defeat ironically forced the Roman Empire to rely still further on such foederati troops to supplement its forces. In 382, the practice was radically extended when federated troops were signed up en masse as allied contingents of laeti and foederatii troops separate from existing Roman units. Near-constant civil wars during the period 408 and 433 between various Roman usurpers, emperors and their supposed deputies such as Constantine III, Constantius III, Aetius and Bonifacius resulted in further losses, necessitating the handing over of more taxable land to foederati.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, a large anti-Polish protest {{took place}} in Lazdijai, with cries to march on Sejny. The last Lithuanian attempt to retake the town was made on August 28. The Lithuanians (about 650 men) were {{defeated}} by the combined forces of the Polish Army (800 men) and PMO volunteers (500 men). On August 27, the Poles officially demanded that Lithuanians retreat behind the Foch Line. On September 1, Rudnicki announced incorporation of PMO volunteers into the 41st Infantry Regiment. During the negotiations on September 5, representatives {{of the two groups}} agreed <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> a detailed demarcation line; Lithuanians agreed to retreat by September 7. The Polish regular army units did not cross the Foch Line, and refused to aid the PMO insurgents still operating on the Lithuanian side.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 1846, after a final {{attempt to}} {{pressure}} Mexico <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> a boundary for Texas, Secretary of War William L. Marcy ordered Brigadier General Zachary Taylor {{to move his}} army, which included May's dragoon squadron, to the Rio Grande. Taylor's destination was the river's north bank, directly opposite the Mexican town of Matamoros, which stood at a natural choke-point and controlled access to well-traveled routes to the south. When Taylor refused to leave the region, Mexican cavalry ambushed a dragoon detachment under Captain Seth B. Thornton on April 25, 1846, which officially commenced hostilities. On May 8, 1846, the two main forces met at the Battle of Palo Alto, where May's squadron was held in reserve and mounted an unsuccessful cavalry charge.|$|E

5|$|The woman, who is {{probably}} {{in her late}} teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck (c.1395 – 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes {{to focus attention on}} the sitter. It was not until Hans Memling (c.1435–1494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape. In this work the flat setting allows the viewer <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on</b> the woman's face and quiet self-possession. Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; {{it is likely that the}} angles created by the sitter's hennin and dress were once much sharper.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, an {{imperial}} investigation into Gubazes's murder {{brought to light}} Martin's culpability. His military successes spared his life, but cost him his command; he was replaced as magister militum per Armeniam by Justin in spring 557. It was in this capacity that in late 557 Justin received the first Avar embassy to the Byzantine Empire. The Avars, who had fled their ancestral lands in Central Asia before {{the rise of the}} Göktürks, asked for imperial protection and for land <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>on.</b> Justin forwarded them to Constantinople, where they arrived in December. Turned away from the Empire and towards the plains of the Ukraine by Justinian, the Avars defeated enemy after enemy and eventually reached the northeastern bank of the Danube in 561/562. There they again encountered Justin, who had just been transferred to the command of the quaestura exercitus covering the lower Danubian limes (the Limes Moesiae). At this time, the Avars demanded to settle in Byzantine imperial territory in Scythia Minor, whose defences had been devastated by a recent Kotrigur invasion led by Zabergan. Here, Justin played a crucial role and gained great fame, by learning of the Avars' intentions and warning Justinian. Consequently, the Avar embassy to Constantinople was detained while the Byzantine defences were put in order. With Justin continuing to maintain a careful watch over the Danube river, the Avars contented themselves with the annual subsidy paid by Byzantium, and left the Empire in peace for some years to come.|$|E
