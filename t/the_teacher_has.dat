After the Japanese surrender, the British Military Administration took charge of Singapore and {{attempts were made to}} revive the school again. The school had lost most of its administrative documents, records, its former students and teachers at the aftermath of the war. The school was finally re-opened on the premises of Outram School by headmaster, Percival Frank Aroozoo on 13 May 1946. Aroozoo, a Eurasian of Portuguese descent was the grandson of Simon Aroozoo, who happened to be a close friend and colleague of Gan Eng Seng when both men worked together at Guthrie and Company for fifty years. A year later, the school was moved to the former Japanese National School building (now the Stamford Arts Centre) at No. 155 Waterloo Street and remained there until 1951. During this period, GESS was still a primary school. The teething problems were soon over and on December 1949, Aroozoo launched the school's periodical, Onward to chronicalise the legacy and milestones of the school. On 29 May 1950, GESS became the first school in Singapore to form the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). Its formation was an initiative by Aroozoo: [...] "Parents as much as <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> {{a great deal to do}} with the training and development of a child as a useful member of the community." ...|$|E

The interviewees mentioned development practices such as projects and training sessions, but participation in them happened only occasionally and participation was voluntary, depending on <b>the</b> <b>teacher.</b> <b>The</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>had</b> networks with various stakeholders in institutions related to their subject, e.g. the church, music college or police.|$|R

6000|$|... 1. Interesting {{the pupils}} in their studies. There are various {{principles}} of human nature, {{which may be}} of great avail, in accomplishing this object. Making intellectual effort, and acquiring knowledge, are always pleasant to the human mind, unless some peculiar circumstances render them otherwise. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has,</b> therefore, only to remove obstructions, and sources of pain, and the employment of his pupils will be, of itself, a pleasure.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> {{proceeded}} thus far, he finds, {{as he looks}} around the room, that the countenances of his pupils are assuming a listless and inattentive air. One is restless in his seat, evidently paying no attention. Another has reclined his head upon his desk, lost in a reverie, and others are looking round the room, at one another, or at the door, restless and impatient, hoping the dull lecture will soon be over.|$|E
60|$|It is {{apart from}} my purpose {{to explain the}} mirage scientifically, and not {{altogether}} in my power. Every schoolboy can do so, I suppose, {{to the satisfaction of}} his teacher if <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> not himself seen the phenomenon, or has seen it only in the broken, feeble and evanescent phases familiar to the overland passenger; but for my part I am unable to understand how the simple causes affirmed in the text-books sufficiently account for the infinite variety and complexity of some of the effects said to be produced by them. But of this the reader shall judge for himself.|$|E

6000|$|These are the {{essential}} sources of difficulty with which <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> to contend; but, as I shall endeavor {{to show in}} succeeding chapters, though they cannot be entirely removed, they can be so far mitigated by the appropriate means, as to render the employment a happy one. I have thought it best however, as this work will doubtless be read by many, who, when they read it, are yet to begin their labors, to describe frankly and fully to them the difficulties which beset the path {{they are about to}} enter. [...] "The wisdom of the prudent is, to understand his way. It is often wisdom to understand it beforehand." ...|$|E
60|$|In ill-regulated {{families}} in that region, {{the care of}} the children is from the first in the hands of half-barbarized negroes, whose power of moulding and assimilating childish minds is peculiar, so that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> to contend constantly with a savage element in the children which seems to have been drawn in with the mother's milk. It is, in a modified way, something the same result as if the child had formed its manners in Dahomey or on the coast of Guinea. In the fierce quarrels which were carried on between the children of this family, I had frequent occasion to observe this strange, savage element, which sometimes led to expressions and actions which would seem incredible in civilized society.|$|E
60|$|It is not, however, {{exactly the}} {{pleasure}} of exercising ingenuity in contrivance, that I refer to here; for <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> not, after all, {{a great deal of}} absolute contriving to do,--or rather his principal business is not contriving. The greatest and most permanent source of pleasure to the boy, in such a case as I have described, is his feeling that he is accomplishing a great effect by a slight effort of his own; the feeling of power; acting through the intervention of instrumentality, so as to multiply his power. So great would be this satisfaction, that he would almost wish to have some other similar work assigned him, that he might have another opportunity to contrive some plan for its easy accomplishment.|$|E

The improving of <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> welfare supported <b>the</b> several efforts to improve <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> professionalism...|$|R
6000|$|This may {{easily be}} {{illustrated}} by supposing a particular case. <b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has,</b> we will imagine, {{been accustomed to}} teach spelling in the usual way, by assigning a lesson in the spelling book, which the scholars have studied in their seats, {{and then they have}} recited by having the words put to them individually in the class. After sometime, he finds that one class has lost its interest in this study. He can make them get the lesson it is true, but he perceives perhaps that it is a weary task to them. Of course they proceed with less alacrity, and consequently with less rapidity and success. He thinks, very justly, that it is highly desirable to secure cheerful, not forced, reluctant efforts from his pupils, and he thinks of trying some new plan. Accordingly he says to them, ...|$|E
60|$|It {{will be seen}} by {{reference}} to the foregoing plan, that I have marked {{the time for the}} recesses, by the letter R. at the top. Immediately after them, both in the forenoon and in the afternoon, twenty minutes are left, marked G., the initial standing for General exercise. They are intended to denote periods during which all the scholars are in their seats with their work laid aside, ready to attend to what <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> to bring before the whole. There are so many occasions, on which it is necessary to address the whole school, that it is very desirable to appropriate a particular time for it. In most of the best schools, I believe this plan is adopted. I will mention some of the subjects, which would come up at such a time.|$|E
60|$|But {{the truth}} is, that {{in almost all}} such cases as this, {{the secret of the}} success is, not that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> {{discovered}} a better method than the ordinary ones, but that he has discovered a new one. The experiment will succeed in producing more successful results, just as long as the novelty of it continues to excite unusual interest and attention in the class, or the thought that it is a plan of the teacher's own invention, leads him to take a peculiar interest in it. And this may be a month, or perhaps a quarter, and precisely the same effects would have been produced, if the whole had been reversed, that is, if the plan of dictation had been the old one, which in process of time had, in this supposed school, lost its interest, and the teacher by his ingenuity and enterprise had discovered and introduced what is now the common mode.|$|E

60|$|The {{lawyer is}} {{confined}} as much. It is true, {{there are not}} throughout the year, exact hours which he must keep, but considering the imperious demands of his business, his personal liberty is probably restrained as much by it, {{as that of the}} teacher. So with all the other professions. Although the nature of the confinement may vary, it amounts to about the same in all. On the other hand the teacher enjoys, in reference to this subject of confinement, an advantage, which scarcely any other class of men does or can enjoy. I mean vacations. A man in any other business may force himself away from it, for a time, but the cares and anxieties of his business will follow him wherever he goes, {{and it seems to be}} reserved for the teacher, to enjoy alone the periodical luxury of a real and entire release from business and care. On the whole, as to confinement, it seems to me that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> but little ground of complaint.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> {{the whole}} field, which this subject opens, fully before him. He has {{human nature to}} deal with, most directly. His whole work is experimenting upon mind; and the mind which is before {{him to be the}} subject of his operation, is exactly in the state to be most easily and pleasantly {{operated}} upon. The reason now why some teachers find their work delightful, and some find it wearisomeness and tedium itself, is that some do, and some do not take this view of their work. One instructer is like the engine-boy, turning without cessation or change, his everlasting stop-cock, in the same ceaseless, mechanical, and monotonous routine. Another is like the little workman in his brighter moments, fixing his invention and watching with delight its successful and easy accomplishment of his wishes. One is like the officer, driving by vociferations and threats, and demonstrations of violence, the spectators from the galleries. The other, like the shrewd contriver, who converts the very cause which was the whole ground of the difficulty, to a most successful and efficient means of its removal.|$|E
60|$|If now, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> {{taken the}} course {{recommended}} in this chapter; if he has, by his general {{influence in the}} school, done all {{in his power to}} bring the majority of his pupils to the side of order and discipline; if he has then studied, attentively and impartially, the characters of those who cannot thus be led; if he has endeavored to make them his friends, and to acquire, by every means, a personal influence over them; if, finally, when they do wrong, he goes, plainly, but in a gentle and delicate manner, to them, and lays before them the whole case; if he has done all this, he has gone as far as moral influence will carry him. My opinion is, that this course, faithfully and judiciously pursued, will in almost all instances succeed; but it will not in all; and where it fails, there must be other, and more vigorous and decided measures. What these measures of restraint or punishment shall be, must depend upon the circumstances of the case; but in resorting to them, the teacher must be decided and unbending.|$|E

50|$|Many {{public schools}} were {{completely}} destroyed, including Ishinomaki Okawa Elementary School (大川小学校), which lost 70 of 108 students and nine of 13 teachers and staff There is still anger {{among some of}} the parents of the dead students because <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>had</b> wasted precious time in debating whether to evacuate to higher ground. And when the decision was finally made, <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>had</b> decided to get to higher ground further away from the school which necessitated crossing a nearby river bridge. It was here while crossing the bridge that both <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> and students were swept away by the tsunami. This decision is deemed unreasonable by many of the parents because there is a hill right behind the school, which they could have reached quickly. One of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>had</b> tried to persuade <b>the</b> other <b>teachers</b> to bring <b>the</b> students to safety uphill soon after the earthquake; when he was unsuccessful, he evacuated himself, managing to persuade one of the students to go with him - both survived.

60|$|Where <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> not {{sufficient}} {{confidence that the}} general sense of propriety among his pupils will preserve good order and decorum during the exercise, it may be better for him to read a prayer, selected from books of devotion, or prepared by himself expressly for the occasion. By this plan his school will be, during the exercise, under his own observation as at other times. It may, in some schools, where the number is small, or the prevailing habits of seriousness and order are good, be well to allow the older scholars to read the prayer in rotation, taking especial care {{that it does not}} degenerate into a mere reading exercise; but that it is understood, both by readers and hearers, to be a solemn act of religious worship. In a word, if the teacher is really honest and sincere in his wish to lead his pupils to the worship of God, he will find no serious difficulty in preventing the abuses and avoiding the dangers which some might fear, and in accomplishing vast good, both in promoting the prosperity of the school, and {{in the formation of the}} highest and best traits a individual character.|$|E
6000|$|The editor {{wishes to}} make a few remarks about the Resolution Honour Roll. As will be seen, only one name figures on it. Felicity says she has thought a {{beautiful}} thought every morning before breakfast without missing one morning, not even the one we were at Peg Bowen's. Some of our number think it not fair that Felicity should be on the honour roll (FELICITY, ASIDE: [...] "That's Dan, of course.") when she only made one resolution and won't tell us what any of the thoughts were. So we have decided to give honourable mention to everybody who has kept one resolution perfect. Felix has worked all his arithmetic problems by himself. He complains that he never got {{more than a third of}} them right and <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> marked him away down; but one cannot keep resolutions without some inconvenience. Peter has never played tit-tat-x in church or got drunk and says it wasn't as bad as he expected. (PETER, INDIGNANTLY: [...] "I never said it." [...] CECILY, SOOTHINGLY: [...] "Now, Peter, Bev only meant that as a joke.") Sara Ray has never talked any mean gossip, but does not find conversation as interesting as it used to be.

60|$|This {{survey of}} your field being made, you are {{prepared}} to commence definite operations, and the great difficulty, in carrying your plans into effect, is, how to act more efficiently on the greatest numbers at a time. The whole business of public instruction, if it goes on at all, must go on by the teacher's skill in multiplying his power, by acting on numbers at once. In most books on education, we are taught, almost exclusively, how to operate on the individual. It is the error into which theoretic writers almost always fall. We meet, in every periodical, and in every treatise, and in fact, in almost every conversation on the subject, with remarks, which sound very well by the fire-side, but they are totally inefficient and useless in school, from their being apparently based upon the supposition, that <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>has</b> but one pupil to attend to at a time. The great question {{in the management of}} schools, is not, how you can take one scholar, and lead him forward, most rapidly, in a prescribed course, but how you can classify and arrange numbers, comprising every possible variety, both as to knowledge and capacity, so as to carry them all forward effectually together.|$|E

40|$|One {{example of}} a way to support novice {{teachers}} is mentoring, where more experienced teachers act as mentors. With the aim to highlight novice teach-ers ` experiences of having a mentor during their first year of work, an inter-view study was conducted after <b>the</b> novice <b>teachers</b> <b>had</b> been working for two years. It was found that the majority of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>had</b> appreciated <b>the</b> men-toring support.
