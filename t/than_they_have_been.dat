25|$|A study {{published}} in the journal Science in September 2009 determined that temperatures in the Arctic are higher presently <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{at any time in the}} previous 2,000 years. Samples from ice cores, tree rings and lake sediments from 23 sites were used by the team, led by Darrell Kaufman of Northern Arizona University, to provide snapshots of the changing climate. Geologists were able to track the summer Arctic temperatures as far back as the time of the Romans by studying natural signals in the landscape. The results highlighted that for around 1,900 years temperatures steadily dropped, caused by precession of earth's orbit that caused the planet to be slightly farther away from the sun during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. These orbital changes led to a cold period known as the little ice age during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. However, during the last 100 years temperatures have been rising, despite the fact that the continued changes in earth's orbit would have driven further cooling. The largest rises have occurred since 1950, with four of the five warmest decades in the last 2,000 years occurring between 1950 and 2000. The last decade was the warmest in the record.|$|E

In an interview for the BBC, Scheele said: [...] "I think in the future, education and industry need to become even more closely linked <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> historically. As government funding changes, the replacement could well come through private funding from companies, individuals and grant-giving agencies." ...|$|E

John Worsfold, the current coach of West Coast, said of Weedon and Ashton Hams, another small forward, were [...] "both physically more prepared to play at the elite level <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> before".|$|E

2500|$|Despite being {{impressed}} by such passages, Hazlitt also voices serious reservations about Byron's poetry as a whole: [...] "He seldom gets beyond force of style, nor has he produced any regular work or masterly whole." [...] Hazlitt mentions having heard that Byron composed at odd times, whether inspired or not, and this {{shows in the}} results, with Byron [...] "chiefly think how he shall display his own power, or vent his spleen, or astonish the reader either by starting new subjects and trains of speculation, or by expressing old ones in a more striking and emphatic manner <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> expressed before." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{despite these}} variations, {{most of the}} Qumran {{fragments}} can be classified as being closer to the Masoretic text than to any other text group that has survived. [...] According to Lawrence Schiffman, 60% can be classed as being of proto-Masoretic type, and a further 20% Qumran style with bases in proto-Masoretic texts, compared to 5% proto-Samaritan type, 5% Septuagintal type, and 10% non-aligned. Joseph Fitzmyer noted the following regarding the findings at Qumran Cave 4 in particular: [...] "Such ancient recensional forms of Old Testament books bear witness to an unsuspected textual diversity that once existed; these texts merit far greater study and attention <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accorded till now. Thus, {{the differences in the}} Septuagint are no longer considered the result of a poor or tendentious attempt to translate the Hebrew into the Greek; rather they testify to a different pre-Christian form of the Hebrew text". On the other hand, some of the fragments conforming most accurately to the Masoretic text were found in Cave 4.|$|E

For {{so early in the}} project, they are much further along <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> on the last two albums we did. On A Thousand Suns there were still a lot of irons in the fire. We knew, 'OK, we can't do this forever. Let's leave this batch and we'll come back and address it when we start up again, Rubin said. Bennington explained that Rubin [...] "gives us spaces to just be ourselves and to work on our own...He gives us a clear and concise description of what he likes...He would like us to push ourselves into a more fresh take on that particular sound." [...] He also stated that Shinoda guides the band through the process of each song, and called the team-up of Shinoda and Rubin [...] "our golden ticket." ...|$|E

2500|$|Israeli {{academic}} and political activist Jeff Halper said that [...] "Israel {{is able to}} pursue its occupation only because of its willingness to serve Western (mainly U.S.) imperial interests" [...] and that rather than influencing the United States via the lobby, Israel is actually [...] "a handmaiden of American Empire." [...] According to political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, though, [...] "the combination of unwavering U.S. support for Israel and the related effort to spread democracy throughout the region has inflamed Arab and Islamic opinion and jeopardized U.S. security." [...] They alleged that while [...] "one might assume that the bond {{between the two countries}} is based on shared strategic interests or compelling moral imperatives....neither of those explanations can account for the remarkable level of material and diplomatic support that the United States provides to Israel." [...] Robert Satloff cited the events of May–June 2010 (in which Israel stopped a flotilla meant to break its blockade of the Gaza Strip and yet, a few days later, every country expected to vote U.N. sanctions against Iran ended up voting as the U.S. wanted them to) as a counter-example that disproved that point of view. Goldberg similarly cited the Arab Spring to counter Walt and Mearsheimer's point: [...] "It seems as if the Arab masses have been much less upset about Israel's treatment of the Palestinians <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> about their own treatment at the hands of their unelected leaders. If Israel ceased to exist tomorrow, Arabs would still be upset at the quality of their leadership (and they would still blame the United States for supporting the autocrats who make them miserable); Iran would still continue its drive to expunge American influence from the Middle East; and al Qaeda would still seek to murder Americans and other Westerners." ...|$|E
2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Kelly Souders {{explained that}} the loss of show creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, as well as series regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk {{at the end of the}} seventh season, forced the creative team to look at the show from a new angle. As Souders explained, it allowed the writers to work with [...] "blank slates", and come up with ways to [...] "reinvigorate and reinvent the show". Executive producer Darren Swimmer explained that this season would feature Chloe's powers manifesting in a way that they have not previously been seen. He went on to express that the theme of season eight would be [...] "double identity"; specifically, Swimmer explained that Clark would begin to understand that he is going to have to live a double life, or he will never be able to continue forward with his destiny. Season eight would be about Clark moving forward to his destiny in a way that the show has never attempted before. Swimmer further explained that Clark will be acting more with his superpowers, whereas previously he would [...] "react" [...] to the situation; [...] "he's going to seek out trouble." [...] Clark joined the Daily Planet to help his cause, using the Planet as a means to get information about where there is trouble. Clark's heroic actions put him in Jimmy's sights, who starts connecting things to Clark; this helped fuel Clark's decision to develop a [...] "secret identity". Another reason for Clark's decision to develop a secret identity will be the stark contrast between saving people in the secluded streets of Smallville, and saving people in the crowded streets of Metropolis. While working at the Daily Planet, Clark was paired up with Lois on various assignments. Lois Lane actress Erica Durance, explained the episodes would be more focused on her character <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the past, and that Lois and Clark would be both rivals and supportive partners to each other. Durance also revealed that Lois would begin to realize her true romantic feelings for Clark, but that she does not want him to know the truth because she does not know what she wants to do with those feelings. Season eight explored these romantic notions between the two characters. Jeph Loeb added that season eight would explore more of the DC Comics mythology, and would introduce new characters, as well as expand on already existing ones in Smallville continuity. Peterson also revealed that there would be a chance that the show would break the [...] "No flights, no tights" [...] rule, at least in regard to the flying part of the rule.|$|E

50|$|The “sense {{of basic}} justice” {{to which the}} Tribunal’s March 2001 Decision {{referred}} arose from the effect of hyperinflation {{on the value of}} the Bonds during the long payment period the State had imposed. Between 1980 and 1987, Peru’s annual inflation rate never dipped below 50%. Between 1988 and 1990, the economic situation continued to worsen and inflation spiraled out of control, reaching its peak in August 1990, when annual inflation was 12,378%. In that month alone, existing currency lost 75% of its value. This means {{that at the end of}} that month, the same amount of money would have the power to buy only 1/4 of the goods and services it could have purchased at the beginning of that month. In other words, prices were more than 100 times higher by August 1990 <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a year earlier; more than 7,000 times higher <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the year before that; and more than 30,000 times higher <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> just three years earlier in August 1987.
