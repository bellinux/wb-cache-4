5|$|On August 7, 2010, the Infrared Array Camera {{aboard the}} Spitzer Space Telescope {{was used to}} find <b>the</b> <b>centroid,</b> the point in space around which both of the Kepler-14 stars orbit. Analysis of the {{collected}} data determined which component of the binary star system {{was the site of}} the transit signal, and, additionally, that the transit signal came from the primary star in the system (as opposed to the fainter, less prominent star).|$|E
5|$|Kepler-14 is {{a binary}} star system, {{which means that}} it is {{actually}} composed of two gravitationally bound stars that orbit a common point in space. The system is composed of a primary star, Kepler-14A, and a dimmer companion star, Kepler-14B. When the stars were observed, while searching for the planet Kepler-14b, the angular separation of the binary system made it extremely difficult to note the dimmer companion star. The stars have such a wide orbit that it takes approximately 2800 years for each star to complete a revolution around <b>the</b> <b>centroid.</b> The two stars are located approximately 980 parsecs (3,196 light years) from Earth.|$|E
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} novel method of {{performing}} image compression using {{a hybrid of}} K-means and wavelet techniques. K-means clustering technique {{is used as a}} vector quantizer to generate centroids when it is applied over the vectors representing an image. The proposed work compresses <b>the</b> <b>centroids</b> (code vectors) by applying the Discrete Wavelet Transform over <b>the</b> <b>centroids.</b> <b>The</b> approximation coefficients of <b>the</b> <b>centroids</b> along with <b>the</b> index values of <b>the</b> <b>centroids</b> corresponding to each input vector representing the image blocks form the compressed image. The proposed technique is implemented successfully and the experimental results show that the hybrid of K-means clustering and wavelet transform techniques produces better image compression with improved performance measures...|$|R
30|$|The {{main steps}} of K-Means {{algorithm}} are as follows: (1) Randomly selects r initial clustering <b>centroids.</b> (2) Compute <b>the</b> distance between each object and each centroid, and assign each {{object to the}} cluster that has <b>the</b> closest <b>centroid.</b> (3) Recalculate <b>the</b> <b>centroids</b> of r clusters after all objects have been assigned. (4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until <b>the</b> <b>centroids</b> no longer change.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>centroid</b> (yellow), {{orthocenter}} (blue), circumcenter (green) {{and center}} of the nine-point circle (red point) all lie on a single line, known as Euler's line (red line). The {{center of the}} nine-point circle lies at the midpoint between the orthocenter and the circumcenter, and the distance between <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> and the circumcenter is half that between <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> and the orthocenter.|$|E
25|$|A {{line segment}} joining a vertex of a {{tetrahedron}} with <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> {{of the opposite}} face is called a median and a line segment joining the midpoints of two opposite edges is called a bimedian of the tetrahedron. Hence there are four medians and three bimedians in a tetrahedron. These seven line segments are all concurrent at a point called <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> of the tetrahedron. In addition the four medians are divided in a 3:1 ratio by <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> (see Commandino's theorem). <b>The</b> <b>centroid</b> of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter. These points define the Euler line of the tetrahedron that {{is analogous to the}} Euler line of a triangle.|$|E
25|$|A {{median of}} a {{triangle}} is {{a straight line}} through a vertex and {{the midpoint of the}} opposite side, and divides the triangle into two equal areas. The three medians intersect in a single point, the triangle's centroid or geometric barycenter, usually denoted by G. <b>The</b> <b>centroid</b> of a rigid triangular object (cut out of a thin sheet of uniform density) is also its center of mass: the object can be balanced on its centroid in a uniform gravitational field. <b>The</b> <b>centroid</b> cuts every median in the ratio 2:1, i.e. the distance between a vertex and <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> is twice the distance between <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> and the midpoint of the opposite side.|$|E
50|$|Another {{remarkable}} {{line in a}} convex non-parallelogram quadrilateral is the Newton line, which {{connects the}} midpoints of the diagonals, the segment connecting these points being bisected by <b>the</b> vertex <b>centroid.</b> One more interesting line (in some sense dual to the Newton's one) is the line connecting the point of intersection of diagonals with <b>the</b> vertex <b>centroid.</b> <b>The</b> line is remarkable {{by the fact that}} it contains <b>the</b> (area) <b>centroid.</b> <b>The</b> vertex <b>centroid</b> divides <b>the</b> segment connecting the intersection of diagonals and <b>the</b> (area) <b>centroid</b> in <b>the</b> ratio 3:1.|$|R
5000|$|Symbols {{connected}} {{to their neighbors}} by line segments form text lines. Using all <b>the</b> <b>centroids</b> in a text line, one can compute an actual line segment representing the text line with linear regression.

25|$|If a {{continuous}} mass distribution has uniform density, which means ρ is constant, then {{the center of}} mass {{is the same as}} <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> of the volume.|$|E

25|$|Nearest {{neighbour}} distance – The nearest neighbour distance (NND) {{describes the}} distance between <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> of one fish (the focal fish) and <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> of the fish nearest to the focal fish. This parameter can be found for each fish in an aggregation and then averaged. Care {{must be taken to}} account for the fish located {{at the edge of a}} fish aggregation, since these fish have no neighbour in one direction. The NND is also related to the packing density. For schooling fish the NND is usually between one-half and one body length.|$|E
30|$|As also {{proposed}} {{in other studies}} [18] our analysis considers <b>the</b> <b>centroids</b> of NUTS 3 regions as origins and destinations. The all-or-nothing assignment module calculates the minimum paths through the networks, i.e. the path with minimum travel times between <b>the</b> <b>centroids</b> of <b>the</b> regions. According to the new travel times between each couple OD, for each scenario various accessibility indexes have been evaluated.|$|R

25|$|There are {{infinitely}} many {{lines that}} bisect {{the area of}} a triangle. Three of them are the medians, which are the only area bisectors that go through <b>the</b> <b>centroid.</b> Three other area bisectors are parallel to the triangle's sides.|$|E
25|$|Over any {{horizontal}} interval, {{the ratio}} of the area under the catenary to its length equals , independent of the interval selected. The catenary is the only plane curve other than a horizontal line with this property. Also, the geometric centroid of the area under a stretch of catenary is the midpoint of the perpendicular segment connecting <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> of the curve itself and the -axis.|$|E
25|$|Gaspard Monge found {{a center}} {{that exists in}} every {{tetrahedron}}, {{now known as the}} Monge point: the point where the six midplanes of a tetrahedron intersect. A midplane is defined as a plane that is orthogonal to an edge joining any two vertices that also contains <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> of an opposite edge formed by joining the other two vertices. If the tetrahedron's altitudes do intersect, then the Monge point and the orthocenter coincide to give the class of orthocentric tetrahedron.|$|E

40|$|A {{sequential}} fuzzy clustering {{algorithm is}} proposed based on a modification to the objective function used in the fuzzy competitive learning algorithm. The new learning algorithm {{can be used to}} enhance the excitation on <b>the</b> non-winning <b>centroids</b> and to reduce the excitation on <b>the</b> winning <b>centroid</b> when <b>the</b> fuzziness parameter is close to unity. The excitation on <b>the</b> winning <b>centroid</b> can be further reduced when the input pattern is far away from <b>the</b> winning <b>centroid.</b> An excitation-inhibition mechanism can also be introduced into the learning such that <b>the</b> non-winning <b>centroids</b> move towards <b>the</b> input pattern, while <b>the</b> winning <b>centroid</b> moves away from the input pattern when <b>the</b> winning <b>centroid</b> is far away from the input pattern. The new algorithm overcomes the problem of under utilization of <b>centroids</b> found in <b>the</b> k-means or related clustering algorithms and in the fuzzy competitive learning algorithm when the fuzziness parameter is close to unity. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated on the IRIS data set...|$|R
25|$|There are an infinitude {{of lines}} that bisect {{the area of}} a {{triangle}}. Three of them are the medians of the triangle (which connect the sides' midpoints with the opposite vertices), and these are concurrent at the triangle's centroid; indeed, {{they are the only}} area bisectors that go through <b>the</b> <b>centroid.</b> Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its incircle). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} isomer {{shift and}} quadrupole splitting are generally evaluated {{with respect to}} a reference material. For example, in iron compounds, the Mössbauer parameters were evaluated using iron foil (thickness less than 40 micrometers). <b>The</b> <b>centroid</b> of the six lines spectrum from metallic iron foil is −0.1mm/s (for Co/Rh source). All shifts in other iron compounds are computed relative to this −0.10mm/s (at room temperature), i.e., in this case isomer shifts are relative to Co/Rh source. In other words, the centre point of the Mössbauer spectrum is zero. The shift values may also be reported relative to 0.0mm/s, here shifts are relative to the iron foil.|$|E
25|$|The center T of the {{twelve-point}} sphere also {{lies on the}} Euler line. Unlike its triangular counterpart, {{this center}} lies {{one third of the}} way from the Monge point M towards the circumcenter. Also, an orthogonal line through T to a chosen face is coplanar with two other orthogonal lines to the same face. The first is an orthogonal line passing through the corresponding Euler point to the chosen face. The second is an orthogonal line passing through <b>the</b> <b>centroid</b> of the chosen face. This orthogonal line through the twelve-point center lies midway between the Euler point orthogonal line and the centroidal orthogonal line. Furthermore, for any face, the twelve-point center lies at the midpoint of the corresponding Euler point and the orthocenter for that face.|$|E

40|$|We generalize <b>the</b> {{notions of}} <b>centroids</b> and barycenters {{to the broad}} class of information-theoretic {{distortion}} measures called Bregman divergences.

25|$|The free-swimming diver {{may need}} to trim erect or {{inverted}} at times, but in general, a horizontal trim has advantages both for reduction of drag when swimming horizontally, and for observing the bottom. A horizontal trim allows the diver to direct propulsive thrust from the fins directly to the rear, which minimises disturbance of sediments on the bottom, and {{reduces the risk of}} striking delicate benthic organisms with the fins. A stable horizontal trim requires that diver's centre of gravity is directly below the centre of buoyancy (<b>the</b> <b>centroid).</b> Small errors can be compensated fairly easily, but large offsets may make it necessary for the diver to constantly exert significant effort towards maintaining the desired attitude, if it is actually possible.|$|E
25|$|Underwater trim is the diver's {{attitude}} in the water, in terms of balance and alignment with the direction of motion. The free-swimming diver may need to trim erect or inverted at times, but in general, a horizontal trim has advantages both for reduction of drag when swimming horizontally, and for observing the bottom. A slightly head down horizontal trim allows the diver to direct propulsive thrust from the fins directly to the rear, which minimizes disturbance of sediments on the bottom, and {{reduces the risk of}} striking delicate benthic organisms with the fins. A stable horizontal trim requires that diver's centre of gravity is directly below the centre of buoyancy (<b>the</b> <b>centroid).</b> Small errors can be compensated fairly easily, but large offsets may make it necessary for the diver to constantly exert significant effort towards maintaining the desired attitude, if it is actually possible. The position of the centre of buoyancy is largely beyond the control of the diver, though the cylinder(s) may be shifted in the harness by a small amount, and the volume distribution of the buoyancy compensator has a large influence when inflated. Most of the control of trim available to the diver is in the positioning of ballast weights. Fine tuning of trim can be done by placing smaller weights {{along the length of the}} diver to bring the centre of gravity to the desired position.|$|E
