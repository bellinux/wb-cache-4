40|$|The {{complexes}} of the cycloserine derivative, 4, 4 '-[1, 4 -phenylenebis(methylidynenitrilo) ]bis(isoxazolidin- 3 -one) or <b>terizidone,</b> with chromium(III), ruthenium(III) and rhodium(III) {{have been}} synthetized; their structures {{have been suggested}} {{on the basis of}} analytical, conductivity, spectral (visible, infrared and far-infrared) and magnetic data, and the thermal analyses have revealed the extent of coordinated water among the chromium and ruthenium complexes. The various ligand field parameters have been evaluated; the B' values suggest a strong covalency in the metal-ligand σ bond and the Dq values show a medium-strong ligand field. The position and multiplicity of the metal-halogen stretching modes in the far-infrared region have been extensively investigated and discussed; the results are particularly useful in distinguishing between the mer- and fac-isomers in the octahedral compounds of the ML 3 X 3 type. The ligand is monodentate O-bonded or N-bonded through the oxygen of the keto group or through the nitrogen of the imino group of the isoxazole ring. We have never observed a metal-induced cycloserine ring opening under the present experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{and other}} studies of iron(II), iron(III), manganese(II) and palladium(II) {{complexes}} with the cycloserine derivative, N 4, N ' 4 -tereftal-bis(cycloserine) or <b>Terizidone,</b> are reported. The methods {{used for the}} characterization of the compounds include elemental analyses, molar conductance, magnetic moments, electronic and infrared spectroscopy and thermal analyses (TG and DTG). From the magnetic properties {{it was concluded that}} the above ligand forms low-spin complexes with palladium(II) and high-spin complexes with iron(II), iron(III) and manganese(II). The wavelengths of the principal absorption bands have been accounted for quantitatively in terms of the crystal field theory for manganese(II) and tetrahedral iron(III) complexes. The values of B and C in the iron(III) derivatives are less than in the corresponding manganese(II) complexes. Far-infrared spectra have been extensively studied and the relationship between metal-halogen stretching vibrations and stereochemistry of the complexes is outlined and shown to have potential application in the assignment of the stereochemistry and coordination number of these new metal-halide complexes. The ligand is always monodentate N-bonded through the nitrogen of the imino group of the isoxazole ring. Under our experimental conditions no metal-induced cycloserine ring opening was observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) {{is a major}} global concern since, despite a complex treatment regime, it still remains a lethal threat. A 21 -yr-old male HIV-negative migrant from Burma presented with a disseminated tuberculosis affecting the lung, spleen, liver, mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes. This particular strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis proved to be resistant to all but one (pyrazinamide) of the first-line drugs, i. e. rifampicin, isoniazid and ethambutol, plus streptomycin, rifabutin and ofloxacin. On the mere account of its susceptibility concerning kanamycin {{it could not be}} labelled as extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. After 1 month of a standard first-line four-drug regimen and a subsequent 4 months of second-line treatment with amikacin, moxifloxacin, <b>terizidone,</b> protionamide, linezolid and pyrazinamide, sputum cultures eventually yielded constantly negative results. Likewise, the organ manifestations decreased significantly, so as to be virtually undetectable in computed tomography scans after 1 yr of continuous treatment. A moderate pancytopenia reversed completely after dose adjustment of linezolid. Disseminated tuberculosis manifestations without typical pulmonary cavernous lesions are likely to represent primary infection rather than reactivation. Even a multiorgan disseminated MDR-TB with an extensive resistance pattern (including fluoroquinolones) can be successfully treated with an individual second-line treatment and result in considerably few adverse events...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite {{the efforts}} made {{worldwide}} {{to reduce the}} number of cases of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) constitutes an important public health issue. Around 440, 000 new cases of MDR-TB are estimated annually, although in 2008 only 7 % of these (29, 423 cases) were notified. The laboratory tests for diagnosing resistance may be phenotypic (based on culture growth in the presence of drugs) or genotypic (i. e. identification of the presence of mutations that confer resistance). The urgent need for a rapid means of detecting resistance to anti-TB drugs has resulted in the development of many genotypic methods over recent years. The treatment of MDR-TB is expensive, complex, prolonged (18 – 24 months) and associated with a higher incidence of adverse reactions. Some basic principles must be observed when prescribing an adequate treatment regimen for MDR-TB: (a) the association of at least four drugs (three of which should not have been used previously); (b) use of a fluoroquinolone; and (c) use of an injectable anti-TB drug. In Brazil, the therapeutic regimen for MDR-TB has been standardized and consists of five drugs: <b>terizidone,</b> levofloxacin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and an aminoglycoside (streptomycin or amikacin). Pulmonary resection is an important tool in the coadjuvant treatment of MDR-TB. While a recent meta-analysis revealed an average cure rate of MDR-TB of 69 %, clinical studies are currently being conducted with new drugs and with drugs already available on the market but with a new indication for TB, with encouraging results that will enable more effective treatment regimens to be planned in the future...|$|E
40|$|South Africa shows one of {{the highest}} global burdens of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and {{extensively}} drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB). Since 2002, MDR-TB in South Africa has been treated by a standardized combination therapy, which until 2010 included ofloxacin, kanamycin, ethionamide, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Since 2010, ethambutol has been replaced by cycloserine or <b>terizidone.</b> The effect of standardized treatment on the acquisition of XDR-TB is not currently known. We genetically characterized a random sample of 4, 667 patient isolates of drug-sensitive, MDR and XDR-TB cases collected from three South African provinces, namely, the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Drug resistance patterns of a subset of isolates were analyzed for the presence of commonly observed resistance mutations. Our analyses revealed a strong association between distinct strain genotypes and the emergence of XDR-TB in three neighbouring provinces of South Africa. Strains predominant in XDR-TB increased in proportion by more than 20 -fold from drug-sensitive to XDR-TB and accounted for up to 95 % of the XDR-TB cases. A high degree of clustering for drug resistance mutation patterns was detected. For example, the largest cluster of XDR-TB associated strains in the Eastern Cape, affecting more than 40 % of all MDR patients in this province, harboured identical mutations concurrently conferring resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, ethionamide, kanamycin, amikacin and capreomycin. XDR-TB associated genotypes in South Africa probably were programmatically selected {{as a result of the}} standard treatment regimen being ineffective in preventing their transmission. Our findings call for an immediate adaptation of standard treatment regimens for M/XDR-TB in South Africa...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find out whether human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -infection and antiretroviral drugs influence multidrug-resistant (MDR) -tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes. The study compares MDR-TB treatment outcomes between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. It involved patients admitted for treatment of MDR-TB between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2006. From 363 patients selected, 268 (177 males and 91 females) had MDR-TB and 95 patients (59 males and 36 females) were co-infected with HIV. Children in the HIV-negative group were 41 and 7 in the HIV-positive group. The HIV-infection was treated with Stavudine, Lamivudine and Efavirenz in 54 patients. Kanamycin, Ethionamide, Ofloxacin, <b>Terizidone,</b> Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol were used for MDR-TB treatment. In HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients MDR-TB treatment outcomes were, respectively as follows: 37 and 35 % cure, 9 and 5 % treatment failure, 20 and 25 % lost to follow up, 11 and 17 % mortality, 19 and 13 % treatment completed, 6 and 5 % transfer-out. The cure rate was 100 % in children. In HIV-positive patients, MDR-TB cure rate was 35 % in patients on ARVs and 34 % in patients not receiving ARVs. The difference between these cure rates is not statistically significant (p-value = 0. 79). The median (range) duration of ART before the start of MDR-TB treatment was 10. 5 (1 to 60) months and did not influence MDR-TB treatment outcomes. In children, the full treatment was supervised in hospital. This could explain the 100 % cure rate. Adults' treatment was supervised in hospital only during the intensive phase then followed up as out patients over 18 months. According to the results of this study, HIV-infection and antiretroviral therapy did not influence MDR-TB treatment outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Background: According to the World Health Organization, South Africa {{ranks as}} one of the highest burden of TB, TB/HIV co-infection, and {{drug-resistant}} TB (DR-TB) countries. DR-TB treatment is complicated to administer and relies on the use of multiple toxic drugs, with potential for severe adverse drug reactions. We report the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) during a standardised DR-TB treatment regimen at two outpatient, decentralized, public-sector sites in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods: We reviewed medical records of the six-month intensive treatment phase for rifampicin-resistant (RR) TB patients registered May 2012 - December 2014. Patients contributed follow-up time until death, loss from treatment, censoring (6 months) or data extraction. A standardized regimen of kanamycin, moxifloxacin, ethionamide, <b>terizidone,</b> and pyrazinamide was used according to national guidelines. AEs were graded using the AIDS Clinical Trial Group scale. We present subhazard ratios from competing risk analysis for time to severe AE, accounting for mortality and loss from treatment. Results: Across the two sites, 578 eligible patient files were reviewed. 36. 7 % were categorized as low weight (≤ 50 kg) at DR-TB initiation. 76. 0 % had no history of TB treatment prior to the current episode of RR TB. 26. 8 % were diagnosed with RR TB while hospitalized, indicating poor clinical condition. 82. 5 % of patients were also HIV positive, of whom 43. 8 % were on ART prior to RR TB treatment and 32. 1 % initiated ART with or after RR TB treatment. Median CD 4 count was 114. 5 (IQR: 45 - 246. 5). Overall, 578 reports of AEs were captured for 204 patients (35. 3 %) and 110 patients (19. 0 %) had at least one severe AE reported. Patients with at least one AE experienced a median of 3 (IQR: 2 - 4) AEs per patient. HIV-positive patients with CD 4 counts ≤ 100 cells/mm 3 and those newly initiating ART were more likely to experience a severe AE (sHR: 2. 76, 95 % CI: 1. 30 – 5. 84 and sHR: 3. 07, 95 % CI: 1. 46 – 6. 46, respectively). Conclusion: Severe AE are common during the first 6 months of RR TB treatment and HIV-positive patients newly initiating ART have the highest subdistribution hazard ratio for severe AE, accounting for the competing risks of death and loss from treatment...|$|E
