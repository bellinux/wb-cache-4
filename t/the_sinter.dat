This model is validated with experimental data on the redox reactions of copper-based oxygen carriers, in which <b>the</b> <b>sintering</b> phenomenon has a remarkable importance. In addition, it was proposed a mathematical expression for the aggregation frequency that depends on physical meaningful variables and can be used to identify the operating mechanism in sintering.
