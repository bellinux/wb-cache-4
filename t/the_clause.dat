5|$|While the Self-Incrimination Clause {{primarily}} implicates the law {{of criminal}} investigations, <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> also protects against self-incrimination that may occur at trial. Plainly, <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial. Further, if the defendant chooses to testify, <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> prevents the state from requiring her to testify first. But, if the defendant testifies, she cannot claim the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to cross-examination {{within the scope of}} the direct examination.|$|E

50|$|The Necessary and Proper Clause, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> Elastic <b>Clause,</b> <b>the</b> Basket <b>Clause,</b> <b>the</b> Coefficient <b>Clause,</b> and <b>the</b> Sweeping <b>Clause,</b> is a {{provision}} in Article One of the United States Constitution, located at section 8, clause 18.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clause</b> {{does not}} require a jury drawn from the {{judicial}} division (a subset of a federal judicial district) within which the crime occurred; rather, the jury may be drawn from any division of the district. Nor does <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> prevent the jury from being drawn solely from a judicial division, or any other subset of a judicial district (rather than the entire judicial district).|$|E
5|$|The Compulsory Process Clause {{guarantees}} the defendant {{the right to}} obtain favorable witnesses at trial. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> prevents a jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants as witnesses. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> prevents the government from deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and favorable to the defense. The right does not pre-empt reasonable procedural rules. Thus, the right does not prevent the preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{consensus is}} that responsibility or guilt for the war was not attached to the article. Rather, <b>the</b> <b>clause</b> was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be laid out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by <b>the</b> <b>clause,</b> which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.|$|E

In the second sentence, <b>the</b> if <b>clause</b> is not true, while <b>the</b> then <b>clause</b> may or may not be true but certainly would be true in the counterfactual circumstance of <b>the</b> if <b>clause</b> being true.

5|$|There are varying {{interpretations of}} the {{original}} intent of Congress and of the ratifying states, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment, {{as well as the}} customs and understandings prevalent at that time. Some of the major issues that have arisen about this clause are {{the extent to which it}} included Native Americans, its coverage of non-citizens legally present in the United States when they have a child, whether <b>the</b> <b>clause</b> allows revocation of citizenship, and whether <b>the</b> <b>clause</b> applies to illegal immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre-trial. And, <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant. Similarly, the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument, even if a bench trial.|$|E
5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of <b>the</b> <b>Clause.</b> Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clauses</b> {{relating}} to custom affected {{only a minority}} of the 600,000 tenant farmers in Ireland. Therefore, it was <b>the</b> <b>clauses</b> {{relating to}} yearly tenants unprotected by custom which formed <b>the</b> most important <b>clauses</b> in <b>the</b> Act. Although <b>the</b> <b>clauses</b> on compensation for improvements were significantly better than previous legislation, their power was limited by the complicated procedure for claiming and assessing compensation. The overall effect, however, was to strengthen the position of the tenant by presuming that the improvements were his work.|$|R
5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, <b>the</b> <b>clause</b> find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subjectâ€“auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a clause both of whose {{variables}} are already set, {{in a way that}} falsifies <b>the</b> <b>clause,</b> then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.|$|E
5|$|Lower {{courts are}} split on whether <b>the</b> <b>Clause</b> {{requires}} that the defendant be tried in a judicial district that was in existence {{at the time the}} crime was committed. Some courts have held that it does. Others have held that it does not and that the district need only be ascertained prior to trial. Even proponents of the former view have found no infirmity when Congress prospectively divides a judicial district, but retains the former configuration for past offenses.|$|E

5|$|Tamil is a {{consistently}} head-final language. The verb {{comes at}} the end of <b>the</b> <b>clause,</b> with a typical word order of subjectâ€“objectâ€“verb (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clause</b> {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a {{practical}} matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Further, {{with the exception of the}} District of Wyoming, which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana, no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states (although the short-lived District of Potomac once did).|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{administration}} {{skirted the}} Ineligibility Clause {{during its first}} year, when Nixon named Representative Donald Rumsfeld as Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969. Although the salary for that office had been increased to $42,500 during Rumsfeld's term in Congress, Rumsfeld was not paid a salary for the position. Rather, Rumsfeld was dually employed as Assistant to the President at the same $42,500 salary, a position presumably {{outside the scope of}} <b>the</b> <b>Clause.</b>|$|E
