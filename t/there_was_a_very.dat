5|$|Aerial {{surveys of}} the site have {{confirmed}} that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large artificial enclosure, roughly circular in shape, within which are {{what is left of}} several circular and rectangular basins. The basins may be identified with the artificial pools described by the court poet Ali ibn Muhammad el-Iyadi, which surrounded the palace. The foundations have been revealed through archaeological excavations. Traces of the great hall's columns are still visible. Some parts of the canal can still be seen.|$|E
5|$|Before 1920 if {{one player}} {{approached}} another player {{to throw a}} contest, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good chance {{he would not be}} informed upon. Now, there was an excellent chance he would be turned in. No honest player wanted to meet the same fate as Buck Weaver... Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|Coma Berenices also {{contains}} the neutron star RBS 1223 and the pulsar PSR B1237+25. RBS 1223 {{is a member}} of the Magnificent Seven, a group of young neutron stars. In 1975, the first extra-solar source of extreme ultraviolet, the white dwarf HZ 43, was discovered in Coma Berenices. In 1995, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rare outburst of the WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova AL Comae Berenices. A June 2003 outburst from GO Comae Berenices, an SU Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova, was photometrically observed.|$|E

5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies had been produced by The Teng Chun, based on Chinese mythology or martial arts, and targeted at low-class audiences, generally ethnic Chinese.

During this period cinemas in the country mainly showed Hollywood productions.|$|E

5|$|In Chicago's bid, {{the games}} {{would have been}} held from July 22 to August 7, with the Paralympics held between August 12 and 28. The bid plan {{emphasized}} use of Chicago Park District parks to host the games, but other existing facilities such as Soldier Field and McCormick Place would have hosted events. The bid included a plan for North Side, Downtown Loop and South Side celebration locations that would have had high-definition LED screens for unticketed visitors. The bid noted that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high concentration of event locations and training facilities {{close to each other}} and that the majority of event sites were clustered together. Thus, the vast majority of athletes would have been close to their competitions.|$|E

5|$|Pre-production {{began on}} October 5, 1997. In talks with investors, the {{directors}} presented an eight-minute documentary along with newspapers and news footage. The documentary was also aired on the defunct television series Split Screen hosted by John Pierson. The script {{began with a}} thirty-five page outline, with the dialogue to be improvised. Accordingly, the directors advertised in Backstage magazine for actors with strong improvisational abilities. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> informal improvisational audition process to narrow the pool of 2,000 actors.|$|E
5|$|Although the Haflinger is {{now found}} {{all over the}} world, the {{majority}} of breeding stock still comes from Austria, where state studs own the stallions and carefully maintain {{the quality of the}} breed. However, there are breeding farms located in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and England. As of 2007, Italian Haflingers had the largest population of any breed in that country. Due to selective breeding during the 1990s aiming to increase height, some breed lines became favored over others in Italy. A 2007 study found little inbreeding within the Italian Haflinger population as a whole, although certain less popular lines had a higher incidence due to the existence of fewer breeding stallions. Haflingers are bred throughout France, especially in the provinces of Brittany, Burgundy and Picardy, with between 350 and 400 foals born each year. Slovenia also has a small Haflinger population, with around 307 breeding mares and 30 breeding stallions as of 2008. A 2009 study found that although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small amount of inbreeding in the population, it was increasing slightly over the years. As of 2005 there were almost 250,000Haflingers in the world.|$|E

5|$|During 1934 {{and early}} 1935, all feature films {{released}} in the Dutch East Indies {{had been made by}} the American-educated Chinese-Indonesian director The Teng Chun. His low budget but popular films were mainly inspired by Chinese mythology or martial arts, and although aimed at ethnic Chinese proved popular among native audiences because of their action sequences. The Teng Chun's dominance was an effect of the Great Depression and changing market trends. The Great Depression had led to the Dutch East Indies government collecting higher taxes and cinemas selling tickets at lower prices, ensuring that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low profit margin for local films. As a result, cinemas in the colony mainly showed Hollywood productions, while the domestic industry decayed. The Teng Chun was able to continue his work only because his films often played to full theatres.|$|E
5|$|The 15th {{edition of}} the Belk Bowl was played in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday, December 29, 2016. This was the 24th {{consecutive}} bowl game for Virginia Tech and Justin Fuente's first bowl game as {{head coach of the}} Hokies football team. This was the first time ever these two teams played each other. The first and second halves were totally different in terms of how each team did. Virginia Tech was losing 24-0 at halftime but turned the game around in the second half aided by 3 interceptions and six sacks, and won 24-35. This resulted in a season record of 10-4 and was the first time a Hokie football coach won 10 games in his first season and the first Hokie 10-win season since 2011. This {{was the first time the}} Hokies won 3 straight bowl games. Only one of the 5 Hokie touchdowns was not the result of an Arkansas turnover. This was the only game in the college football 2016 in which a team trailing by 24 or more points ended up winning the game. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> confusing ruling in the second quarter that took the officials about 12 minutes to sort out. Arkansas punted and the Hokies muffed it. Arkansas touched the ball and the Hokies recovered. But there was also an inadvertent whistle blown. Officials disagree on what the ruling should have been. The game officials gave the ball back to Arkansas.|$|E

25|$|With the {{establishment}} of Safavid rule, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> raucous and colourful, almost carnival-like holiday on 26 Dhu al-Hijjah (or alternatively, 9 Rabi' al-awwal) celebrating the murder of Caliph Umar.

25|$|Just {{a decade}} later, {{policing}} in New Zealand {{was given a}} significant overhaul.

25|$|Canada {{finished}} second in Round 4 of the Americas 1999 Rugby World Cup qualifying, losing only to Argentina, and qualify for the World Cup. Canada finished third in their pool (with France, Fiji and Namibia), winning their match against Namibia but losing their other two fixtures. The victory against Namibia was uncharacteristic for Canada, as they ran the score up to 72–11, {{one of their most}} lopsided victories, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> slight statistical chance that they could have advanced on points scored. This trashing was the one bright light in an otherwise gloomy and disappointing 1999 World Cup performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Ban Pa Dong was {{selected}} as the base for covert training of Hmong guerrillas for several reasons. Most pressing, it was out of reach of enemy actionbarely.
