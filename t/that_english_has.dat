500|$|English is {{an immensely}} rich {{language}} {{in terms of}} vocabulary, containing more synonyms than any other language. There are words which appear on the surface to mean {{exactly the same thing}} but which, in fact, have a slightly different shade of meaning and must be used appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message they intend to convey. It is generally stated <b>that</b> <b>English</b> <b>has</b> around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if obsolete words are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the Oxford English Dictionary from 1989. Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 million wordsbut that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use and technical acronyms.|$|E

5000|$|In {{common with}} many of the older members of the UDA, English was vehemently opposed to the drugs trade and when {{individual}} brigadiers took up drug dealing he would give their names to contacts he had in the press. However English's anti-drugs stance was eventually to be the cause of his downfall. Amongst those <b>that</b> <b>English</b> <b>had</b> mentioned to journalists was John [...] "Grugg" [...] Gregg; but English's fellow Rathcoole native, who <b>had</b> replaced <b>English</b> as brigadier, discovered <b>that</b> <b>English</b> <b>had</b> given information to the press. As a result, Gregg, who had {{a reputation as one of}} the UDA's fiercest members outside the Shankill Road, forced English out of the UDA and removed him from the political scene. He resigned from his role as chairman of the UDP in 1997.|$|R
2500|$|In some languages, like Welsh, verbs {{have special}} inflections {{to be used}} in {{negative}} clauses. (In some language families, this may lead to reference to a negative mood.) An example is Japanese, which conjugates verbs in the negative after adding the suffix -nai (indicating negation), e.g. taberu ("eat") and tabenai ("do not eat"). It could be argued <b>that</b> <b>English</b> <b>has</b> joined the ranks of these languages, since negation requires the use of an auxiliary verb and a distinct syntax in most cases; the form of the basic verb can change on negation, as in [...] "he sings" [...] vs. [...] "he doesn't sing". Zwicky and Pullum have shown that n't is an inflectional suffix, not a clitic or a derivational suffix.|$|E
2500|$|The fact <b>that</b> <b>English</b> <b>has</b> {{words like}} {{before and after}} that are (currently or archaically) polysemous between 'front/earlier' or 'back/later' may seem to refute the claims {{regarding}} Aymara uniqueness. However, these words relate events to other events and {{are part of the}} moving-events metaphor. In fact, when before means in front of ego, it can mean only future. For instance, our future is laid out before us while our past is behind us. Parallel Aymara examples describe future days as qhipa uru, literally 'back days', and they are sometimes accompanied by gestures to behind the speaker. The same applies to Quechua speakers, whose expression qhipa p'unchaw corresponds directly to Aymara qhipa uru. [...] Possibly, the metaphor is that the past is visible to us (in front of our eyes) while the future is not.|$|E
2500|$|Note {{concerning}} words <b>that</b> <b>English</b> <b>has</b> {{borrowed from}} French recently {{that they do}} not come under its traditional pronunciation. [...] Instead, in our attempts to approximate the values the French are using for œ in these non-learned words (namely, their [...] and [...] in terms of the International Phonetic Alphabet), English-speakers use a variety of substitutions. [...] This involves only a few items of vocabulary, as one can see from a fairly-complete list of words in English that have spellings containing œ ~ oe. [...] These recent borrowings from French include just the likes of: , , , , etc. [...] Returning to the remaining majority, which does come under the traditional English pronunciation of borrowings from / via pre-modern French and from / via Latin, we can list the examples of them in the following categories, into which they have been divided by developments in our pronunciation since Middle English.|$|E

60|$|In {{the course}} of the century, I am {{inclined}} to think that Germany will solve her difficulty in this respect by speaking English. Every boy and girl in Germany, above the peasant class, speaks English. Were English pronunciation less arbitrary, there is not the slightest doubt but that in {{the course of}} a very few years, comparatively speaking, it would become the language of the world. All foreigners agree that, grammatically, it is the easiest language of any to learn. A German, comparing it with his own language, where every word in every sentence is governed by at least four distinct and separate rules, tells you <b>that</b> <b>English</b> <b>has</b> no grammar. A good many English people would seem to have come to the same conclusion; but they are wrong. As a matter of fact, there is an English grammar, and one of these days our schools will recognise the fact, and it will be taught to our children, penetrating maybe even into literary and journalistic circles. But at present we appear to agree with the foreigner that it is a quantity neglectable. English pronunciation is the stumbling-block to our progress. English spelling would seem to have been designed chiefly as a disguise to pronunciation. It is a clever idea, calculated to check presumption on the part of the foreigner; but for that he would learn it in a year.|$|E

50|$|The {{language}} {{is closely related}} to Pitkern, but has no other close relatives other than its parent tongues of English and Tahitian.

50|$|The {{primary source}} of the {{differences}} between Russian and English verse is <b>that</b> <b>English</b> <b>has</b> many one syllable nouns, verbs, and adjectives, where Russian words typically have many syllables, and carry only a single invariable stress.

50|$|English tag questions, {{when they}} have the {{grammatical}} form of a question, are atypically complex, because they vary according to at least three factors: the choice of auxiliary, the negation and the intonation pattern.
