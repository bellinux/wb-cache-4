40|$|A compact {{portable}} {{electronic system}} has been developed for measurement of sap flow through the xylem in the stem of woody plants. This system utilizes a single heated <b>thermistor</b> <b>probe</b> which is alternately and automatically switched between a constant (heating phase) and a variable (cooling phase) temperature mode of operation. Experiments reported here {{have been carried out}} in two distinct porous medium, packed bands and the stem of several apple trees. The system performance was tested to detect the variations in flow rate. In both mediums, results indicated that the single heated thermistor is able to work as flowmeter since its transient thermal response was affected by the local fluid flow. The natural logarithm of the fractional response of the <b>thermistor</b> <b>probe</b> indicated that the system can not be analysed as a first order model. Non-linear regression analysis showed that the relationship between the probe sensor temperature response and the time elapsed from the beginning of cooling phase is adequately fitted by an additive exponential model.

Knee temperature assessments correlated well with clinical parameters and were essentially independent of room temperature. INFRA-RED thermography is being used as a means of objective assessment of joint inflammation (Haberman et ah, 1968).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to assess the suitability of the thermistor based method for measuring thermal conductivity and diffusivity of moist food materials at high temperatures. Research focused on aspects of calibration, thermal contact in solid food materials, natural convection in liquid media and the performance in moist food materials at high temperatures. Thermistor probes were constructed in house and calibrated in three materials of known thermal conductivity and diffusivity, water, glycerol, and a heat transfer fluid, HTF 500. With few exceptions, the calibrated probe estimated thermal properties with an error of less than 5 %, over the range of thermal properties spanned by the those of the calibration media. An alternate calibration using two media was also investigated. It was found to give better accuracy over a more limited range. Thermal contact in potato and lean beef was investigated through a comparative study that used a miniature line heat source probe as a reference method. The food materials were measured at 25, 50 and 100 °C.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of wireless non-contact temperature measurement systems out there {{but most of them}} are work at high temperatures or do not have sufficient resolution for use in the physiological domain (30 �C- 42 �C). Even to this date, temperature measurement in incubators is done by attaching <b>thermistor</b> <b>probes</b> to the skin of the baby. This thesis presents a non-contact temperature measurement system designed for neonatal care. The system removes the need of attaching <b>thermistor</b> <b>probes</b> to the neonate's skin and therefore reduces the risk of epidermal stripping, microbial infections, etc. The fluorescence intensity ratio (ratiometric) technique is utilized to determine the temperature of a target using temperature responsive fluorophores. This technique measures the changes in the fluorescence intensity as the temperature is changed. The ratiometric technique utilizes two separate fluorophores where one is non-sensitive to temperature and thus serves as a reference. Determining results using ratiometric techniques also minimizes changes in the final measurements when environmental changes such as changes in ambient lights occur. An illuminator is employed to excite the fluorophores which then emit fluorescence that is measured by a camera. This is done by capturing consecutive frames with the illuminator on and then off and then subtracting them. The data is captured, stored, pre-processed and sent to the computer using an FPGA. The MATLAB computational environment is utilized to carry out final processing and display of the ratiometric values. The thesis looks into variable situational changes that can present themselves during actual application of the system and studies the effect on the stability of the ratiometric fluorescence measured. Measurements of the ratiometric fluorescence under different conditions suggest that a low-cost sensing system is viable. The resolution of the system is reported to be better than 0. 18 &# 730;C...|$|R

The {{dependence}} of oxygen isotope fractionation on ice growth rate during the freezing of sea water is investigated based on laboratory experiments and field observations in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The laboratory experiments were {{performed in a}} tank filled with sea water, with sea ice grown under calm conditions at various room temperatures ranging from – 58 C to – 208 C. In McMurdo Sound, the ice growth rate was monitored using <b>thermistor</b> <b>probes</b> for first-year landfast ice that grew to 2 m in thickness. Combining these datasets allows, for the first time, examination of fractionation at {{a wide range of}} growth rates from 0. 810 – 7 to 9. 310 – 7 m s– 1.
