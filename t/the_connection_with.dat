There were few direct trade contacts between Romans and Han Chinese, as the rival Parthians and Kushans were each protecting their lucrative role as trade intermediaries.|$|E

The essence of network synthesis is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E

Miners developed a disproportionate amount of lung disease, eventually recognized as lung cancer in the 1870s. Despite this discovery, mining continued into the 1950s, due to the USSR's demand for uranium. Radon was confirmed {{as a cause of}} lung cancer in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|M-49 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1930, running along its current routing between M-9 (now M-99) in Litchfield and the Ohio state line south of Camden. Near the state line, the highway jogged along Territorial Road for a short {{distance}} to make <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> the continuation of SR49. The second version of M-120 ran concurrently with M-49 on this section of Territorial Road starting in 1939. This concurrency was removed in late 1946 or early 1947 when M-49 was realigned to smooth out the corners in the roadway at M-120. The routing of M-49 has remained the same since. It is currently the only state highway that connects with a like-numbered state highway from another state. The only other highways in Michigan to share a number with a cross-border connection are components of the Interstate Highway System or the United States Numbered Highways.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} bolt {{connections}} on Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) Sengon. Series of connection {{tests were conducted}} to evaluate 3. 5 d, 5 d, and 7 d end distances and 3 d, 4 d, and 5 d bolt spacings, where d is a 10 mm bolt diameter. All connections  were double-shear model (steel-LVL-steel). The results showed that all variations of end distance failed in ductile manner especially <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>with</b> end distances of 5 d and 7 d. Load carrying capacity of <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>with</b> end distances of 5 d and 7 d were about the same. For single bolt <b>connections,</b> those <b>with</b> 5 d bolt spacing had the highest ratio of load carrying capacity. Only <b>the</b> two-bolt <b>connections</b> <b>with</b> 5 d bolt spacing gave the ratio of load carrying capacity {{higher than that of}} prediction. These findings therefore suggests that minimum end distance of 5 d and minimum bolt spacing of 5 d are recommended to be addopted in LVL Sengon bolted connections...|$|R

5|$|In the 14th century, Orkney and Shetland {{remained}} a Norwegian possession, but Scottish influence was growing. Jon Haraldsson, who {{was murdered in}} Thurso in 1231, {{was the last of}} an unbroken line of Norse jarls, and thereafter the earls were Scots noblemen of the houses of Angus and St Clair. On the death of Haakon VI in 1380, Norway formed a political union with Denmark, after which the interest of the royal house in the islands declined. In 1469, Shetland was pledged by Christian I, in his capacity as King of Norway, as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret, betrothed to James III of Scotland. As the money was never paid, <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> the Crown of Scotland became permanent. In 1470, William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness ceded his title to James III, and the following year the Northern Isles were directly annexed to the Crown of Scotland, an action confirmed by the Parliament of Scotland in 1472. Nonetheless, Shetland's connection with Norway has proved to be enduring.|$|E
5|$|Ireland King of Arms was {{the title}} of an officer of arms to the King of England and Lord of Ireland from 1392 until the {{accession}} of Henry VII as King of England in 1485. A king of arms is the highest of the three levels of officers of arms, and usually enjoys heraldic jurisdiction over a geographical area. Despite the name Ireland King of Arms {{did not appear to}} exercise heraldic authority in Ireland, and indeed <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> Ireland seems rather tenuous. The office may have been created preparatory to a subsequently aborted military expedition to Ireland. The last holder of the office, Walter Bellinger, did exercise the heraldic prerogative of a king of arms to grant armorial bearings, however two of his grants were annulled or regranted by other kings of arms as they felt he encroached on their provinces. In 1552, 70 years after the last Ireland King of Arms, the office of Ulster King of Arms was created. The holders of this office exercised control over the heraldic affairs of Ireland until the death of its last incumbent, Neville Wilkinson, in 1941. Thereafter, heraldic affairs in Ireland were transferred to the Government of Ireland while the post was merged with that of Norroy King of Arms forming the present office of Norroy and Ulster King of Arms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} {{investigation on}} the block shear failure behavior of coped beams with double welded clip angle connection was conducted. Parametric study was conducted based on the validated finite element model. The parameters included the web block aspect ratio and <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> rotational stiffness. Based on the mechanical model of double angle <b>connection,</b> <b>the</b> pitch and the beam element length-to-angle thickness (L/t) ratio of the outstanding leg were selected as two importance parameters to consider the effect of <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> rotational stiffness. <b>The</b> results of parametric study show that <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> rotational stiffness has a great influence {{on the block}} shear capacity of coped beams with double welded clip angle connection. This is contributed {{to the fact that}} for <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>with</b> a smaller <b>connection</b> rotational stiffness, <b>the</b> shear stresses of the shear area were much less than those of <b>the</b> <b>connections</b> <b>with</b> a larger <b>connection</b> rotational stiffness...|$|R
5|$|The Aurigids had a {{spectacular}} outburst in 1994, when many grazing meteors—those {{that have a}} shallow angle of entry and seem {{to rise from the}} horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though {{there were only a few}} visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. <b>The</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by Peter Jenniskens and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were very bright and often colored blue and green. The maximum zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.|$|E
5|$|The Chesham {{branch is}} a {{single-track}} railway branch line in Buckinghamshire, England, {{owned and operated}} by the London Underground. It runs from a junction at Chalfont & Latimer station on the Metropolitan line for 3.89miles (6.26km) northwest to Chesham. The line was built as part of Edward Watkin's scheme to turn his Metropolitan Railway (MR) into a direct rail route between London and Manchester, and it was envisaged initially that a station outside Chesham would be an intermediate stop on a through route running north to connect with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Deteriorating relations between the MR and LNWR led to the MR instead expanding to the northwest via Aylesbury, and the scheme to connect with the LNWR was abandoned. By this time much of the land needed for the section of line as far as Chesham had been bought. As Chesham was at the time the only significant town near the MR's new route, it was decided to build the route only as far as Chesham, and to complete <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>with</b> the LNWR at a future date if it proved desirable. Local residents were unhappy at the proposed station site outside Chesham, and a public subscription raised the necessary additional funds to extend the railway into the centre of the town. The Chesham branch opened in 1889.|$|E
