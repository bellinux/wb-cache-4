Despite this, the liner notes for the cassette claim it was recorded in twelve hours, while the later remaster of Buddha contend it was recorded [...] "over three rainy nights."

500|$|Thirsty Merc's first {{extended}} play, First Work, {{was released}} on 8 September 2003 by the band's own label, Don't Music and was distributed by [...] Warner Music Australia. The five-track CD was independently recorded during downtime at a studio where Thistlethwayte worked. The EP reached the top100 on the ARIA Singles Chart; and its lead single, [...] "Wasting Time", achieved radio airplay on national radio stations, Triple J and Nova. The self-funded music video for the single was broadcast on Channel , and became the 'ripe clip of the week'. At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> the EP they were without a label. After extensive gigging around Sydney's pubs, representatives from Warner had signed the band in June 2003, {{for the release of}} the EP and the follow up single, [...] "Emancipate Myself", which was a reworked version of the EP track.

500|$|The Atlantic Records studio {{had just}} {{purchased}} an 8-track recorder, and recording engineer Tom Dowd was familiarizing himself with how it worked. In February 1959 Charles and his orchestra finally recorded [...] "What'd I Say" [...] at Atlantic's small studio. Dowd recalled {{that it did}} not seem special at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording.</b> It was second of two songs during the session and Charles, the producers, and the band were more impressed with the first one at the session, [...] "Tell the Truth": [...] "We made it like we made all the others. Ray, the gals, and the band live in the small studio, no overdubs. Three or four takes, and it was done. Next!" [...] In retrospect, Ahmet Ertegun's brother Nesuhi credits the extraordinary sound of the song to the restricted size of the studio and the technologically advanced recording equipment used; the sound quality is clear enough to hear Charles slapping his leg in time with the song when the music stops during the calls and responses. The song was recorded in only a few takes because Charles and the orchestra had perfected it while touring.|$|E

Despite suffering from arthritis and not even owning a piano at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> with Cooder, (due to an infestation of termites whilst living in South America) the American guitarist described him as [...] "the greatest piano soloist I have ever heard". After the success of the 1997 record, González recorded and toured with bassist Orlando [...] "Cachaíto" [...] López, who was the only musician to play on all of the songs on the Buena Vista Social Club album.

500|$|The album's cover art {{features}} {{the members of}} the band at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>recording</b> in a group pose and {{standing in front of a}} wood cut-out of the name [...] "Pearl Jam". The wood cut-out was constructed by Ament. Ament said, [...] "The original concept was about really being together as a group and entering into the world of music as a true band...a sort of all-for-one deal." [...] Ament is credited for the album's artwork and art direction, Lance Mercer receives credit for photography, and both Lisa Sparagano and Risa Zaitschek are credited for design. Ament stated, [...] "There was a bit of headbutting going on with the Sony art department at that time. The version that everybody got to know as the Ten album cover was pink and it was originally intended to be more of a burgundy color and the picture of the band was supposed to be black and white." [...] Pearl Jam's original name was taken from the professional basketball player Mookie Blaylock. It was changed after the band signed to Epic Records, as record executives were concerned about intellectual property and naming rights following Blaylock's inking of an endorsement deal with Nike. In commemoration of the band's original name, the band titled its first album Ten after Blaylock's jersey number.|$|E

"Techno Cumbia" [...] is {{believed}} by musicologist to have predated the Latin urban music genre—which {{became one of}} the most popular subgenres of Latin music in the 2000s decade—and to have spearheaded a new style of music.
