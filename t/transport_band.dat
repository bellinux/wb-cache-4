40|$|Charge {{carriers}} that execute multi-phonon hopping generally interact strongly {{enough with}} phonons to form polarons. A polarons sluggish motion {{is linked to}} slowly shifting atomic displacements that severely reduce the intrinsic width of its <b>transport</b> <b>band.</b> Here a means to estimate hopping polarons bandwidths from Seebeck-coefficient measurements is described. The magnitudes of semiconductors Seebeck coefficients are usually quite large (greater than 86 microvolts/K) near room temperature. However, {{in accord with the}} third law of thermodynamics, Seebeck coefficients must vanish at absolute zero. Here the transition of the Seebeck coefficient of hopping polarons to its low-temperature regime is investigated. The temperature and sharpness of this transition depends on the concentration of carriers and on the width of their <b>transport</b> <b>band.</b> This feature provides a means of estimating the width of a polarons <b>transport</b> <b>band.</b> Since the intrinsic broadening of polaron bands is very small, less than the characteristic phonon energy, the net widths of polaron transport bands in disordered semiconductors approach the energetic disorder experienced by their hopping carriers, their disorder energy...|$|E

But unlike silicon, {{the nature of}} the <b>transport</b> <b>band</b> gap in CNTs is not fully understood. The transport gap in CNTs is predicted to be strongly driven by electron-electron (e-e) interactions and correlations, even at room temperature. Here, we use dielectric liquids to screen e-e interactions in individual suspended ultra-clean CNTs. Using multiple techniques, the transport gap is measured as dielectric screening is increased. Changing the dielectric environment from air to isopropanol, we observe a 25 % reduction in the transport gap of semiconducting CNTs, and a 32 % reduction in the band gap of narrow-gap CNTs.

40|$|The {{interface}} formation between copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and two representative metal substrates, i. e., Au and Co, {{was investigated}} by the combination of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy. The occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals and thus the <b>transport</b> <b>band</b> gap of CuPc are highly influenced by film thickness, i. e., molecule-substrate distance. Due to the image charge potential given by the metallic substrates the <b>transport</b> <b>band</b> gap of CuPc "opens" from (1. 4 ± 0. 3) eV for 1 nm thickness to (2. 2 ± 0. 3) eV, and saturates at this value above 10 nm CuPc thickness. The interface dipoles with values of 1. 2 eV and 1. 0 eV for Au and Co substrates, respectively, predominantly depend on the metal substrate work functions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements using synchrotron radiation {{provide detailed information on}} the interaction between CuPc and the two metal substrates. While charge transfer from the Au or Co substrate to the Cu metal center is present only at sub-monolayer coverages, the authors observe a net charge transfer from the molecule to the Co substrate for films in the nm range. Consequently, the Fermi level is shifted {{as in the case of}} a p-type doping of the molecule. This is, however, a competing phenomenon to the energy band shifts due to the image charge potential.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} and cooling {{power of a}} two-terminal thermoelectric refrigerator are analyzed near the limit of vanishing dissipation (ideal system), where the optimal efficiency is the Carnot one, but the cooling power then unfortunately vanishes. This limit, where transport occurs only via a single sharp electronic energy, {{has been referred to}} as "strong coupling" or "the best thermoelectric". It follows however, that "parasitic" effects that make the system deviate from the ideal limit, and reduce the efficiency from the Carnot limit, are crucial for the usefulness of the device. Among these parasitics, there are: parallel phonon conduction, finite width of the electrons' <b>transport</b> <b>band</b> and more than a single energy transport channel. In terms of a small parameter characterizing the deviation from the ideal limit, the {{efficiency and}} power grow linearly, and the dissipation quadratically.
