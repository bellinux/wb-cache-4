5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> {{died because}} of {{deliberate}} genocide, massacres, mass-bombings, disease, and starvation.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{capitulation}} agreement, the Polish Home Army {{soldiers were}} {{to be treated as}} regular POWs and <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> of Warsaw evacuated. Mazurkiewicz disbanded his unit and together with his wife Anna, {{who was a member of}} the Radosław Group, escaped the city by posing as a civilian.|$|E
5|$|Civilians {{who took}} part in the {{evacuation}} suffered the consequences of the military action along Route 7. Most of <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> who followed the military convoy were either relatives of soldiers or officers in the army, or were government civil servants. Of the estimated 400,000 civilians who initially took part in the march, only a handful actually reached their destinations in the Mekong region. In addition to the casualties inflicted upon them by North Vietnamese artillery, <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> were also hit by air strikes from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. As a result of those huge losses, Route 7 became known as the ‘convoy of tears’.|$|E
50|$|On April 14, 1833, a fire burnt down much of Cumberland, {{including}} {{the offices of}} <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> and <b>the</b> Cumberland Advocate. The account books of <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> were <b>the</b> only objects recovered from the office afterwards. By July 1833, <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> offices had been rebuilt beneath the Cumberland Bank on Mechanic Street. From 1833 through 1840 the paper was known as <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Civilian.</b>|$|R
5000|$|March 31, 1933: <b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps Reforestation Relief Act (ch. 17, [...] ) {{established}} <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps (CCC) as a {{means to}} combat unemployment and poverty.|$|R
50|$|On March 17, 1859, the Cumberland Telegraph and Maryland Mining Register (formerly the Telegraph) {{merged with}} the Cumberland Miners' Journal (formerly <b>the</b> <b>Civilian)</b> to create <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> & Telegraph.|$|R
5|$|Loring {{was home}} to a {{civilian}} population, {{many of whom were}} employed alongside active duty service members. The base included many amenities, such as a hospital, school, and ski hill, which facilitated the adjustment to Maine life by <b>the</b> <b>civilians.</b>|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. <b>The</b> <b>civilians</b> and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. <b>The</b> <b>civilians</b> thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E
5|$|The Baćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 83 civilians just outside the village of Baćin, near Hrvatska Dubica, committed by Croatian Serb paramilitaries. The killings took place on 21 October 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence. Most of <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> were Croats, but they also included two ethnic Serbs, taken from Hrvatska Dubica, Baćin and the nearby village of Cerovljani. <b>The</b> <b>civilians</b> {{were killed in the}} area of Krečane, at the very bank of the Una River, and their bodies were left unburied for two weeks. Most of them were subsequently bulldozed into a shallow mass grave, while a number of the bodies were thrown into the river.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1930s, as the Great Depression worsened, Franklin Roosevelt created <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps (CCC). <b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps Camp Ludington-Pere Marquette SP-2 was established in 1933. That same year, architect Ralph B. Herrick designed this beach house for the park. The Ludington State Park Beach House was constructed by <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps in 1935.|$|R
25|$|The Military Organization {{was made}} up of {{branches}} similar to those in <b>the</b> Ba'ath's <b>civilian</b> sector. However, unlike <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> sector <b>the</b> Military Organization was controlled by a separate Military Bureau, and held periodical Military Congresses. The Military Organization and <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> Organization converged at the Regional Congress.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} part {{is closed}} off from <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> airport by a fence, which encompasses the former air base minus <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> airfield and also crosses <b>the</b> runway. <b>The</b> <b>civilian</b> part of <b>the</b> airfield {{is in charge}} of the control tower, some hangars, a parking and 1450m of the runway (the southern half). It is run by the Flughafen Husum GmbH & Co. KG.|$|R
5|$|After {{this initial}} skirmish, Black Hawk led many of <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> in his band to the Michigan Territory. On May 19, the militia {{traveled}} up the Rock River trailing {{and searching for}} Black Hawk and his band. Several small skirmishes and massacres ensued over the next month in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin before the militia regained public confidence in battles at Bloody Lake and Waddams Grove.|$|E
5|$|As the SAS {{operation}} concluded, the Chinooks ferried {{prisoners and}} bodies from Gberi Bana to the Jordanian battalion of UNAMSIL. From there, the bodies would {{be identified and}} buried, and those prisoners identified as West Side Boys would be {{handed over to the}} Sierra Leonean Police. Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the West Side Boys—the men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the West Side Boys, possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future, while the women were used as sex slaves. Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> and so <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to be identified. A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault.|$|E
5|$|Georgian {{artillery}} units launched smoke bombs into South Ossetia at 23:35 on 7 August. This {{was followed}} by a 15-minute intermission, which purportedly enabled <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> to escape, before the Georgian forces began bombarding enemy targets. Georgian military intentionally targeted South Ossetian military objects, not civilian ones. Although Georgian military had promised safety to the Russian peacekeepers for their neutrality, the Russian peacekeepers had to follow the Russian command to attack the Georgian troops.|$|E
5000|$|Right after <b>the</b> ceasefire, <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> {{control zone}} outside the DMZ {{encompassed}} 100 or so empty villages. The government implemented migration measures to attract settlers into the area. As a result, in 1983, when the area delineated by <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> control line {{was at its}} largest, a total of 39,725 residents in 8,799 households {{were living in the}} 81 villages located within <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> control zone.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Coupé is a British, single-engined two-seat private {{monoplane}} built {{starting in}} 1929. Only five {{were made and}} it was <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> Aircraft Company's only product, but one still flies in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Although the Polish {{military}} had prepared for conflict, <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war propaganda emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion {{came as a}} shock to <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> population. Lacking training for such a disaster, <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.|$|R
5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, the Laotian commander and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The four {{civilians were}} tried on December 13. The {{principal}} prosecution witness, a servant {{of one of}} the accused, made claims that were easily rebutted by defense witnesses. In the face of this weak testimony, as well as waning public interest, the prosecution allegedly failed to press its case very hard. <b>The</b> <b>civilians</b> were all acquitted, and the servant was eventually convicted of perjury, whipped, and banished from the province.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, was spent in fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk. This included digging trenches and clearing trees {{in front of the}} defensive lines. The hard labor had a detrimental effect on the general morale of the Union troops stationed at Suffolk. This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|The Work Projects Administration and <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps helped {{ease the}} county economy during the Great Depression. <b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps built Fort Parker State Recreation Area. The WPA erected {{a number of}} {{buildings}} in the county.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Service Medal 1939-1945 is {{bronze and}} portrays the Southern Cross {{surrounded}} by golden wattle, Australia's floral emblem. The Southern Cross represents Australia {{and the golden}} wattle represents <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> population joining in defence of the country.|$|R
50|$|During the Civil War, the {{politics}} of <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> & Telegraph were conservative, firmly Unionist. The paper became associated with the Unconditional Union Party in 1861. On July 1, 1865, <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> & Telegraph was purchased by Will H. Lowdermilk.|$|R
5|$|About 60 Gilbertese {{civilians were}} {{relocated}} to Fanning island in January 1957 on the copra ship Tungaru, and another 40 on the Tulgai the following month. By mid-March 44 Gilbertese men, 29 women and 56 children remained. By {{the end of}} April, 31 of the men, and all {{the women and children}} hadd been taken to Fanning Island by RAF Hastings. <b>The</b> <b>civilians</b> would remain there for the next three months, before returning to Christmas Island. During the later test series, the Gilbertese civilians remained on the island, marshalled in areas like the military personnel.|$|E
5|$|After announcing Gotham will {{be subject}} to his rule come nightfall, the Joker rigs two {{evacuating}} ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. He says that he will blow them both up by midnight, but will let one live if its passengers (who have been supplied the trigger to the other boat's explosives) blow up the other. Batman finds the Joker with a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of Lucius Fox. Both <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing <b>the</b> <b>civilians.</b> At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the capture of Saborsko. Some of the victims were shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E
50|$|The park is {{the site}} of <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps Museum with {{exhibits}} about the work of <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps in Virginia. Located in a building constructed by the CCC, the museum's exhibits include photographs, artifacts and personal mementos.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps {{built their}} own barracks and camp support {{structures}} {{adjacent to the}} Rand Ranger Station. <b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps camp eventually housed over 200 enrollees. They also made many improvements to the Forest Service side of the compound. This included remodeling existing buildings and constructing new structures. They improved the landscaping around ranger station and built masonry retaining walls at <b>the</b> site. <b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps camp at Rand was closed in August 1941.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps {{was created}} in 1933. That same year, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was {{established}} at Rand. Known as Camp 1650, it was initially manned by 18 enrollees. While most of the Rand area projects were managed by the Forest Service, <b>the</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps workers constructed buildings, built roads and trails, and developed campgrounds in the surrounding National Forest. <b>The</b> <b>Civilian</b> Conservation Corps troops also helped Forest Service employees fight wildfires during the summer months.|$|R
5|$|After {{the coup}} on 1 November 1963, in which Diệm and Nhu were killed the {{following}} day, Thơ was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's military junta five days later, on 6 November 1963. He {{was the leading}} civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Minh had earlier promised U.S. officials that <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> would be above the generals in the hierarchy. In addition, he was minister for finance and the economy. Thơ's appointment was not universally popular, with some leading figures privately lobbying for a clean break from the Diệm era.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} prosecuted {{in absentia}} and convicted seven Croatian Serbs for killing {{of at least}} 75 persons in the Baćin massacre in 2013. Commanding officer of SAO Krajina TO in Dubica Milinko Janjetović, commander of SAO Krajina police in Dubica Momčilo Kovačević and two of their subordinates, Stevo Radunović and Veljko Radunović were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, and Stevan Dodoš was sentenced to 15 {{years in prison for}} organizing detention of <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> and participation in their execution near Baćin. Head of the SAO Krajina civilian authorities in Dubica, Branko Dmitrović and the commander of SAO Krajina TO in Kostajnica, Slobodan Borojević, were sentenced to 15 years in prison each under the command responsibility for failing to prevent or punish the crime.|$|E
5|$|In early November 1822, the {{schooner}} USS Alligator, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Allen, put into Matanzas, Cuba, intending to patrol the area as part of the United States Navy's West Indian Anti-Piracy Campaign. Upon arriving at the port, Allen discovered two Americans attempting to raise $7,000 in order to pay a ransom to a band of pirates that had captured their vessels. If the ransom was not delivered, the pirates threatened to destroy the ships and rough up their crews. Learning from these men that the pirates were holed up some 15 leagues away, Allen took <b>the</b> <b>civilians</b> aboard and decided to make an attempt at recovering their ship from the buccaneers.|$|E
25|$|In practice, this {{is taken}} as a {{directive}} meaning the IAF bears the responsibility of safeguarding Indian airspace and thus furthering national interests {{in conjunction with the}} other branches of the armed forces. The IAF provides close air support to the Indian Army troops on the battlefield as well as strategic and tactical airlift capabilities. The Integrated Space Cell is operated by the Indian Armed Forces, <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> Department of Space, and the Indian Space Research Organisation. By uniting <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> run space exploration organizations and the military faculty under a single Integrated Space Cell the military is able to efficiently benefit from innovation in <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> sector of space exploration, and <b>the</b> <b>civilian</b> departments benefit as well.|$|R
