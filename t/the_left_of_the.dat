5|$|A large {{range of}} {{seventeenth and eighteenth}} century monuments survive, mainly in the chancel. They include some {{for members of the}} major landowning {{families}} in the (original) parish, including the Powells of Nanteos (who were long-time Lords of the Manor of Llanbadarn Fawr) and the Pryses of Gogerddan. A white marble tablet was erected in 1666 to Colonel John Jones, of Nanteos. Several of the monuments are substantial, including that to Lewis Pryse, erected by his widow Margaret, to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north wall window. To <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great east window is a monument erected by Mary Pryse in memory of several members of her family. To {{the right side of the}} altar – the epistle side of the chancel – is a monument to Thomas Powell. Several smaller monuments are mounted above both of these. In the south wall there is a large memorial to William Powell, and several smaller memorials.|$|E

50|$|The aorta {{begins at}} <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper border <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second sternocostal {{articulation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right side, and runs at first upward, backward, and to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trachea; then travels backward on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trachea and finally passes downward on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth thoracic vertebra.

50|$|In this technique, <b>the</b> {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodies is {{very similar}} to the one described just above. The athlete executing the technique is standing over his opponent's back, while the latter is down on his right knee. <b>The</b> <b>left</b> leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> athlete is straddling <b>the</b> <b>left</b> thigh <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent—the <b>left</b> knee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent is not on the floor—and is trapping <b>the</b> <b>left</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent by stepping on it. The athlete uses his left hand to push down on <b>the</b> side/back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent while with his right hand he pulls the opponent's right arm back, against his midsection. This creates an arm bar on the right arm with the pressure now being mostly on the elbow. The fallen opponent cannot relieve it, because his head is being shoved the opposite way by <b>the</b> <b>left</b> hand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> athlete executing the technique.|$|R
5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{composition of}} the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.|$|E
5|$|The underdrawing {{is visible}} through modern {{technical}} analysis, revealing the main group of figures and contour {{lines in the}} folds and drape of the clothing. The angels' wings to Mary's left are visible, but not those to the right, probably because of later overpainting. In the underdrawing Mary's gown extends far to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angel, but Christus apparently {{changed his mind about}} its execution.|$|E

Behind them in the blue waistcoat, King Stanisław August Poniatowski, annoyed, stands up from the throne, wanting to leave, and looking at his pocket watch.|$|E
25|$|Chimpanzees, other primates, {{and humans}} produce {{asymmetrical}} facial expressions with greater expression on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face (right hemisphere <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain). Researchers also subjectively reported that <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face was expressing more emotion using images of left-left chimeric faces.|$|R
50|$|Each {{hemisphere}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain interacts {{primarily with}} one half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body: <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain interacts with <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and vice versa. The developmental cause {{for this is}} uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retina, in both eyes, go to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, whereas connections from <b>the</b> right half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retina go to <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain. Because each half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retina receives light coming from <b>the</b> opposite half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world goes to <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain, and vice versa. Thus, <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain receives somatosensory input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, and visual input from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual field.|$|R

5|$|To <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{open space}} {{north of the}} medieval city are the steep {{southern}} slopes of the Brunkebergsåsen esker, a geological feature whose remains still stretch north through the city.

5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is {{the same as that of}} the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic {{as the air}} is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E
