5|$|Although it's {{believed}} that the San Jose Fault runs through campus, and geotechnical investigations have been conducted, there is uncertainty regarding its precise type and location.

5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising property taxes to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education.

5|$|In the mid-2000s, German sect experts {{expressed}} concerns that Scientologists were becoming {{active in the}} German after-school tutoring market. <b>These</b> <b>concerns</b> arose because customers of around 20 after-school tutoring centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by Scientologists, using Scientology methods. Brochures advertising the tutoring services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, but not Scientology itself.|$|E

5|$|Bordeaux was an {{important}} port for the German war effort, receiving {{a great deal of}} cargo, mostly raw materials, from overseas. It was also a major naval base, with huge submarine pens for U-boats. The Gironde estuary and Bordeaux had already been a target for the Allies. Operation Frankton was a 1942 commando raid targeting important shipping in the port. In January 1944, the Allies intercepted communications indicating that German commanders were concerned by the possibility of landings in the Bay of Biscay region of France. The next month, German naval and air units undertook anti-invasion exercises in the area. Ironside was intended to amplify <b>these</b> <b>concerns.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready to}} commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was <b>these</b> <b>concerns</b> that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E
5|$|China has had {{an organ}} {{transplantation}} programme since the 1960s. It {{is one of the}} largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. <b>These</b> <b>concerns</b> resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that he had taken part in organ extraction operations.|$|E

However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children with special needs was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. <b>These</b> <b>concerns</b> were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E

Following the USDA announcement to allow choices in purchasing decisions for ground beef, many school districts stated that they would opt out of serving ground beef with LFTB. By June 2012, 47 out of 50 U.S. states declined to purchase any of the product for the 2012–2013 school year while South Dakota Department of Education, Nebraska, and Iowa chose to continue buying it.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade.
