25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new <b>therapeutic</b> <b>class,</b> called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E

A comprehensive understanding of current procurement processes provides {{strong support for}} the development of effective policies. This study examined Brazilian Federal Government pharmaceutical procurement data provided by the Integrated System for the Administration of General Services (SIASG) database, from 2006 to 2013. Medicine purchases were aggregated by volume and expenditure for each year. Data on expenditure were adjusted for inflation using the Extended National Consumer Price Index (IPCA) for December 31, 2013. Lorenz distribution curves were used to study the cumulative proportion of purchased <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classes.</b> Expenditure variance analysis was performed to determine the impact of each factor, price and/or volume, on total expenditure variation. Annual expenditure on medicines increased 2. 72 times, while the purchased volume of drugs increased 1. 99 times. A limited number of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classes</b> dominated expenditure each year. Drugs for infectious diseases drove the increase in expenditures from 2006 to 2009 but were replaced by antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents beginning in 2010. Immunosuppressants (L 04), accounted for one third of purchases since 2010, showing the most substantial growth in expenditures during the period (250 -fold increase). The overwhelming price-related increase in expenditures caused by these medicines is bound to have a relevant impact on the sustainability of the pharmaceutical supply system. We observed increasing trends in expenditures, especially in specific <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classes.</b> We propose {{the development and implementation of}} better medicine procurement systems, and strategies to allow for monitoring of product price, effectiveness, and safety.

5000|$|The term empathogen, meaning [...] "generating a {{state of}} empathy", was coined in 1983-84 {{independently}} by Ralph Metzner and David E. Nichols as a term to denote a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>class</b> of drugs that includes MDMA and phenethylamine relatives. Nichols later rejected this initial terminology and adopted, instead, the term entactogen, meaning [...] "touching within", to denote this class of drugs, asserting a concern {{with the potential for}} improper association of the term empathogen with negative connotations related to the Greek root πάθος páthos ("suffering"). Additionally, Nicholas wanted to avoid any association with the term pathogenesis.Nichols also thought the original term was limiting, and did not cover other therapeutic uses for the drugs that go beyond instilling feelings of empathy. The hybrid word entactogen is derived from the roots en (within), tactus (touch) and -gen (produce). Neither term is dominant in usage, and, despite their difference in connotation, they are essentially interchangeable, as they refer to precisely the same chemicals.|$|E

50|$|Chemogenomics {{has been}} used to {{identify}} mode of action (MOA) for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda. Compounds contained in traditional medicines are usually more soluble than synthetic compounds, have “privileged structures” (chemical structures that are more frequently found to bind in different living organisms), and have more comprehensively known safety and tolerance factors. Therefore, this makes them especially attractive as a resource for lead structures in when developing new molecular entities. Databases containing chemical structures of compounds used in alternative medicine along with their phenotypic effects, in silico analysis may be of use to assist in determining MOA for example, by predicting ligand targets that were relevant to known phenotypes for traditional medicines. In a case study for TCM, the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>class</b> of ‘toning and replenishing medicine” was evaluated. Therapeutic actions (or phenotypes) for that class include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuroprotective, hypoglycemic activity, immunomodulatory, antimetastatic, and hypotensive. Sodium-glucose transport proteins and PTP1B (an insulin signaling regulator) were identified as targets which link to the hypoglycemic phenotype suggested. The case study for Ayurveda involved anti-cancer formulations. In this case, the target prediction program enriched for targets directly connected to cancer progression such as steroid-5-alpha-reductase and synergistic targets like the efflux pump P-gp. These target-phenotype links can help identify novel MOAs.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{unabated}} rise in medication costs particularly affects {{older persons}} with chronic conditions that require long-term medication use, but how prescription benefits affect medication adherence for such persons has received limited study. OBJECTIVE: We sought {{to study the}} relationship among prescription benefit status, health, and medication acquisition {{in a sample of}} elderly HMO enrollees with 1 or more common, chronic conditions. RESEARCH DESIGN: We implemented a cross-sectional cohort study using primary survey data collected in 2000 and administrative data from the previous 2 years. SUBJECTS: Subjects were aged 67 years of age and older, continuously enrolled in a Medicare + Choice program for at least 2 years, and diagnosed with 1 or more of hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease (n = 3073). MEASURES: Outcomes were the mean daily number of essential <b>therapeutic</b> drug <b>classes</b> and refill adherence. RESULTS: In multivariate models, persons without a prescription benefit acquired medications in 0. 15 fewer <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classes</b> daily and experienced lower refill adherence (approximately 7 fewer days of necessary medications during the course of 2 years) than those with a prescription benefit. A significant interaction revealed that, among those without a benefit, persons in poor health acquired medications in 0. 73 more <b>therapeutic</b> <b>classes</b> daily than persons in excellent health; health status did not significantly influence medication acquisition for those with a benefit.
