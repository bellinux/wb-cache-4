5|$|December 2012 marked <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> b'ak'tun—a {{time period}} in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in Central America prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the Olmec, it has become closely {{associated}} with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900AD. The writing system of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered, meaning that a corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the European conquest.|$|E
5|$|Finally, within 36 {{hours of}} a game's {{conclusion}} (including <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suspended game), the official scorer is required to create {{a summary of the}} game using a form established by the league. This task is performed for each game that is scored, including called games which must be completely replayed at a later date, and games that end in forfeit. The information in the score report includes the date, location of the game, the names of the teams, the names of the umpires who officiated the game, the final score, and the data that is required in rule 10.02.|$|E

25|$|Inductive {{reasoning}} contrasts {{strongly with}} deductive reasoning in that, {{even in the}} best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, {{the truth of the}} premises does not guarantee <b>the</b> truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion.</b> Instead, <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inductive argument follows with some degree <b>of</b> probability. Relatedly, <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.|$|R
5|$|Virginia Tech {{returned}} the kick to their 43-yard line, and the Hokies proceeded {{to run out}} the clock by executing running plays—which do not stop the clock at their conclusion. Tempers ran high among Texas players, and Texas defender Stoney Clark was ejected from the game after throwing the football at a Virginia Tech player following <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> play. Texas was assessed two personal-foul penalties, which advanced {{the ball to the}} Texas 31-yard line and gave Virginia Tech a first down. Tech continued to run down the clock with rushing plays, and the Hokies brought in freshman backup quarterback Al Clark to supervise the game's final plays. The clock rolled to zero, and Virginia Tech secured a 2810 victory.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the Athabasca Oil Sands. He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing {{an overhaul of the}} province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had to cope with a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Apamea {{was fought}} on 19 July 998 between {{the forces of}} the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate. The battle was part of a series of {{military}} confrontations between the two powers over control of northern Syria and the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo. The Byzantine regional commander, Damian Dalassenos, had been besieging Apamea, until the arrival of the Fatimid relief army from Damascus, under Jaysh ibn Samsama. In the subsequent battle, the Byzantines were initially victorious, but a lone Kurdish rider managed to kill Dalassenos, throwing the Byzantine army into panic. The fleeing Byzantines were then pursued, with much loss of life, by the Fatimid troops. This defeat forced the Byzantine emperor Basil II to personally campaign in the region the next year, and was followed in 1001 by <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ten-year truce between the two states.|$|E

5|$|The Caliph {{dispatched}} new {{forces to}} Sicily under Ammar ibn Ali al-Kalbi {{and his brother}} al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi. In spring/summer 956, the Fatimid fleet clashed with and defeated the Byzantine fleet in two battles in the Straits of Messina, followed by Fatimid raids on the Calabrian coast. In the aftermath of these raids, Marianos travelled to the Fatimid court in person, and sought a truce {{in exchange for the}} resumption of a payment of tribute and the annual release of prisoners of war taken in the East. Al-Mu'izz agreed to these terms, but warfare resumed soon after, when the Byzantine admiral Basil destroyed the mosque built by the Fatimids at Rhegion and raided Termini. Marianos therefore returned to the Fatimid court in a second embassy in 957, going first through Sicily, where he apparently delivered to the local Fatimid governor, Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Kalbi, the agreed tribute. During the reception by al-Mu'izz, Marianos presented a letter by Constantine VII confirming the terms agreed during the first embassy, but this time al-Mu'izz rejected the terms. As a result of the breakdown in these negotiations, Constantine VII sent a massive expedition to Italy under admirals Krambeas and Moroleon, while Marianos commanded the land troops. The Fatimids under the Kalbid brothers al-Hasan and Ammar were victorious over Marianos, but following the arrival of the Byzantine reinforcements the Fatimid fleet left Calabria, only to suffer a shipwreck on its return to Sicily. Marianos is no longer mentioned in Italy after that, although he may have led a third embassy to al-Mu'izz in September 958, which led to <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> five-year truce between the two powers.|$|E
