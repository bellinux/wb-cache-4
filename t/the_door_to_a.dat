5|$|All four cover sleeves for Rock 'n' Roll Circus were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer ND Chow. The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki holding <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> red telephone box in Covent Garden, London, with the album title {{and her name}} superimposed on the booth. This marks Hamasaki's third album cover to be photographed and directed outside of Japan, after LOVEppears and (Miss)understood. The CD and music video DVD format has a close-up of Hamasaki's face, with parts of the British stripes across her face. The box set is coloured black with the red British cross near the corner; the album version is the CD and DVD format, with the CD and DVD cover imprinted onto the mug, red tea tin, and the bag. The digital release uses the standalone CD format. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Chow, and the design was based on Hamasaki's {{first visit to the}} UK and Britannia. First pressing issues for both the standalone CD format, the CD and DVD format, and the box set included a 36–page photo album of Hamasaki roaming the streets and wondering around stores and markets in London.|$|E
5|$|Ellen tells Mulder {{that she}} saw a {{reflection}} in the mirror earlier, and that's what killed Martha. Mulder believes the glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people. Ellen believes Jenny Uphouse summoned the spirits, but she denies it. Later, Ellen finds a skeleton key in her house and a raven by her baby's crib. In a mirror, Ellen sees the reflection of a monster chasing after her, but it suddenly breaks. She hides in the closet until Phil comes home and finds her. However, he attributes the commotion to stress, believing that she is imagining things. Mulder finds the skeleton key and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon's coat pocket. Mulder deduces that the sheriff is having an affair with Jenny. Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father. The sheriff reveals that the key opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> motel, where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs. Meanwhile, at the motel, Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature.|$|E

25|$|Living at {{the edge}} of town, however, led to Eiseley's early {{interest}} in the natural world, to which he turned when being at home was too difficult.

25|$|For Michel Christol, {{the term}} Liberum must be {{understood}} in this context and in an abstract sense. This liberty derives from belonging to a city and expresses {{the end of the}} civitas’ dependence, “the elevation of a community of peregrini to the liberty of Roman citizenship”, which also served to placate the fears of the inhabitants of the pagus and to open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> later promotion, to the status of a colony. This promotion took place in 261 CE, during the reign of Gallienus, following an appeal from Aulus Vitellius Felix Honoratus in Michel Christol’s version of events. Thereafter, the defence of the libertas publica was not a question of defending a privilege at risk, but of requesting the “ultimate liberty” (summa libertas) - the promotion to the status of a colony. Michel Christol also points out the abstract character of terms such as libertas or dignitas; despite their abstract use, they are references to concrete and unique events.|$|E

25|$|Feeling {{abused by}} the railroads and the grain elevators, militant farm {{organizations}} appeared, notably the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA), formed in 1909. Guided by {{the ideas of}} William Irvine and later by Henry Wise Wood, the UFA was intended at first to represent economic interests rather than to act as another political party. But farmers' dissatisfaction with Liberal provincial policies and Conservative federal policies, combined with falling wheat prices and a railroad scandal, drove the farmers to favour direct politics and the election of three Farmer-oriented MLAs and a MP in the 1917 to 1921 period opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> general contesting for power in 1921. There was an overwhelming UFA landslide in the provincial legislature in 1921. Alberta also gave strong support to UFA and Labour candidates in the 1921 federal election. The elected MPs worked with the Progressive Party of Canada, a national farm organization. Together they held {{the balance of power}} for the minority Liberal and Conservative governments in power for much of the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Penderecki {{was born}} in Dębica, to Tadeusz Penderecki, a lawyer, and Zofia (née Wittgenstein). Penderecki's grandfather, Robert Berger, was a highly talented painter and {{director}} of the local bank at the time of Penderecki's birth; Robert's father Johann moved to Dębica from Breslau (now Wrocław) in the mid-19th century. His grandmother was an Armenian from Isfahan, Iran. Penderecki used to go to Armenian Church in Kraków with her. Penderecki was the youngest of three siblings; his sister, Barbara, was married to a mining engineer, and his older brother, Janusz, was studying law and medicine {{at the time of his}} birth. Tadeusz was a violinist and also played piano. In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and Penderecki's family moved out of their apartment as the Ministry of Food was to operate there. After the war, Penderecki began attending grammar school in 1946. He began studying the violin under Stanisław Darłak, Dębica's military bandmaster who organized an orchestra for the local music society after the war. Upon graduating from grammar school, Penderecki moved to Kraków in 1951, where he attended Jagiellonian University. He studied violin with Stanisław Tawroszewicz and music theory with Franciszek Skołyszewski. In 1954, Penderecki entered the Academy of Music in Kraków and, having finished his studies on violin after his first year, focused entirely on composition. Penderecki's main teacher there was Artur Malawski, a composer known for his choral works and orchestral works, as well as chamber music and songs. After Malawski's death in 1957, Penderecki took further lessons with Stanisław Wiechowicz, a composer primarily known for his choral works. At the time, the 1956 overthrow of Stalinism in Poland lifted strict Communist cultural censorship and opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wave of creativity.|$|E
25|$|The third series {{staggered}} {{the entry}} of new characters and only Robin appeared in all thirteen episodes. As the series opens, Tuck (David Harewood), a spiritual preacher returning to England, and Kate (Joanne Froggatt), a Locksley villager, are introduced; both soon becoming part of Robin's gang. Isabella (Lara Pulver), Gisborne's younger sister who is running from an abusive husband, arrives soon after and starts a secret relationship with Robin. Her link to the castle through Gisborne {{is used by the}} gang while she plots revenge against her brother, but her thirst for independence, power and vengeance soon leads her to become a ruthless Sheriff and a sworn enemy. Toby Stephens appears as Prince John in three episodes mid-series, successfully exploiting the rift between Gisborne and Sheriff Vaisey, leading to the latter's supposed death at Gisborne's hand. Gisborne is briefly made Sheriff before Isabella uses her influence to replace him, leaving Gisborne a fugitive, and following the death of a young villager with whom he was briefly imprisoned, seeking revenge. This opens <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> liaison with Robin and sets up the tenth episode of the series, told largely through flashbacks, which revisits Robin and Gisborne's history. It features Dean Lennox Kelly, Sophie Winkleman, Paul Hilton and Ian Reddington as Robin's father, Gisborne's parents and another past Locksley villager respectively, and reveals the existence of Archer (played by Clive Standen from episode 11), the illegitimate child of Robin's father and Gisborne's mother, who Robin's dying father begs them to find. Archer is Robin's equal with a bow and arrow. (This, coupled with his biological ties to Robin, Gisborne and Isabella, led to speculation that he was set to take over the programme's lead role following Jonas Armstrong's departure.) Having found Archer, who promptly abandons them after escaping, Gisborne and Robin return to Nottingham with a tentative alliance formed, setting up the two-part series finale, where Robin and Gisborne decide to take Nottingham Castle to prepare for King Richard's return. Although they are lured into a trap set by Archer and Isabella, they succeed when Archer turns against his half-sister. However, Allan is killed by a storm of arrows when Vaisey reappears at the head of an army wielding Byzantine fire. Gisborne is killed in a sword fight with the Sheriff and Isabella as he defends the castle, and Robin is poisoned by the blade of Isabella. However, before succumbing to his injury, Robin evacuates the villagers from Nottingham, and fires a flaming arrow into the Byzantine fire stored in the castle. Vaisey and Isabella realize too late and perish with their army in an explosion that destroys Nottingham Castle. As the castle burns, Robin returns to Sherwood Forest, says goodbye to the remainder of his Merry Men and encourages Archer to take up the defense of the people of England. Robin heads off on his own, and is greeted by Marian in a vision to welcome him into the afterlife. The remaining outlaws find Robin's body, and after a small ceremony, set out to continue their quest to end suffering in England.|$|E

500|$|Despite his reservations, in October 2011 Virtanen {{cooperated with}} another scholar, Vesa Sirén, to prepare {{three of the}} more {{developed}} fragments for performance. The sketches were copied and tidied, but nothing not written by Sibelius {{was added to the}} material. Permission from the Sibelius Rights Holders was secured, and John Storgårds, chief conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic, agreed to play and record these excerpts at the orchestra's rehearsal session on 30 October 2011. The pieces comprise an opening segment of about a minute's duration, an eight-second fragment that might be part of a scherzo, and a final scrap of orchestral music again lasting roughly a minute. Sirén describes the music as [...] "strange, powerful, and with daring, spicy harmonies—a step into the new even after Tapiola and the music for The Tempest". Stearns gives a more detailed insight: [...] "The first excerpt is classic Sibelian announcement of a first movement. There's a genteel orchestral thunderclap that throws open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> harmonic world that is Sibelius' alone, but has strange dissonances unlike any other work. Another glimpse sounds like the beginning of a scherzo, surprisingly spring-like with a buoyant flute solo. Another snippet has a classic Sibelian bassoon solo, the sort that speaks of primal things and goes to a dark, wintry underworld." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{allowing}} the {{trustee of the}} will to retain the property {{is at the heart}} of the [...] "fraud", it is not clear why courts have considered the appropriate remedy to recognise a trust on behalf of others, rather than a resulting trust in favour of the estate (the residuary legatee). To this it has been argued that, since the testator is dead, a resulting trust is often reversing the beneficiary's claims since the testator cannot make any attempt to revoke or undo the trust terms. Save in case of a will and except the plain reading of clauses within the will, having admitted external evidence as operating under the proper introduction of the doctrine of incorporation by reference, a conclusive claim that it is necessary to observe further the formality requirement cannot be disregarded, because Will Act clearly set out the requirements of property transfer in case of failure has to be based on result trust that a party ultimately intended. The enforcement of the secret trust as a response to perceived fraud also opens <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> further form of deceit, whereby the trustee funnels the trust monies to the wrong beneficiary.
