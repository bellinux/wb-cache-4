The experiment was carried out at the Federal University of Tocantins in arandomized complete block design with 24 treatments and 6 replicates. A method based on leaf length and leafwidth was used to <b>determine</b> <b>total</b> leaf <b>area.</b> The results showed that total leaf area was underestimated when onlysmall leaves were sampled. On the other hand, total leaf area was overestimated when only large leaves weresampled. It shows that the measurement of large and medium leaves at the upper and middle of the plant can beused to <b>determine</b> <b>total</b> leaf <b>area.</b> We therefore conclude that sampling forms {{is determined by the}} period ofmeasurement; the fourth period of measurement is the most indicated to quantify the width of Jatropha curcasleaves; and to the measurement of total leaf area, the upper side of the plant was the best place of sampling...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{reasoning}} is {{a skill that}} needs to be developed in students as it isimportant in geometry for <b>determining</b> <b>total</b> surface <b>areas</b> and volumes of 3 -dimensional shapes (Liedtke, 1995). Simply teaching children the formulae, in this case for finding total surface areas, can limit them in understanding mathematics conceptually (Bonotto, 2003). As pointed out in the NCTM Principles and Standards (2000) : Some students may have difficulty finding the surface area of three-dimen-sional shapes using two-dimensional representations because they cannot visualize the unseen faces of the shapes. Experience with models of three-dimensional shapes and their two-dimensional “nets” 1 is useful in such visualization … Students should build three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional representations (p. 237). Helping students establish a relationship between the total surface area of a three-dimensional solid and the area of a two-dimensional net should help them in understanding total surface area conceptually.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{develop a}} {{mathematical}} model for the determination of total areas under curves from various metabolic studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — In Tai's Model, the total area under a curve is computed by dividing the area under the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total area under the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method Gess than ± 0. 4 %). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total area under a metabolic curve by a great margin. RESULTS — Tai's model proves {{to be able to}} 1) <b>determine</b> <b>total</b> <b>area</b> under a curve with precision; 2) calculate area with varied shapes {{that may or may not}} intercept on one or both X/Y axes; 3) estimate total area under a curve plotted against varied time intervals (abscissas), whereas other formulas only allow the same time interval; an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{this paper}} was to develop and {{demonstrate}} practical methods for computing sub-pixel areas (SPAs) from coarse-resolution satellite sensor data. The methods were tested and verified using: (a) global irrigated area map (GIAM) at 10 -km resolution based, primarily, on AVHRR data, and (b) irrigated area map for India at 500 -m based, primarily, on MODIS data. The sub-pixel irrigated areas (SPIAs) from coarseresolution satellite sensor data were estimated by multiplying the full pixel irrigated areas (FPIAs) with irrigated area fractions (IAFs). Three methods were presented for IAF computation: (a) Google Earth Estimate (IAF-GEE); (b) High resolution imagery (IAF-HRI); and (c) Sub-pixel de-composition technique (IAF-SPDT). The IAF-GEE involved the use of “zoom-in-views ” of sub-meter to 4 -meter very high resolution imagery (VHRI) from Google Earth and helped <b>determine</b> <b>total</b> <b>area</b> available for irrigation (TAAI) or net irrigated areas that does not consider intensity or seasonality of irrigation. The IAF-HRI is a well known method that uses finer-resolution data to determine SPAs of the coarserresolution imagery.

50|$|Using {{the above}} equation, Wm (red line) is plotted in Figure 3 for {{different}} values of Eg (or nph).Now, we can fully use Henry’s graphical QE analysis, {{taking into account}} the two major intrinsic losses in the efficiency of solar cells. The two main intrinsic losses are radiative recombination, and the inability of single junction solar cells to properly match the broad solar energy spectrum. The shaded area under the red line represents the maximum work done by ideal infinite multi-junction solar cells. Hence, the limiting efficiency of ideal infinite multi-junction solar cells is evaluated to be 68.8% by comparing the shaded area defined by the red line with the <b>total</b> photon-flux <b>area</b> <b>determined</b> by the black line. (This is why this method is called “graphical” QE analysis.) Although this limiting efficiency value is consistent with the values published by Parrott and Vos in 1979: 64% and 68.2% respectively,there is a small gap between the estimated value in this report and literature values. This minor difference is most likely due to the different ways how to approximate the photon flux from 0 eV to 0.3096 eV. Here, we approximated the photon flux from 0 eV to 0.3096 eV as the same as the photon flux at 0.31 eV.|$|R

Clones with the best biosynthetic potential were multiplied for phytochemical investigations. The amounts of terpenoid and polyene compounds in the genetically transformed cultures were compared with those in in-vivo plants. In Hungary a wild chamomile population was found which contained significant amount of (-) -alpha-bisabolol in the oil from the inflorescence. We used biotechnological methods to preserve the genome of this wild type. Transformed chamomile root cultures were obtained by infection of sterile organized cultures with Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains #A- 4,# 15834, and #R- 1601. Hairy roots freed from bacteria were cultivated on solid medium and then in liquid, hormone-free, B 5 and MS media. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the essential oil was examined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The volatile compounds were identified by comparing their retention times with those of authentic standards and of essential oils of known composition, and by peak enrichment. Confirmation of identity was achieved by comparison of mass spectra with those {{reported in the literature}} and those of reference compounds. The amount of each component {{as a percentage of the}} <b>total</b> was <b>determined</b> by <b>area</b> normalization.

Most colorectal carcinomas develop from adenomas (adenoma-carcinoma sequence) in a process due to accumulation of molecular genetic alterations. About 5 % of adenomatous polyps are expected to become malignant, but data on the differential angiogenic patterns of these lesions in patients with and without concomitant cancer are missing. The aim {{of the present study}} is to compare the angiogenic and lymphatic patterns of adenomatous polyps from patients with and without sporadic cancer. Thirty adenomatous polyps (15 from patients with another principal malignant lesion, and 15 from patients without cancer) were submitted to immunohistochemical staining for CD 105 (marker for neoangiogenesis) and D 2 - 40 (marker for lymphatic endothelium). Microvessel density and <b>total</b> vascular <b>area</b> were <b>determined</b> by computer image analysis to quantify the immunostained and total areas, and to assess the number of microvessels.

There was an inverse linear relationship {{between the number of}} myelinated fibers per square millimeter and increasing age. A stronger correlation was found between the number of Schwann cell nuclei per nerve (P less than 0. 01) and per square millimeter (P less than 0. 001) and the logarithm of age. The slope of myelin thickness/axon diameter regression lines (P less than 0. 001) changed with age in linear relationship (correlation coefficient: P less than 0. 001). There were no age-dependent changes in the number and density of unmyelinated fibers, but the number of unmyelinated axons per Schwann cell subunit decreased with age. Size distribution histograms for myelinated fibers showed a unimodal profile in the newborn. A second peak at 6 - 7 micron appeared at age 3 months, shifting progressively to 9 - 11 micron at 14 years. The distribution of unmyelinated fibers was unimodal, with a peak around 0. 8 micron, irrespective of age. There were marked individual variations in endoneurial area...|$|R

The parameters required to create suitable habitat {{need to be addressed}} to fully understand factors that limit the success or decline of a population. The Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a threatened seabird, foraging in the ocean and nesting inland in large old-growth trees. Management of this species should focus on the protection of large, contiguous old growth areas, in low elevation areas near productive marine habitat. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) these requirements were combined creating a suitability map, showing areas ranging from high to low suitability habitat within the Carmanah Valley / Walbran area. The effects of forest fragmentation were addressed through the analysis of the suitability raster in Fragstats to <b>determine</b> <b>total</b> patch <b>area,</b> patch size and proximity.
