5|$|The pre-dreadnought's {{armament}} {{was completed}} by a tertiary battery of light, rapid-fire guns. These could be of any calibre from 3-inch (76mm) down to machine guns. Their role was to give short-range protection against torpedo boats, or to rake <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> superstructure of a battleship.|$|E
5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction. <b>The</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> turret roof armour proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side armour was {{not strong enough to}} withstand the shock of impact from heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|The Route139 {{project will}} {{rehabilitate}} the eastbound side of Hoboken Avenue Viaduct and resurface the westbound roadway. There will be operational improvements at several intersections {{on the upper}} roadway, replacing all overpasses. It will replace <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> rehabilitate the superstructure of the Conrail Viaduct. The total project cost is estimated at $180–200million {{and is expected to}} be completed by 2016.|$|E

The winner of the last trick also receives ten bonus round points. The total value of <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> (<b>and</b> thus the maximum amount of round points) is 230 points.|$|E
5|$|A large {{squadron}} of ten frigates, including Aigle, was eventually {{able to make}} its way up the western passage on 9 August, enduring fire from batteries {{on both sides of}} the river for more than two hours. Aigle, in the centre, had her stern frame shattered when a shell fell through <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> exploded, killing a marine and wounding four other members of the crew. She was the only ship to suffer any damage and her casualties amounted to almost half the total of two killed and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|At nightfall, as {{the three}} swap stories, the great white returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull and killing the power. The men work through the night, {{repairing}} the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line {{is tied to the}} stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backwards, swamping <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> flooding the engine compartment before breaking the cleats off. He then heads toward shore, intending to lure the shark to shallower waters and suffocate it, but the overtaxed engine fails.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} slab is constructed {{to provide a}} smooth transition between <b>the</b> bridge <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> existing roadway pavement. The differential settlement between <b>the</b> bridge <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{approach slab}} leads {{to the formation of}} a "Bump" at the bridge. This is mainly due to difference support systems for <b>the</b> bridge <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> slab. A detailed literature review had been done on the causes and the mitigation techniques available...|$|R

5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted further damage to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' hulls. Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> huge quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E

5|$|Hood {{was due to}} be modernised in 1941 {{to bring}} her up to a {{standard}} {{similar to that of}} other modernised World War I-era capital ships. She would have received new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin 5.25-inch gun turrets and six octuple 2-pounder pom-poms. Her 5-inch upper armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition the conning tower would have been removed and her bridge rebuilt. The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast capital ship, meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s she was in need of a lengthy overhaul.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two spans, 64.1 feet and 81.10 feet, with a 3.2 feet gap between them. The combined trussed portions of the bridge are 149.1 feet long. The bridge's Town lattice is an unusual design choice, but the later addition of the queen trusses are also unusual, resulting in a unique visual appearance by the bridge's unequal spans. This gives the appearance of kingposts within the queenposts. Since {{the addition of the}} steel I-beam flooring in 1973, the trusses have supported nothing but themselves. The State of Connecticut's lists the bridge as CT 1338 and the May 2012 inspection of the bridge found <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> superstructure conditions to be satisfactory and condition of the substructure to be fair. The West Cornwall Covered bridge has been appraised as functionally obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Stord Bridge was undertaken {{as part of the}} same contract as the Bømla Bridge, which was awarded in December 1998 to Triangle Contractors, a joint venture between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Most of the work was carried out by NCC with HBG having responsibility for the steel parts of <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> the cables. HBG had previously built the steel for the Osterøy Bridge, which opened in 1997. The responsibility for the cables was given to Brown Beach Associates and Hordaland Mekaniske Verksted. Construction started on 20 February 1999. After the pylons were completed on 25 September 1999, two catwalks were erected between them, with the constructors choosing two continuous catwalks instead of three separate pairs. Extra stability to the catwalks was achieved by building connections between the two.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak was {{initially}} armed with 24 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns on <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> 11 rifled breech-loading (RBL) Armstrong seven-inch, 110-pounder guns. Eight {{of these were}} also on <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other three served as chase guns on <b>the</b> upper <b>deck,</b> two at <b>the</b> bow and one aft.|$|R
50|$|These decks {{consist of}} 60 cards in total, 50 cards in <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> 10 cards in <b>the</b> gate <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> main <b>deck</b> {{contains}} member, tactics, and paradox cards, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gate <b>deck</b> must consist of exactly 10 gate cards. You may {{have up to}} four cards {{of the same name}} in <b>the</b> main <b>deck,</b> <b>and</b> up to two cards of the same Gate number in <b>the</b> gate <b>deck.</b>|$|R
50|$|All {{that remains}} of the old bridge are the piers, abutments, <b>and</b> towers. <b>The</b> <b>decking</b> <b>and</b> cables were removed in 1958. These are listed as a Category I {{historic}} place by Heritage New Zealand.|$|R
5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, almost all of the compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E
5|$|French {{fire was}} {{taking its toll}} on the British ship, and at 22:20, Amethysts {{mizzenmast}} was shot through and collapsed on the quarterdeck, smashing the wheel and impeding Seymour's command of his ship. Thétis began to pull ahead and Pinsum attempted to rake Amethyst in her disorganised state, turning sharply to starboard but coming to a sudden halt as her own mizzenmast collapsed. With their ability to manoeuvre severely hindered, Amethyst and Thétis gradually closed on one another, Pinsum ordering the soldiers on his frigate to board the British vessel and capture her, while Seymour prepared for the eventuality by loading his cannon with two roundshot and his carronades with double loads of grapeshot. At 23:00, Pinsum suddenly swung his frigate towards Amethyst, the bows colliding and rebounding and the French stern swinging towards the British. At his signal, the soldiers and sailors crowded onto <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> railings, ready to leap onto the British ship and engage her crew in hand-to-hand combat. With seconds remaining, Seymour ordered his gunners to fire. The double-shotted broadside, fired at point-blank range, killed or wounded over 100 men, including most of the officers. Only four guns were still serviceable on Thétis, which was set alight in three places due to {{the proximity of the}} British muzzle flashes.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E
50|$|The LST-491 class {{replaced}} the elevator {{installed in the}} original LST-1 class, to transfer equipment between <b>the</b> tank <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> main <b>deck,</b> with a ramp that was hinged at <b>the</b> main <b>deck.</b> This allowed vehicles to be driven directly from <b>the</b> main <b>deck</b> onto <b>the</b> tank <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> then across <b>the</b> bow ramp to the beach or causeway, speeding the process of disembarkation.|$|R
50|$|Wire {{shelving}} {{for industrial}} use consists of steel wire, used for <b>the</b> <b>decking,</b> <b>and</b> steel sheets, {{used for the}} supports. The wire makes up about 60% of the weight and the sheet steel about 40%.|$|R

5|$|The fleet {{returned}} to waters off Okinawa on 4 May and renewed its {{attacks on the}} airfields on the Sakishima Islands. Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second {{in command of the}} BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were {{able to take advantage of}} the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.|$|E
5|$|When Cord wakes up, {{he finds}} Chi who was {{instructed}} to kill him, but she decides to free him after a conversation. Cord and Chi head for the quayside at level 1 and manage to lower a bridge leading to a helicopter. After they free Alexandria, they fly away as the base is destroyed. After they spot Nagarov's nuclear submarine, they land on it. Cord and Chi explore the submarine to prevent the missile from being launched. They {{take care of the}} guards, and hear messages about problems with the reactor. After they split up, Lukyan knocks Chi down and takes her to a lower level. Lukyan later ambushes Cord, but he manages to kill him by pushing him into a turbine. In the bridge room, Nagarov enters armed with a gun, and after their conversation, Cord hits Nagarov with a ladder. Cord uses two keys he found to abort the missile launch. After releasing Chi, a message is heard {{that there is only one}} minute left to a critical reactor failure. They return to <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> are picked up by Alexandria in the helicopter just before the submarine explodes. In the end sequence, Cord phones Alpha and tells her that he has dumped his information about her deal with Nagarov on the Chinese and American intelligence nets. The game ends showing Cord, Chi, and Alexandria approaching a beach where the sun sets.|$|E
