5|$|The Giants {{struggled}} in 2015, finishing 6-10 again {{and third in}} <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> due to the Giants defense blowing {{the lead in the}} final minutes in 6 of their 10 games. Despite their defensive struggles, Quarterback Eli Manning threw for a career-high 35 touchdown passes and also set career highs in attempts and completions. After the season, head coach Tom Coughlin resigned after 12 seasons.|$|E
5|$|As the Giants began 2011, many NFL analysts {{predicted}} that the Philadelphia Eagles were a favorite to win <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title, while the Giants were not expected to make the playoffs. The Giants opened their regular season against the Washington Redskins on September 11, 2011, and lost in FedEx Field 28–14. The Giants then won three straight games, including breaking their six-game losing streak to Philadelphia. By Week 9, New York was 6–2 after beating the Patriots in Foxboro for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLII. At this point however, they entered a difficult stretch of games and lost four straight to a resurgent 49ers, followed by the Eagles, Saints, and Packers. By now, the Giants found their chances of beating Dallas to the division title fading and Tom Coughlin's coaching abilities were increasingly called into question despite reassurances from team president John Mara {{that there were no}} plans to fire him. However, the Giants kept their playoff hopes alive in Week 14 by beating the Cowboys in Dallas on a last-second scoring drive led by Eli Manning and extending their win streak in Cowboys Stadium to three straight games. Despite another loss to the Redskins afterwards, the Giants defeated the New York Jets in Week 16 by a final score of 29-14, also eliminating the Eagles from playoff contention, to set up a rematch with the Dallas Cowboys in which the winner would win <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East.</b> The game was later flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants beat the Cowboys 31–14 to win <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> with a record of 9-7. Throughout the regular season, Eli Manning (always viewed as a weak QB compared to his brother) put up some of the best stats of his career.|$|E
5|$|The Giants won <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> {{title for}} the first time since 2000 with a 30–21 win against the Oakland Raiders in the final game of the season. The Giants lost 23–0 to the Carolina Panthers in the first round of the playoffs however. The 2005 Giants had five pro bowlers, {{including}} Barber (who set a team record in rushing yards during the season), Shockey, Strahan, Defensive End Osi Umenyiora, and Special teamer David Tyree.|$|E
50|$|After {{losing to}} <b>the</b> 2007 <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> Champion Dallas Cowboys the week before, The Packers headed down south to play <b>the</b> 2007 <b>NFC</b> South Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|$|R
50|$|With the win, the Chargers {{finished}} {{the season with}} an 11-game winning streak and {{with a record of}} 13-3 and also were the only team in the AFC West to sweep <b>the</b> whole <b>NFC</b> <b>East.</b>|$|R
5000|$|...* The 2007 New York Giants are <b>the</b> only <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> {{team to win}} a Super Bowl as a Wild Card team, and {{the only}} NFL team in history to win the Super Bowl as a 5th Seed in either Conference.|$|R
5|$|The Giants, Dallas Cowboys, and Washington Redskins {{finished}} the 1985 season with identical 10–6 records. Dallas was awarded <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title {{because they had}} the best head-to-head record among the three teams. The Giants were awarded a wild card berth because of their record in NFC play, while Washington did not qualify for the playoffs due to a head-to-head loss against the San Francisco 49ers, who also finished 10–6.|$|E
5|$|The Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams (NFC West), and New Orleans Saints (NFC West) {{finished}} the 1988 season with identical 10–6 records. Philadelphia was awarded <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title {{due to a}} head-to-head sweep of the Giants in regular season play, while Los Angeles was awarded a wild card berth based on winning percentage in NFC play. The Giants and Saints did not qualify for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 2006. The season was {{characterized}} by inconsistent play, criticism of the coaching {{by the media and}} players, and Manning's struggles. They won five straight following a 1–2 start, giving them a two-game lead in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East,</b> but they lost six of their last seven games, and the players publicly clashed with Coughlin. One of the team's worst losses was a 24–21 defeat to Tennessee, in which the team surrendered a 21-point 4th-quarter lead. Following a season-ending win at Washington, the Giants made the playoffs as a wild card in spite of their record, but were defeated 23–20 by Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|Tuck's {{rookie season}} in the NFL found him behind Pro Bowl {{defensive}} ends Michael Strahan and Osi Umenyiora on the New York Giants depth chart, reducing his role to special teams and the first backup at each defensive end position. In total, Tuck played in 14 regular season games with one start and <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Wild Card Game. His first career sack came against <b>the</b> Giants' <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> rival, <b>the</b> Dallas Cowboys.|$|R
50|$|With {{the loss}} to the Redskins the Ravens fell to 9-4 and 0-2 on <b>the</b> road against <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> teams. Also, {{it was the first}} {{consecutive}} loss for the Ravens since Week 6 of their 2009 season.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, the Meredith Corporation (having {{acquired}} WFSB in June 1997) purchased W67DF {{in order}} {{to set up a}} separate operation in the Pioneer Valley. Reasons for such a launch ranged from local advertising opportunities, along with being able to assert the Pioneer Valley as a secondary New England Patriots market, allowing Meredith to avert from pre-empting Patriots games in a market such as Hartford/New Haven where split allegiances to the AFC East's New York Jets or Buffalo Bills (along with <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East's</b> New York Giants in selected weeks) are maintained. In November of that year, the station joined CBS and adopted the call sign WSHM-LP after officially upgrading to low-powered status. TBN remains available easily through all cable and satellite providers in the area.|$|R
5|$|Originally, {{the home}} {{teams in the}} playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation. From 1970 to 1974, the {{division}}al playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would not have home field advantage, with the wild-card teams and the teams they would face in the divisional playoff game would never have home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Starting in 1970, the divisional playoff games consisted of the AFC Central champions and the NFC West champions playing their games on the road. Then in 1971 it rotated to the AFC East champions and <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> champions playing their games on the road. In the 1972 divisional playoff games, the AFC West champions and the NFC Central champions were the visiting teams. And 1973 it would start all over with the AFC Central and NFC West again, and so on.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished {{on the outside looking in}} despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 24–14 in week 14 {{to move into}} sole possession of first place in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East.</b> The Redskins held Joe Morris, who had rushed for 181yards in the Giants week eight victory, to 62yards on 22 carries. However, Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and harassed Redskins' quarterback Jay Schroeder all game, as the Giants recorded four sacks and the Redskins only recorded one. Phil Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro, Bobby Johnson, and Phil McConkey in the victory. Schroeder threw six interceptions in the game, matching Sammy Baugh's franchise record, and the Redskins had 7 turnovers overall. After the game, Parcells gave the Redskins credit for their performance and told the reporters {{that he had a}} feeling that the two would meet again sometime in the playoffs.|$|E
5000|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in 1997, Gailey led the team to a 10 - 6 record in 1998 as Dallas became <b>the</b> first <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> team to sweep the division. The Cowboys {{suffered}} a humiliating first-round playoff exit, however, when the Arizona Cardinals defeated them at Texas Stadium 20-7 for their first postseason victory in half a century. Jones raised hopes in the off-season, though, signing fleet-footed wide receiver Raghib [...] "Rocket" [...] Ismail.|$|R
500|$|The Philadelphia Eagles, a {{professional}} American football team based in Philadelphia, joined the National Football League (NFL) in 1933 {{as a replacement}} team for the Frankford Yellow Jackets, after the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and ceased operations. After the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, the Eagles were moved to <b>the</b> current <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> division. Every April, each NFL franchise adds new players to its roster through a collegiate draft at the [...] "NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting", more {{commonly known as the}} NFL Draft.|$|R
50|$|Garrard was {{outstanding}} {{on the day}} completing 19 of 32 {{passes for}} over 240 yards and the Jaguars rushed for better than 150 yards. For the Giants, Jeremy Shockey led the team with seven catches and Tiki Barber was held to only 20 yards rushing in the defeat. New York's second straight defeat moves them into a first place tie in <b>the</b> tough <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> with <b>the</b> resurgent Dallas Cowboys and their quarterback Tony Romo. The loss was the Giants' second consecutive.|$|R
5|$|The Giants hired former Arizona Cardinals {{offensive}} coordinator Jim Fassel as their head coach before the 1997 season. With the team's offense floundering {{once again and}} a 2–3 record after five games, Fassel turned to inexperienced Danny Kanell as the starting quarterback over Dave Brown. The Giants experienced a resurgent season, finishing 10–5–1 and winning <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East.</b> They hosted a first–round playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings. The Giants led the Vikings {{for most of the}} game, including 22–13 in the 4th quarter, but following a muffed onside kick, the Vikings booted a last-second field goal to win 23–22. Following the season, George Young left the Giants. He was replaced by Ernie Accorsi, a veteran general manager who had successful stints building the Baltimore Colts and Cleveland Browns.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011 preseason, the Giants lost {{tight end}} Kevin Boss, wide {{receiver}} Steve Smith, guard Rich Seubert, linebacker Keith Bulluck, wide receiver Derek Hagan, and Pro Bowl center Shaun O'Hara to free agency. However, the 2011 season {{also saw the}} emerging of second-year wide receiver Victor Cruz and second-year tight end Jake Ballard. The Giants opened the season against the Washington Redskins on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, with both New York City and Washington being a target of the attacks. The Redskins beat the Giants 28–14, but the Giants won their next three games, against the Rams, Eagles, and Cardinals. After a loss against the Seattle Seahawks, they went on another three-game winning streak. A key victory was an upset of the New England Patriots 24–20 at Gillette Stadium. The victory ended the Patriots' NFL record home-game winning streak, after a touchdown pass from Manning to Ballard with 15 seconds left. However, the Giants lost their next three games, before regaining their position atop <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> with a tightly contested 37–34 win over the Dallas Cowboys on December 11. After splitting their next two games against the Redskins and New York Jets, a victory over the Cowboys in the last game {{of the regular season}} clinched a postseason appearance for the Giants.|$|E
25|$|Including the 2014 season, the Cowboys {{have won}} <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> 22 times in their 54-year history.|$|E
50|$|The Philadelphia Eagles are <b>the</b> only <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> team {{to play in}} {{the city}} of the team's naming, Philadelphia. The other three teams play in suburbs of the major cities they are named after. The Dallas Cowboys play in Arlington, Texas. The Washington Redskins play in Landover, Maryland and the New York Giants play in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where they share a stadium with the New York Jets. The only two other teams not from either East {{division}} to do so is <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> West's San Francisco 49ers, who started playing in the San Francisco suburb of Santa Clara in 2014, and the Arizona Cardinals, who play in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale.|$|R
5000|$|On December 29, 2013, in Week 17 of the 2013 season, the Eagles and Cowboys faced off in Dallas for <b>the</b> {{de facto}} <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> Championship. <b>The</b> winner would thus claim the third seed in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Playoffs and <b>the</b> loser would be {{eliminated}} from playoff contention. The Eagles won 24-22 on an interception by Brandon Boykin with the Kyle Orton pass intended for Miles Austin. This sealed the victory with 1:43 remaining in the game. Tony Romo missed the game after being injured in a victory over the Redskins the previous week.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, Pardee {{was hired}} by the Chicago Bears as head coach. He spent the next three years there, leading Chicago to their first playoff berth in 14 years in 1977, before moving on to the Washington Redskins. In 1979, he led the Redskins to within one game of making the playoffs, but in the season's final week, they blew a 13-point lead to <b>the</b> {{eventual}} <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> champions Dallas Cowboys and missed the playoffs. He was fired after going 6-10 in 1980. In 1981, he was hired as assistant head coach in charge of defense for the San Diego Chargers.|$|R
25|$|With the Cowboys {{falling to}} 8–5, the New York Giants {{clinched}} <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> (despite {{losing to the}} Eagles).|$|E
25|$|With the win, the Cowboys took a one-game lead in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> {{with two}} games to go.|$|E
25|$|With {{the merger}} of the NFL and AFL in 1970, the Eagles were placed in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> Division with their archrivals the New York Giants, the Washington Redskins, and the Dallas Cowboys. Their heated rivalry with the Giants is the oldest of <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> rivalries, dating {{all the way back}} to 1933 and has been {{considered}} by writers in Philadelphia as one of the best rivalries in the NFL in the 21st century.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the second}} {{game of the year}} between <b>the</b> two <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> rivals. <b>The</b> Redskins were two years removed from winning Super Bowl XXII, but were an aging team, behind a new quarterback, Jeff Rutledge. The Eagles were in their fifth season under {{defensive}} mastermind Buddy Ryan, but coming off two straight early playoff exits. In the previous game, on October 21, the 3-2 Redskins beat the 2-3 Eagles 13-7, behind a rushing touchdown by Gerald Riggs and two Chip Lohmiller field goals. The rematch would come three weeks later, on Monday Night Football, with the second-place Redskins being 5-3 and the third-place Eagles being 4-4.|$|R
50|$|The Browns {{began their}} 2008 {{campaign}} {{at home against}} <b>the</b> defending <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> champion Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, Cleveland trailed early as Cowboys RB Marion Barber got a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Browns responded with QB Derek Anderson completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Kellen Winslow. Dallas would respond with QB Tony Romo completing a 35-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens, along with another 1-yard TD run from Barber. In the third quarter, Cleveland's defensive struggles continued as RB Felix Jones got an 11-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Browns tried to rally, yet all they {{could come up with}} was a 34-yard field goal from kicker Phil Dawson.|$|R
50|$|Entering {{the postseason}} as <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> top seed, <b>the</b> Giants began their postseason run {{at home in}} <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Divisional round against their <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> rival, <b>the</b> #6 Philadelphia Eagles, in Round 3 of 2008's series.|$|R
25|$|With the win, Dallas {{improved}} to 8-3 on the season, {{setting up a}} showdown with the 8-3 Eagles for first place in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> on Thanksgiving Day.|$|E
25|$|Dallas {{finished}} {{the regular season}} winning <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> with a 10–4 record, winning their final five regular season games to overcome the St. Louis Cardinals (who lost their final three games and fell to third place in the final standings) and New York Giants (who lost their finale 31–3 to the Los Angeles Rams; a Giants victory would have given New York <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> title based upon a better division record and forced a coin toss between the Cowboys and Detroit Lions for the wild card playoff spot).|$|E
25|$|The Dallas Cowboys became <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> {{division}} champions {{with their}} season finale shutout of the Philadelphia Eagles, the second division title in Romo's three full seasons {{as the starting}} quarterback.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, the Cardinals {{were placed}} in <b>the</b> new <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> {{division}} following <b>the</b> merger with the AFL. They posted three consecutive shutouts in November, blanking the Houston Oilers, Boston Patriots, and the Cowboys, the last of those victories coming 38-0 on Monday Night Football in the Cotton Bowl. But St. Louis collapsed down the stretch, losing December games to the New York Giants, Detroit Lions and Washington Redskins to finish 8-5-1 {{and out of the}} playoffs. The Cardinals then regressed to three consecutive 4-9-1 seasons from 1971-73. Bill Bidwill became sole owner in 1972 and still owns the team. Only the New York Giants and Chicago Bears have been in the hands of one family longer than the Cardinals.|$|R
5000|$|Joe Bugel, the {{architect}} of the Redskins' famous [...] "Hogs" [...] offensive line in the 1980s, coached the Cardinals from 1990 to 1993, usually finishing last in <b>the</b> dominant <b>NFC</b> <b>East,</b> which produced <b>the</b> Super Bowl winner in each of those seasons (Giants in '90, Redskins '91, Cowboys '92-93). Bugel's first three teams finished 5-11 in 1990 and 4-12 in both 1991 and 1992 before improving to 7-9 in 1993. During the 1993 season, the Cardinals outscored their opponents by 57 points, but suffered eight losses by seven points or less, five of those setbacks coming to playoff teams. A three-game winning streak to close the season, including a 17-6 triumph over the playoff bound Giants, was not enough to save Bugel's job.|$|R
50|$|The Redskins {{finished}} the 1987 strike-shortened regular season as <b>NFC</b> <b>East</b> champions with an 11-4 {{record and the}} third seed in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> playoffs.|$|R
