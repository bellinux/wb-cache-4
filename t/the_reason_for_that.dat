He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985. In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> result by biographers. After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the BJP; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.|$|E

25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone but <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> {{is a little}} harder to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of time in filming, no tracks were filmed that were unreleased, but several {{alternative}} shots and outtakes were held in the Archives du Film du Bois D'Arcy near Paris. At some point, an employee of the owners, MHF Productions, decided this footage was of no value and incinerated all 548 cans of the original 35mm negatives. Maben was particularly frustrated about the lack of additional shots for [...] "One of These Days," [...] which is primarily a Mason solo-piece in the released version.

She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, [...] "I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did." [...] The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, [...] "Margot's much nicer... She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count." ...|$|E
500|$|The U.S. government's National Center for Health Statistics {{reported}} 33,736 {{motor vehicle}} traffic deaths in 2014. This exceeded {{the number of}} firearm deaths, which was 33,599 in 2014. According to another U.S. government office, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, motor vehicle crashes on U.S. roadways claimed 32,744 lives in 2014 and 35,092 in 2015. (The National Center for Health Statistics may have different criteria for inclusion or a slightly different methodology from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report comparing 2015 to 2014 noted that fatalities increased from 2014 to 2015 in almost all segments of the population: passenger vehicle occupants, passengers of large trucks, pedestrians, pedalcyclists (commonly referred to as cyclists), motorcyclists, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities, male/female, daytime/nighttime. Fatalities of drivers of large trucks remained unchanged. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration performed a regression analysis between monthly roadway fatalities and various possible explanatory variables over the five-year period 2011–2015. The strongest correlation was with vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which had a correlation of [...]80, followed by average monthly temperature, which had a correlation of [...]74, meaning that higher temperatures were associated with increased fatalities. Part of <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> pattern may be that more people are out walking and biking in the warmer months, and pedestrians and cyclists are often victims of collisions with motor vehicles. The report also suggests {{that there may be}} more vacation travel during warmer months. (It is not stated whether the analysis used annual vehicle miles traveled or monthly vehicle miles traveled.) Although not mentioned, motorcycle use, and therefore motorcyclist fatalities, may also increase in warmer months.|$|E
2500|$|The Simpsons writer Al Jean {{commented that}} Grampa {{is often the}} focus of pointed jokes about old people. He said <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> is because the staff is trying to {{illustrate}} how society mistreats the elderly, [...] "and {{some of it is}} because people over 55 never watch our show". Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former writers on the show, said that they liked to write episodes about Grampa because they are [...] "obsessed" [...] with old people. Weinstein commented that they [...] "both love [...] and seem to really hate them at the same time". He also said that he [...] "enjoys" [...] writing for characters such as Grampa and Mr. Burns because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because he gets to use dictionaries for looking up [...] "old time slang".|$|E

2500|$|The only {{prototype}} T7 Combat Car (No. W40223) {{was shipped}} to Aberdeen Proving Grounds in August 1938 for testing. [...] While it showed good speed and performance, cavalry branch representatives {{were not significantly}} impressed. [...] Tests were delayed until 1939, but they were reasonably successful. The vehicle even participated in the First Army maneuvers at Plattsburg, New York in 1939, where the cavalrymen liked it. [...] However, in October 1939, the cavalry branch formed new requirements for their combat vehicles which specified regular tracked (not combined) suspension. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> decision was that the tracks were already available in reasonable quantity and quality and thus {{there was no need}} for the complexity and higher cost associated with convertible vehicles. Furthermore, the heavy machine gun was determined insufficient for the role. [...] The ongoing war in Europe at the time proved that, in order for a vehicle to be successful, it needed a proper cannon. In October 1939, despite its potential, the Mechanized Cavalry Board recommended further development and test of the T7 Combat Car program, and all other such convertible vehicles, be canceled. [...] Thus ended the last wheel-tracked combat vehicle development for the U.S. Army.|$|E
2500|$|After {{yet another}} dismal {{performance}} in , the Mariners managed their first winning season in , finishing 83–79 under manager Jim Lefebvre. Though {{it was the}} team's best season up to that point, it was only good enough for a fifth-place finish in the seven-team American League West in which no team finished under [...]500, and Lefebvre was fired after 1991. The team hired Bill Plummer as Lefebvre's replacement for the [...] season, but he too was let go after a 98-loss campaign in 1992. Much of <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> was trading away pitchers Bill Swift, Mike Jackson and Dave Burba to the San Francisco Giants for outfielder Kevin Mitchell and pitcher Mike Remlinger. Bill Swift {{would go on to}} win the ERA title in 1992 and finish 2nd in Cy Young voting in 1993, Mike Jackson would have a solid career as a relief pitcher and Burba would pitch well as both a reliever and starter. While Kevin Mitchell had a solid year in 1992, he would be traded the next season to Cincinnati for Norm Charlton and Mike Remlinger didn't even play in a Mariner uniform. After several years of relocation threats by owner Jeff Smulyan, {{in the middle of the}} 1992 season, the Mariners were purchased by a group of Seattle-area businessmen, led by Nintendo chairman Hiroshi Yamauchi. The purchase was initially opposed by baseball officials, who objected to a team being owned by a non-North American entity. Eventually, they allowed the sale, provided that the team's presidency and chairmanship remained in the hands of American partners.|$|E
