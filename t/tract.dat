5|$|A urinary <b>tract</b> {{infection}} (UTI) is {{an infection}} that affects {{part of the}} urinary <b>tract.</b> When it affects the lower urinary <b>tract</b> it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary <b>tract</b> it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary <b>tract</b> include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the genome}} of Caenorhabditis elegans, {{homopolymeric}} poly-G/poly-C <b>tracts</b> (G/C <b>tracts)</b> exist at high frequency and are {{maintained by the}} activity of the DOG- 1 protein. The frequency and distribution of G/C <b>tracts</b> in the genomes of C. elegans and the related nematode, C. briggsae were analyzed to investigate possible biological roles for G/C <b>tracts.</b> Results In C. elegans, G/C <b>tracts</b> are distributed along every chromosome in a non-random pattern. Most G/C <b>tracts</b> are within introns or are close to genes. Analysis of SAGE data showed that G/C <b>tracts</b> correlate with the levels of regional gene expression in C. elegans. G/C <b>tracts</b> are over-represented and dispersed across all chromosomes in another Caenorhabditis species, C. briggsae. However, the positions and distribution of G/C <b>tracts</b> in C. briggsae differ from those in C. elegans. Furthermore, the C. briggsae dog- 1 ortholog CBG 19723 can rescue the mutator phenotype of C. elegans dog- 1 mutants. Conclusion The abundance and genomic distribution of G/C <b>tracts</b> in C. elegans, the effect of G/C <b>tracts</b> on regional transcription levels, and the lack of positional conservation of G/C <b>tracts</b> in C. briggsae suggest a role for G/C <b>tracts</b> in chromatin structure but not in the transcriptional regulation of specific genes. </p...|$|R

5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a urinary <b>tract</b> infection each year. They {{are more common}} in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a urinary <b>tract</b> infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary <b>tract</b> infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E

5|$|Chronic {{prostatitis}} in {{the forms}} of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and chronic bacterial prostatitis (not acute bacterial prostatitis or asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis) may cause recurrent urinary <b>tract</b> infections in males.

50|$|The {{medullary}} pyramids contain motor fibers {{that are}} known as the corticobulbar and corticospinal <b>tracts.</b> The corticospinal <b>tracts</b> are on the anterior surface of the pyramids. These <b>tracts</b> transport motor signals that originated in the precentral gyrus and travelled through the internal capsule to the medulla oblongata and pyramids. Extrapyramidal <b>tracts</b> are those motor <b>tracts</b> that do not traverse the medullary pyramids.|$|R

5|$|Fezf2 is a {{gene that}} is {{regulated}} by TBR1. Fezf2 expression is observed in layer V of the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex is constructed in six layers. Fezf2 expression is restricted to layer V for proper development and migration of neurons of the corticospinal <b>tract,</b> which is derived from layer V neurons and is involved in voluntary muscular control. Recent studies show that TBR1, expressed in layer VI, binds directly to the Fezf2 gene, preventing Fezf2 expression in layer VI. In this manner, TBR1 acts as a transcription repressor of Fezf2. Mutation of TBR1 results in Fezf2 expression in layer VI and malformation of the corticospinal <b>tract.</b> Abnormal activation of TBR1 in layer V eliminates corticospinal <b>tract</b> formation.|$|E

5|$|Several {{barriers}} protect organisms from infection, including mechanical, chemical, {{and biological}} barriers. The waxy cuticle of most leaves, the exoskeleton of insects, the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs, and skin {{are examples of}} mechanical barriers that are {{the first line of}} defense against infection. However, as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments, other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs, intestines, and the genitourinary <b>tract.</b> In the lungs, coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory <b>tract.</b> The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens, while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal <b>tract</b> serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.|$|E

40|$|Census <b>tracts</b> are small, {{relatively}} permanent geographic entities within counties (or {{the statistical}} equivalents of counties) delineated {{by a committee}} of local data users. Generally, census <b>tracts</b> have between 2, 500 and 8, 000 residents and boundaries that follow visible features. When first established, census <b>tracts</b> are to be as homogeneous as possible with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Block numbering areas (BNAs) are geographic entities similar to census <b>tracts,</b> and delineated in counties (or the statistical equivalents of counties) without census <b>tracts.</b> For the 1990 census, the difference between census <b>tracts</b> and BNAs generally {{was the type of}} organization doing the delineation. Local census statistical areas committees (CSACs), often working at the county level, delineated or reviewed census <b>tracts.</b> State agencies and American Indian tribal authorities, sometimes with extensive assistance from the Bureau of the Census, delineated BNAs.

5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary <b>tract</b> infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%.

Healthcare-associated urinary <b>tract</b> infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary <b>tract</b> infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary <b>tract</b> infection.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is much shorter and closer to the anus. As a woman's {{estrogen}} levels decrease with menopause, her risk of urinary <b>tract</b> infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora. Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent urinary <b>tract</b> infections.|$|E

To build the atlas, we start with a set of labeled ROIs specified by an expert and extract the fiber <b>tracts</b> initiating from each ROI. Affine registration is used to project the extracted fiber <b>tracts</b> of each subject to the atlas, whereas their B-spline representation is used to efficiently compare them to the fiber <b>tracts</b> in the atlas and assign cluster labels. Expert visual inspection of the result confirms that the proposed method is very promising and efficient in clustering of the known bundles of fiber <b>tracts...</b>|$|R

In those with frequent urinary <b>tract</b> infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary <b>tract</b> infections in this group.|$|E
