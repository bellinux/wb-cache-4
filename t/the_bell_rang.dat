5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked {{his hands behind his}} neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At the end of the match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him {{in the back of the}} head with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.|$|E
5|$|The third match saw Big Show face Snitsky. The match {{began with}} Big Show and Snitsky brawling as <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang.</b> Big Show {{was able to}} perform a big slap to the chest and headbutt. Snitsky then took the upper hand over Big Show, as he applied an armbar hold, after {{countering}} a chokeslam. Big Show delivered a Spinebuster and got the victory after a successful chokeslam.|$|E
5|$|The next match {{featured}} Chris Benoit {{defending the}} United States Championship against Chavo Guerrero (accompanied by Vickie Guerrero). Before <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang</b> {{to start the}} match, Chavo tried to attack Benoit, but as the match began, Benoit retaliated by delivering a clothesline. Benoit and Guerrero wrestled inconclusively until Benoit covered Chavo to try to pin him. Chavo managed to place his foot {{on top of the}} bottom rope, which forced Benoit to break the pin per official wrestling match rules. While Guerrero was lying on his stomach, Benoit applied the Sharpshooter, and made Chavo submit to retain the championship.|$|E

5|$|The second {{match was}} a Cruiserweight Open {{match for the}} WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Chavo Guerrero defended the title against Funaki, Jimmy Wang Yang, Shannon Moore and Jamie Noble. Hornswoggle, who wasn't booked {{to be in the}} match, became a part of the match when he entered the ring as <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang.</b> All the cruiserweights were out of the ring except Noble. Hornswoggle, who was under the ring for the match, entered and {{surprisingly}} and performed a Tadpole Splash on Noble. Hornswoggle went on to pin Noble to get the victory and win the Cruiserweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. <b>The</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang</b> out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|The event {{began with}} a match between The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau). As soon as <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang</b> to signify that the match had begun, Smith {{attacked}} Jacques. The two teams traded blows until The Rougeaus flipped Dynamite Kid over their heads so that he fell on {{his back to the}} mat. Dynamite Kid escaped another offensive maneuver before tagging in his partner, Smith, and The British Bulldogs performed a double-team maneuver on Jacques. Despite having the upper hand, The Bulldogs failed to pin Jacques in time, and the match ended in a twenty-minute time draw.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} another {{standard}} match involving Shelton Benjamin and Kerwin White. White {{tried to get}} in the ring, but Benjamin slid out and tripped him. Benjamin threw White into the ring barricade, which led him to throw him back in the ring as <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang</b> to officially start the match. In the ring, Benjamin body slammed White, which was followed by a running forearm. White retaliated with a dropkick to Benjamin's knee. The match concluded after White grabbed a golf club that he hid in the steel steps and tried to assault Benjamin with it. Benjamin, however, countered with a T-Bone Suplex and covered White and got the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to climb up {{the outside of the}} cage, but Hardy hit the cage, making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started to crawl out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and threw him into a corner. Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering a Twist of Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking Edge off the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop {{off the top of the}} cage before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2008, Edge faced Batista in a {{match for}} his title at Night of Champions. Due to {{interference}} from La Familia and a belt shot from Edge, {{he was able to}} defeat Batista. The next night on Raw, which happened a week after that year's draft lottery, Edge came out to gloat about his victory as well as the fact that, thanks to the draft, both the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship were both SmackDown property (Triple H, who was the reigning WWE Champion at the time, was drafted to SmackDown and had retained his title at Night of Champions as well). As Edge was leaving the ring, an angry Batista (who had been drafted back to Raw after three years as a SmackDown wrestler) came out and chased Edge back to the ring. He proceeded to assault Edge, finishing with a Batista Bomb in the ring. Just as Batista was leaving, CM Punk ran to the ring carrying the Money in the Bank briefcase he had won at WrestleMania XXIV, with referee Mike Chioda tagging along with him. Since Edge was still out of it from the attack, he did not see Punk come into the ring and therefore was unaware that Punk was cashing in his contract. Once <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> Punk simply hit Edge with a Go To Sleep and pinned him to win the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E
25|$|After an uneventful year in 1990, Andy Hug {{returned}} to the spotlight in '91 {{when he reached the}} final of the 6th European Championships in Budapest only to lose to Michael Thompson once more. The 5th World Championships also took place that year at the Budokan in Tokyo, Japan. In his third fight, Andy came up against Francisco Filho. At the end of the round, as <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> Filho landed a mawashi geri on the side of Hug's head which left him unconscious on the floor. Despite protest from the Swiss camp, it was later confirmed that Filho's kick had indeed struck after <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> but he had started his move before the time was up and Filho was declared the winner.|$|E
25|$|On March 29, 2003, Rahman faced David Tua for {{a second}} time. The fight was ruled a draw after one judge scored it for Rahman, a second for Tua and a third had the score even.

In June, Rahman was elevated to the No. 1 contender's position by the WBC.|$|E

25|$|The {{winner of}} the Qualifying Round played the day's {{returning}} champion in the renamed Championship Round, which kept the same line/position form of scoring. However, {{instead of being a}} race against time, the Championship Round was a race to achieve a score of one hundred points. The normal scoring format was used until someone reached fifty points. Once that happened, <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang</b> to indicate it and each word played after that was worth double the points. Whoever reached 100 points won the game and the championship and got to play the Solo Game for the jackpot.|$|E
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang,</b> Seabiscuit {{broke in}} front, led by over a length after 20 seconds, and soon crossed {{over to the}} rail position. Halfway down the backstretch, War Admiral started to cut into the lead, {{gradually}} pulling level with Seabiscuit, then slightly ahead. Following advice he had received from Pollard, Woolf had eased up on Seabiscuit, allowing his horse to see his rival, then asked for more effort. Two {{hundred yards from the}} wire, Seabiscuit pulled away again and continued to extend his lead over the closing stretch, finally winning by four lengths despite War Admiral's running his best time for the distance.|$|E
25|$|Words {{were not}} scored by length. Instead, the {{position}} of the word's first letter was added to the number of the line it was on to determine a team's score. For instance, a word that started in the first position of the first line (line one, position one) would be worth two points, whereas a word on the same line but with the first letter in the eighth position (line one, position eight) would be worth nine points. Halfway through the round, a bell would ring and the teammates would switch seats. This occurred after six questions had been asked; after another six were asked, <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang</b> again and the team that was in the lead when it rang the second time won the Elimination Round.|$|E

25|$|The storyline {{dispute between}} Último Guerrero and Rey Escorpión {{that led to}} that week's main event was very evident even before the match {{actually}} started. Guerrero entered the ring first, then attacked Rey Escorpión {{while he was still}} on the floor, before <b>the</b> <b>bell</b> <b>rang.</b> Guerrero dove out of the ring and knocked Escorpión down, not once but three times in a row, inflicting enough damage that Rey Escorpión was not able to get inside the ring before the referee counted to 20, giving Último Guerrero the first fall by count out. Once Escorpión recovered he was able to fight back in the second round, he fought back against Guerrero, even {{going so far as to}} tearing at Guerrero's mask using his teeth. Escorpión gained a measure of revenge on Guerrero when he applied Último Guerrero's own Pulpo Guerrero ("The Guerrero Octopus") to Guerrero and forced him to submit, tying the match at one fall each. During the third fall Rey Escorpión team mate Dragón Rojo, Jr. came to ringside to distract the referee.|$|E
