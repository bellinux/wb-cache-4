30|$|All hooks {{fractured}} in {{the region}} just beneath or at the commencement of curvature. This {{is in line with}} shear theory since the material at this point has the smallest cross-sectional area. The innermost fibres experience the highest strain as the hook tries <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>under</b> loading. The outermost fibres will be in extension as the hook distorts and “straightens” under loading. Once the inner fibres have failed, the full load is then transferred to the outer fibres which immediately fail in tension under the significantly higher stress.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experimental program has been to study CFRP strengthening of existing concrete bridges that contain soffit curvature. In the presence of such curvature, the FRP laminates attempt <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>under</b> tension, leading <b>to</b> direct transverse tensile stress in the adhesive, which may cause premature peeling. This tensile stress could also lead to the cover being ripped off prematurely. In this research program, six beams, each 6 m in length and each having different extents of curvature, were tested under a three-point static load test setup at the University of Missouri – Rolla (UMR). One of the beams containing soffit curvature was anchored using GFRP anchor spikes to prevent the expected premature peeling...|$|R
40|$|Apparatus for {{sensing the}} {{magnitude}} of a load on a cable as the cable is employed to support the load includes a beam structure clamped to the cable so that a length of the cable lies along the beam structure. A spacer associated with the beam structure forces a slight curvature in {{a portion of the}} length of cable under a cable no-load condition so that the portion of the length of cable is spaced from the beam structure to define a cable curved portion. A strain gauge circuit including strain gauges is secured to the beam structure by welding. As the cable is employed to support a load the load causes the cable curved portion to exert a force normal to the cable through the spacer and on the beam structure to deform the beam structure as the cable curved portion attempts <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>under</b> the load. As this deformation takes place, the resistance of the strain gauges is set to a value proportional to {{the magnitude of}} the normal strain on the beam structure during such deformation. The magnitude of the normal strain is manipulated in a control device to generate a value equal to the magnitude or weight of the load supported by the cable...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research program was to study carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) members which have concavely-curved soffits. In the presence of such curvature, the FRP laminates attempt <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>under</b> tension, leading <b>to</b> direct transverse tensile stress at the adhesive-concrete interface, which may cause premature peeling. This tensile stress could also lead to concrete cover delamination. Ten beams, each 6 m in length and having the same soffit curvature (i. e., 4 × 10 − 5 mm− 1 or in− 1), extending over 1, 3 and 5 meters, were tested under three-point static flexure. Two different types of CFRP strengthening techniques, namely wet layup laminates and pultruded precured laminates, were used for external strengthening. One of the beams strengthened with CFRP wet layup laminates (with a curved soffit over an extent of 5 m), used glass FRP spike anchors to prevent peeling. Beams with soffit curvature limited to an extent of 1 m, failed at similar loads when compared with control specimens containing flat soffits. For beams having a soffit curvature extending over 3 and 5 m, reduction in strength was observed because of premature peeling. Inclusion of the GFRP spike anchors with the wet layup system led to a performance superior to the control specimen (flat soffit) confirming that application of GFRP spike anchors delays premature peeling...|$|R

Previous studies have suggested that the natural curvature of the spine <b>straightens</b> <b>under</b> load, but are based on modelling and external measurements {{from the surface of the}} back. In the current study, an upright positional MRI scanner was used to acquire sagittal images of the lumbar and lower thoracic spine of 24 subjects. The subjects were imaged in standing whilst supporting 0, 8 and 16 kg of load which was applied axially across the shoulders using an apron. An active shape model of the vertebral bodies from T 10 to S 1 was created and used to characterise the effect of load. The results from the shape model showed that the behaviour of the average-shaped spine was <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> slightly. However, the shape model also showed that the effect of load exhibited systematic variation between individuals. Those who had a smaller than average curvature before loading <b>straightened</b> <b>under</b> load, whereas those who had a greater than average curvature before loading showed an increase in curvature under load. The variation in behaviour of differently shaped spines may have further implications for the effects of load in lifting manoeuvres and in understanding the aetiology of back pain...|$|R
