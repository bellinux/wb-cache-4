5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his landmark 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subg.

Oncostylis was further divided into four series, with B.brownii placed in series Spicigerae because its inflorescences are cylindrical.|$|E

The church's design also includes a wide atrium and a rectangular entrance area, or narthex, marked by two circular turrets.|$|E
5|$|Paraphrasing John Wheeler, Einstein's {{geometric}} {{theory of}} gravity {{can be summarized}} thus: spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve. What this means is addressed in the following <b>three</b> <b>sections,</b> which explore the motion of so-called test particles, examine which properties of matter serve {{as a source for}} gravity, and, finally, introduce Einstein's equations, which relate these matter properties to the curvature of spacetime.|$|E

5|$|The {{pictures}} {{are not in}} strictly chronological order. If they are perceived as three groups, then the pictures {{in each of the}} three units inform upon each other, in the same way as was usual in Medieval paintings and stained glass. The <b>three</b> <b>sections</b> of Creation, Downfall, and Fate of Humanity appear in reverse order, when read from the entrance of the chapel. However, each individual scene is painted to be viewed when looking toward the altar. This is not easily apparent when viewing a reproduced image of the ceiling but becomes clear when the viewer looks upward at the vault. Paoletti and Radke suggest that this reversed progression symbolises a return to a state of grace. However, the <b>three</b> <b>sections</b> are generally described in the order of Biblical chronology.|$|E

5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia {{in his classic}} 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subgenus Banksia, and was divided into <b>three</b> <b>sections.</b> George placed Banksia coccinea in its own series—Banksia series Coccineae—within the section B.section Banksia on account of a unique combination of characters, namely the vertical arrangement of flowers on the spike, combined with the branched open habit, broad leaves and very small follicles. Members of the series Quercinae and five species within the series Spicigerae share the vertically aligned flowers, but do not wholly exhibit the other characters.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than a conventional infantry company, it was organised into three platoons, each of <b>three</b> <b>sections,</b> each of which contained two subsections. It had considerable firepower. Each subsection had a Bren light machine gun. The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with rifle grenades. The remaining four or five men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E
