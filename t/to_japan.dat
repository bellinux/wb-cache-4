5|$|Following the Surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, Japanese {{military}} personnel and civilians were repatriated <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> between 1945 and 1946, although some 350 labourers and technicians were permitted to remain behind to carry out repair works to Palau's infrastructure. However, offspring of Japanese-Palauan intermarriages were allowed to remain, although a few migrated <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> with their fathers. In the 1950s, Japanese-Palauans formed an organisation, Sakura-kai to assist Japanese-Palauans and Japanese youths who were abandoned by their parents to search for their parents and kinsmen who were forcibly separated {{as a result of}} forced repatriation of Japanese settlers back <b>to</b> <b>Japan.</b> The organisation became a cultural organisation from the 1980s onwards, as most Japanese-Palauans had reunited with their Japanese families or voluntarily chose to leave certain family separations as they were.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in 1945, Japanese settlers were repatriated back <b>to</b> <b>Japan,</b> {{and male}} Japanese settlers who had raised Japanese-Palauan families abandoned {{their families in}} favour of repatriation, reasoning that the offspring {{would be able to}} better adapt in Palau than in Japan. Many of these Palauan women raised their mixed-race children singlehandedly, while others were abandoned and adopted by Palauan families. Some Japanese-Palauan families migrated <b>to</b> <b>Japan,</b> but generally faced a cultural shock and petitioned to return to Palau after living in Japan for some years. Most petitions were allowed, although they were not allowed to bring their Japanese spouses along.|$|E

5|$|Based in Yokohama, Farsari {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with E. A. Sargent. Their firm, Sargent, Farsari & Co., dealt in smokers' supplies, stationery, visiting cards, newspapers, magazines and novels, Japanese and English conversation books, dictionaries, guidebooks, maps, and photographic views of Japan.

After his partnership with Sargent ended, the company, now A. Farsari & Co., published successive editions of Keeling's Guide <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> and Farsari himself wrote and published Japanese Words and Phrases for the Use of Strangers. The firm was among the most prolific publishers of materials to aid travellers, having produced its first guidebook <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> by July 1880.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} of oil from Southeast Asia <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By {{this stage of the}} war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore <b>to</b> <b>Japan.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the Yellow Sea and was damaged in the {{subsequent}} Battle of Tsushima. In addition she frequently bombarded the defenses of Port Arthur. The ship played a limited role in World War I and was used to escort Allied convoys and search for German commerce raiders in the Indian Ocean and Australasia. In 1918, Nisshin was deployed to the Mediterranean and then escorted the surrendered German submarines allocated <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> from Britain <b>to</b> <b>Japan</b> after the war. She became a training ship in 1927 and was sunk as a target ship in 1936. Her wreck was later refloated and used as a target again in 1942.|$|E
