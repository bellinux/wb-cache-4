5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond {{together}} {{returned to}} Australia. Energised by her success, Rix Nicholas purchased a car, filled its rear compartment with painting equipment, and the pair set out <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> landscape, ranging from Canberra and the Monaro plains to the south, up into central Queensland. This included a publicity-attracting occasion where she painted figures {{on the beach at}} Bondi, reported by various publications including Australian magazine, The Home.|$|E

50|$|Leong's art is best {{characterized}} as abstract expressionism, with the subjects {{and interests of}} his paintings constantly changing over time.

5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>The</b> Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims were celebrating Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|My {{object in}} the present work is <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> rich Jew in his true colors, as the enemy of society; {{to show that the}} Jew who steals millions, can, in Europe, at any rate, defy the laws with impunity, and that he almost {{invariably}} escapes punishment owing to improper occult influences, and the mighty power of Israelitish gold.|$|E
5|$|On {{a single}} day in 1825, 23 ships were left {{stranded}} off the coast. In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, {{almost half a century}} before the arrival of the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Peter and Catharine {{traveled}} extensively {{and continued}} <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> and draw. They dedicated their lives primarily <b>to</b> <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Rockies, and to collecting local art and historical material. They enjoyed entertaining their numerous friends, who regularly stopped over for tea, conversation, and laughter.|$|R
5000|$|In the portrait, Hogarth {{himself is}} in a <b>painting</b> as <b>the</b> pug is {{alongside}} him, making the dog [...] "real" [...] {{as opposed to}} the created person. The dog is indifferent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> books and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> palette (which shows Hogarth's Line of Beauty). So <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> seems <b>to</b> be a Vanitas still life. But, as an ironic disruption, the cloth behind the dog comes out of <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Indicative of an {{interest}} also in genre painting, Athenaeus reports that Androcydes' gourmet passion for seafood {{prompted him to}} devote inordinate attention <b>to</b> <b>painting</b> <b>the</b> fish around a central figure of Scylla {{in one of his}} works.|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{depiction of}} the abbey is by the engravers Samuel and Nathaniel Buck, who specialised in landmarks and great ruins. Their engraving (1733) shows {{the church of the}} abbey much as it is today, {{with the exception of the}} high vault of the south transept still present. The picture has notable errors and was clearly done from memory and rough sketches. The most famous artist <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> ruins was John Constable, whose 1833 painting of the west end of the church shows it among trees.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{appeared}} in four (out of five) Beatles' films. During {{the filming of}} the Beatles' first feature film, A Hard Day's Night, Evans {{appeared in}} a cameo role, carrying an upright bass in between John Lennon and Millie in the backstage scene in which Millie mistakes Lennon for someone else. In Help!, Evans played a confused channel swimmer who pops up through an ice-hole in Austria, and {{on a beach in}} the Bahamas. Evans and Aspinall were asked to find and hire the actors that were needed to perform in the Magical Mystery Tour film, and to hire an old 60-seater coach, on which they were told <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> Magical Mystery Tour logo, which McCartney had designed. Evans later appeared in the film as one of the magicians, who cast mysterious spells on the passengers of the bus.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth chose <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also {{known as}} The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady {{a chance to}} recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with the implication that if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

5|$|For Shaw's Ferrari, it {{was decided}} that {{purchasing}} an actual model of which only 350 exist and would cost at least $1million would be too expensive and the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes. Instead, two replicas were commissioned, a process which took three months under the supervision of prop master Peter Gelfman. The replicas then received additional reinforcement for filming purposes from Steve Kirshoff and the special effects crew. After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors, {{it was decided}} <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> replicas bright red {{in order to create a}} lasting impression instead of using the actual metallic brown muted-coloring of McQueen's vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1917, {{the rotary}} engine F.I {{prototype}} {{was assigned to}} Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown Japanese fighting kites with his cousins in Krefeld; the decorations on the kites gave him the inspiration <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> nose cowling of his triplane with two eyes, eyebrows and a moustache. The arrival of the new fighter brought celebrities visiting. On 31 August, Anthony Fokker escorted German Chancellor Georg Michaelis and Major General Ernst von Lossberg to see and film the new triplane. On 9 September, Crown Prince Wilhelm would also visit Jasta 10.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{worked in}} Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was {{commissioned}} <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In {{the spring of}} 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary on behalf of Ludovico to meet Matthias Corvinus, for whom he {{is believed to have}} painted a Holy Family. Between 1493 and 1495, Leonardo listed a woman called Caterina among his dependents in his taxation documents. When she died in 1495, the list of funeral expenditures suggests that she was his mother.|$|E

5|$|Matejko began <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> Prussian Homage on Christmas Eve 1879 and {{finished}} it in 1882. He donated {{it to the}} Polish nation during {{the meeting of the}} Diet of Galicia (Sejm Krajowy) in Lwów (Lviv) on 7 October 1882 to start a collection designed to revive the remodelling of Wawel Castle. It was subsequently exhibited in Kraków, Lwów and Warsaw, as well as in Berlin, Paris, Budapest, and most notably in Rome and Vienna. When it returned to Kraków in 1885, it was temporarily exhibited in the Sukiennice Museum because the Royal Wawel Castle was occupied at that time by the Austrian army, as Kraków was part of the Austrian partition of Poland.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, despite {{evolving}} {{trends in}} Europe, especially in Paris, embracing Realism and Impressionism, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts refused {{to change their}} approach, insisting their students should continue to paint in the preferred styles of Historicism and Neoclassicism. Among those who were increasingly frustrated by this approach were Michael Ancher, Karl Madsen and Viggo Johansen who in the early 1870s were studying at the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen. Madsen, who had already visited Skagen in 1871 while staying with his uncle in nearby Frederikshavn, invited Ancher to join him there in 1874, <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> local fishermen. He became {{a friend of the}} Brøndum family who had a shop with a bar which was soon extended to become Brøndums Gastgiveri, a guest house. He was invited to their 15-year-old daughter Anna's confirmation and showed an immediate interest in her. The following year, he returned to Skagen with both Madsen and Viggo Johansen who had been strongly influenced by French Impressionism. In particular, Johansen began to paint open-air scenes combining Impressionism with Realism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year 1506, Pope Julius {{conceived}} a program <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The walls of the chapel had been decorated twenty years earlier. The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was (and sometimes still is) hung on special occasions with the set of tapestries designed by Raphael. The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ {{on the right side}} and the Life of Moses on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty-two popes. A draft by Matteo d'Amelia indicates that the ceiling was painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars, possibly representing the zodiacal constellations. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance, it was Pope Julius' intention and expectation that the iconography of the ceiling was to be read with many layers of meaning.|$|E
50|$|In 1778, Pocock's employer, Richard Champion, became financially {{insolvent}} due to {{the effects}} of the American Revolutionary War on transatlantic trade.

5|$|John Gilchriese {{became friends}} with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp’s secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood {{inherited}} many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed {{over a number of}} years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them and their family. Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The oil on masonite painting titled The Street Fight is 6 feet 4 inches by 4 feet (1.93 m by 1.22 m). It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese's collection, including Wyatt Earp's own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} {{argument}} in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E
5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} a country and their participants were shot in their respective countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white paper, and the postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and white paint <b>to</b> <b>paint</b> <b>the</b> Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a camera or phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E
