50|$|Washington {{goes on to}} warn <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> to {{question}} <b>the</b> ulterior motives of any person or group who argue that the land within {{the borders of the}} United States is too large to be ruled as a republic, an argument made by many during the debate on the proposed purchase of the Louisiana Territory, calling on the people to give the experiment of a large republic a chance to work before deciding that it cannot be done. He then offers strong warnings on the dangers of sectionalism, arguing that the true motives of a sectionalist are to create distrust or rivalries between regions and people to gain power and take control of the government. Washington points to two treaties acquired by his administration, the Jay Treaty and Pinckney's Treaty, which established the borders of the United States' western territories between Spanish Mexico and British Canada, and secured the rights of western farmers to ship goods along the Mississippi River to New Orleans. He holds up these treaties as proof that the eastern states along the Atlantic Coast and the federal government are looking out for the welfare of all <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> and <b>can</b> win fair treatment from foreign countries as a united nation.|$|R
60|$|Of dirt of {{all kinds}} it behoves Washington and those {{concerned}} in Washington to make themselves free. It is the Augean stables through which some American Hercules must turn a purifying river before <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> justly boast either of their capital or of their government. As to the material mud, enough has been said. The presence of the army perhaps caused it, and the excessive quantity of rain which had fallen may also {{be taken as a}} fair plea. But what excuse shall we find for that other dirt? It also had been caused by the presence of the army, and by that long-continued down- pouring of contracts which had fallen like Danae's golden shower into the laps of those who understood how to avail themselves of such heavenly waters. The leaders of the rebellion are hated in the North. The names of Jefferson Davis, of Cobb, Toombs, and Floyd are mentioned with execration by the very children. This has sprung from a true and noble feeling; from a patriotic love of national greatness and a hatred of those who, for small party purposes, have been willing to lessen the name of the United States. I have reverenced the feeling even when I have not shared it. But, in addition to this, the names of those also should be execrated who have robbed their country when pretending to serve it; who have taken its wages in the days of its great struggle, {{and at the same time}} have filched from its coffers; who have undertaken the task of steering the ship through the storm in order that their hands might be deep in the meal-tub and the bread-basket, and that they might stuff their own sacks with the ship's provisions. These are the men who must be loathed by the nation--whose fate must be held up as a warning to others before good can come! Northern men and women talk of hanging Davis and his accomplices. I myself trust that there will be no hanging when the war is over. I believe there will be none, for the Americans are not a blood-thirsty people. But if punishment of any kind be meted out, the men of the North should understand that they have worse offenders among them than Davis and Floyd.|$|E

40|$|In {{cases with}} no claims or {{defenses}} concerning sports, the Supreme Court and lower {{federal and state}} courts frequently publish opinions that draw analogies to the rules or terminology of sports familiar to broad segments of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> Sports analogies <b>can</b> help the court explain factual or legal points because today’s generation, including the lawyers and litigants who comprise the prime audience for written opinions, grew into adulthood amid an unprecedented saturation of professional and amateur sports in the broadcast and print media, and more recently on the Internet. This article surveys the broad array of sports whose references now lace written judicial opinions, and then discusses the use and misuse of these references. Sports references can help courts explain and resolve complexity, but may also implicate Rule 1. 3 of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct by detracting unacceptably from the prestige indispensable to the judicial role. A sports reference remains incompatible with judging when a reasonable reader would conclude that the court invoked it primarily for the judge’s personal pleasure and not to facilitate the communication of ideas...|$|R

40|$|In 1900, as {{professional}} forestry was establishing {{its roots in}} the United States, the population of the contiguous 48 states was reported at 75 million. In 2000, as <b>the</b> Society of <b>American</b> Foresters is celebrating its Centennial, the population estimate for that same area stands close to 275 million. The addition of some 200 million people to the Nation, on top of a Century’s efforts to protect some lands from natural resource exploitation, makes it readily apparent that the people-land equation has changed dramatically. What those gross changes do not tell, however, is where and how the situation has changed, and what those changes may mean to working lands over the next few decades. This paper {{takes a look at the}} facts and trends about people and forests in the United States, in an attempt to identify some of the trends that will challenge foresters and forestry program managers in the near future.

On the positive side, regulations have an essential role to play in protecting the environment, assuring a safe workplace, providing protection to consumers and in other ways addressing the needs of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> Yet regulations <b>can</b> also be costly. When designed poorly, regulations can create distortions in the economy by punishing small and large businesses and thwarting innovation and productivity improvements. Unfunded mandates on state and local governments can create serious fiscal problems for Mayors, Governors and other local officials. Common sense can sometimes distinguish a good rule from a bad one but in many complex situations a formal regulatory analysis is necessary to guide regulatory decision making. The Bush Administration is committed to developing a smarter regulatory system based on sound science and economics. A smarter system adopts cost-effective rules when market and state and local efforts fail, revises existing rules to make them less costly and/or more effective, and rescinds outmoded rules whose benefits do not justify their costs. In pursuing this agenda, the Administration is actively seeking suggestions from the scientific community, stakeholders, and the general public. This document fulfills two statutory requirements for reporting to Congress on Federal regulatory activity. The first of these reports is Office of Management and Budget’s fourth report t...|$|R

[...] "Tribune London correspondent totally false." [...] Not {{only is there}} not a word of truth in the pretended conversation, {{but it is so}} absurdly unlike me that I cannot suppose it to be even invented by anyone who ever heard me exchange a word with mortal creature. For twenty years I am perfectly certain that I have never made any other allusion to the republication of my books in America than the good-humoured remark, [...] "that if there had been international copyright between England and the States, I should have been a man of very large fortune, instead of a man of moderate savings, always supporting a very expensive public position." [...] Nor have I ever been such a fool as to charge the absence of international copyright upon individuals. Nor have I ever been so ungenerous as to disguise or suppress the fact that I have received handsome sums for advance sheets. When I was in the States, I said what I had to say on the question, and there an end. I am absolutely certain that I have never since expressed myself, even with soreness, on the subject. Reverting to the preposterous fabrication of the London correspondent, the statement that I ever talked about [...] "these fellows" [...] who republished my books or pretended to know (what I don't know at this instant) who made how much out of them, or ever talked of their sending me [...] "conscience money," [...] is as grossly and completely false as the statement that I ever said anything to the effect that I could not be expected to have an interest in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> And nothing <b>can</b> by any possibility be falser than that. Again and again in these pages ("All the Year Round") I have expressed my interest in them. You will see it in the [...] "Child's History of England." [...] You will see it in the last preface to [...] "American Notes." [...] Every American who has ever spoken with me in London, Paris, or where not, knows whether I have frankly said, [...] "You could have no better introduction to me than your country." [...] And for years and years when I have been asked about reading in America, my invariable reply has been, [...] "I have so many friends there, and constantly receive so many earnest letters from personally unknown readers there, that, but for domestic reasons, I would go to-morrow."
