40|$|ObjectiveThe {{mammalian}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin {{signaling pathway}} has {{been implicated in}} therapeutic resistance in several types of cancer. However, the significance <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin activation in chemoradiotherapy sensitivity {{and its effect on}} the prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy remain unknown. However, this pathway is of particular interest because an effective inhibitor is available. MethodsBy using immunohistochemistry, phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression was examined in 77 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery between 1999 and 2009, and correlated with treatment outcome. With the use of CE 81 T/VGH and TE 2 cell lines, cells were treated with chemotherapy, temsirolimus (mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin inhibitor), or a combination of chemotherapy and temsirolimus, and investigated by 3 -(4. 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. ResultsPathologic complete response rates were 42 % and 16 % in patients with negative and positive phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression, respectively (P = . 01). The 3 -year overall survivals were 57 % and 30 % in patients with negative and positive phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression, respectively (P = . 005). Positive phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression was independently associated with inferior overall and disease-free survival. In patients who did not achieve pathologic complete response, postchemoradiotherapy esophagectomy specimens showed significantly higher phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression than pretreatment biopsy specimens. In cell lines, concomitant administration of temsirolimus enhanced the effect of chemotherapy. ConclusionsPhosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression is independently associated with the response to chemoradiotherapy and prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin inhibition can sensitize esophageal cancer cells to chemotherapy. Our results suggest the potential for mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin as a therapeutic target for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who receive multimodality treatment...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{mammalian}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin is a conserved {{protein kinase}} known to regulate protein synthesis, cell size and proliferation. Aberrant regulation <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin activity {{has been observed}} in hematopoietic malignancies, including acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes, suggesting that correct regulation <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin is critical for normal hematopoiesis. Design and Methods An ex vivo granulocyte differentiation system was utilized to investigate the role <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin in the regulation of myelopoiesis. Results Inhibition <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin activity, with the pharmacological inhibitor rapamycin, dramatically reduced hematopoietic progenitor expansion, without altering levels of apoptosis or maturation. Moreover, analysis of distinct hematopoietic progenitor populations revealed that rapamycin treatment inhibited the expansion potential of committed CD 34 (+) lineage-positive progenitors, but did not affect early hematopoietic progenitors. Further examinations showed that these effects of rapamycin on progenitor expansion might involve differential regulation of protein kinase B and mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin signaling. Conclusions Together, {{these results indicate that}} mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin activity is essential for expansion of CD 34 (+) hematopoietic progenitor cells during myelopoiesis. Modulation <b>of</b> the mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin pathway may be of benefit in the design of new therapies to control hematologic malignancies...|$|R

40|$|Impairment of {{reciprocal}} social interaction is a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder. Genetic disorders frequently accompany autism spectrum disorder, such as {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} caused by haploinsufficiency of the TSC 1 and TSC 2 genes. Accumulating evidence implicates a relationship between autism spectrum disorder and signal transduction that involves tuberous sclerosis complex 1, tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin. Here we show behavioural abnormalities relevant to autism spectrum disorder and their recovery by the mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex. In Tsc 2 þ / mice, we find enhanced transcription of multiple genes involved in mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin signalling, which is dependent on activated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin signalling with a minimal influence of Akt. The findings indicate a crucial role <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin signalling in deficient social behaviour in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex, supporting the notion that mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin inhibitors may be useful for the pharmacological treatment of autism spectrum disorder associated with tuberous sclerosis complex and other conditions that result from dysregulated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin signalling...|$|R
