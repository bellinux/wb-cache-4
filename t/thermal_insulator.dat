5|$|Snowfall can be {{beneficial}} to agriculture by serving as a <b>thermal</b> <b>insulator,</b> conserving {{the heat of the}} Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth, both directly and via runoff through streams and rivers, which supply irrigation canals. The following are examples of rivers that rely on meltwater from glaciers or seasonal snowpack as an important part of their flow on which irrigation depends: the Ganges, many of whose tributaries rise in the Himalayas and which provide much irrigation in northeast India, the Indus River, which rises in Tibet and provides irrigation water to Pakistan from rapidly retreating Tibetan glaciers, and the Colorado River, which receives much of its water from seasonal snowpack in the Rocky Mountains and provides irrigation water to some 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares).|$|E

40|$|International audienceSilica aerogels are {{excellent}} <b>thermal</b> <b>insulators,</b> but their brittle nature has prevented widespread application. To overcome these mechanical limitations, silica–biopolymer hybrids are a promising alternative. A one-pot process to monolithic, superinsulating pectin–silica hybrid aerogels is presented. Their structural and physical properties can be tuned {{by adjusting the}} gelation pH and pectin concentration. Hybrid aerogels made at pH 1. 5 exhibit minimal dust release and vastly improved mechanical properties while remaining excellent <b>thermal</b> <b>insulators.</b> The change in the mechanical properties is directly linked to the observed “neck-free” nanoscale network structure with thicker struts.

25|$|The {{hardness}} (8–8.5), RI (2.15–2.18, isotropic), dispersion (0.058–0.066), and low {{material cost}} make CZ {{the most popular}} simulant of diamond. Its optical and physical constants are however variable, owing to the different stabilizers used by different producers. There are many formulations of stabilized cubic zirconia. These variations change the physical and optical properties markedly. While the visual likeness of CZ is close enough to diamond to fool most who do not handle diamond regularly, CZ will usually give certain clues. For example: it is somewhat brittle and is soft enough to possess scratches after normal use in jewelry; it is usually internally flawless and completely colorless (whereas most diamonds have some internal imperfections and a yellow tint); its SG (5.6–6) is high; and its reaction under ultraviolet light is a distinctive beige. Most jewelers will use a thermal probe to test all suspected CZs, a test which relies on diamond's superlative thermal conductivity (CZ, like almost all other diamond simulants, is a <b>thermal</b> <b>insulator).</b> CZ is made {{in a number of}} different colors meant to imitate fancy diamonds (e.g., yellow to golden brown, orange, red to pink, green, and opaque black), but most of these do not approximate the real thing. Cubic zirconia can be coated with diamond-like carbon to improve its durability, but will still be detected as CZ by a thermal probe.|$|E
