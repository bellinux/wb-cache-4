Evidence showed that titanium had been incorporated into the inorganic wall of zirconium oxide during synthesis, and titanium was found not to affect the surface area at low temperatures but to substantially enhance the thermal stability of the materials. A specific surface area as high as 400 m(2) /g was obtained at a 10 mol% <b>titanium</b> <b>doping</b> level after calcining at 773 K.

40|$|The {{technique}} of single molecule spectroscopy in solids is investigated, {{with the view}} to extending this technique to the detection of single ions of titanium in sapphire. High-resolution experimental apparatus was set-up to study single particles in solids and to allow hole-burning experiments to be carried out. Hole-burning processes were investigated in samples of uranium doped strontium tungstate with concentrations of 500 ppm and 200 ppm. Hole-burning at different laser intensities revealed a homogeneous linewidth of (6. 3 #+-# 0. 1) MHz for the stronger doped sample. The weaker doped sample was determined to have a homogeneous linewidth less than the laser linewidth. The relaxation behaviour of holes, monitored between 10 - 20 K, was also examined. The relaxation process {{was found to be}} similar to an activated process with an attempt frequency of 309 s"-" 1 and it was concluded that the process was some form of tunnelling with strong phonon coupling. Repeatable, stable single molecules of terrylene in hexadecane were measured in the wings of the inhomogeneous zero-phonon line. Unstable molecules were observed, where the molecule would jump in and out of resonance. Weakly doped crystals and films of <b>titanium</b> <b>doped</b> <b>sapphire</b> were found to contain strong chromium emission. The annealing of both crystals and films of <b>titanium</b> <b>doped</b> <b>sapphire</b> was investigated. The best procedure for obtaining films with good crystallinity and Ti" 3 "+ ions was to grow the films at 650 deg C followed by annealing at 1100 deg C in a reducing atmosphere. Hole-burning was only evident in unannealed crystals of Ti" 3 "+:AI_ 2 O_ 3, indicating that Ti" 4 "+ is necessary for hole-burning to occur. Neither single ions or statistical fine structure were detected as the concentration of titanium ions was expected to be too large.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{describe}} the development and characterisation of a hybrid high power laser system based on chirped pulse amplification (CPA) in <b>Titanium</b> <b>doped</b> <b>sapphire</b> and Neodymium doped phosphate glass. The laser was developed through a research contract between Grupo de Lasers e Plasmas, Instituto Superior Tecnico (IST) and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL, UK). The preliminary work and assembly of the system was done at RAL, and the final installation and characterisation was performed at the Laboratory for Intense Lasers, at the IST campus. We have developed an advanced laser system capable of delivering pulses with a peak power on the Terawatt (1 T W= 10 " 1 " 2 W) level. The system starts with a low energy Nd: YLF oscillator producing 2. 6 ps (1 ps = 10 " 1 " 2 s) pulses, which are spectrally broadened in an optical fibre and temporally stretched in a grating pair arrangement. Amplification to the mJ level {{takes place in a}} Ti: sapphire regenerative amplifier, and a double passed Nd: phosphate rod increases the energy to the Joule level. After compression in another grating pair, the pulse width is reduced to the ps level, yielding a total power of the order of 1 T W. The amplification in the last stage and the compression are not completely described yet in this preliminary version, since we are currently optimising their performance.

At low concentrations the lifetime for vanadium and <b>titanium</b> <b>doped</b> GLS was 30 µs and 67 µs respectively. We validate {{the use of}} the stretched exponential model and discuss the possible microscopic phenomenon it arises from.

We also show that the fluorescence lifetime of vanadium and titanium at low concentrations in the oxide rich host; gallium lanthanum oxy-sulphide (GLSO) is 43 µs and 97 µs respectively, which is longer than that in GLS.

40|$|Enabling {{inexpensive}} and ubiquitous steels {{for use as}} solid oxide fuel cell interconnects has two major hurdles to overcome. Firstly, corrosion must be limited such that the interconnect can have longevity. Secondly, the evaporation of chromium from the corrosion layer must also be limited such that the fuel cell can have longevity. The evaporation of chromium from chromia, <b>titanium</b> <b>doped</b> chromia, and chromium cobalt spinels was studied and characterized. Spinels lost {{the least amount of}} mass during evaporation experiments, and changed the least after experimental conditions were imposed on them that. Chromium titanate samples retained a significant amount of chrome that would have evaporated had the sample been chromium oxide alone. This was due to local changes at the surface with titanium becoming enriched and blocking loss of further chromium. Various methods of depositing <b>titanium</b> <b>doped</b> chromia on the surface of SS 430 were investigated. Sol-gel was attempted, but proved problematic. Evaporation of elemental titanium onto SS 430 followed by conversion to rutile by heating followed by the evaporation of chromium into the rutile layer was investigated at length. These layers are nanoscale when evaporated and about 10 times thicker after oxidation. Characterization of the resulting Ti layers showed that at low temperatures a thick dense layer of rutile could be observed. At higher oxidation temperatures, the titanium was difficult to find.

40|$|<b>Titanium</b> <b>doped</b> {{tin dioxide}} nanopowders were {{produced}} using a simple precipitation method and displayed the same crystalline structure and decreasing particle size with increasing dopant concentration. Optical absorption studies showed broad absorption in the UV region for each sample and enhanced absorption relative to commercial zinc oxide (ZnO) but significantly less absorption than the uncoated commercial titanium dioxide nanopowder (P- 25). Photocatalytic {{studies showed that}} the 5 %Ti doped sample had the lowest methylene blue (MB) degradation rate of (1. 9 ± 0. 4) x 10 - 3 min- 1, followed by the undoped ((2. 6 ± 0. 4) x 10 - 3 min- 1) and 10 % Ti-doped ((4. 5 ± 0. 4) x 10 - 3 min- 1) samples. All of the nanoparticle samples demonstrated substantially lowered photocatalytic activity compared to commercial ZnO and P- 25 reference particles...|$|R
40|$|Iron (Fe) <b>doped</b> <b>titanium</b> dioxide (TiO 2) {{thin films}} have been {{successfully}} deposited by using spin coating technique. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were employed to characterize the microstructure and crystallite morphology of the films. It was indicated that the rutile crystal orientation appears due to increasing annealing temperature of the thin films. Furthermore, increasing annealing temperature of the thin films yielded an increasing of porosity value which {{is related to the}} application on gas sensor films.

40|$|A novel {{deposition}} technique {{based on}} inkjet-technology {{has been developed}} for manufacturing gas-sensitive layers of <b>titanium</b> <b>doped</b> chromium oxide (Cr 2 −xTixO 3 +z, CTO). A stable dispersion, carrying CTO particles in defined sizes, has been tuned for printing, concerning its rheological properties. Therefore the CTO was prepared by using the solid-state reaction between Cr 2 O 3 and TiO 2 powders during sintering at temperatures exceeding 1000 °C. The aqueous CTO ink was developed in a ball milling process. A great variety of layers in different formations were printed. The structures were analysed concerning morphology, topography and lateral resolution. Achievable layer thicknesses were determined. High roughness and a porous morphology are characteristic of the layers. Different possibi lities for printing gas sensitive patterns are presented. Prototypes were assembled and their gas-sensitive behaviour to different test gases has been investigated. Correlations between layout and {{the response of the}} layers were observed. Free-standing structures and porous morphology offer a high-sensitive sensor performance...|$|R
