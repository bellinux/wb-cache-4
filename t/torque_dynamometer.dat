40|$|Objective: to {{investigate}} the association between muscle strength, biomechanical functional moments during everyday tasks and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older adults. Methods: eighty-four healthy adults aged 60 - 88 years were tested. A <b>torque</b> <b>dynamometer</b> was utilised to measure muscle moments at the knee and hip joints. Functional assessment involved 3 -D biomechanical analysis of gait, chair rise and sit-down, stair ascent and descent using an 8 -camera VICON® system with Kistler force plates. HRQoL was assessed using the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36) questionnaire. Results: Spearman’s correlation coefficient showed significant correlation (p< 0. 001) between isometric strength and functional moments (r= 0. 24 to 0. 67). Muscle strength was significantly correlated with SF- 36 scores, including physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning and role emotional scores. Knee flexion moment was correlated with role physical, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health and mental component scores (r= 0. 24 to 0. 40). Conclusion: loss of muscle strength is associated with poorer functional ability and both are associated with reduced HRQoL. The reduction of HRQoL is considerable in the physical functioning domain. Cause and effect was not established but studies need to be undertaken to evaluate the benefits of strength training, functional activity training or increased participation in life <br/...|$|E

This study aimed to determine the biomechanical functional demand in terms of joint moments and maximal muscle capabilities at the knee and hip joints while older adults performed stair ascent (SA) and stair descent (SD). Eighty-four healthy older adults aged 60 - 88 years were tested. A <b>torque</b> <b>dynamometer</b> attached to a purpose-built plinth was utilized to measure muscle moments at the knee and hip joints.

Stair negotiation required knee extensor moments {{in excess of the}} maximum isometric muscle strength available (SA 103 %, SD 120 %). For the hip, the levels of demand were high, but were slightly lower than those of the knee joint. Stair negotiation placed a high level of demand on the knee extensors with demand in SA reaching maximal isometric capacity and demand in SD exceeding maximal isometric capacity.

40|$|Background Muscle {{strength}} {{is an important}} component of performance and is a vital measure for characterisation of functional capability in everyday activities. Currently, there is little evidence with regard to the impact of loss of strength at the hip joint on the ability to perform a chair sit down activity in older adults. Method A custom-built <b>torque</b> <b>dynamometer</b> was used to measure muscle strength of hip extensors in 82 older adults who were aged 60 years and over. Isometric strength was measured at three positions namely 45 °, 30 ° and 0 ° of hip flexion within the joint range of motion. Biomechanical analysis with Vicon motion analysis system and Kistler force platforms was performed to determine functional moments produced during chair sit down. Results Muscle strength decreased with increasing age for hip extensors in all the three joint positions. The 80 year olds had lower strengths (22 % ± 3 %) compared to those in the younger age cohorts and the differences were statistically significant. (P value < 0. 05) Hip extensor strength was significantly correlated with functional moments with a correlation coefficient r = 0. 47. (P value = < 0. 001) Conclusion This investigation showed that poor hip extensor strength was associated with reduced functional moments produced at hip during chair sit down in older adults. Hence, loss of muscle strength with advancing age is likely to increase the demands of performing this activity in older adults...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{influence}} of the vehicular traffic on the degradation of urban atmosphere is focused on by researchers belonging to different fields in view of its prime importance for public health. The control of exhaust gases emission is primary in order to keep air pollution below the specified limits of the laws in force. In previous works the “medium car” characterises a country in modelling a pollutant in urban areas. This is the central parameter of a forecasting model proposed by Pignato and LoMastro, of pollutant concentration near urban cross-road with traffic lights in continue queue and platoon flow. The proofs have been carried on two classes of displacement vehicles and four classes of age considering the circulating park. We have found the trend of the pollutants emission vs. rpm in the phase of “acceleration” and in the phase of “stopping and deceleration”. Applying the model proposed it is possible forecast the maximum concentration of the considered pollutant in platoon flow near urban cross road with traffic light, without the bus presence. The "medium car", is the fictitious vehicle polluting like that real one of the platoon most probable composition. In steady-state conditions, the vehicular traffic is governed by stoppages at crossroad assuming the pattern of a "platoon flow", or crossing by "platoons". Any vehicle of the platoon undergoes the following kinematics phases: entering the queue, deceleration within the queue, waiting and starting from rest.

40|$|Strength {{of lower}} {{extremity}} muscles {{is an important}} determinant of mobility-based functional activities. Loss of strength with age produces functional limitation in {{activities of daily living}} such as rising from a chair or stair negotiation. However, there is limited information on the effect of age-related changes on the torque-producing ability of muscles through their ranges of joint motion. To investigate the effect of ageing on the torque-producing ability of lower extremity muscles in a large sample of older adults in three age groups. Eighty-two volunteers participated in this study and were divided into six groups according to their chronological age (60 s, 70 s and 80 s and above) and gender (male, female). Isometric muscle strength was measured at the knee and hip joints at three positions through the joint range using a custom-built strain gauge <b>torque</b> <b>dynamometer</b> and a purpose built plinth. The peak torque of major muscle groups of the knee and hip joints decreased with increasing age at all the three joint positions at which strength was tested. The 80 -year-olds had 20 % lower strength compared to the 60 -year-olds. Age-related decrease in muscle strength was significant when comparing 80 -year-olds with the 60 -year-olds (p < 0. 05). Strength loss was noted to be higher at the inner (muscle is shortened from mid-position) and outer (muscle is lengthened from mid-position) ranges of muscle action when compared with the mid-range position (mid-position). Gender-based differences were significant for all the strength tests (p < 0. 05). Strength decreased with increasing age at all the positions within joint range of motion for knee and hip joints. However, the percentage loss of muscle strength was different at different positions in the joint range. Our findings suggest that muscle strength was more preserved in the middle range of muscle function compared to the inner and outer range of muscle action. In older people, lower extremity muscles might be required to produce higher moments in joint positions that are not within the optimum mid-position for muscle action...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this Thesis was to improve {{treatment}} and rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft. Study I: The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate and compare closed kinetic chain (CKC) training and a combination of closed and open kinetic chain (OKC) quadriceps exercises following ACL reconstruction on anterior knee laxity and isokinetic muscle torque. Another purpose was to determine whether this leads to improved knee function and improve the ability to return to sporting activities. Forty-four patients, aged 18 - 40 years, were randomised and matched into two intervention groups, each comprising 22 patients. Combined OKC and CKC rehabilitation protocol was superior to CKC alone by resulting in significantly better quadriceps <b>torque</b> (Kin-Com@ <b>dynamometer)</b> and a two months earlier return to pre-injury level of sports without compromising knee joint stability (KT- 1000). Study II: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate if a normal knee, bandaged as after an ACL reconstruction and placed in a straight post-operative brace lies in full knee extension (0 °). Another purpose was to evaluate if a postoperative brace in slight hyperextension could prevent extension deficit after an ACL reconstruction. Five healthy subjects with known hyperextension of their knees underwent an Xray examination. This showed that the brace had to be set in - 10 ° to get all their knees in hyperextension. Forty-four patients were then randomised into two groups, either using a brace in 0 ° or - 5 ° during three weeks. At three months follow-up there were no group differences in anterior knee laxity (KT- 1000). A brace set at - 5 ° led to less extension deficit than a brace set at 0 ° using a goniometer with long lever arms. Study Ill: The first {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the frequency of anterior knee pain (AKP) before and after ACL reconstruction using either the central or the medial third of the patellar-tendon as a graft. The second purpose was to study whether there was a gender difference in the amount of AKP. The third purpose was to study possible correlations between AKP and quadriceps weakness. AKP was evaluated before and after ACL reconstruction with a functional knee score tested for reliability, r= 0. 96. Thirty out of 35 patients reported less AKP on an average 8. 4 ± 2. 6 months after ACL reconstruction compared to before. In terms of AKP there was no significant difference between the use of the central or medial patellar tendon graft, and no significant difference between gender. There was no correlation between AKP and quadriceps <b>torque</b> (Kin-Com@ <b>dynamometer).</b> Study IV: The purpose of this follow-up investigation was to study possible relations between anterior knee laxity, knee function, personality and return to sports after bonepatellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction. Another purpose was to check whether knee laxity could distinguish patients that were able to return to pre-injury activity level after ACL reconstruction from those that did not. Forty-nine physically active patients were seen at a 7. 2 year follow-up. One third of the patients returned to pre-injury level of sports. These patients had a significantly better functional outcome (KOOS) and a significantly lower degree of Somatic Trait Anxiety, Psychic Trait Anxiety and Stress Susceptibility (Swedish universities scales of personality). There were no significant group differences regarding anterior knee laxity (KT- 1000).

Study I: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the role of a brace after ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft on knee stability and knee function two years after surgery. Sixty-two patients, aged 16 - 49 years, were randomly allocated to a rehabilitation program with or without postoperative bracing for six weeks. Knee laxity (Stryker laxity tester), range of motion (goniometer), knee circumference for swelling (measuring tape), isokinetic thigh muscle <b>torques</b> (Kintrex <b>dynamometer),</b> a feeling of giving-way (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS), pain (VAS), a feeling of discomfort (VAS), knee function (Lysholm. Knee Scoring Scale) and activity level (Tegner Activity Scale) were assessed preoperatively, two and six weeks as well as three. six and 24 months after surgery. Additionally, the oneleg-hop test was assessed six and 24 months after surgery. For nonparametric measurements we used the Mann-Whitney U test and for parametric measurements an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used. Differences between groups were assessed by Student's t test for independent variables. At a two year follow-up we could not find any benefit of using a postoperative knee brace at any stage up to 24 months after surgery. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of knee joint stability indicating that a postoperative brace does not affect knee joint stability up to two years after surgery. Study II: The purpose of this investigation was to study the long-term clinical outcome regarding patient reported knee function and knee related quality of life after bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction on an average 11, 5 years after surgery. We also wanted to investigate whether there were any correlations between the results of clinical tests that were performed two years after ACL reconstruction and patient reported knee function and knee related quality of life on an average 9, 5 years later. For this study the entire patient cohort from Study I was followed-up. Of the original 62 patients, 56 patients were available at the two year follow-up. At the 11, 5 year follow-up the original 62 patients were also invited to participate and we were able to follow-up 56 patients. Out of these 56 patients one patient was missing at both occasions. The results of the following tests at the two year follow-up were used to study possible predictors for patient reported long-term outcome of knee function and knee related quality of life as determined by two subscales (Function in sport and recreation and Knee related Quality of life) of Knee injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and three subscales (Bodily Pain, Role Physical and Physical Functioning) of SF- 36.

40|$|The torque {{characteristics}} of variable fill hydraulic dynamometers are investigated, particularly {{the phenomenon of}} self-emptying of Froude F type machines under open loop control. An integrated one-dimensional model is adapted from fluid coupling and torque converter theory to cover the steady-state case, and extended to the non-linear open loop dynamic cases by incorporating varying fluid fill and the dynamic governing equations for dynamometers. Two feedback systems are included to predict the closed loop behaviour of the machines. The effect of geometric variations on the steady-state <b>torque</b> capacity of <b>dynamometers</b> is given {{and the cause of}} the self-emptying phenomenon determined. It is found that the increase in working compartment fluid pressure with shaft speed leads to the fluid outflow rate becoming greater than the supplied inflow rate. Thus the fluid fill decreases. This phenomenon is further investigated using a dynamic model, consisting of a system of first order differential equations. The Adams-Bashforth Predictor Adams-Moulton Corrector numerical method is used to solve the system of equations. In addition to the self-emptying characteristic investigation, the differences between steady state and dynamic model predictions and the system responses to changes of set point and disturbances of its inputs (driving torque, outflow valve position, fluid inflow rate) are studied. To enable closed loop performance prediction, models of two feedback system are incorporated: a back pressure water outlet valve driven by a machine-speed oil-pump, and an electrohydraulic butterfly valve governed by direct digital control. The latter model is used to investigate controller tuning around the dynamometer's operating envelope. It is also subjected to input disturbances and the responses compared to the open loop behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Whether the {{transition}} in fatigue processes between “low-intensity” and “high-intensity” contractions occurs gradually, as the torque requirements are increased, or whether this transition occurs more suddenly at some identifiable “threshold”, is not known. We {{hypothesized that the}} critical torque (CT; the asymptote of the torque-duration relationship) would demarcate distinct profiles of central and peripheral fatigue during intermittent isometric quadriceps contractions (3 -s contraction, 2 -s rest). Nine healthy men performed seven experimental trials to task failure or for up to 60 min, with maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) performed {{at the end of}} each minute. The first five trials were performed to determine CT [∼ 35 – 55 % MVC, denoted severe 1 (S 1) to severe 5 (S 5) in ascending order], while the remaining two trials were performed 10 and 20 % below the CT (denoted CT- 10 % and CT- 20 %). <b>Dynamometer</b> <b>torque</b> and the electromyogram of the right vastus lateralis were sampled continuously. Peripheral and central fatigue was determined from the fall in potentiated doublet torque and voluntary activation, respectively. Above CT, contractions progressed to task failure in ∼ 3 – 18 min, at which point the MVC did not differ from the target torque (S 1 target, 88. 7 ± 4. 3 N·m vs. MVC, 89. 3 ± 8. 8 N·m, P = 0. 94). The potentiated doublet fell significantly in all trials, and voluntary activation was reduced in trials S 1 –S 3, but not trials S 4 and S 5. Below CT, contractions could be sustained for 60 min on 17 of 18 occasions. Both central and peripheral fatigue developed, but there was a substantial reserve in MVC torque at the end of the task. The rate of global and peripheral fatigue development was four to five times greater during S 1 than during CT- 10 % (change in MVC/change in time S 1 vs. CT- 10 %: − 7. 2 ± 1. 4 vs. − 1. 5 ± 0. 4 N·m·min− 1).

O objetivo do estudo foi avaliar as razões isocinéticas concêntricas convencionais de torque de pacientes submetidos a tratamento cirúrgico de ruptura aguda do TC após dois protocolos diferentes de reabilitação. Após procedimento cirúrgico para reconstrução do TC, a amostra foi dividida de forma intencional em dois grupos: conservador (GC, 11 homens, 41, 3 ± 7, 9 anos) e grupo acelerado (GA, 13 homens, 43, 5 ± 13, 7 anos). O GC permaneceu com imobilização gessada no tornozelo por seis semanas (tratamento tradicional), enquanto o GA usou uma órtese robofoot em posição neutra e, após duas semanas, iniciou mobilização e apoio precoce do tornozelo, com reabilitação por seis semanas. Após 3 meses de pós-operatório, a razão do torque concêntrico máximo dos FD pelos FP do tornozelo foi avaliada por dinamômetro isocinético. As razões de torque do lado operado se mantiveram superiores às do lado saudável mesmo após 3 meses de pós-operatório (p Achilles tendon rupture reduces ankle plantarflexor (PF) muscles {{mechanical}} overload. This {{change in}} the ankle joint mechanics changes the natural muscle balance between dorsiflexor (DF) and PF muscles. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess such imbalance by concentric conventional isokinetic torque ratios of patients who underwent different rehabilitation protocols after surgical repair of the Achilles tendon. After surgery, subjects were assigned to either a conservative or to an accelerated rehabilitation group. The conservative group (11 men, 41. 3 ± 7. 9 years old) remained with a plaster cast for 6 weeks after surgery. The accelerated group (13 men, 43. 5 ± 13, 7 years old) used a"robofoot" cast for 2 weeks and underwent ankle mobilization and early weight bearing for a period of 6 weeks post-immobilization. At 3 months post-surgery the ratio between the maximal concentric DF torque and the maximal concentric PF torque was evaluated with an isokinetic <b>dynamometer.</b> <b>Torque</b> ratios on the surgery side were higher (p< 0. 05) than on the sound side in both groups.

40|$|EXPLANATION OF TEST REPORT GENERAL CONDITIONS East tractor is a {{production}} model equipped for common usage. Power consuming accessories can be disconnected {{only when it}} is convenient for the operator {{to do so in}} practice. Additional weight can be added as ballast if the manufacturer regularly supplies it for sale. The static tire loads and the inflation pressures muse conform to recommendations in the Tire Standards published by the Society of Automotive Engineers. PREPARATION FOR PERFORMANCE RUNS The engine crank case is drained and refilled with a measured amount of new oil conforming to specifications in the operator’s manual. The fuel used and the maintenance operations must also conform to the published information delivered with the tractor. The tractor is then limbered-up for 1 hour on drawbar work in accordance with the manufacturers published recommendations. The manufacturer’s representative is present to make appropriate decisions regarding mechanical adjustments. The tractor is equipped with approximately the amount of added ballast that is used during maximum drawbar tests. The tire tread-bar height must be at least 65 % of new tread height prior to the maximum power run. BELT OR POWER TAKE-OFF PERFORMANCE Maximum Power and Fuel Consumption. The manufacturer’s representative makes carburetor, fuel pump, ignition and governor control settings which remain unchanged throughout tall subsequent runs. The governor and the manually operated governor control lever is set to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer for maximum power. Maximum power is measured by connecting the belt pulley or the power take-off to a dynamometer. The dynamometer load is then gradually increased until the engine is operating at the rated speed specified by the manufacturer for maximum power. The corresponding fuel consumption is measured. Varying Power and Fuel Consumption. Six different horsepower levels are used to show corresponding fuel consumption rates and how the governor causes the engine to react to the following changes in dynamometer load: 85 % of the <b>dynamometer</b> <b>torque</b> at maximum power; minimum <b>dynamometer</b> <b>torque,</b> ½ the 85 % torque; maximum power; ¼ and ¾ of the 85 % torque. Since at tractor is generally subjected to varying loads the average of the results in this test serve well for predicting the fuel consumption of a tractor in general usage. DRAWBAR PERFORMANCE All engine adjustments are the same as those used in the belt or power take-off tests. If the manufacturer specifies a different rated crankshaft speed for drawbar operations, then the position of the manually operated governor control is changed to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer in the operating instructions. Varying Power and Fuel Consumption With Ballast. The varying power runs are made to show the effect of speed-control devices (engine governor, automatic transmissions, etc.) on horsepower, speed and fuel consumption. These runs are made around the entire test course with has two 180 degree turns with a minimum radius of 50 feet. The drawbar pull is set at 3 different levels as follows: (1) as near to the pull a maximum power as possible and still have the tractor maintain the travel speed at maximum horsepower on the straight sections of the test course; (2) 75 % of the pull at maximum power; and (3) 50 % of the pull at maximum power. Prior to 1958, fuel consumption data (10 hour test) were shown only for the pull obtained at maximum power for tractors having torque converters and at 75 % of the pull obtained at maximum power for gear-type tractors. Maximum Power With Ballast. Maximum power is measured on straight level sections of the test course. Data are shown for not more that 12 different gears or travel speeds. Some gears or travel speeds may be omitted because of high slippage of the traction members or because the travel speed may exceed the safe-limit for the test course. The maximum safe speed for the Nebraska Test course has been set at 15 miles per hour. The slippage limits have been set at 15 % and 7 % for pneumatic tires and steel tracks or lugs, respectively. Higher slippage gives widely varying results. Maximum Power Without Ballast. All added ballast is removed from the tractor. The maximum drawbar power of the tractor is determined by the same procedure used for getting maximum power with ballast. The gear (or travel speed) is the same as that used in the 10 -hours test. Varying Power and Travel Speed With Ballast. Travel speeds corresponding to drawbar pulls beyond the maximum power range are obtained to show the “lugging ability” of the tractor. The run starts with the pull at maximum power; then additional drawbar pull is applied to cause decreasing speeds. The run is ended by one of three conditions; (1) maximum pull is obtained, (2) the maximum slippage limit is reached, or (3) some other operating limit is reached...|$|R
