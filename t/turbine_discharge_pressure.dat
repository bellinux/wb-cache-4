Jet properties for the F 100 EMD engines were calculated using the engine manufacturer's specification deck. The effects of atmospheric temperature on jet Mach number, M 10, were calculated. Values of <b>turbine</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure,</b> PT 6 M, jet Mach number, and jet temperature were calculated {{as a function of}} aircraft Mach number, altitude, and power lever angle for the test day conditions. At a typical test point with a Mach number of 0. 9, intermediate power setting, and an altitude of 20, 000 ft, M 10 was equal to 1. 63. Flight measured and calculated values of PT 6 M were compared for intermediate power at altitudes of 15500, 20500, and 31000 ft. It was found that at 31000 ft, there was excellent agreement between both, but for lower altitudes the specification deck overpredicted the flight data. The calculated jet Mach numbers were believed to be accurate to within 2 percent...|$|E

40|$|This paper analyzes, {{given the}} large {{variation}} in <b>turbine</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> with changing ambient temperatures, whether variable-speed radial-inflow turbine operation {{has a similar}} benefit for Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power recovery systems as variable-speed centrifugal compression has for chiller applications. The benefit of variable-speed centrifugal compression over fixed-speed operation is a reduction in annual electricity consumption of almost 40 %. Air-conditioning systems are by necessity always designed for the highest possible ambient temperature. This is not necessary for ORC systems. Lower cost ORC systems are obtained when the design point is selected at moderate ambient temperatures. However, these systems show reduced power output at higher ambient temperatures. The more expensive ORC systems designed to achieve full power at higher ambient temperatures will produce constant power independent of ambient temperature but consume more heat and require a control mechanism to prevent overloading the turbine at lower ambient temperatures. The benefit of variable-speed ORC turbine operation over fixed-speed {{is an increase in}} annually averaged ORC power output and/or a reduction in annually averaged thermal heat input demand. However, the variable-speed benefit is as, will be explained in the paper, inherently smaller for ORC systems than for centrifugal chillers...|$|E

The optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> of the trans-critical CO 2 heat pump is investigated under different external operation conditions. When the tap-water temperature is low, the characteristic of the S-shape isotherm at the supercritical region has little effect on the occurrence of the optimal discharge pressure; while the mass flow rate of CO 2, the suction pressure and the gas-cooler outlet temperature {{play a significant role in}} determining the emergence of the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure.</b> At the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure,</b> the COP reaches the peak; however, the corresponding heating capacity is still lower than its maximum, which is reached as the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> is slightly above the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure.</b> Reducing the tap-water flowrate or increasing the water-source temperature can increase the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure.</b> The COP is positively dependent on both the tap-water flowrate and the water-source temperature.

40|$|Abstract: Even in {{the absence}} of {{self-acting}} valves, flow through the discharge port of a twin screw compressor is oscillatory in nature. This unsteady but periodic flow variation at the discharge port excites the pressure pulsation, which is the main source of noise and vibration. In this paper, a mathematic model based on the one-dimensional unsteady gas flow equations is established to describe the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsation, which considers the effects of friction and heat transfer between the gas and the pipe. The boundary conditions of the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsation model are given in detail. The two-step Lax–Wendroff scheme is applied to solve the one-dimensional unsteady gas flow equations. In order to verify the theoretical analysis, the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsations under various working conditions are measured and compared. It is shown that the model established in this paper is a useful tool to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of the <b>pressure</b> pulsation in <b>discharge</b> pipe. It is found that the most important factor that affects the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> pulsation is the pressure difference between the pressure upstream of the discharge port in the compression chamber and the <b>pressure</b> in the <b>discharge</b> line someway downstream. The minimum fluctuation occurs when the <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> is equal to the pressure corresponding to the built-in volume ratio.

40|$|Air-source {{transcritical}} CO 2 {{heat pump}} water heater (ATHW) can supply hot water from 60 ? to 90 ? at high efficiency with environment-friendly refrigerant CO 2 for commercial, residential and industrial applications. Several optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> correlations for transcritical CO 2 heat pump {{have been proposed}} {{in the past few}} years, most of which are related to the ambient temperature, the evaporation temperature and the gas cooler outlet temperature. In an earlier study, the authors’ research group had presented a study on the dependency of the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> on the ambient temperature and the hot water outlet temperature.

In order to validate the optimal <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> model developed, field tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of an air-source transcritical CO 2 heat pump water heater in practical application. The system is comprised of a semi-hermetic reciprocating compressor, a counter-flow tube-in-tube gas cooler, a counter-flow internal heat exchanger, a fin-and-tube evaporator, and an electronic expansion valve (EEV) driven by electrically operated step motor. A Siemens SIMATIC S 7 - 200 Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) was used to regulate the compressor <b>discharge</b> <b>pressure</b> by adjusting the EEV opening and the water flow rate by changing the frequency of the variable speed water pump. Field tests were conducted under three different operating scenarios: the nominal test condition, high water supply temperature condition and low ambient air temperature condition.

Even when the hot water temperature is higher than 90 ?, the COP remains at 3. 21 with 20 ? dry-bulb temperature and 15 ? wet-bulb temperature.
