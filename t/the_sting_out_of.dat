5|$|Brundage {{hoped that}} the Munich Games would take <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his defeat over the Rhodesian issue. Munich {{was one of his}} {{favorite}} cities, and the heitere Spiele (cheerful Games) were designed to efface memories of 1936 and Berlin {{in the eyes of the}} world. They initially seemed to be doing so, as athletic feats, like those of gymnast Olga Korbut and swimmer Mark Spitz captivated viewers. In the early morning of September 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists from the organization Black September entered the Olympic Village and took 11Israelis hostage, demanding freedom for hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli custody. Brundage, once informed, rushed to the Olympic Village, where he conferred with German and Bavarian state officials through the day, playing what Guttmann describes as a modest role in the discussions. German officials moved the hostages and their captors to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base, where German police and troops tried a rescue late that evening. The attempt was bungled; the nine remaining hostages (two had been murdered earlier) and three of their captors were killed.|$|E

The Cabinet eventually agreed to let Wilson recall battalions from Silesia, Malta and Egypt, mobilise sailors and an 80,000 strong paramilitary “Defence Force”.

25|$|Crudely {{described}} {{the purpose of}} the operation is to break the connection between the patient’s thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve the connection between the patient’s thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve mental tension, to take <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> experience and thus to favour improvement or to hasten recovery from mental disorder. Risks were listed as death due to cerebral haemorrhage or infection; epilepsy; and personality changes. A text book of the day went into more detail about personality changes, suggesting that they always occurred to greater or lesser extent and left the patient with diminished judgement, childish behaviour, carelessness, loss of ambition, and generally living at a lower level than previously. There was also the possibility of intellectual deterioration. Overall in the Board of Control survey six per cent of patients had died (half of them directly {{as a result of the}} operation); 36 per cent had left hospital and 58 per cent remained in hospital (often described as quieter or easier to nurse). Patients who were depressed and had not been ill for long were much more likely to have left hospital than those who had a schizophrenic illness and had been in hospital longer.|$|E

Wilson had originally wanted the gorilla picture {{to appear on the}} back cover of the book; however, Warner Books stated it must appear on the book's front cover. [...] "It might stand as an apt emblem of the Razzies themselves," [...] commented Nason. [...] "We are not PC. We do not pull punches. We do not pay attention to the basic rules of decorum.

500|$|Ponsford {{travelled}} to England for {{a second}} time, with the 1930 Australian team. In a wet summer, Australia won the series two Tests to one, recovering The Ashes. For {{the second time in}} as many trips to England, Ponsford fell ill—gastritis caused him to miss the third Test at Headingley Stadium. Despite this setback, Ponsford scored 330runs in the Tests at an average of 55.00. Wisden wrote, [...] "Ponsford had a much better season—especially in the Test matches—than four years previously.... In helping his captain to wear down England's bowling he accomplished great work and, even if he was seldom really attractive to watch, there could be no question about his skill and how difficult he was to get out." [...] The outstanding performer of the tour was the young Don Bradman, who scored 974runs in the Test matches—this remains a world record for the most runs scored in a Test series. Ponsford played a part in Bradman's success; Wisden stated that [...] "it is only fair to say that {{on more than one occasion}} [...] task was rendered the easier by the skilful manner in which Woodfull and Ponsford, by batting of different description, had taken <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the England bowling." ...|$|E

On January 21, 1938, Carol's executive (led by Cuza and Octavian Goga) passed a law aimed at reviewing criteria for citizenship (after it cast allegations that previous cabinets had allowed Ukrainian Jews to obtain it illegally), and requiring all Jews who had received citizenship in 1918-1919 to reapply for it (while providing a very short term in which this could be achieved - 20 days); ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviews were mixed, {{according}} to the Associated Press (AP) review summary. That summary quoted, for example, the review by Michael Kuchwara for the AP: [...] "Some reviewers felt Lloyd Webber took <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a cynical tale. 'Wilder's bitter brew has been diluted,' wrote AP Drama Critic Michael Kuchwara. He added: 'When LuPone is off stage, the show sags.'" [...] Frank Rich wrote [...] "Much of the film's plot, dialogue and horror-movie mood are preserved, not to mention clips used to illustrate those sequences in which the faded silent-film star, Norma Desmond ...and her kept, young screenwriter, Joe Gillis, ... travel by car. The lyricist, Don Black ..., and the playwright, Christopher Hampton ..., smartly tailor their jokes to the original screenplay's style. At times, even Lloyd Webber gets into the Wilder swing. Both acts open with joltingly angry diatribes about Hollywood, part exposition-packed recitative and part song, in which the surprisingly dark, jazz-accented music, the most interesting I've yet encountered from this composer, meshes perfectly with the cynical lyrics. Anderson makes the sardonic Wilder voice an almost physical presence in Sunset Boulevard, but he is too often drowned out by both LuPone's Broadway belt and mechanical efforts of Lloyd Webber and his director, Trevor Nunn, to stamp the proven formulas of Phantom and Les Miz on even an intimate tale. At odd moments, the mammoth set advances like a glacier toward the audience or retreats, or, most dramatically, rises partly up into the flies, actors in tow." ...|$|E
40|$|Allseas Engineering bv ("Allseas") {{is a major}} {{offshore}} contractor, {{supplying the}} oil and gas industry with their expertise in the field of marine pipeline installation. Their biggest ship, the Solitaire, has a horizontal working plane and to prevent the pipe from bending or breaking due to its weight the pipe is guided by an outrigger called <b>the</b> "stinger". <b>The</b> <b>stinger</b> is constructed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> cylindrical elements and will convey the pipeline into the water on its route to the seabed. To calculate the hydrodynamic forces on <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> <b>the</b> program AQWA is used by Allseas. This program calculates the Morison force for each element in <b>the</b> <b>stinger.</b> In this thesis a verification of the AQWA program is made, which results in more knowledge on the accuracy of the program. The drag and inertia coefficients in the Morison force can be greatly influenced by several effects, which are neglected by AQWA and have to be investigated. In order to determine the accuracy of the program, AQWA is compared with scale model tests done by Maritime Research Institute Netherlands ("MARIN"). From the investigation followed that only the effects of free stream turbulence, angle of attack, interference and vortex shedding can cause a significant difference between AQWA and the reality. MARIN executed scale model test on the Solitaire and his stinger. For a fair comparison between AQWA and the scale test, scale effects are taken into account. <b>The</b> differences in <b>stinger</b> loads between AQWA and MARIN were of limited significance. Where the ship motions coincide, the loads on <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> were in <b>the</b> same. The trend found in AQWA for the current and regular wave test, was an underestimation by AQWA of the forces in x" and z" direction and the moment around the y" axis. From the comparison it can also be seen that the ship motions have a great influence on <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> forces and moments. It is advised to execute a test in reality.

60|$|The {{aspect of}} Greenwich Park, {{with all those}} festal people {{wandering}} through it, resembled that of the Borghese Gardens under the walls of Rome, on a Sunday or Saint's day; but, I am not ashamed to say, it a little disturbed whatever grim ghost of Puritanic strictness might be lingering in the sombre depths of a New England heart, among severe and sunless remembrances of the Sabbaths of childhood, and pangs of remorse for ill-gotten lessons in the catechism, and for erratic fantasies or hardly suppressed laughter {{in the middle of}} long sermons. Occasionally, I tried to take <b>the</b> long-hoarded <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> these compunctious smarts by attending divine service in the open air. On a cart outside of the Park-wall (and, if I mistake not, at two or three corners and secluded spots within the Park itself) a Methodist preacher uplifts his voice and speedily gathers a congregation, his zeal for whose religious welfare impels the good man to such earnest vociferation and toilsome gesture that his perspiring face is quickly in a stew. His inward flame conspires with the too fervid sun and makes a positive martyr of him, even in the very exercise of his pious labor; insomuch that he purchases every atom of spiritual increment to his hearers by loss of his own corporeal solidity, and, should his discourse last long enough, must finally exhale before their eyes. If I smile at him, be it understood, it is not in scorn; he performs his sacred office more acceptably than many a prelate. These wayside services attract numbers who would not otherwise listen to prayer, sermon, or hymn, from one year's end to another, and who, for that very reason, are the auditors most likely to be moved by the preacher's eloquence. Yonder Greenwich pensioner, too,-- in his costume of three-cornered hat, and old-fashioned, brass-buttoned blue coat with ample skirts, which makes him look like a contemporary of Admiral Benbow,--that tough old mariner may hear a word or two which will go nearer his heart than anything that the chaplain of the Hospital can be expected to deliver. I always noticed, moreover, that a considerable proportion of the audience were soldiers, who came hither with a day's leave from Woolwich,--hardy veterans in aspect, some of whom wore as many as four or five medals, Crimean or East Indian, on the breasts of their scarlet coats. The miscellaneous congregation listen with every appearance of heartfelt interest; and, for my own part, I must frankly acknowledge that I never found it possible to give five minutes' attention to any other English preaching: so cold and commonplace are the homilies that pass for such, under the aged roofs of churches. And as for cathedrals, the sermon is an exceedingly diminutive and unimportant part of the religious services,--if, indeed, it be considered a part,-- among the pompous ceremonies, the intonations, and the resounding and lofty-voiced strains of the choristers. The magnificence of the setting quite dazzles out what we Puritans look upon as the jewel of the whole affair; for I presume that it was our forefathers, the Dissenters in England and America, who gave the sermon its present prominence in the Sabbath exercises.|$|R

2500|$|His {{attitude}} towards Essays and Reviews in 1861, against {{which he wrote}} {{an article in the}} Quarterly, won him the special gratitude of the Low Church party, and latterly he enjoyed the full confidence and esteem of all except the extreme men of either side and party. It was also Wilberforce who proclaimed eminent geologist Sir Roderick Murchison the unofficial King of Siluria. On the publication of John William Colenso's Commentary on the Romans in 1861, Wilberforce endeavoured to induce the author to hold a private conference with him; but after the publication of the first two parts of the Pentateuch Critically Examined he drew up the address of the bishops which called on Colenso to resign his bishopric. In 1867 he framed the first Report of the Ritualistic Commission, in which coercive measures against ritualism were discountenanced by {{the use of the word}} [...] "restrain" [...] instead of [...] "abolish" [...] or [...] "prohibit." [...] He also endeavoured to take <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> some resolutions of the second Ritualistic Commission in 1868, and was one of the four who signed the Report with qualifications. Though strongly opposed to the disestablishment of the Irish Church, yet, when the constituencies decided for it, he advised that no opposition should be made to it by the House of Lords. After twenty-four years in the diocese of Oxford, he was translated by Gladstone to the bishopric of Winchester. He was killed on 19 July 1873, by the shock of a fall from his horse near Dorking, Surrey.|$|E
