5|$|Howard Peck, {{an animal}} trainer, brought the eight-month-old collie to Hollywood animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax {{in order to}} break the animal of {{uncontrolled}} barking and a habit of chasing motorcycles. After working with the dog, Weatherwax gained control of the barking {{but was unable to}} break Pal of his motorcycle-chasing habit. Peck was disappointed with the results and gave <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> a friend, but when he learned that Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax sensed Pal was <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> fill the role, and bought Pal back from his friend for $10.00 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim him after he became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's legal ownership was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for such films as The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the show}} standard, {{there are several}} {{physical}} points which would be treated as faults in the show ring. These are for {{the height of the}} dog at the withers to be outside of the standard range, or for <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> possess either pricked up ears, a liver or brown coloured nose, an overshot or undershot jawline or to have brindle markings.|$|E
5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E

50|$|In 1995, <b>the</b> Prairie <b>Dogs,</b> or <b>Dogs</b> as <b>the</b> fans {{commonly}} called them, began play at Abilene Christian University's Crutcher Scott Field. Under {{the management of}} Charlie Kerfeld, <b>the</b> Prairie <b>Dogs</b> accumulated a dismal 40-60 record, earning them the last place in their League. 1996 brought a new manager, Phil Stephenson, who led <b>the</b> <b>Dogs</b> <b>to</b> a League Championship with a 67-31 record. In 1997, <b>the</b> <b>Dogs</b> returned <b>to</b> last place standing (36-52) under the management of Barry Jones. Jones rallied <b>the</b> <b>Dogs</b> in 1998, <b>to</b> take a fourth-place position with a 39-45 record for the year. In 1999, Jones {{moved on to the}} Ozark Mountain Ducks, and was replaced by Dan Madsen, who took <b>the</b> <b>Dogs</b> <b>to</b> a 46-38 third place League standing in their final year of play.|$|R

5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E
5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh {{returns to}} Marty who hides {{him from his}} family. Concealing Shiloh in the woods in a wire pen he builds, Marty smuggles some of his dinner to the dog each evening. After his mother discovers Marty feeding the dog, he persuades her not to reveal the secret. That night, Shiloh is {{attacked}} by a German Shepherd Dog while in his makeshift cage and his family discovers Marty has been lying and hiding the dog. After taking <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> the town doctor, the family must return Shiloh to his rightful owner by Sunday.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull {{issues such as}} an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A {{complication}} from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> be euthanised. Fused toes, where {{two or more of}} the dog's toes are fused together, may seem to be a health issue but this breed trait is not a cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|These events trouble Mac Da Thó greatly, {{such that}} he goes three days without food, drink or sleep. However, his wife devises {{for him a}} plan – that he should give <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> both parties and let them fight for it. Pleased by this scheme, Mac Da Thó takes each {{delegation}} aside in private, and intimates to both that he had awarded the hound to them after much deliberation. Unknowingly, both parties agreed separately that their people should come {{on the same day}} to a feast in Leinster to claim Ailbe formally.|$|E
5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
50|$|Then, The Birds play a {{football}} game against <b>The</b> <b>Dogs</b> <b>to</b> figure out which team {{will be going to}} the Super Bowl. The Birds crush <b>The</b> <b>Dogs,</b> 58-0, and another drink of Chirpade is poured onto the coach.|$|R
500|$|Their diet {{included}} breadfruit, coconut, yam and poi {{made from}} taro and sometimes fish. This soft vegetarian diet caused <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>to</b> develop round skulls {{and a small}} stature.|$|R

5|$|Debbie and Darren have a brief {{relationship}}, but it ends {{when her}} boyfriend Dan Hunter (Andrew McNair) returns from prison. He later begins {{a relationship with}} Steph, but ends it when she has an epileptic seizure, and he begins dating Zoe. Darren begins gambling, and becomes addicted. The relationship ends when Darren has sex with Zoe's best friend Jessica after he and Zoe fight over his gambling addiction. Darren steals Frankie Osborne's (Helen Pearson) jewellery to settle a debt with a loan shark, and blames Newt (Nico Mirallegro), who is sent back to care. Jack, unaware of Darren's addiction, gives him half The Dog in recognition of how much he has matured. Darren begins counselling for his gambling addiction, but later plays poker with Warren and loses his half of <b>The</b> <b>Dog</b> <b>to</b> him. Jack and Frankie discover that Darren has stolen Frankie's jewellery and lost his half of The Dog. Jack then has a heart attack which Darren blames himself for.|$|E
5|$|Young actress Julie Sawyer (Kristy McNichol) accidentally {{runs over}} a stray White German Shepherd Dog one night.

A rapist breaks into her house and tries to attack her, but the dog protects her so she decides to adopt him, against the wishes of her boyfriend (Jameson Parker). Unbeknown to her, the dog was trained by a white racist to attack, and kill, any and all black people on sight. It sneaks {{out of the house}} one night and kills a black truck driver in an attack. Later, when Julie takes <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> work with her, it attacks a black actress on the set.|$|E
25|$|Spinal {{injuries}} or surgery can cause impairment of motor function, {{which may be}} treated by allowing <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> exercise in water; it provides support and allows <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> exercise its muscles while nerve regeneration is taking place. Degenerative conditions can make normal weight bearing exercise difficult and pressure on joints and limbs may aggravate some conditions, so hydrotherapy {{can be used in}} these cases to allow <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> <b>to</b> exercise in an environment where there is no pressure on the affected areas.|$|E

50|$|The hounds {{were kept}} in a kennel, inside or {{separate}} from the main domicile. Here <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> would have oak beds to sleep on, and often also a second level where <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> could go when the ground level became too hot or too cold. Outside the kennel there would be grass for <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> <b>to</b> eat whenever they had digestive problems. <b>To</b> care for <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> would be a hierarchy of servants such as pages, varlets, aides and veneurs; the page being the lowest, often a young boy. Pages would often sleep in the kennels with <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> <b>to</b> keep them from fighting and care for them if they got sick. Though this might seem harsh by modern standards, <b>the</b> warm <b>dog</b> house could often be much more comfortable than the sleeping quarters of other medieval servants.|$|R
