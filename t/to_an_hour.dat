He did not provide Mackendrick with another directoral role, but assigned him to second unit work. Another of Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage at Ealing Studios and re-edited the film; this version was the one released into cinemas.|$|E
5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> a day.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E

5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue up <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' {{left and right}} flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering {{the brunt of the}} assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E

5|$|Riley and Nye made {{arrangements}} with James Pond {{to make two}} national tours during 1888 and 1889. The tours were popular and generally sold out, with hundreds having to be turned away. The shows were usually forty-five minutes <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye. The shows were informal {{and the two men}} adjusted their performances based on their audiences reactions. Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility. Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows. At a New York City show in March 1888, Augustin Daly was so enthralled by the show he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theatre actors.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} 15 defunct NBA franchises. The Anderson Packers, the {{original}} Denver Nuggets, the Indianapolis Jets, the Sheboygan Red Skins, and the Waterloo Hawks {{had played in}} the NBL before joining the NBA, while the original Baltimore Bullets had played in the American Basketball League before joining the NBA. Nine of the fifteen defunct teams have played in only one NBA season. The Packers, Red Skins, and Hawks left the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League, and are the only defunct teams to have ceased to exist in a league other than the NBA. The original Bullets were the last defunct team to leave the NBA, having left during the 1954–55 season, and are the only defunct team to have won an NBA championship. The Chicago Stags, the Indianapolis Olympians, the Cleveland Rebels, the Packers, and the Red Skins qualified for the playoffs in every year they were active in the league. Among cities that have hosted defunct NBA franchises, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. {{are the only ones}} to currently have an NBA team, although Providence, Rhode Island, Anderson, Indiana and Sheboygan, Wisconsin are all close <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> away from a market with an NBA franchise.|$|E

5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E
