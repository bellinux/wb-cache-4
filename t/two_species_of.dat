5|$|There are a {{total of}} 14 species of {{amphibians}} in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, of which 11 breed in the watershed. These species consist of 6 salamanders, 6 frogs, one newt, and one toad. There are seven species of reptiles in the watershed, of which five breed there. Five of these species are snakes and two are turtles. The biodiversity of birds in the watershed {{is much greater than}} that of amphibians or reptiles; there are approximately one hundred different species of birds in the Nescopeck Creek watershed.

5|$|At least <b>two</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis {{have been}} found as ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have no natural predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive birds {{have been found}} to be susceptible to avian influenza (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E

5|$|During the Kimmeridgian, Europe {{was covered}} by the shallow inland Tethys Ocean, with exposed landmasses being a series of {{scattered}} archipelagos. Highly variable sea levels supported a highly diverse insular crocodilian fauna, with biodiversity (that of atoposaurids in particular) being driven strongly by allopatric speciation. The <b>two</b> <b>species</b> <b>of</b> Knoetschkesuchus were part of similar faunas, in both of which they functioned as small predators ecologically partitioned from the other contemporary crocodilians; {{it is likely that}} these faunas originated through dispersal over larger landmasses.
