5|$|In January 1940 Hauptmann (Captain) Wolfgang Falck took {{command of}} I./ZG1. Falck came to <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> the Bf110 {{was just a}} little too big for Ostermann and had him {{transferred}} to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 equipped I./Jagdgeschwader 21 (JG21) on 7April 1940. JG21 at the time was based at Mönchengladbach and was subordinated to Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Max Ibel, the Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of Jagdgeschwader 27.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's speech {{received}} much less attention than his (now famous) remarks in Indianapolis and was largely forgotten {{by the news}} media.

5|$|The {{church has}} not been {{conclusively}} dated.

5|$|Throughout September 1973, Aman had {{received}} eleven warnings, including a warning from Jordan's King Hussein, that Egypt and Syria were bent on waging war, {{but they were}} all disregarded, as Aman maintained the belief that the Arabs would not launch an attack.

5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is of <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|ANA was of <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> if a {{small amount}} of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} two shows of season two, Jim Shelley in The Guardian, called The Wire the best show on TV, praising the second season {{for its ability to}} detach from its former {{foundations}} in the first season. Jon Garelick with the Boston Phoenix was of <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> the subculture of the docks (second season) was not as absorbing as that of the housing projects (first season), but he went on to praise the writers for creating a realistic world and populating it with an array of interesting characters.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prominent}} {{opponent of}} the Theses was Johann Eck, Luther's friend and a theologian at the University of Ingolstadt. Eck wrote a refutation, intended for the Bishop of Eichstätt, entitled the Obelisks. This was {{in reference to the}} obelisks used to mark heretical passages in texts in the Middle Ages. It was a harsh and unexpected personal attack, charging Luther with heresy and stupidity. Luther responded privately with the Asterisks, titled after the asterisk marks then used to highlight important texts. Luther's response was angry and he expressed <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> Eck did not understand the matter on which he wrote. The dispute between Luther and Eck would become public in the 1519 Leipzig Debate.|$|E

5|$|As a Liberal MP he {{supported}} Irish Home Rule, trade unions, {{free trade and}} welfare reforms. Leading up to the First World War he argued that Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> it should be fought and won. In addition {{to the production of}} alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify trinitrotoluene.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} campaign, Isbul and Malamir {{captured}} the Thracian fortresses of Probaton (near Adrianople, modern Edirne) and Bourdizon (modern Babaeski). After conquering these two fortresses, the Bulgarian troops reached Philippopolis (now Plovdiv). As the defence forces of the city had fled, Isbul and Malamir entered negotiations with the population in order to persuade them to cede the fortress. Pavlov is of <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> the war ended with {{a continuation of the}} peace of 815. He believes that Byzantine Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842) was forced to make concessions to Bulgaria, which may have included the incorporation of Philippopolis and its close surroundings into the Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Cambridge won {{the coin}} toss and chose {{to start from}} the {{southern}} side, the Surrey side, of the River Thames, based on <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> taking a lead early in the race would give them an advantage.

50|$|Due {{to their}} huge caseloads and volume of output, {{the courts of}} appeal in turn see {{the largest number of}} {{decisions}} appealed to the state supreme court and the Supreme Court of the United States. A few famous U.S. Supreme Court cases, such as Burnham v. Superior Court of California, came to the high court on writ of certiorari to one of the courts of appeal after the state supreme court had denied review. Many Court of Appeal opinions have become nationally prominent in their own right, such as <b>the</b> 1959 <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> carved out <b>the</b> first judge-made exception to the at-will employment doctrine, <b>the</b> 1980 <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> authorized a cause of action for wrongful life, and <b>the</b> 1984 <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> created <b>the</b> right to Cumis counsel.|$|R

5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> Plateosaurus could use both quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, in {{the spirit}} of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more {{expansive}} history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was of <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> the name {{may not be as}} rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E

5|$|In early 1988, Butthole Surfers {{were ready}} to record a new album and wanted to use a modern studio for the first time, {{choosing}} a state-of-the-art facility in Texas. The following sessions took only one week, as the band had been performing most of the material for years. The band opted to follow this album's blueprint on future projects. In contrast, songs on their earlier recordings had undergone far more in-studio development and experimentation. Pinkus has expressed <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> the later, better-organized sessions stifled much of the spontaneous creativity that had propelled their earlier releases.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} {{to this group}} of works, the Commission express <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>that</b> an enemy {{will not attempt to}} enter Washington from this direction, and that we cannot (as a general rule) expect to be able to meet him with a line of troops. What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and family ties would suggest.

Instead, {{it is most}} likely that he moved to that country {{with the belief that}} Serbia's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities.
