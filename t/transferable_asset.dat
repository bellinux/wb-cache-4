Targets such as highly populated areas and food stocks {{are at high risk}} due to the current inefficiency in detecting bacteria. A method that can achieve this will be a <b>transferable</b> <b>asset</b> to the food and health and safety industry. This study uses Stable Isotope and Trace Element (SITE) analysis to differentiate between bacteria B. subtilis and B. cereus. This will also aid in the identification of the production method and determine the geographical origin of the bacterium. The study used Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to create inorganic fingerprints of the samples in conjunction with Elemental Analyser-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (EA-IRMS) analysis of the isotopes δ 13 C, δ 14 N and δ 2 H to achieve this...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} game in which the manager can decide how to {{allocate}} total investments between <b>transferable</b> and non-transferable <b>assets</b> of an international joint venture. During operation, the joint venture profits are divided proportionally with a share for the manager. After the joint venture is dissolved, the <b>transferable</b> <b>assets</b> are divided proportionally, whereas all non-transferable assets remain in the host country, benefiting only the host country investor. We investigate to what extent the manager deviates from the profit maximizing allocation in order to benefit the one or the other investor. We find a strong tendency for a national in-group bias in the choices made by Chinese, German, and Korean managers. Only the American managers do not exhibit a preference for allocations that are biased towards the investor of their own nationality. They instead generally choose the profit maximizing allocation. Furthermore, the experiments indicate that investors expect managers’ decisions to be affected by a national in-group bias. These results challenge the conventional wisdom that explicit incentive schemes provide sufficient control for manager behavior...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the pensions delivered by the mandatory social security system, different schemes offer in France the option to purchase private life annuities. These individual annuities are provided by numerous and heterogeneous institutions that rely on more or less rigorous prudential rules and are subjected to highly disparate fiscal laws. Mortality and financial risks are differently covered whereas the accessiblity to life annuities appears unequal. Undoubtedly this disparity impairs the development of such products: very few individuals purchase private life annuities and {{the total amount of}} annuitized financial assets is rather low. Indeed, various restrictive institutional factors tend to strengthen the natural propensity of individuals to favour liquid and <b>transferable</b> <b>assets.</b> Although long term savings benefit from an attractive taxation, it is generally not fiscally advantageous to annuitize the accumulated wealth. Other factors lead to inefficiency on the market for annuities: limitation to competition, constraints on the use of mortality tables favouring adverse selection, restrictive prudential rules. life-annuities, pension schemes, adverse-selection...|$|R
40|$|An {{employment}} relationship consists of many dimensions other than monetary compensation. Textbook economic theory implies {{employers and employees}} will agree upon an efficient level of such nonwage compensation based on an employee's preferences and the employer's cost. At the same time, most types of nonwage compensation are set {{in a context of}} substantial regulation, legal restrictions, and other interventions. This dissertation investigates how regulatory intervention and other changes to the external environment affect firms' decisions regarding two types of nonwage compensation: workplace safety and employment mobility. Chapter One investigates how media coverage of employers caught violating workplace safety and health regulations affects future compliance. Using quasi-random variation in media coverage induced by a policy change at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), I find coverage about one employer leads to significantly higher compliance among other employers likely exposed to it. The results are most consistent with employers acting defensively to avoid their own future publicity. This work contributes to a growing literature investigating how providing information to stakeholders about sellers' quality leads to quality improvements. Chapter Two examines how workplaces respond to health and safety regulatory enforcement inspections. We first analyze the effects of randomized inspections on safety and business outcomes of inspected workplaces. We find inspections lead to significantly fewer injuries and have no detectable effect on business outcomes. We then attempt to identify the types of workplaces where inspections are more or less effective. Chapter Three investigates why employers have employees sign non-compete agreements (NCAs), which contractually limit where the employee can work {{in the event of a}} job separation. NCAs may solve hold-up problems that limit incentives to invest in <b>transferable</b> <b>assets</b> (e. g. general human capital). At the same time, NCAs may impose large costs on employees who sign them. We develop a model of how labor market conditions and liquidity constraints can jointly determine the decision to include an NCA in a hiring contract. We find strong support for the model's predictions using a survey we conducted among employers in the high-end hair salon industry, one in which NCAs are a large and growing phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} the present-value asset pricing model to fishing quota markets by applying instrumental variable panel data estimation techniques to 15 years of market transactions from New Zealand’s individual fishing quota market. In addition to the influence of current fishing rents (as measured by lease prices), we explore the effect of market interest rates, risk, and expected changes in future rents on quota asset prices. Controlling for these other factors, the results support a fairly simple relationship between quota asset and contemporaneous lease prices. Consistent with theoretical expectations, the results indicate that quota asset prices are positively related to declines in interest rates, lower levels of risk, expected increases in future fish prices, and expected cost reductions from rationalization under the quota system. However, the magnitude of some interrelationships is muted relative to what theory suggests, possibly due to measurement error. tradable permits, individual <b>transferable</b> fishing quota, <b>asset</b> pricing, fisheries, policy...|$|R
40|$|Transferable {{allowance}} {{management systems}} are receiving increased attention from fishery managers and stakeholders alike. We use a laboratory experiment {{in which human}} subjects {{play the role of}} fishers to evaluate the promised economic efficiency of tradable allowance systems. In an experiment designed to parallel the most common rules for trading allowances, we find that allowance prices are only weakly associated with the value of the fishing right it provides. Instead, we find a high degree of price variability, consistent with field experiences. In the lab, this variability hampers convergence and supports speculation, leading to average prices much higher than the equilibrium value of allowances. During this protracted price discovery, allowances are misallocated and efficiency falls. Modifications to the market institutions used in most tradable allowance systems to improve price discovery and enhance efficiency are discussed. fishery management, ITQs, tradable fishing rights, <b>transferable</b> allowances, experiments, <b>asset</b> markets, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Q 22, Q 28, G 12,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} Hungary’s antimoney laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism measures. The Hungarian authorities have made significant progress in strengthening their AML regime. The most important step has been {{the passage of a}} revised AML Act of 2003, replacing the 2001 revision of the original 1994 AML Act. With this, the legislative framework for AML is in place, and has been extended to nonfinancial businesses and professions. Financial institutions’ compliance with the AML requirements is well supervised, and they are well aware of their obligations under the Act.

40|$| Friend on Facebook?) Legally {{as far as}} Facebook is concerned, the {{relationship}} {{between them and the}} user, even after death, is primarily regulated by contract. The contract may simply not contain any rules on what happens on death – Facebook do give some insight into their internal rules[8] but many service provider contracts are simply blank on the matter, which may mean disputes are left to the discretion of abuse teams, or similar. Even where rules do exist though, there is a patent potential for conflict on death between the rules of contract and the rules of succession/executry. This major problem was first explored in case law in the celebrated Ellsworth and Yahoo! case, discussed in full below at section B. A connected and less often aired problem is that contract rules are a matter of private bargaining not social policy. While inheritance laws may have evolved to try to balance the interests of, say, parents and spouse of the deceased, or spouse and best friend, or even society (e. g. ultimus haeres rules), contract is unlikely to think about the public good or what value society places on family ties. This is particularly true in the context of social network or most online service contracts which are usually (as they say in consumer law) standard form contracts dictated to the user with significant imbalance of power and lack of opportunity to negotiate. In plain English, this mean that users rarely read the contracts they “sign” with online service providers and have no power to alter them even if they did; thus they are likely not to reflect their real wishes on death but merely what is commercially best for the service provider. There is often a lack of transparency as to what the service provider’s rules are, and a lack of consistency as to what the rules are from one service provider to another. This is why it is quite probable that what terms if any social network providers state about transmission of user accounts may well clash with the general law of succession; and that users are likely to have no idea what happens to their profiles etc when they die. Given the complexities described above, this chapter will mainly draw comparatively on the laws of the US and England and Wales, with a few references where relevant to EU law. In general as a matter of private law, succession and property laws in the EU are a matter for national law. Some harmonised EU law, e. g. data protection law, is however relevant. Similarly in the US, succession law is largely a state not federal matter. As already noted, the lack of international (or often even national) harmonisation in this area is a particularly acute problem when talking about “globalised” or delocalised assets such as tweets or Facebook profiles. Another key problem is the simple novelty of the area, meaning {{there is a lack of}} legal precedent as well as good practice among solicitors/lawyers. Part of the plan for future Edwards/Harbinja research is to provide a one-stop shop guide for users and lawyers seeking guidance on devolution of particular digital assets on death.
