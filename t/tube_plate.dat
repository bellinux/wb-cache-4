The first {{precaution}} needful in {{the construction}} of the instrument was to avoid the recombination of the evolved gases, an effect which the positive electrode has been found so capable of producing (571.). For this purpose various forms of decomposing apparatus were used. The first consisted of straight tubes, each containing a plate and wire of platina soldered together by gold, and fixed hermetically in the glass at the closed extremity of the <b>tube</b> (<b>Plate</b> V. fig. 60.). The tubes were about eight inches long, 0.7 of an inch in diameter, and graduated. The platina plates were about an inch long, as wide as the tubes would permit, and adjusted as near to the mouths of the tubes as was consistent with the safe collection of the gases evolved. In certain cases, where it was required to evolve the elements upon as small a surface as possible, the metallic extremity, instead of being a plate, consisted of the wire bent into the form of a ring (fig. 61.). When these tubes were used as measurers, they were filled with the dilute sulphuric acid, inverted in a basin of the same liquid (fig. 62.), and placed in an inclined position, with their mouths near to each other, that as little decomposing matter should intervene as possible; and also, in such a direction that the platina plates should be in vertical planes (720).|$|E

50|$|The boilers were of {{outstanding}} proportions {{to enable the}} locomotives to cope with one particular bank on the Zeerust line which required continuous steaming for 75 minutes. The boiler barrel and outer firebox shell was made of nickel steel plates while the steel inner firebox was stayed with flexible and rigid stays, the flexible stays arranged at suitable positions along the side and back plates and also along the two front rows of the firebox crown. The firebox <b>tube</b> <b>plate</b> and inner back plate {{were similar to those}} of the Class GL. The firebox was fitted with two Nicholson thermic syphons to increase water circulation and also to provide additional heating surface. In addition, two arch tubes leading from the <b>tube</b> <b>plate</b> to the back plate provided more heating surface while supporting the brick arch.|$|E

50|$|The inner {{series of}} tubes were bent {{up at the}} ends and {{expanded}} into two cast-steel collector boxes, attached to the smokebox {{on each side of}} the chimney. The right hand side box was divided into two chambers by a central partition, with half the superheater tubes expanding into each of the chambers. The partition on the <b>tube</b> <b>plate</b> side of this box was connected to the regulator pipe, while the front partition was connected through the steam pipes to the cylinders. The left hand side steam collector box had no partition.|$|E
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first engines {{to be built in}} Britain with a Schmidt superheater, which was of the smokebox type and consisted of 61 solid drawn-steel tubes. The superheater tubes were encased in a box which was built up of thin steel plates, adapted to the shape of the outer series of tubes, and ended at the steam collector box in two narrow vertical dampers. The whole superheater occupied two-thirds of the total length of the smokebox. To ensure that the superheater tubes received ample heat, a large flue of 10+3/4 in diameter was installed in {{the lower part of the}} boiler between the firebox and the front <b>tube</b> <b>plate,</b> where it connected to the casing of the superheater.|$|E

25|$|In early powered radios, the {{headphone}} {{was part}} of the vacuum <b>tube's</b> <b>plate</b> circuit and carried dangerous voltages. It was normally connected directly to the positive high voltage battery terminal, and the other battery terminal was securely grounded.

50|$|With the 10th Class, on {{the other}} hand, he {{obtained}} a wide firebox by spreading the grate over the rear coupled wheels, hence the requirement to raise the boiler pitch. The front portion of the firebox formed a combustion chamber, which reduced spark throwing and thereby reduced wear on the tube ends. The inside of the firebox was of copper and the plates were 5/8 in thick throughout, except for the <b>tube</b> <b>plate,</b> which was 1 in thick at the tube ends. This firebox design was uncomplicated and allowed for liberal water spaces. The result was a firebox which was virtually {{a copy of the}} one which was used on the Hendrie B locomotive which had been placed in service on the Natal Government Railways (NGR) in 1904.|$|E
5000|$|Some Northern {{locomotives}} {{were also}} rebuilt from older engines. Between 1945 and 1947, the Reading Railroad rebuilt thirty of their heavy I-10 class 2-8-0 Consolidations to booster-fitted 4-8-4 Northern locomotives with 70 in diameter driving wheels. An additional ring was added at the smokebox {{end of the}} boiler, which increased {{the length of the}} boiler tubes from 13 ft to 20 ft, and a larger smokebox was installed which increased the distance between the <b>tube</b> <b>plate</b> and the chimney centre line from 34 in to 111 in. Steam pressure was raised from [...] Four syphons were fitted, three in the firebox proper and one in the combustion chamber. A twelve-wheeled tender was attached, weighing 167 tons in working order, with a capacity of 23.5 tons of coal and 19000 gal of water. A new cast-steel frame was used, with the cylinders cast integral and roller bearings on all axles. They were reclassified to T1 and numbered 2100 to 2129. Two of these locomotives, preserved for hauling special trains, were still in use in 1963.|$|E
50|$|As {{copper and}} nickel alloy {{with each other}} easily and have simple structures, the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated. Strength and {{hardness}} for each individual alloy is increased by cold working; they are not hardened by heat treatment. Joining of 90-10 (C70600) and 70-30 (C71500) is possible by both welding or brazing. They are both weldable {{by the majority of}} techniques, although autogenous (welding without weld consumables) or oxyacetylene methods are not recommended. The 70-30 rather than 90-10 weld consumables are normally preferred for both alloys and no after-welding heat treatment is required. They can also be welded directly to steel, providing a 65% nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects. The C71640 alloy tends to be used as seamless tubing and expanded rather than welded into the <b>tube</b> <b>plate.</b> Brazing requires appropriate silver-base brazing alloys. However, great care must be taken to ensure that there are no stresses in the Cu-Ni being silver brazed, since any stress can cause intergranulary penetration of the brazing material, and severe stress cracking (see image). Thus, full annealing of any potential mechanical stress is necessary.|$|E
50|$|They were {{identical}} to the predecessor Classes 16 and 16B in most respects, except that Hendrie had added a combustion chamber to the boiler, {{similar to that of}} the Class 15A.

50|$|The 500 MW {{single shaft}} {{machines}} manufactured by English Electric, are arranged lengthwise along the turbine hall, which is 259.08 m (850 ft) long by 39.624 m (130 ft) wide by 26.060 m (85.5 ft) high. The overall length of each machine is 49.53 m (162.5 ft). The generators are rated at 500 MW, 22 kV at 0.85 power factor. Steam {{conditions at the}} H.P. turbine stop valve are 2,300 psig (158.6 bar). at 566 °C with a single reheat stage to the I.P. cylinder of 565 psia (38.96 bar) at 566 °C. The turbine has a design steam consumption of 6.3932 lb/kWh, including reheating, feed heating, and boiler feed pump drive and an overall heat input of 7,543 Btu/kWh. A novel mounting arrangement was adopted for the turbo-generators. The L.P. cylinders are supported on two steel beams about 22.098 m (72.5 ft) long, which bridge between the concrete blocks at the H.P. steam and generator ends of the sets. The fabricated condenser structure was welded directly to {{the underside of the}} L.P. frame using a pre-heated welding technique. This provides a compact arrangement of the condenser and the main set and is {{a major factor in the}} reduction of size related to the output of the machines, which is a striking feature of the turbine hall. The L.P. frame is supported at its corners, each of the supports taking about 203.2 tonnes (200 tons) in weight. The overall weight of the frame and condenser structure is some 2,235 tonnes (2,200 tons) of which 1,422 tonnes (1,400 tons) is supported on the bottom of the condenser by the mounting springs. The condensers were fabricated on site by English Electric from sub assemblies and welded to the bridge beams supporting the L.P. cylinder. There are over 40,000 9.144 m (30 ft) long, 25.4 mm (1 in) diameter aluminium/brass tubes in each condenser, giving an effective surface area of 27,870 m² (300,000 sq ft) the equivalent of 3.9 football pitches. Operation is at 1.3 inHg with 1,023 m³/min (225,000 gal of cooling water at 15.5 °C. Steam is passed to the condenser at over 963.9 t/h (2,125,000 lb/h). Since contamination of the condensate by the cooling water must be avoided, a double <b>tube</b> <b>plate</b> construction has been adopted in which the condenser tubes are expanded into an extra tubeplate in addition to the one forming the side of the water box. The narrow space between the plates is filled with demineralised water, supplied from a header tank from 48.768 m (160 ft). This provides a pressure considerably higher than the 20 psig developed in the cooling water system, so that any leaks on the tube end plates will be supplied from the header tank.|$|E
