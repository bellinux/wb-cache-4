30|$|Ten {{grams of}} {{pristine}} ZrP and 20  g of three alkyl silanes (>[*] 95 %, Aladdin), including <b>trimethoxyoctylsilane</b> (C 8), dodecyltrimethoxysilane (C 12), and hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (C 16), were first dissolved by toluene in a 500 -mL three-necked flask, respectively. The mixtures were then placed into {{an oil bath}} at 100  °C with a constant stirring for 48  h. After the reaction, the solvents were removed by centrifugation and the solid samples were washed by centrifugation for three times using petroleum ether. The surface-modified ZrP nanoplatelets were dried at 70  °C in an oven for 24  h. Finally, the dried ZrP samples were ground with {{a mortar and pestle}} into fine powders before further uses. These three surface-modified ZrP nanoplatelets were identified as C 8 -ZrP, C 12 -ZrP, and C 16 -ZrP, respectively.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a bottom-up approach to fabricating a visible light-driven titania photocatalyst device bearing an embedded two-dimensional (2 D) array of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a near-field light-generating layer. The device is a layered structure prepared by depositing a 2 D array of AuNPs on a transparent conductive substrate (10 nm {{indium tin oxide}} (ITO) layer on quartz), coating the 2 D array of AuNPs with a monolayer of <b>trimethoxyoctylsilane</b> (TMOS), and depositing titania nanocrystals on the anchoring molecule (TMOS) layer. The visible light activity of the device was tested using photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) by illuminating the device with visible light (700 nm light) and ultraviolet (UV) light (250 – 380 nm). The localized surface plasmon resonance peak of the 36 nm AuNP 2 D array is around 700 nm with a full-width at half-maximum of 350 nm. In comparison with other control samples, the device showed the highest photocatalytic activity with visible irradiation, which was 1. 7 times {{higher than that of}} titania with UV irradiation. The origin of the visible light activity was confirmed by both quadratic incident light power dependency and action spectrum to be plasmon-induced (near-field enhancement by AuNPs) two-photon absorption...|$|E
