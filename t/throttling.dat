5|$|Believing she {{has finally}} lost her sanity, Jenni {{resolves}} to be committed. She tells Eric {{that the entire}} property will be meticulously searched for the skull as a last resort. Mickey secretly steals the skull and brings it to Snow before Eric can retrieve it. That night, Eric prepares to murder Jenni and stage it as a suicide. Jenni sees Marion's ghost in Mickey's greenhouse and flees back to the house, where Eric begins <b>throttling</b> her. The ghost appears and chases Eric outside, corners and attacks him, drowning him in the decorative pond.|$|E
5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine <b>throttling</b> or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E
5|$|By 2011 Snapdragon was {{embedded}} in Hewlett Packard's WebOS devices {{and had a}} 50% market share of a $7.9 billion smartphone processor market. By 2012, the Snapdragon S4 (Krait core) had taken a dominant share from other Android system-on-chips like Nvidia Tegra and Texas Instruments OMAP which caused the latter to exit the market. As of July 2014, the market share of Android phones had grown to 84.6 percent, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips powered 41% of smartphones. By 2015, Snapdragon was used in most non-Apple smartphones. However, the September 2013 debut of Apple's 64-bit A7 chip in the iPhone 5S forced Qualcomm to rush out a competing 64-bit solution, despite the capable performance of the Snapdragon 800/801/805, since their existing Krait cores were only 32-bit. The first 64-bit SoCs, the Snapdragon 808 and 810, were rushed to market using generic Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 cores and suffered from overheating problems and <b>throttling,</b> particularly the 810, which led to Samsung ditching Snapdragon for its Galaxy S6 flagship phone.|$|E
5000|$|On many cars, the {{accelerator}} pedal motion is communicated via the <b>throttle</b> cable, {{to activate the}} <b>throttle</b> linkages, which move the <b>throttle</b> plate. In cars with electronic <b>throttle</b> control (also known as [...] "drive-by-wire"), an electric motor controls the <b>throttle</b> linkages and {{the accelerator}} pedal connects not to the <b>throttle</b> body, but to a sensor, which sends the pedal position to the Engine Control Unit (ECU). The ECU determines the <b>throttle</b> opening based on accelerator pedal position and inputs from other engine sensors.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>throttle</b> {{is opened}} up {{slightly}} from the fully closed position, the <b>throttle</b> plate uncovers additional fuel delivery holes behind the <b>throttle</b> plate {{where there is a}} low pressure area created by the <b>throttle</b> plate/Valve blocking air flow; these allow more fuel to flow as well as compensating for the reduced vacuum that occurs when the <b>throttle</b> is opened, thus smoothing the transition to metering fuel flow through the regular open <b>throttle</b> circuit.|$|R
50|$|Usually, the <b>throttle</b> valve is {{controlled}} with a <b>throttle</b> pedal or lever via a direct mechanical linkage. In vehicles with electronic <b>throttle</b> control, the manual <b>throttle</b> control sends {{a signal to}} the Engine Control Unit (ECU), which then directly controls the position of the <b>throttle</b> valve. This means that the operator does not have direct control over the <b>throttle</b> valve; the ECU can finely control the valve in order to reduce emissions or maximize performance.|$|R
5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by <b>throttling</b> their charging rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCoE) can be calculated by dividing the total cost to build and operate a power-generating system over its lifetime by {{the total amount of}} electricity shipped to the grid during that period. The amount of money is essentially a combination of the capital expense (CAPEX) of the plant and the interest payments on that CAPEX, and the discounted cost of the fuel, the maintenance needed to keep it running and its dismantling, the discounted operational expenses, or OPEX. The amount of power is normally calculated by considering the peak power the plant could produce, and then adjusting that by the capacity factor (CF) to account for downtime due to maintenance or deliberate <b>throttling.</b> As a quick calculation, one can ignore inflation, opportunity costs and minor operational expenses to develop a figure of merit for the {{cost of electricity}}.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at Tâˆ’6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, <b>throttling</b> up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

The copper-coloured coil visible next to this returns the <b>throttle</b> to its idle (closed) position when the pedal is released.|$|R
50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, the <b>throttle</b> plate rotates within the <b>throttle</b> body, opening the <b>throttle</b> passage to allow more air into the intake manifold. Usually an airflow sensor measures this change and communicates with the ECU. The ECU then increases the amount of fuel {{being sent to the}} fuel injectors in order to obtain the desired air-fuel ratio. Often a <b>throttle</b> position sensor (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the <b>throttle</b> plate to provide the ECU with information on whether the <b>throttle</b> is in the idle position, wide-open <b>throttle</b> (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>throttle</b> {{position}} sensor (TPS) is a sensor {{used to monitor}} the <b>throttle</b> position of a vehicle. The sensor is usually located on the butterfly spindle/shaft {{so that it can}} directly monitor the position of the <b>throttle.</b> More advanced forms of the sensor are also used, for example an extra closed <b>throttle</b> {{position sensor}} (CTPS) may be employed to indicate that the <b>throttle</b> is completely closed. Some engine control units (ECUs) also control the <b>throttle</b> position electronic <b>throttle</b> control (ETC) or [...] "drive by wire" [...] systems and if that is done the position sensor is used in a feedback loop to enable that control.|$|R
5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, {{and there was no}} time for any training or exercises. There was also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill decided that he would sit in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assist the pilot. Despite the battalion's parachutes only arriving at 16:30 on 14 November, and were packed twelve to a container which meant they had to be removed and individually repacked, the battalion was prepared by 15 November and took off at 07:30. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border, they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. At the same time, 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR successfully conducted a drop at Tebessa, capturing its objectives and securing the area; it then passed from the control of 1st Parachute Brigade and remained in the area for some time. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and encountered excellent weather which allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, <b>throttling</b> him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's secondincommand, Major Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment which collected airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.|$|E

25|$|Virgin Broadband {{employs a}} form of {{bandwidth}} <b>throttling</b> whereby customer bandwidth is reduced temporarily after a threshold is reached during peak periods. The company has experimented with and revised all parameters involved in the <b>throttling,</b> such as threshold size, peak period definitions, <b>throttling</b> percentage and duration. Separate thresholds are applied to upstream and downstream, and thresholds vary between packages. From 28 February 2014, Virgin Media announced that they were scrapping traffic management for downstream traffic on 30Mb or higher packages, which was welcomed by many customers. As a result of this, 30Mb or higher packages are only throttled on the upstream, where as 20Mb or below packages are throttled on both the upstream and the downstream.|$|E
