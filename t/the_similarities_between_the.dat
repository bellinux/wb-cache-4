5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere).

Kwee Tek Hoay followed this article with another discussion of the work's origins in 1925. Later writers criticised Lie's other works as blatant adaptations. Tan Soey Bing and Tan Oen Tjeng, for instance, wrote that none of his works were original. Tio Ie Soei, in response, stated that Lie had changed the stories he had adapted, and thus shown originality.|$|E

This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer Gate of Ploče was designed and constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević. Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.|$|E

5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} note <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> táltos of Hungarian {{folklore and}} Siberian shamans, but {{the existence of}} shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven. Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary, including boszorkány ("witch"), elbűvöl ("to charm"), and the ancient Hungarian word for holy (igy or egy), are of Turkic origin. Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary: búcsú (indulgence), bűn (sin), gyón (confess), isten (god), and ördög (devil). According to Gyula László, a Hungarian children's verse that refers to a fife, a drum, and a reed violin preserves {{the memory of a}} pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise. The refrain of another children's verse, which mentions three days of the week in reverse order, may have preserved an ancient belief in the existence of an afterlife world where everything is upside-down.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} the HDF {{observations}} were taken, a region in the south celestial hemisphere was imaged {{in a similar way}} and named the Hubble Deep Field South. <b>The</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two regions strengthened the belief that the universe is uniform over large scales and that the Earth occupies a typical region in the Universe (the cosmological principle). A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In 2004 a deeper image, known as the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure. The HUDF image was at the time the most sensitive astronomical image ever made at visible wavelengths, and it remained so until the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (XDF) was released in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Hellenistic wall {{paintings}} at Delos and the First Style of Pompeii, Joyce {{contends that the}} differences in Delian and Pompeian mosaics are the deliberate product of artistic preference rather than the result of ignorance of each other's traditions. These differences include {{the widespread use of}} opus signinum at Pompeii, with only four known examples at Delos; the use of opus sectile at Pompeii and its complete absence at Delos; the prevalent use of polychrome patterns and intricate, three-dimensional figured designs in Delian mosaics versus two-dimensional designs at Pompeii, which at best utilize two colors. Complex three-dimensional figured mosaics using polychrome designs to achieve the illusion of light and shadow weren't produced at Pompeii until the Pompeian Second Style of wall painting (80-20 BC) and are considered an adoption from Hellenistic art trends. While lead strips were used in Hellenistic mosaics of Delos, Athens, and Pella (Greece), Pergamon (Turkey), Callatis (Romania), Alexandria (Egypt), and Chersonesus (the Crimean peninsula), they are absent in Western Mediterranean mosaics of Malta, Sicily, and the Italian peninsula. Westgate affirms that Hellenistic mosaics can be divided into two broad categories: eastern and western, based on their different styles and production techniques.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Ben Silverman {{was named}} {{co-chairman}} of NBC's entertainment division in 2007, he asked Greg Daniels {{to create a}} new comedy series. Silverman and Daniels previously worked together on The Office, a half-hour comedy Daniels adapted from the British comedy of the same name by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Daniels wrote the pilot for what eventually became Parks and Recreation along with series co-creator Michael Schur, who had served as a writer on The Office. Daniels and Schur had been considering ideas for a possible show with cast members Rashida Jones and Aziz Ansari, but the concept for the series did not form until they learned Amy Poehler could play the lead character. Once that casting was determined, the script for the pilot episode was first written in the summer of 2008 revolving around her as a city bureaucrat seeking to turn an enormous construction pit into a park. They also decided the script would include the mockumentary comedy style of The Office and, like that show, would allow for improvisation on set. However, they did not consider the script an Office spin-off and NBC officials vehemently insisted to media outlets that the show was a completely separate series, despite <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two shows.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} species similar in {{appearance}} to G.maritimus: G.arenophilus, G.decipiens, G.flavus, G.fulgens and G.pseudofulgens. G.arenophilus and particularly G.fulgens {{are the most}} similar. Though G.maritimus and G.arenophilus show similarities in their biogeography and ecology, the typically slightly smaller G.arenophilus differs from G.maritimus morphologically. While G.maritimus has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales, G.arenophilus can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with G.maritimus typically displaying larger warts. Like G.maritimus, G.fulgens has been recorded growing on sand-dune heathland; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of G.maritimus. However, G.fulgens requires soil rich in peat and must grow among moss. Moreover, {{there are a number}} of morphological differences; G.maritimus mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on G.fulgens stems, the shape of the top of the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on G.maritimus. G.fulgens var. luteicystis is even more distinct from G.maritimus than the nominate variety. Despite <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> three species, the three have been shown to be in different clades within Gymnopilus, suggesting ecological convergence between G.arenophilus and G.maritimus, and morphological convergence between G.fulgens and G.maritimus.|$|E
