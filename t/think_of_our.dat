The idea of Cooley's looking glass self is that our sense of self {{develops}} as we observe and reflect upon others and what they may <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> actions. Additionally, impression formation processes allow us to interpret the significance of others' actions.|$|E
25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results—we know this {{even if we do}} not understand the physics involved.|$|E

Richards himself {{said in a}} 1998 interview: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him, it's {{because no one else}} has the guts to do it or else they're paid not to do it. At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done." ...|$|E

In order for the performance or the movie to take place {{there will be one}} person, a cameraman who will turn the camera on. What is more important - we need at least one spectator and an actor. And when we have millions of spectators the actors will always be talented, the key is the work and love of spectators.|$|R

He considered the mysteries of Alien to be alien in nature, and said, [...] "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey'... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?" [...] His solution was to link the alien mysteries {{to the past and}} future of humanity. He said: [...] "if that story is somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story. That story changes meaning within our own life, things of such significance that we <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> own lives differently." [...] Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float. By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the script, [...] "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?" [...] In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.|$|E

2500|$|The {{leaders of}} Canada's {{traditional}} federal parties continue to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> country as [...] "an equal partnership between two founding races, the English and French"—a federation of founding peoples {{and ethnic groups}} distinguished by official bilingualism, government-sponsored multiculturalism, and government enterprise. The approach to national unity is to grant special status to those Canadians who feel constitutionally or otherwise disadvantaged. This is Old Canada—and it has become [...] "a house divided against itself." ...|$|E

But I do not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> dear ones there. They are safe, folded, the dear lambs". Horatio later wrote the famous hymn [...] "It Is Well with My Soul", commemorating his daughters.
