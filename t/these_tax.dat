Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era.

Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors.

These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from <b>these</b> <b>tax</b> cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E

25|$|Because the tax did not vary, the {{treasury}} could estimate fairly well {{how much they}} were going to make in revenue for the year. Prior to Khosrow's tax reforms, taxes were collected based on the yield that the land had produced.

Lands which grew date palms and olive trees used a slightly different method of taxation based on the amount of producing trees that the land contained. <b>These</b> <b>tax</b> reforms of Khosrow were the stepping stone which enabled subsequent reforms in the bureaucracy and the military to take place.|$|E

The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld their convictions, but with reduced sentences.|$|E

Non-partisan analyses of Romney’s tax plan estimated that it could have added more than $3 trillion to the federal deficit, and would have favored the highest-earning Americans, possibly raising annual taxes on middle-class earners by as much as $2,000. Romney and supporters of his tax plan said that such analyses were unreliable because they were based on assumptions about specific measures that were not detailed in the plan and because they had not adequately accounted for the positive effects on economic growth that Romney said his plan would generate. And that lower tax rates would lower rates of Tax evasion.|$|E

40|$|Common wisdom supposes that {{inheritance}} {{taxes are}} very unpopular among the public.

Usual explanations for this are that people are poorly informed {{about the extent of}} <b>these</b> <b>taxes</b> or a lack of a compelling moral case for such taxes. This chapter argues that current approaches do not go far enough. It suggests public attitudes to inheritance taxes are better understood as a specific case of discontent with wider taxes.
