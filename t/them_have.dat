Their beliefs, attitude and intention were assessed based on the principals of theory of planned behavior (TPB). A questionnaire was developed by the researchers and completed by 400 first grade preparatory school pupils from the west zone of Alexandria Governorate.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence rates of human deficiency in a sample of the Parque Antonio Vieira population in Juazeiro do Norte, Ceara.

The authors affirm that measuring the disease frequency in populations is a way to let people informed about the many deficient people present in their society, and it would also help people to plan strategies to include those deficient people’s needs in the general aspects of society...|$|R
