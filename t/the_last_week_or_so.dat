500|$|In July 2015, Greg Berlanti, {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer on both series, said: We've just been breaking into it over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> actually ... so we're, really, excited about it. We've got a great story lined up for {{towards the end of}} the fall, early winter. This year our real hope is to make a crossover that's even bigger, and even more rewarding for the audience than the last years. The scripts for the [...] "Heroes Join Forces" [...] crossover were written in September 2015. Berlanti created the story for the event, and Kreisberg and Guggenheim helped to craft the story of The Flash and Arrow episodes, respectively. The teleplay for The Flash was written by showrunners Aaron and Todd Helbing; Arrows was written by Brian Ford Sullivan and Guggenheim.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 2015 Oldfield tweeted, via his {{official}} Twitter account [...] "I am continuing {{to work on}} ideas for [...] "A New Ommadawn" [...] for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to see if [...] the idea actually works." [...] On 8 May 2016, Oldfield announced via his Facebook group page that the new Ommadawn project with the tentative title of Return to Ommadawn is finished, and he is awaiting a release date from the record company. He also suggested that he may soon be starting work on a possible fourth Tubular Bells album.|$|E
60|$|Note to III.--I {{had counted}} on being back at Embro' by <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of May.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's quite right. I've {{noticed it}} myself," [...] he commented. [...] "In fact, I've been {{figuring}} on {{asking you to}} get out <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ormsgill laughed. [...] "A {{good deal}} just now. We started soon after sunrise, and have {{scarcely}} stopped all day. In fact, {{we have been}} marching rather hard <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two." ...|$|R
60|$|Then she blazed out. The sallowness of her cheeks, {{the little}} dip under her cheekbones--she had grown thinner during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so--made her eyes seem {{larger and more}} {{brilliant}} than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's good to {{hear you}} say that, Duge," [...] he said. [...] "I tell you we have come pretty near being scared <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> I feel a lot more {{comfortable}} fighting with you in the ranks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's been {{a regular}} {{procession}} of them fellers, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> walkin' through the country," [...] replied Jerry. [...] "To-day's {{the first time}} any of them got to me. But I've heerd talk. Sunday when I was in Palmer the air was full of rumors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} very busy since I was last here," [...] Winifred admitted, {{and then turned to}} Hastings. [...] "Until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> there has been no {{slackening}} in the rush to sell. Everybody seems to have been throwing wheat on to the market." ...|$|E
60|$|Sadie had a {{strained}} look {{and had been}} quiet for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two except when she was angry. This indicated that her nerves were on edge, and Keller thought he knew why.|$|R
50|$|The mums leave {{a list of}} chores {{that need}} doing, and so the dad will really {{appreciate}} her work load she won't have stocked up on food over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>or</b> done <b>the</b> laundry.|$|R
6000|$|Alice Deringham turned, {{and saw the}} girl's fingers flittering {{across the}} paper, but her face was still hidden and the {{monotonous}} voice continued, [...] "We made a few advances during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> He was {{thoughtful}} and worried. Once I pressed him about it. He admitted {{that there was}} something, {{and that it was}} concerned with his official life. 'It is too serious for me to speak about, even to you,' said he. I could get nothing more." ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor Captain H- and {{his wife}} were terribly cut up. If they had only been able to bring it into port alive it could have been {{probably}} saved; but the wind failed them for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> light breezes, and [...] . the baby was going to be buried this afternoon. He supposed I would attend-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish to God I {{knew why}} it should!" [...] he answered, almost bitterly. [...] "Do {{you know what}} a fool I have been making of myself for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so?</b> I have given up my club and all my friends, refused every invitation, and spent all my time going about from {{restaurant}} to restaurant, café to café, hoping somewhere to come across you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} very glad, Doctor. I have not seemed to gain strength, for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> ten days; but I believe that, if I were in the open air, I should gain ground rapidly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, father, I {{think it}} may be a matter of thirty-five years; though it don't seem so long, does it? But I've been {{thinking}} harder for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two, and I'm going to speak out." ...|$|R
6000|$|He hardly {{regarded}} her at first. She had discerned that during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two he had seemed preoccupied, {{as if some}} private business harassed him. She repeated her request. He replied with a sigh, 'Yes, certainly, mee deer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{stand the}} Golden Lion any longer," [...] he explained. [...] "Somehow or other, the place {{seems to have}} changed in the most {{extraordinary}} manner' during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> Everybody drinks too much there. The table-linen isn't clean, and the barmaids are too familiar. I've found out a little place in Jermyn Street where I go now when I have time. We can talk there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Though {{he could}} not see the man's face for the dark, Gallwey fancied he was a little disconcerted at this announcement. In another half-hour, however, they were sitting down to a meal. Leland said very little until it was over, when, taking his pipe out, he pulled a hide chair up to the stove and looked at the man. [...] "Whom have you had round the place <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> Jeff?" [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|John {{stood and}} watched the inspanning absently. In truth, he, too, was {{conscious}} of a sensation of regret. He felt ashamed of himself for it, but there it was; he was sorry to leave the place. For <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> he {{had been living in}} a dream, and everything outside that dream was blurred, indistinct as a landscape in a fog. He knew the objects were there, but he could not quite appreciate their relative size and position. The only real thing was his dream; all else was as vague as those far-off people and events that we lose in infancy and find again in old age.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, {{you can do}} so," [...] the {{lieutenant}} said. [...] "You can hear {{if there is any}} news of the Kaffirs stirring in that neighbourhood; they seem to have been a bit more quiet for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so." ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{some point}} in the 1980s, the {{tradition}} of [...] "Cram Jams" [...] was formally instituted. This refers to <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two of <b>the</b> semester, when finals are being taken. The entire WTBU schedule is revised and DJs tend to play music they feel is especially relevant to test-taking.|$|R
6000|$|... “I have {{received}} their deputations civilly, and during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two I’ve {{put up with}} a good deal. We pay standard wages and I don’t think there’s a man about the place who’s asked to do more than he’s able. But I can’t have these fellows dictating whom I shall employ!” ...|$|R
60|$|That {{man was not}} {{altogether}} a stranger to me. For <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> I had been rather on the look-out for him in all the public places where in a provincial town men may expect to meet each other. I saw {{him for the first}} time (wearing that same grey ready-made suit) in a legitimist drawing-room where, clearly, he was an object of interest, especially to the women. I had caught his name as Monsieur Mills. The lady who had introduced me took the earliest opportunity to murmur into my ear: “A relation of Lord X.” (Un proche parent de Lord X.) And then she added, casting up her eyes: “A good friend of the King.” Meaning Don Carlos of course.|$|E
60|$|It {{was always}} the custom for such Austinians as went up to {{represent}} the School at the annual competition to stop {{the night in the}} town. It was not, therefore, till just before breakfast on the following day that Tony arrived back at his House. The boarding Houses at St Austin's formed a fringe to the School grounds. The two largest were the School House and Merevale's. Tony was at Merevale's. He was walking up from the station with Welch, another member of Merevale's, who had been up to Aldershot as a fencer, when, {{at the entrance to the}} School grounds, he fell in with Robinson, his fag. Robinson was supposed by many (including himself) to be a very warm man for the Junior Quarter, which was a handicap race, especially as an injudicious Sports Committee had given him ten yards' start on Simpson, whom he would have backed himself to beat, even if the positions had been reversed. Being a wise youth, however, and knowing that the best of runners may fail through under-training, he had for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> been going in for a steady course of over-training, getting up in the small hours and going for before-breakfast spins round the track on a glass of milk and a piece of bread. Master R. Robinson was nothing if not thorough in matters of this kind.|$|E
60|$|I {{am writing}} this in Major Hapgood's office--it is bright and pleasant, only the dust here in Washington {{is a great}} nuisance. Mother, your shirts do first rate--I am wearing them; the one I have on to-day suits me better than any I have ever yet had. I have not worn the thin coat <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> as {{it has not been}} very hot lately. Mother, I think {{something}} of commencing a series of lectures and reading, etc., through different cities of the North, to supply myself with funds for my hospital and soldiers' visits, as I do not like to be beholden to the medium of others. I need a pretty large supply of money, etc., to do the good I would like to, and the work grows upon me, and fascinates me--it is the most affecting thing you ever see, the lots of poor sick and wounded young men that depend so much, in one word or another, upon my petting or soothing or feeding, sitting by them and feeding them their dinner or supper--some are quite helpless, some wounded in both arms--or giving some trifle (for a novelty or a change, it isn't for the value of it), or stopping a little while with them. Nobody will do but me--so, mother, I feel as though I would like to inaugurate a plan by which I could raise means on my own hook, and perhaps quite plenty too. Best love to you, dearest mother, and to sister Mat, and Jeff.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Haldin had {{not made}} the {{slightest}} allusion to her son for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> more. She sat, as usual, in the arm-chair by the window, looking out silently on that hopeless stretch of the Boulevard des Philosophes. When she spoke, a few lifeless words, it was of indifferent, trivial things.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe's deportment was {{certainly}} more cheerful. For <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two {{he had been}} depressed. He had paid visits with Eve and myself, and devoted {{a reasonable amount of}} time to his wife. The demands on his complete respectability, however, had been irksome. He was too obviously finding no savor in life.|$|R
5000|$|The Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) is a {{community}} health worker. Depending on the area covered by the sub-centre, each ANM is supported by four or five ASHAs. ANMs are supposed to take weekly or fortnightly meeting with ASHAs to review work done <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> fortnight. ANMs guides ASHAs on aspects of health care.|$|R
5000|$|On 16 October 2015, Oldfield stated on Twitter, [...] "I am {{continuing}} {{to work on}} ideas for [...] "A New Ommadawn" [...] for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to see if ... the idea actually works." [...] On 8 May 2016, Oldfield stated on his Facebook group page that the new Ommadawn project with the tentative title of Return to Ommadawn is finished, and he is awaiting a release date from the record company.|$|E
5000|$|West's fiancée is a {{bit more}} informative. There was {{something}} on his mind for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of his life. He commented to her on how easily a traitor could get hold of [...] "the secret" [...] and how much a foreign agent would pay for it. Then, on the night in question, as {{the two of them were}} walking to the theatre, near his office, he dashed off, never to be seen again.|$|E

60|$|Prescott nodded, {{because he}} did not know what to say. Mrs. Jernyngham had, he gathered, been unusually fractious for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two, and Cyril was {{invariably}} forbearing. Indeed, Prescott sometimes wondered at his patience, for he imagined that his comrade had outgrown what love he had borne her. The man had his virtues: he was rash, but he seldom failed to face the consequences with whimsical good-humor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; I {{have not}} seen very much of them for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two. They have made a nest {{in one of the}} big trees {{at the back of the}} house, and I daresay that they are there, or perhaps they are hunting for their food--they always feed themselves. But I will soon tell you," [...] and she whistled in a soft but {{penetrating}} note.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{have been}} so {{impressed}} with what I have heard and seen from your politicians on the news in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two, I see {{no need for the}} party anymore." [...] Weiss in April 2009 The party was disbanded in April 2009, reportedly due to Weiss being impressed at the progress of the Northern Ireland peace process after the Massereene Barracks shooting, and it was deregistered on 8 June 2009.|$|R
