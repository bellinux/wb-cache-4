40|$|This study {{investigated}} long-term stability of forward osmosis (FO) membranes against biodegradation during prolonged exposure <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> sludge. Results show that cellulose triacetate (CTA) membranes were more resistant against biodegradation than polyamide thin film composite (TFC) ones. Nevertheless, CTA membrane biodegradation was discernible after {{seven months of}} exposure <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> sludge as manifested {{by an increase in}} the membrane average pore size, water and salt permeability, and membrane structural parameter. Asaresult, of prolonged exposure <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> sludge, the water and reverse salt fluxes of the CTA membrane increased; and concomitantly the rejection of a range of trace organic contaminants decreased significantly. The impact of prolonged exposure <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> sludge on the polyamide active layer of TFC FO membranes was even more severe. Our results indicate that currently available commercial CTA and polyamide TFC FO membranes may not be readily compatible for practical osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) operation. Thus, the development of new and robust FO membrane materials specifically designed for membrane bioreactor operation is essential for commercial OMBR applications...|$|R
5|$|After encountering {{the three}} servile groups, the player begins {{to learn of}} a group of foreigners known as Sholai, explorers who have been shipwrecked on the island. It was the Sholai, led by a man named Trajkov, who {{attacked}} the player with their last remaining ship. Trajkov controls a device called the Geneforge, created by the Shapers, which can rewrite the user's DNA and make them incredibly powerful. This is the cause of the island's Barred status, the device was deemed too dangerous in the wrong hands. Trajkov and his followers have allied themselves with the Takers, absorbing the contents of canisters and trying to claim Shaper powers as their own. The group have been unable <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> the Geneforge itself due to a Shaper being needed <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> the device. A Shaper named Goettsch was kidnapped for this purpose, {{in the same manner as}} the player-character. Goettsch fled and stole the shaping gloves needed to safely use the Geneforge, causing Trajkov to attempt to kidnap the player as a replacement. During these events, some Sholai have escaped from their increasingly violent and unpredictable leader.|$|E

5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> the receptors they bind. Antagonists do {{not maintain}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit {{the function of}} agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E

40|$|Combined oral {{contraceptives}} show clear differences in {{effect on the}} tissue factor-initiated coagulation test of activated protein C resistance, which {{is dependent on the}} presence and dosage of levonorgestrel. Multiphasic levonorgestrol {{oral contraceptives}} differ from monophasic contraceptives and resemble third-generation contraceptives. The significance of levonorgestrel dose in oral contraceptives for effects on coagulation is presented. A study in Germany was conducted <b>to</b> test the <b>activated</b> protein C resistance and assess the differences induced by various combined oral contraceptives (COCs). A resistance <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> protein C of monophasic COCs with desogestrel, gestodene, or norgestimate close to the value of women heterozygous for factor V Leiden was confirmed. Higher concentrations of levonorgestrel counteract the increase in resistance. Thus, monophasic and multiphasic COCs with levonogestrel were distinguished according to their effects on tissue-factor-initiated resistance <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> protein C. A more detailed comparison of in-vitro coagulation effects and epidemiology will further assess the plausibility and mechanisms of resistance in relation <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> protein C acquired by COC use and venous thromboembolism.

5|$|Helper T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required <b>to</b> <b>activate</b> antibody-producing B cells.|$|E

30|$|DiscussionSilver ions {{released}} from nanosilver react immediately with {{large amounts of}} chloride present in wastewater to form silver chloride. Silver ions may react with organic ligands or sulfide groups additionally. Consequently, even silver nitrate added with 1  mg/L Ag (250  mg Ag/kg TS) <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> sludge did not inhibit nitrification activity. Very high amounts of nanosilver, i.[*]e. 100  mg/L Ag, overburdened the system and equilibrium condition between silver ion release and ligands was not reached. The mass balance reflects the excellent attachment of nanosilver <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> sludge and biological flocs.

40|$|The chronic {{inflammatory}} {{skin disease}} psoriasis {{is characterized by}} prominent skin infiltration by neutrophils and microabscess formation. The adhesion of leukocytes and subsequent transmigration through the activated endothelium is one prerequisite for the accumulation of these cells in skin. In recent studies, the human Thy- 1 (CD 90) was characterized as an adhesion molecule on activated endothelial cells (ECs) mediating the adhesion of neutrophils via the interaction with the β 2 -integrin Mac- 1. Based on these novel findings, we compared the roles of Thy- 1 and ICAM- 1 in the adhesion of neutrophils from patients with psoriasis <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> ECs. The adhesion of peripheral blood neutrophils of patients suffering from psoriasis to Thy- 1 -transfected cells as well as <b>to</b> <b>activated,</b> Thy- 1 -expressing human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) is distinctly increased {{in comparison to the}} adhesion of neutrophils from healthy controls. In contrast, adherence of psoriatic neutrophils to ICAM- 1 transfectants is, if at all, only slightly enhanced compared to healthy controls. The interaction of healthy as well as psoriatic polymorphonuclear cells to Thy- 1 transfectants and HDMECs was significantly inhibited by blocking Thy- 1 on ECs or its receptor Mac- 1 on neutrophils, indicating the importance of this interaction for the adhesion of neutrophils <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> endothelium. In conclusion, our data indicate that the adhesion of neutrophils <b>to</b> <b>activated</b> ECs mediated by Thy- 1 /Mac- 1 interaction is an important attachment mechanism facilitating their subsequent migration into lesional psoriatic skin...|$|R
