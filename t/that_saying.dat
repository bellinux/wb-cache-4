Rav Nachman protested that he said Rahab's name twice and nothing happened to him. Rabbi Isaac replied that he meant that this would happen to any man who knew her.|$|E

25|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} Thomas is dependent on Syriac writings, including unique versions of the canonical gospels. They contend that many sayings of the Gospel of Thomas are more similar to Syriac translations of the canonical gospels than their record in the original Greek. Craig A.

25|$|During Kamakura period, major reformation {{activities}} started, namely {{changing from}} Buddhism for the imperial court to the Buddhism {{for the common}} people. The traditional Buddhism mostly focused on {{the protection of the}} country, imperial house or noble families from the ill spirits and salvation of the imperial families, nobles and monks themselves (self-salvation). On the other hand, new sects such as Jodo shu (pure land sect) founded by Honen and Jodo Shinshu (true pure land sect) founded by Shinran, Honen's disciple, emphasized salvation of sinners, common men and women and even criminals such as murderers of parents. Shinran preached the commoners by teaching <b>that</b> <b>saying</b> nembutsu (prayer of Amida Buddha) is a declaration of faith in Amida's salvation.
