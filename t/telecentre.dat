A study was conducted to identify the issues of financial sustainability on 132 <b>telecentres</b> in Malaysia.

The results prove that financial support is critical in operating and maintaining the centers. The costs incurred in running <b>telecentres</b> involve the costs for promotion, staff, utilities, premise renting, and training.

This paper reports on the role of inter-generational interactions in community <b>telecentres</b> in facilitating low-income, older and technology-challenged citizens in gaining access and using digital city infrastructure. Our research also finds that virtual communities are playing a role in supporting e-participation among older, technology-challenged citizens. We examine the influence and interaction of members of offline communities, who use <b>telecentres,</b> on virtual community participation. These communities and <b>telecentres</b> can provide support for the provision of e-services and the development of the digital city. We explore these issues based on empirical field research in community-based <b>telecentres</b> in a developing country.

40|$|<b>Telecentres</b> are an {{important}} type of information and communication technology (ICT) system particularly assisting rural and urban communities in developing countries, but the focus is often put on social development, sometimes on static economic returns, and rarely on dynamic economic aspects. This paper develops a basis for understanding the factors behind financial success in a dynamic setting based {{on the concept of}} increasing returns. This is applied to <b>telecentres</b> according to the stage of maturity of their information services. The framework is illustrated with literature- and interview-based cases, and will help an understanding of ways in which <b>telecentres</b> can scale-up their operation and impact.

40|$|Shared Information and Communication Technology (ICT) {{facilities}} such as <b>telecentres</b> offer people {{opportunities to}} access digital technologies that may facilitate socio-economic development. This {{is particularly important}} in rural areas where the citizens {{are less likely to}} own technologies. However, despite a huge investment in such interventions, developing countries have not fully realised the benefits. In particular, due to a myriad of social factors, women in rural areas seem to benefit the least from such interventions. The aim of the paper is to explore the challenges rural women face in using <b>telecentres.</b> The study employed a qualitative approach and was based on an interpretivism paradigm. Data for the study came from both secondary sources and semi-structured interviews. The interviews were conducted with women in two Eastern Cape rural towns. The challenges which limited the usage of <b>telecentres</b> were grouped into: (1) institutional, (i. e. financial sustainability, staff shortage, poor ICT infrastructure, location, lack of awareness), and (2) community challenges (perception, operational times, affordability, lack of ICT skills). The study concludes that through awareness; improvement of ICT capacity (infrastructure and literacy); and women empowerment in terms of ICT; use of <b>telecentres</b> can be successfully integrated in rural communities. The findings of the study may be used by those seeking to improve the impact of <b>telecentres</b> in rural areas, especially on women. NRF, COSTEC...|$|R
