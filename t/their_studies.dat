5|$|Sabah state {{government}} also emphasises pre-school {{education in the}} state. This was followed with the aid from Sabah Foundation (Yayasan Sabah) and Nestlé who helped to establish pre-schools in the state. Sabah has two public universities: Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). Universiti Tun Abdul Razak (UNIRAZAK) has set up their regional centre in Kota Kinabalu. As of 2016, there is around 15 private colleges, two private university colleges together with other newly established colleges. In 1960, the overall literacy rate in North Borneo was only 24%. The recent findings in 2011 found the literacy rate have increase to 79%. Most of secondary schools leavers also did not continue <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> after completing their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) mainly due to financial burden as well {{because of the lack}} of interest and confidence to continue <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> in local higher learning institutes, with a survey in 2015 saw only 16,000 out of more than 20,000 secondary schools leavers continuing <b>their</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|E

Students at Gujarat University were unable to take examinations, which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption. While other schools in the state had to postpone or cancel exams, it was reported that some schools held examinations under police protection. It was also reported that many students were forced to leave <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because they had lost income-earning members of their families.|$|E

Techniques in analyzing the data used descriptive analysis, the first and second hypothesis used partial correlation and the third hypothesis used regression that was started by normality, linearity, and intercorrelation testing. This study shows that: (1) there was positive and significant correlation between parents’ social status with willing to continue <b>their</b> <b>study</b> in university level; (2) there was positif and significant correlation between learning achievement of automotive subject with willing to continue <b>their</b> <b>study</b> in university level; and (3) there was positive and significant correlation between parents’ social status and learning achievement of automotive subject with willing to continue <b>their</b> <b>study</b> in university level...|$|R

They spent the next 16 months in France. In October 1647 Marek and John Sobieski went to England and subsequently studied mathematics in the Netherlands. The brothers had planned to go to Turkey, but after hearing of the Khmelnytsky Uprising they decided to return to Poland. Marek and John Sobieski left Brussels on 24 July 1648.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from the post of Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers, Lefebvre was approached by traditionalists from the French Seminary in Rome who had been refused tonsure, the rite by which, until 1973, a seminarian became a cleric.

In 1969, he received permission from the local bishop to establish a seminary in Fribourg which opened with nine students, moving to Écône, Switzerland in 1971.|$|E

40|$|The {{authors of}} the paper have been {{providing}} Japanese university students who are planning to study in the U.

The purpose of the study is to investigate the use of social skills and social support networks by Japanese students during <b>their</b> <b>study</b> in the U. S. in order to analyze the influence of the pre-departure session. To achieve this goal, the authors compared questionnaire and interview responses of two groups of students after <b>their</b> <b>study</b> abroad: those who had joined the pre-departure session and those who had not. The results show that both groups actively used their social skills in the last stage of <b>their</b> <b>study</b> in the U. S. No clear {{difference between the two groups}} was found regarding the use of social skills at that stage. The students who had participated in the pre-departure session, however, were more people-oriented than those who had not. In other words, those who had joined the session tended to attach greater importance on making friends during <b>their</b> <b>study</b> abroad. The reasons for this are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Next, we {{analyzed}} two students and one entire focus group who provided particularly rich details about <b>their</b> <b>study</b> habits {{in order to}} depict how studying unfolds in real-world settings at the individual level. These subjects were selected because {{of the level of}} detail they provided when self-reporting their conceptions of what studying means, the contexts in which <b>their</b> <b>studying</b> occurred, and <b>their</b> actual <b>study</b> behaviors. These case studies also highlight the situated nature of studying in the influence of peers, curricular artifacts, and other features of the environment on <b>their</b> <b>study</b> habits. Finally, we examined the resulting themes to explore any patterns in the data and identified a new way of thinking about studying that is reported in this paper.|$|R

At this time, officers who had not served overseas were sent to Europe to tour the battlefields, and Loper visited battlefields in France, Belgium and Italy, as well as the Army of Occupation in Germany.|$|E

The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane.

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} paper {{draws on}} data from a larger ongoing project and examines how students conceive of their opportunities to influence <b>their</b> <b>study</b> environment and how this {{may be related to}} their self-efficacy beliefs and <b>their</b> <b>study</b> motivation. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to analyze semi-structured in-depth interviews of 10 students of a Masters Program in Engineering. The results indicate that most students had confidence in their opportunities to influence <b>their</b> <b>study</b> environment and believed influencing could increase self-efficacy beliefs and study motivation. The high content of problem solving in courses was the principal motivator. Students that either perceived their opportunities to influence the study environment as not highly important or as satisfactory were more motivated and performed better than other students. Findings have implications for students' motivation and performance if educators inform students of their formal and informal opportunities to influence <b>their</b> <b>study</b> environment...|$|R

They usually called themselves Sigma6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment.

Under the circumstances many elected to pursue <b>their</b> <b>studies</b> abroad. Jan Brożek, a rector of the Kraków University, was a multidisciplinary scholar who worked on number theory and promoted Copernicus' work. He was banned by the Church in 1616 and his anti-Jesuit pamphlet was publicly burned. Brożek's co-worker, Stanisław Pudłowski, worked on a system of measurements based on physical phenomena.|$|E
