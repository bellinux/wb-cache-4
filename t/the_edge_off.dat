500|$|The Leipziger Weihnachtskantaten {{recording}} by the Collegium Vocale Gent, {{conducted by}} Philippe Herreweghe, was reviewed as with [...] "bracing but not rushed tempos, infectiously energetic and technically solid {{contributions from the}} chorus, and an intelligently paced flow from movement to movement." [...] The Guardian wrote: [...] "Herreweghe's accounts are typically thoughtful, not at all theatrical or dramatically driven, and that slightly laid-back approach takes <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the Magnificat too, though {{the quality of the}} solo and choral singing, and the careful shaping of the orchestral lines are all exemplary." ...|$|E

The washroom set has graffiti on the walls to look authentic, and is used for the girls' and boys' room; urinals are installed and removed as needed. The set used for the cafeteria is [...] "purposefully bland to take <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the rest of the school looking so beautiful." [...] It is also used as the studio's cafeteria where the cast and crew eat.|$|E
500|$|During a New York trip, A.B. {{heard the}} Pretenders' 1983 single [...] "Back on the Chain Gang" [...] on the radio. He was {{concerned}} over {{the lack of}} material the band had to record for the album. The idea of reworking [...] "Back on the Chain Gang" [...] into a Spanish-language cumbia song captivated him and he asked Vela to write its translation. After discovering that Selena had sampled her song, Pretenders' vocalist Chrissie Hynde prevented the band from releasing Amor Prohibido because of her copyrights and demanded a translation from Vela before she approved a rights agreement. At the time of Hynde's refusal, the band had $475,000 (1994 USD) of pre-sale copies in a warehouse that included [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos". Noticing it was the shortest track on Amor Prohibido, musicologist James Perone felt that [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] had [...] "stripped some of <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> of Hynde's text but retained the basic premise of [...] ". Perone complemented A.B.'s arrangement as [...] "an example of [...] universal Latin approach." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1956 season, Feller started {{four games}} and {{appeared}} in 15 others, {{and finished with}} an 0–4 record and career-worst 4.97ERA. The Indians held [...] "Bob Feller Night" [...] on September 9, and he appeared in his last major league game on September 30. After the season, speculation mounted regarding whether Feller would retire as a player. In December 1956, Feller told The Plain Dealer: [...] "I will return to Cleveland later this week and plan to confer with Hank Greenberg before Christmas. I hope to reach a decision at that time." [...] Greenberg had also offered Feller his release or {{a job with the}} Indians in their front office. Greenberg said, [...] "We sincerely want Feller to remain with us. As far as I'm concerned, {{there will always be a}} job waiting for Bob in the Cleveland organization." [...] On December 28 Feller officially retired from the Indians as a player to continue his work selling insurance. Announcing his retirement, Feller said, [...] "I could have gone with a couple other ball clubs, but anything I might have done with them would have taken <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the success I have had with the Cleveland club the last 20 years." [...] He continued, [...] "What if I did pitch another year, so what? I would have to come to the decision I am making now, some time." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{flying back}} from New York, A.B. Quintanilla—the brother-producer of Selena—heard the Pretenders' 1983 single [...] "Back on the Chain Gang" [...] on the radio. At the time, A.B. {{was having a}} nervous {{breakdown}} after realizing he {{was running out of}} materials to record for Selena's fourth studio album, Amor Prohibido (1994). He likened the idea of reworking [...] "Back on the Chain Gang" [...] into a Spanish-language cumbia song. Keyboardist of the group, Ricky Vela wrote the Spanish lyrics into a cumbia-style that A.B. envisioned for the recording. The Amor Prohibido album was pressed for a release date of March 13, 1994, and was halted for distribution due to the copyrighting issues with [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos". Vela retold in a 2002 interview how he was awaken by Selena and A.B. because they did not have the clearance for [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos". Singer-songwriter Chrissie Hynde's music producers reported the song to Hynde who did not allow Selena to continue with [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] until she received an English-language writing of the song. It was only after Vela re-wrote the song into English that Hynde gave Selena the clearance for the recording. Musicologist James Perone, noticed how the song was the shortest track off of Amor Prohibido. He further wrote how Vela [...] "stripped some of <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> of Hynde's text but retained the basic premise of [...] " [...] Perone found A.B.'s arrangement to be [...] "an example of [...] universal Latin approach".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the series, Martin called them as the [...] "most {{entertaining}} characters" [...] of the series and [...] "one of anime's liveliest and most entertaining couples". He described their constant glee as infectious and their [...] "bizarre logic" [...] as priceless. He felt that their presence [...] "elevates the series from merely {{a very good one}} to a truly exceptional one." [...] He believes that they always [...] "make the most of their screen time", noting how every one of their actions [...] "give an entirely new twist to the events otherwise playing out normally." [...] Carl Kimlinger, also from ANN, adds that [...] "the things those two can do to a well-laid plan are simply appalling." [...] Davey Jones of Active Anime felt the pair was the [...] "highlight of the story" [...] and should have their own series. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment described the two as [...] "very off center in a colorful and fun way" [...] and believed they stood out from the large cast because they were [...] "far more outgoing." [...] He felt that the connections they make {{with the rest of the}} cast [...] "are fun to watch and there's only a kind of elegance to it". Beveridge commented that [...] "when this pair comes on the screen, [...] can’t help but smile" [...] and that he [...] "enjoy all of the scenes that involve [...] because they bring such a lighthearted aspect to the show that’s definitely needed to break up the more intense scenes." [...] DVD Talk's Todd Douglass felt that Isaac and Miria are [...] "the uplifting and energetic component of [...] show," [...] feeling that it is entertaining to see how they influenced the events. Nick Hartel, also from DVD Talk, believed that it would be cruel not to mention them. He described them to be filled with [...] "a maniac energy, often brought to a screeching halt by melodramatic breakdowns over trivial occurrences or bold assumptions." [...] Although he admit they seem to have to place in the series at first, he notes that their interactions with other characters [...] "causes a drastic shift in tone." [...] He comments that as the plot progresses, the pair [...] "become a bright spot as storylines take dark turns and serve as a reminder of the goodness that makes up the vast majority of the world." [...] Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order Podcast and quest Mike Toole believed that out of every other character in the ensemble cast, the pair are the [...] "default protagonists" [...] simply because they meet every other character. They also felt that if ignorance is bliss, they are the happiest people [...] "in the world" [...] because they are [...] "that stupid". The two characters were compared to Bonnie and Clyde, but the reviewers felt that were more like Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, characters from the animated series Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. Even if the events become grim, the reviewers could not help but smile as Isaac and Miria appear. ANN columnist Erin Finnegan described Isaac and Miria as [...] " [...] a couple of completely loveable weirdoes". She agreed that the subplot revolving around them [...] "takes some of <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> the dark moments." [...] Amanda Tarbet of SequentialTart.com drew parallels between the duo and the trickster god archetype. She compared them to the kitsune of Japanese folklore, which are portrayed [...] "as tricksters, but also as nurturing characters such as guardians and friends". She felt that Isaac and Miria [...] "represent this duality perfectly." [...] Tarbet also described them as part Bonnie and Clyde and part Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E

2500|$|Mackintosh {{thereafter}} {{became a}} bitter disappointment to Hazlitt. Looking {{back at the}} elder man's change of political sentiments, Hazlitt observed that the lecturer struck a harsh note if he felt it were a triumph to have exulted {{in the end of}} all hope for the [...] "future improvement" [...] of the human race; rather it should have been a matter for [...] "lamentation". The two later again crossed paths, when Hazlitt, as a political reporter, attended Mackintosh's [...] "maiden speech" [...] in Parliament, in 1813, leading Hazlitt to think deeply about what constitutes an effective speech in a legislative body (Mackintosh's was presented as a counter-example in Hazlitt's 1820 essay on the subject). [...] By this time, Mackintosh's return to the liberal camp had begun to take <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> Hazlitt's bitterness, although he regretted that the nature of his talents kept Mackintosh from being an effective ally in Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|HMS Fisgard {{was first}} reinforcement, ordered from the Pacific Station by Rear Admirial Seymour in January 1846. Captain Duntze was to [...] "afford Protection to Her Majesty's Subjects in Oregon and the North West Coast..." [...] and avoid any {{potential}} confrontations with American settlers. On 5 May the Fisgard reached Fort Victoria, later moving to Fort Nisqually on the 18th, where it remained until October. Sent to aid other British vessels navigate difficult channels and rivers, HMS Cormorant, a Paddle steamer, {{arrived at the}} Strait of Juan de Fuca in June. Two survey ships were dispatched from Plymouth in June 1845, HMS Herald and HMS Pandora, for charting {{the coast of the}} Americas. The vessels reached Cape Flattery on 24 June 1846. The Cormorant towed the Herald to Fort Victoria three days later. The Herald and the Pandora spent several months charting the Puget Sound and Vancouver Island until 2 September, when the vessels sailed for Alta California. The Fisgard and Cormorant both departed for Valparaíso in October. As the Modeste was the only British ship in the region during 1847, the Oregon Treaty [...] "seemed to have taken <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>off</b> of the Royal Navy's interest in the Northwest Coast." ...|$|E
