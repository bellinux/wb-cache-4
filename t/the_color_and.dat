5|$|Seiderman {{worked with}} Charles Wright on the wigs. These went over a {{flexible}} skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread. When {{he found the}} wigs too full he untied one hair {{at a time to}} alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> texture.|$|E
5|$|While probing crevices {{with their}} head, banded sea kraits {{are unable to}} observe {{approaching}} predators and can be vulnerable. The snakes can deter predators, such as larger fish, sharks, and birds, by fooling them into thinking that their tail is their head, because <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> movement of the tail {{is similar to that}} of the snake's head. For example, the lateral aspect of the tail corresponds to the dorsal view of the head.|$|E

5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and the absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E
5|$|Most americium(III) halides form {{hexagonal}} crystals with slight {{variation of}} <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl3) is reddish {{and has a}} structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P63/m) and the melting point of 715°C. The fluoride is isotypic to LaF3 (space group P63/mmc) and the iodide to BiI3 (space group R). The bromide is an exception with the orthorhombic PuBr3-type structure and space group Cmcm. Crystals of americium hexahydrate (AmCl3·6H2O) can be prepared by dissolving americium dioxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid. Those crystals are hygroscopic and have yellow-reddish color and a monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations in <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E

5|$|The breed was {{developed}} in Iowa during the early 20th century, beginning with a cream-colored mare named Old Granny. The Great Depression threatened the breed's existence, but several breeders worked to improve <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> type of the breed, and in 1944 a breed registry was formed. The mechanization of farming in the mid-20th century led to {{a decrease in the}} breed's population and the registry became inactive for several decades. It was reactivated in 1982 and population numbers have slowly grown since then. However, population numbers are still considered critical by The Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> general {{appearance}} of A.bisporigera {{are similar to}} those of A.verna and A.virosa. A.bisporigera is at times smaller and more slender than either A.verna or A.virosa, but it varies considerably in size; therefore size is not a reliable diagnostic characteristic. A.virosa fruits in autumn—later than A.bisporigera. A.elliptosperma is less common but widely distributed in the southeastern United States, while A.ocreata is found on the West Coast and in the Southwest. Other similar toxic North American species include Amanita magnivelaris, which has a cream-colored, rather thick, felted-submembranous, skirt-like ring, and A.virosiformis, which has elongated spores that are 3.9–4.7 by 11.7–13.4μm. Neither A.elliptosperma nor A.magnivelaris typically turn yellow with the application of KOH; the KOH reaction of A.virosiformis has not been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> {{the other for}} {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but {{it really was a}} goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> {{texture of}} the coyote's fur varies {{somewhat}} geographically. The hair's predominant color is light gray and red or fulvous, interspersed around the body with black and white. Coyotes living at high elevations {{tend to have more}} black and gray shades than their desert-dwelling counterparts, which are more fulvous or whitish-gray. The coyote's fur consists of short, soft underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. The fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms, with the fur of some Mexican and Central American forms being almost hispid (bristly). Generally, adult coyotes (including coywolf hybrids) have a sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and a white facial mask. Albinism is extremely rare in coyotes; {{out of a total of}} 750,000 coyotes harvested by federal and cooperative hunters between March22, 1938, and June30, 1945, only two were albinos.|$|E
5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of <b>the</b> <b>color)</b> <b>and</b> Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E
