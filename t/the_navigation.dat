5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> {{ceased to}} operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock {{remained}} in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> were owned by <b>the</b> <b>navigation,</b> and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was agreed that <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Although much of {{the upper}} reaches are now {{designated}} as leisure routes, there is still significant commercial traffic on <b>the</b> <b>navigation.</b> 300,000 tons were carried in 2007, {{although most of the}} traffic is now petroleum and gravel, rather than the coal which kept <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> profitable for 150 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1737, <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> was leased {{to three}} of the company {{shareholders}} for 14 years, and a new 7-year lease was made in 1751. After 1758, the company managed <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> itself. Tolls for the next 10 years raised an average of £7006 per annum, indicating healthy traffic levels.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the towpath as a leisure amenity began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire walked along the towpath from end to end in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge the legality of the towpath diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the towpath. These organisations were Southampton County Borough Council, Eastleigh Borough Council, Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of weirs at most of the locks by the Southern Water Authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of <b>the</b> <b>navigation.</b> The powers of <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} head of {{the canal}} was at Blackbridge Wharf, Winchester, just {{to the south of}} Wharf Mill, a grade II listed water mill dating from 1885, and College Walk, which spans the river at Blackbridge, an eighteenth-century stone bridge which is also grade II listed. Below the bridge, the channel splits, with the river flowing to the west and <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> to the east. Blackbridge Wharf was accessed by Wharf Bridge, the oldest surviving bridge over <b>the</b> <b>navigation,</b> dating from the 1760s. Close by, the manager's house, a warehouse and some stables have also survived. <b>The</b> <b>navigation</b> flows past the grounds of Winchester College, which uses the waterway for rowing practice. The rowing eights use a winding basin just above the remains of St Catherine's Hill Lock, which now contains a modern sluice mechanism, and was the location of a water-powered sawmill, located {{to the west of the}} lock.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> River Wey <b>Navigation</b> and Godalming Navigation, {{geographically}} (but not historically) <b>the</b> Wey <b>Navigation,</b> form {{a continuous}} waterway {{which provides a}} 20 mi navigable route from the River Thames between Weybridge and Hamm Court, Addlestone via Guildford to Godalming. The waterway is in Surrey and {{is owned by the}} National Trust. <b>The</b> Wey <b>Navigation</b> connects to <b>the</b> Basingstoke Canal at West Byfleet, and <b>the</b> Godalming <b>Navigation</b> part to <b>the</b> Wey and Arun Canal in the Broadford part of Shalford. <b>The</b> <b>Navigations</b> consist of man-made canal and adapted (dredged and straightened) parts of the River Wey. Its adjoining path is part of European long-distance path E2.|$|R
5|$|Efforts to {{maintain}} and improve <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> channel have continued to the present day.

5|$|However, his {{re-instatement}} {{was short}} lived, as <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> ceased {{to operate in}} January 1869, the last month in which tolls were collected. Mortgages of £19,708 were outstanding, of which £2,607 dated from the original construction by Pyott. A plan to buy the waterway by J. R. Stebbings of Southampton in 1871 fell through. A further attempt to buy <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> was made in 1909 by Patrick O'Carroll, an estate agent from Southsea. He created a company called the Itchen Navigation Ltd, with a capital of £20,000, but {{they were unable to}} establish who owned it, and so the company never traded.|$|E
5000|$|The festival was {{centred on}} a {{location}} known as Chain Bridge in Loughborough. This {{point is the}} intersection of <b>the</b> Loughborough <b>Navigation,</b> <b>the</b> Leicester <b>Navigation</b> and Loughborough Wharf of the Grand Union Canal.|$|R
50|$|The River Soar {{passes by}} {{to the east}} of <b>the</b> town. <b>Navigation</b> from Loughborough north towards the Trent was {{achieved}} in 1778 by <b>the</b> Loughborough <b>Navigation,</b> which terminates at Loughborough Wharf between Derby Road and Bridge Street. Subsequently <b>the</b> Leicester <b>navigation</b> was constructed, connecting to <b>the</b> Loughborough <b>Navigation</b> at Chain Bridge and to the River Soar south of the town.

5|$|Metroid: Other M is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to feature melee attacks. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques, such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point-blank range. Unlike other Metroid games, enemies do not drop items, with the {{restoration}} of health and ammo occurring either by using <b>the</b> <b>Navigation</b> Booths, or employing of the Concentration technique, where Samus rests and replenishes missiles and health. Players can also use <b>the</b> <b>Navigation</b> Booths to save their progress. While there are power-ups scattered around the Bottle Ship, a few items are already equipped by Samus, but she agrees to wait to use them until commanding officer Adam Malkovich authorizes her to do so. Players can find items that will augment Samus's abilities, such as Energy and Missile Tanks.|$|E
5|$|The drain {{has been}} renamed as the Black Sluice Navigation by the Environment Agency.

5|$|The next lock is Conegar Lock, {{which was}} also called Stoke Conegar or Coneygear Lock. Just above it are some hatches which {{supplied}} water to the adjacent water meadows. They were built of dressed stone, and are the best-preserved of the original hatches. There is no modern sluice at Conegar Lock, and the change in level has resulted in fast-flowing rapids which have cut back the channel above the lock. A little further south at Fish House Bay, <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> crossed the Barton River diagonally, as the mill stream made its {{way back to the}} main river. A footbridge on the eastern bank carried the towpath over the Barton River, but <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> below this point is dry, with its line occupied by a vegetable garden.|$|E
5|$|The route {{description}} {{has been}} split into two sections. From its source to Midhurst, the river has powered several mills, but has never been navigable. Below Midhurst, it was navigable until <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> closed in the 1880s. There were eight locks on this section, some of which bypassed additional water mills.|$|E

50|$|The Wey was {{the second}} river in England to be turned from wholly unnavigable to navigable for its main town, as it was behind the River Lea; <b>the</b> River Wey <b>Navigation</b> opened in 1653 with 12 locks between Weybridge and Guildford. Construction of <b>the</b> Godalming <b>Navigation,</b> a further four locks, was {{completed}} in 1764 connecting a second market town. Commercial traffic (save for exceptional loads for canalside buildings) ceased in 1983 and <b>the</b> Wey <b>Navigation</b> and <b>the</b> Godalming <b>Navigations</b> were donated to the National Trust in 1964 and 1968 respectively.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> current <b>navigation</b> of <b>the</b> River Thames {{replacing}} <b>the</b> old <b>navigation</b> to <b>the</b> {{east side}} of Osney Island, {{is believed to have}} been engineered by the canons of the Abbey to turn their mill.|$|R

5|$|With the {{prospects}} of a link between <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> and the Basingstoke Canal being constructed, the undertaking was valued at £24,000, and D'Arcy sold a half share in it to his agent, George Hollis. He then sold the other half to him, and moved to Ireland. Hollis became the sole proprietor from 1804, having bought out his sleeping partner. Throughout its life, <b>the</b> <b>navigation</b> had almost been a monopoly, but Hollis planned to end this, and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1802, {{to make it an}} open navigation, where anyone could use it on payment of the appropriate tolls. These were laid down in the Act, ending the setting of tolls by the Commissioners. The Act also specified that he had three years to put the river in order, which he appears to have achieved, since he then leased it to a group of merchants.|$|E
