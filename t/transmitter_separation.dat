Our earlier work proposed a natural spectrum sharing game for this problem and characterized the Nash equilibria {{as a function of}} the signal and interference distances, when the positions of the four nodes were assumed fixed. In this work, we derive i) the joint distribution of the interference distances conditioned on the <b>transmitter</b> <b>separation</b> distance, as well as ii) the unconditioned interference distance distribution when we place one transmitter at the origin and the second uniformly at random over a disk. This allows us to compute the distribution of the random Nash equilibria and random prices of anarchy and stability {{as a function of the}} random interference distances. We leverage the analysis to give an asymptotic expression for the coupling probability in a game where the transmitter positions form a (low density) Poisson process, which may be interpreted as the fraction of players essentially playing a two player game...|$|E
40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the identification of}} the available whitespace, i. e., the regions that are not covered by any of the existing transmitters, within a given geographical area. To this end, n sensors are deployed at random locations within the area. These sensors detect for the presence of a transmitter within their radio range r_s, and their individual decisions are combined to estimate the available whitespace. The limiting behavior of the recovered whitespace as a function of n and r_s is analyzed. It is shown that both the fraction of the available whitespace that the nodes fail to recover as well as their radio range both optimally scale as (n) /n as n gets large. The analysis is extended to the case of unreliable sensors, and it is shown that, surprisingly, the optimal scaling is still (n) /n even in this case. A related problem of estimating the number of transmitters and their locations is also analyzed, with the sum absolute error in localization as performance metric. The optimal scaling of the radio range and the necessary minimum <b>transmitter</b> <b>separation</b> is determined, that ensure that the sum absolute error in transmitter localization is minimized, with high probability, as n gets large. Finally, the optimal distribution of sensor deployment is determined, given the distribution of the transmitters, and the resulting performance benefit is characterized. Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} characterization of ultra wideband (UWB) outdoor channel over a frequency range of 3. 1 – 5. 3 GHz. Time domain measurements were conducted for line-of-sight scenarios. The acquired measurement data are characterized {{in terms of}} path-loss exponents, root mean square (RMS) delay spread, K-factor and channel capacity. Results show that the path-loss exponents range between 1. 4 and 2. 1 for the log-distance propagation model and the RMS delay spread {{was found to be}} between 1. 2 and 3. 4 ns. Different statistical distributions for the delay spread were also investigated. Results of the statistical analysis also show that the correlation between RMS delay spread and <b>transmitter</b> receiver <b>separation</b> distance is very low. The small-scale fading analysis indicated that UWB signals experience Rician fading, where the maximum value of K-factor is 11 dB...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ultra {{wide band}} (UWB) {{communication}} {{is expected to}} {{play a key role}} in next generation broad-band intra vehicle wireless applications. The car compartment differs significantly from other well studied indoor or outdoor environments. Hence, channel sounding experiments are crucial for gaining a thorough knowledge of the UWB signal propagation characteristics in such a medium. Time domain channel sounding campaigns often employ some sort of deconvolution during measurement post processing as the measured signal in these experiments is the convolution of the channel response and the probing pulse which violates the Nyquist criterion. In this paper, a comparison of two variants of time-domain serial subtractive decon-volution algorithm, popularly known as CLEAN, is presented. Appropriate statistical metrics for assessing the relative merit of a deconvolution technique are identified in the context of intra vehicle UWB transmis-sion, and the better algorithm is selected based on its performance over a standard IEEE channel simulation testbed. The chosen method is then applied to extract power delay profile and delay parameters from an empirical time domain sounding experiment performed inside a passenger car. The effects of passenger occupancy, <b>transmitter</b> receiver <b>separation,</b> and absence of direct transmission path are studied...|$|R

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 This {{research}} {{involves the}} numerical modelling of electromagnetic wave propagation, (1) {{to calculate the}} electric and magnetic fields {{at any point in}} a hallway for a known transmitter and receiver antenna pattern and orientation and (2) to determine the wave normal direction of the electromagnetic wave using the electric fields calculated in (1). The results of the numerical simulation are compared with measurements for two hallways. Both the transmitter and receiver employ vertically oriented / 4 dipoles operating at 2. 4 GHz. Our work has led to the following new results: (1) The calculated signal power varies as 1 /r² whereas the measured data varies as 1 /r¹·⁴, where r is the <b>transmitter</b> receiver <b>separation</b> distance, (2) The temporal clustering of calculated multipath arrival times qualitatively agrees with the Saleh-Valenzuela model [1987], (3) For an SNR of 0 dB, the standard deviation of the error in the DOA estimate for the direct path signal is 2 ̃° and 4 ̃ ̊for the azimuth and elevation angles respectively.

40|$|Pure tone sound {{absorption}} coefficients were measured at 1 / 12 octave intervals from 4 to 100 KHz at 5. 5 K temperature intervals between 255. 4 and 310. 9 K and at 10 percent relative humidity increments between 0 percent and saturation {{in a large}} cylindrical tube (i. d., 25. 4 cm; length, 4. 8 m). Special solid-dielectric capacitance transducers, one to generate bursts of sound waves and one to terminate the sound path and detect the tone bursts, were constructed to fit inside the tube. The absorption was measured by varying the <b>transmitter</b> receiver <b>separation</b> from 1 to 4 m and observing the decay of multiple reflections or change in amplitude of the first received burst. The resulting absorption was compared with that from a proposed procedure for computing {{sound absorption}} in still air. Absorption of bands of noise was numerically computed by using the pure tone results. The results depended on spectrum shape, on filter type, and nonlinearly on propagation distance. For some of the cases considered, comparison with the extrapolation of ARP- 866 A showed a difference {{as large as a}} factor of 2. However, for many cases, the absorption for a finite band was nearly equal to the pure tone absorption at the center frequency of the band. A recommended prediction procedure is described for 1 / 3 octave band absorption coefficients...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transmission}} of two correlated and memoryless sources (U,V) over several multiple-user phase asynchronous channels. Namely, we consider a class of phase-incoherent multiple access relay channels (MARC) with both non-causal and causal unidirectional cooperation between encoders, referred to as phase-incoherent unidirectional non-causal cooperative MARC (PI-UNCC-MARC), and phase-incoherent unidirectional causal cooperative MARC (PI-UCC-MARC) respectively. We also consider phase-incoherent interference channels (PI-IC), and interference relay channel (PI-IRC) models in the same context. In all cases, the input signals are assumed to undergo non-ergodic phase shifts due to the channel. The shifts {{are assumed to be}} unknown to the transmitters and known to the receivers as a realistic assumption. Both necessary and sufficient conditions in order to reliably send the correlated sources to the destinations over the considered channels are derived. In particular, for all of the channel models, we first derive an outer bound for reliable communication that is defined with respect to the source entropy content (i. e., the triple (H(U|V),H(V|U),H(U,V))). Then, using separate source and channel coding, under specific gain conditions, we establish the same region as the inner bound and therefore obtain tight conditions for reliable communication for the specific channel under study. We thus establish a source-channel separation theorem for each channel and conclude that without the knowledge of the phase shifts at the <b>transmitter</b> sides, <b>separation</b> is optimal. It is further conjectured that separation in general is optimal for all channel coefficients. Comment: submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theor...|$|R
40|$|Indoor use of {{wireless}} systems poses {{one of the}} biggest design challenges. It is difficult to predict the propagation of a radio frequency wave in an indoor environment. To assist in deploying the above systems, characterization of the indoor radio propagation channel is essential. The contributions of this work are two-folds. First, in order to build a model, extensive field strength measurements are carried out inside two different buildings. Then, path loss exponents from log-distance path loss model and standard deviations from log-normal shadowing, which statistically describe the path loss models for a different <b>transmitter</b> receiver <b>separations</b> and scenarios, are determined. The {{purpose of this study is}} to characterize the indoor channel for 802. 11 wireless local area networks at 2. 4 GHz frequency. This thesis presents a channel model based on measurements conducted in commonly found scenarios in buildings. These scenarios include closed corridor, open corridor, classroom, and computer lab. Path loss equations are determined using log-distance path loss model and log-normal shadowing. The chi-square test statistic values for each access point are calculated to prove that the observed fading is a normal distribution at 5 % significance level. Finally, the propagation models from the two buildings are compared to validate the generated equations.

The system employs a planar near-field scanning set-up for characterizing defects in composite panels in the 50 &#x 2013; 67 GHz band, {{and can be}} considered as a complementary diagnostic tool for non-destructive testing purposes. The introduced algorithms are based on the reconstruction of the illuminating source at the <b>transmitter,</b> enabling a <b>separation</b> of the sampled signal with respect to the location of its potential sources&#x 003 B; the scatterers within the device under test or the transmitter. For the second algorithm, a L 1 -minimization problem formulation is introduced that enables compressive sensing techniques to be adapted for image retrieval. The algorithms are benchmarked against a more conventional imaging technique, based on the Fourier Transform, and it is seen that the complete imaging system provides increased dynamic range, improved resolution and reduced measurement time by removal of a reference measurement. Moreover, the system provides stable image quality over a range of frequencies...|$|R
40|$|UWB {{is a major}} {{research}} area {{in the field of}} wireless communication. The IEEE 802. 15. 3 a has been assigned the job of standardizing it. It is being considered as a breakthrough technology capable enough to revolutionize short range wireless communication. Ultra wideband communication as its name implies has large absolute bandwidth greater than 500 MHz and operating frequency band is 3. 1 GHz- 10. 6 GHz. It is a rapidly growing technology that plays a very promising role in modern age wireless communication. It finds application in various sectors, for example in medical application to observe the status of patient using wireless health monitoring of life sustaining systems. In vehicular technology it can be used for obstacle avoidance and fast data transmission, and in military application as radar for detection behind walls and other blockages. Since it is based on short pulse carrier less transmission so hardware implementation becomes less complex and cheap. Thesis work has been done to study the BPSK modulation based DS-UWB communication system. Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technique along with UWB signal and two types of equalization techniques has been incorporated to mitigate the multipath fading effect associated with S-V indoor channel. Rake receiver has been used to utilize the energy of various delayed multipath components to improve the performance of the system. In short range communication process, indoor channel model or UWB channel model has been studied with different <b>transmitter</b> receiver <b>separation,</b> using some fundamental parameters of channel. Inter symbol interference (ISI) is a major problem in frequency selective fading channels, to overcome this problem, RAKE-MMSE equalizer and single carrier frequency domain equalizer (SC-FDE) have been incorporated.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} location estimation based {{power control}} strategy for cellular radio systems via a location based interference management scheme. Our approach considers the carrier-to-interference as {{dependent on the}} <b>transmitter</b> and receiver <b>separation</b> distance and therefore an accurate estimation of the precise locations can provide the power critical mobile user to control the transition power accordingly. In this fully distributed algorithms, we propose using a Robust Extended Kalman Filter (REKF) to derive {{an estimate of the}} mobile user’s closest mobile base station from the user’s location, heading and altitude. Our analysis demonstrates that this algorithm can successfully track the mobile users with less system complexity, as it requires measurements from only one or two closest mobile base stations and hence enable the user to transmit at the rate that is sufficient for the interference management. Our power control algorithms based on this estimation converges to the desired power trajectory. Further, the technique is robust against system uncertainties caused by the inherent deterministic nature of the mobility model. Through simulation, we show the accuracy of our prediction algorithm and the simplicity of its implementation. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Playa {{wetlands}} in the Rainwater Basin area {{in south-central}} Nebraska perform the important functions of protecting water quality by trapping and filtering sediments and other pollutants, {{but they are}} highly vulnerable to the culturally accelerated sediment accumulation from the surrounding watershed. Culturally accelerated accumulation of sediment will overwhelm playa wetlands in many respects by reducing wetland volume and altering the hydro-period of wetlands, and subsequently decrease their value as biotic habitats. This study aims to use EM 38 -MK 2 to map sediment vertical depth to Bt (clay) layer for the hydric soil footprints at 93 publicly-managed wetland watersheds to determine if electromagnetic induction (EMI) technique {{can be used as}} a technique to more efficiently detect the depth of sediment to Bt layer, and to generalize sediment accumulation conditions in the 93 publicly-managed playa wetlands in Nebraska Rainwater Basin area. At each site, the sample data with three replicates was taken with the EM 38 -MK 2 in both east-west and north-south directions in vertical mode with <b>transmitter</b> receiver coil <b>separation</b> at 1 meter within certain hydric soil type. The EM data were processed using Interpex Limited 1 X 1 Dv 3 inversion software to generate one dimensional conductivity versus depth profiles, and the depth of sediment to Bt layer can be derived from the inversion results. The results in this research indicate that the depth of sediment in all 279 sites ranged from 21. 00 to 78. 00 cm, and the average of sedimentation accumulation is 39. 00 cm. The annual average depth of sedimentation ratio is 0. 26 cm/year. This project can fill the critical knowledge gap about the vertical profile of playa wetland sediments, and future wetland restoration plans can be developed based on the results of this research.

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2002 seismic and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were {{conducted}} at a Maya ruin site in northwestern Belize, Central America. The 2002 field season was initiated {{with the purpose of}} non-invasively exploring the Ma’ax Na site and assisting archaeologists in focusing excavation activities. This paper describes the GPR surveys carried out over several caves and over one of the plazas at Ma’ax Na. The GPR lines were acquired using Sensors & Software Inc. ’s Noggin ® and Smart Cart ® monostatic system with an antenna frequency of 250 MHz and a <b>transmitter</b> and receiver <b>separation</b> of 27. 94 cm. Most areas had loose soils and forest debris overlying rubble or competent carbonates. Preliminary analysis of the reflection data gives velocities from 0. 072 m/ns (for a depth of 1 m) to 0. 106 m/ns (for a depth of 0. 7 m). Based on our measured velocities, the dielectric permittivity of soil and limestone is 8 and 16 respectively. The data were processed using filtering, deconvolution, velocity analysis, and migration algorithms. Refinement of the processing flow is ongoing. Using the velocity values determined during acquisition, we estimate that the maximum reflection depth is between 1 and 3 metres. A good comparison between two reversed lines indicates that the method provides repeatable results. The cave project provided reasonable imaging of these cavities and indicated the applicability of the method in a carbonate environment. The depth of penetration of the GPR for the plaza lines is about 1. 8 m. Resolution based on a velocity of 0. 072 m/ns and the antennae frequency of 250 Mz is approximately 8 cm. The plaza project results showed reasonable quality records with good signal penetration. Surficial discontinuities (roots) and anomalous buried features were identified. Excellent ties between intersecting plaza lines inspired confidence in the acquisition method. Modeling of the GPR based on changes in the property of dielectric permittivity revealed a good correlation between the synthetic radargram and the GPR record...|$|R
40|$|This report {{outlines}} the multipath fading phenomenon {{and its relationship}} to wireless system design. The work was conducted for the academic year of 1996. This report provides the reader with an insight into the phenomenon called fading and its relevance when designing wireless systems. Fading is an important consideration when wireless systems are to be designed. Because fading is very unpredictable and it cannot to totally eliminated in a wireless system, systems engineers have a hard time trying to design and commission efficient communication systems for a particular environment. Over the years, there has been a existing need worldwide to design wireless systems which perform efficiently under fading conditions which is introduced into the propagation channel. As Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) and Wireless Private Branch Exchanges (WPBX) have become increasingly popular, along with a whole other range of wireless systems such as Personal Communication Systems and cellular systems, the need to provide effective and efficient systems which perform well under fading conditions and also other conditions which degrade a system, has been the utmost challenge faced by systems and communications engineers. With all this research going into designing efficient systems for communication being conducted worldwide, when the opportunity was presented by my supervisor to conduct similar research into indoor wireless systems within the microwave region. I was very excited as to the prospect of conducting research in these field of interest. This report {{outlines the}} background theory, which the reader will find most helpful and then presents the measurements conducted, and finally the results and analysis of the conducted measurements and its important relationship to wireless systems design within the ISM band of 2. 4 to 2. 5 GHz. This study investigates the various aspects of fading which affect a wireless channel under the introduction of controlled motion for a set measurement period. The empirical data base consists of twenty five 20 second recordings of the continuos wave envelope fading waveforms with both antennas in a stationary position. Measurements were conducted in a cluttered laboratory setting at 2. 4 GHz with two quarter wave monopole antennas with <b>transmitter</b> and receiver <b>separation</b> ranging from 2 to 5 meters. Effects of controlled degrees of motion with 2 individuals walking briskly around the antennas was investigated.

These results and statistical analysis can be used in designing wireless computer communication applications, such as WLAN 2 ̆ 7 s and also the results can be used to simulate wireless channels which use intelligent antenna systems to reduce fading...|$|R
