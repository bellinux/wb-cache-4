5|$|Dams, weirs {{and other}} instream {{barriers}} block {{the migration of}} adult and juvenile Murray cod and prevent recolonisation of habitats and maintenance of isolated populations. Additionally, recent study has proven approximately 50% of Murray cod larvae are killed when <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> through undershot weirs.|$|E
5|$|Highway416 crosses {{under the}} Prescott Highway a second time; to the north, the two remain roughly {{parallel}} but separated as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> through {{a mix of}} farmland and forest. South {{of the community of}} Kemptville, the Prescott Highway crosses the route a third time, with an interchange connecting the two highways.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>passed</b> by hills, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> by mountains, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through valleys, {{leaving behind}} them thick forests, and fields covered with flowers; and at length {{they reached the}} court of the over-lord.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>passed</b> {{the next}} {{mile and a}} half swiftly and smoothly; yet among the many things which <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> in the course of it was a clump of eager policemen {{standing}} at a cross-road. As <b>they</b> <b>passed,</b> one of the policemen shouted something to the others; but nothing else happened. Eight hundred yards farther on, Turnbull stood up suddenly in the swaying car.|$|R

5|$|Like all ants, banded sugar ants begin life as eggs. If the egg is fertilised, the ant {{becomes a}} female; if not, {{it will become}} a male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> through a larval and pupal stage before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, {{it becomes a}} haploid male. They develop through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> through larval and pupal stages before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|Most {{visitors}} {{approach the}} temple as they ascend a stairway, roofs of which provide shelter to {{a multitude of}} shops selling souvenirs and other - mostly secular - commodities. <b>They</b> <b>pass</b> by a so-called Liberation Pond, following the Buddhist tradition of merit-making, turtles may be released into freedom, albeit a limited one.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>passed</b> {{through the}} hall and into the main chamber where the altar piece was, and the {{kneeling}} places. The Speaker scarcely glanced at the altar as <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> by. He pushed open a small side door and beckoned Conger through.|$|R
50|$|The lamia chased after them. <b>They</b> <b>passed</b> a {{field and}} the lamia {{asked if they had}} seen anyone; they {{answered}} only that they were planting beans. Or, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> a mouse that gave answers about what it had been doing, not what it saw, until several questions in.|$|R

5|$|According to FN, the 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} has {{an effective}} range of 200m (219yd) {{and a maximum}} range of 1,800m (1,969yd) when fired from the P90, and an effective range of 50m (55yd) and a maximum range of 1,510m (1,651yd) when fired from the Five-seven. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> through ballistic gelatin and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, {{and it is a}} subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{it passed}} {{perihelion}} on April 1, 1997 the comet {{developed into a}} spectacular sight. It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius, and its dust tail stretched 40–45 degrees across the sky. The comet was visible well before the sky got fully dark each night, and while many great comets {{are very close to}} the Sun as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> perihelion, comet Hale–Bopp was visible all night to northern hemisphere observers.|$|E
5|$|As the {{trunkline}} heads {{away from}} Bay City, it runs {{parallel to the}} Lake State Railway again. M-13 intersects {{the northern end of}} its connector route before Huron Road crosses the Kawkawlin River. The highway runs through the community of the same name {{on the north side of}} the river. M-13 and Huron Road continue north across mixed agricultural and forest land as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> through the communities of Linwood and Pinconning. South of Standish in Arenac County, M-13 meets the northern end of the US23 freeway and terminates.|$|E
60|$|On the way <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> mine after mine, and {{the boys}} were much {{interested}} in watching {{the process of getting}} out ore, and also {{in the work of the}} huge quartz-crushers. Whenever <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> a mine there would be sure to be somebody to wave a friendly hand to Tom Dillon.|$|R

5|$|The Doctor, Amy, River, and Father Octavian and his {{surviving}} clerics {{escape the}} approaching Weeping Angels when the Doctor destroys the gravity globe illuminating the cave they are in, {{allowing them to}} jump up into the gravity well of the crashed starship Byzantium. They scramble inside as the Angels start to follow, and the Doctor directs the group to the ship's oxygen factory, a forest contained within the ship. As <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> the primary control room, the Doctor notices a familiar crack in its wall, leaking time energy that the Angels are being drawn to.|$|E
5|$|The low-lying damp ground {{can produce}} a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana when the Tor appears to rise out of the mist. This optical {{phenomenon}} occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed. The Italian term Fata Morgana {{is derived from the}} name of Morgan le Fay, a powerful sorceress in Arthurian legend.|$|E

5|$|The toll {{portion of}} SR 133 employs a barrier toll system, where drivers are charged {{flat-rate}} tolls {{based on what}} particular toll booths <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> through. Tolls are collected at selected on- and off-ramps; and at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza, which spans the on-and off-ramps to Northbound SR 241 (traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs Toll Plaza located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133/241 interchange).|$|E
5|$|Tourette's {{is defined}} {{as part of a}} {{spectrum}} of tic disorders, which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> through adolescence. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is a rarity; tics are often unnoticed by casual observers.|$|E
5|$|When {{operating}} a full circle route, trains start through the Common Tunnel. If running clockwise, <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> {{through all the}} common stations (Tøyen, Grønland, Jernbanetorget, Stortinget, Nationaltheatret and Majorstuen). They head north on the Sognsvann Line, stopping at Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion. The Ring Line proper then splits off, and the trains serve Nydalen, Storo and Sinsen, before Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line. After that, the trains again enter the Common Tunnel at Tøyen.|$|E

5|$|With the plane, {{they land}} {{on an island}} which has the source for every dirty joke ever made, the base looks similar to a temple-compound from the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. The base is {{inhabited}} with many great minds including Warren Buffett (who was in a deleted scene on the DVD), Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking where <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> their time writing the world's dirty jokes.

5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud. Later, <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, {{as well as the}} fact that it is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Back in South Park, Chef rallies {{the townspeople}} (in {{a parody of}} Braveheart) to fight the genetically {{engineered}} turkeys; humorously, one of the turkeys also rallies the other turkeys to fight the townspeople. A massive battle ensues in which Kenny is killed (his eye is poked and gouged out), but eventually the South Park residents kill all the turkeys and claim victory. The FBI returns Cartman to South Park and takes Marvin home, but not before he brings {{the bodies of the}} dead turkeys back to Ethiopia for everyone to eat. Marvin is then hailed as a hero by his people while <b>they</b> <b>pass</b> Struthers being bound and gagged over a fire.|$|E
