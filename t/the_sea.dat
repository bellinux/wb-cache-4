5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> otter (Enhydra) lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately two mya, giving rise to the now-extinct †Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. <b>The</b> <b>sea</b> otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 mya, respectively, <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> otter is a relative newcomer to marine life. In some respects though, <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.|$|E

5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} of <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> gave rise to many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish lurking in the deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials when the body was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set adrift on <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive {{to the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E

5|$|The role of <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> {{in human}} {{culture has been}} {{important}} for centuries, as people experience <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous. Human responses to <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> {{can be found in}} artforms including literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> Symbolically, <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology.

5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} back down to <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> It {{has been shown that}} this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> up the beach.

5|$|Among the Ainu, the otter {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger between humans and the creator. <b>The</b> <b>sea</b> otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.|$|E

5|$|British and French {{submarine}} {{operations in}} <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Marmara {{were the one}} significant area of success of the Gallipoli Campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels {{at a cost of}} eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Marmara. During the campaign there was always one British submarine in <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region. E2 left <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.|$|E
