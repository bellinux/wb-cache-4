25|$|An {{alternative}} to surgical crown lengthening is orthodontic forced eruption, it is non-invasive, does not remove or damage {{the bone and}} can be cost effective. The tooth is extruded a couple of millimeters with simple bracketing of adjacent teeth and using light forces this will only <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months. A fiberotomy is performed after crown lengthening and is easily performed by the general dentist. In many cases {{such as this one}} shown, surgery and extraction may be avoided if patient is treated orthodontically rather than periodontally.|$|E
25|$|Mueller {{increasingly}} {{believed that}} {{to move up}} {{in the hierarchy of}} the Labs he would need a PhD, and he began working towards this goal on a part-time basis at Princeton University, getting up every morning at around 5 o'clock and driving to Princeton to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> courses before driving back down to Holmdel to work all day at Bell Labs. In 1946 a colleague at the Labs, Milton Boone, a professor from Ohio State University on leave at Bell Labs during the war, encouraged Mueller to help set up a vacuum tube lab and run the communications group at Ohio State.|$|E
25|$|One of nine {{changes to}} the {{starting}} eleven, Redmond produced an outstanding performance as Birmingham outclassed Maribor in the last group stage fixture. Apart from Jovan Vidović's early header that went wide, the attacking play was all Birmingham's. After 24 minutes, Rooney scored his first European goal, a close-range header from a Redmond cross, then Žigić failed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> chances, Davies failed {{to make contact with}} a Redmond corner when {{it would have been easier}} to score, and Redmond himself hit a half-volley against the post from distance. His marker, Arghus, was perhaps fortunate to escape a red card for a high tackle born of frustration. But ten-man Braga could only draw with Brugge, so Birmingham's ten points were not enough.|$|E

[...] His comments proved prophetic, as soon afterwards Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being [...] "more popular than Jesus" [...] embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and subpar performances proved to be their last.

500|$|In 1854, Maxwell {{graduated}} from Trinity {{with a degree}} in mathematics. He scored second highest in the final examination, coming behind Edward Routh and earning himself the title of Second Wrangler. He was later declared equal with Routh in the more exacting ordeal of the Smith's Prize examination. Immediately after earning his degree, Maxwell read his paper [...] "On the Transformation of Surfaces by Bending" [...] to the Cambridge Philosophical Society. This {{is one of the few}} purely mathematical papers he had written, demonstrating Maxwell's growing stature as a mathematician. Maxwell decided to remain at Trinity after graduating and applied for a fellowship, which was a process that he could expect to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years. Buoyed by his success as a research student, he would be free, apart from some tutoring and examining duties, to pursue scientific interests at his own leisure.|$|E

Sharp digressed, [...] "o be honest it isn't the most accessible of films and for those unfamiliar with Suzuki's unorthodox and seemingly disjointed style it will probably <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> viewings before the bare bones of the plot begin to emerge." [...] As Zorn has put it, [...] "plot and narrative devices {{take a back seat to}} mood, music, and the sensuality of visual images." [...] Japanese film historian Donald Richie thus encapsulated the film, [...] "An inventive and ultimately anarchic take on gangster thrillers. [...] script flounders midway and Suzuki tries on the bizarre for its own sake." [...] David Chute conceded that in labeling the film incomprehensible, [...] "f you consider the movie soberly, it's hard to deny the bosses had a point". On a conciliatory note, Rayns commented, [...] "Maybe the break with Nikkatsu was inevitable; it's hard to see how Suzuki could have gone further in the genre than this." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{his brief}} stay in Pittsburgh, the Pirates sent Clarke to Greenville in 1920. He played next for Toledo and Winston-Salem, {{and then for}} the Reading Aces in the International League during the 1922 and 1923 seasons. In 1924, he played for both Reading and Harrisburg. [...] In 1925, he played for the Salisbury Indians in the Eastern Shore League. In the spring of 1925, The Sporting News wrote: [...] "Nig Clarke not only led the league with the bat and the mitt and the arm, he was the very picture of a {{baseball}} player. I rather suspect that Nig put away as much corn juice as the next man. In the days of his greatness he was wont to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> snifters every morning before breakfast. Never seemed to hurt Nig any."

500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing.

[...] Stan Hey of The Mail on Sunday observed that on the strength of the opening episode, the series' success seemed [...] "fairly assured". He noted that: [...] "characters are only skin–deep as yet, being subsidiary to the plot, but a successful graft should be achieved during the series." [...] Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record praised the casting of French and Griffin, writing: [...] "It will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> episodes before both actors shake off their soapy history, but with some decent plots and good lines, they should make the grade." [...] Morgan deemed Irving the star of the show, and commented: [...] "With Irving in the driving seat, Holby City looks like it is on the right track." ...|$|E

500|$|The urethra and vagina of {{the female}} spotted hyena exit through the clitoris, {{allowing}} the females to urinate, copulate and give birth through this organ. This trait makes mating more laborious for the male than in other mammals, and also makes attempts to sexually coerce (physically force sexual activity on) females futile. Joan Roughgarden, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist, said that because the hyena's clitoris is higher on the belly than the vagina in most mammals, the male hyena [...] "must slide his rear under the female when mating so that his penis lines up with [...] ". In an action similar to pushing up a shirtsleeve, the [...] "female retracts the [...] on itself, and creates an opening into which the male inserts his own penis". The male must practice this act, which can <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months to successfully perform. Female spotted hyenas exposed to larger doses of androgen have significantly damaged ovaries, {{making it difficult to}} conceive. After giving birth, the pseudo-penis is stretched and loses much of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips. Approximately 15% {{of the female}}s die during their first time giving birth, and over 60% of their species' firstborn young die.|$|E

[...] After every game, Boros had pitch-by-pitch data fed into a mainframe computer at Digital Equipment Corporation in Philadelphia. He would retrieve the data before the next game, analyzing how each pitcher and hitter matched up. Jay Alves, a [...] "sabermetrician" [...] hired by Boros to run the computer system, later recalled: [...] "With Steve, we tracked (on paper) virtually every pitch and where it was hit.

2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again.

I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract.
