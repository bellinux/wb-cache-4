5|$|The {{next section}} accuses <b>the</b> <b>Dissenters</b> of {{involvement}} with various notorious and hideous {{events of the}} past century, including the English Civil War and Monmouth's Rebellion. The accusations become increasingly sinister, and at points the speaker directly addresses <b>the</b> <b>Dissenters</b> ("You have butchered one King! deposed another King! and made a Mock King of a third!"). A brief history is given of how past monarchs—from James I to William III—have treated the Dissenters; in the opinion of the speaker, it is too leniently.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dissenters</b> {{proposed}} Robert Webb, who {{had previously}} served as the member for Taunton from 1747 until the general election in 1754, to fill the vacancy. The recent history of the elections in Taunton suggested that no opposition would be offered: the last contested election had been in 1741. That however proved {{not to be the}} case, and a group of Tories put forward their own candidate, Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet of Shute in Devon. Webb did not want the expense of a contested election, and withdrew, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Dissenters</b> without a candidate. Unable to find a suitable candidate, <b>the</b> <b>Dissenters</b> appealed to Lord Egremont to locate someone to stand for the Whiggish interest. The Mayor, Henry Manly, was sent to London to meet with the Whig Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, to try and secure a candidate. Manly reported that the Duke of Newcastle did not want the seat to go to a Tory, and was willing to fund the election from the secret service account (more accurately the King's private money, a fund which was not accountable to Parliament). Eventually, through communication with both Lord Egremont and the Duke of Newcastle, Robert Maxwell came forward as the Whig candidate. Maxwell offered to spend up to £3,000 on the election, in addition to the money promised from the secret service fund.|$|E
5|$|During Tkach's tenure, {{the changes}} that he {{implemented}} stirred much controversy and significant dissent among those who continued to follow Armstrong's theology. <b>The</b> <b>dissenters</b> labeled the changes as heresy and many left to form new church organizations. Within the mainstream Christian community, some have hailed Tkach's reforms, which brought a church from the fringe to orthodoxy, as unprecedented.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} federal statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices {{in the majority}} were Catholic, whereas <b>the</b> <b>dissenters</b> were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia {{to such an extent}} that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day {{celebrating the}} end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with {{supplies}} for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past {{the end of}} their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. One man was hit about the head with the butt of a pistol and <b>the</b> <b>dissenters</b> were dispersed into small groups and reassigned to various units in the infantry division; the 52nd (Lowland) Division.|$|E
5|$|The Shortest Way {{with the}} Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church is a {{pamphlet}} consisting of twenty-nine pages. It opens with the fable of the Cock and the Horses. The Cock, lacking any perch in the stable, {{is forced to}} rest on the ground and in fear of the Horses moving around and stepping on him, advises: “Pray, Gentlefolks! let us stand still! for fear we should tread upon one another!” The speaker then applies this to the contemporary situation, with the Cock representing <b>the</b> <b>Dissenters.</b>|$|E
50|$|Direct action {{tries to}} silence <b>the</b> <b>dissenter</b> via factors or {{influences}} in a forthright manner, often coercive. Indirect action tries to silence <b>the</b> <b>dissenter</b> via intervening factors or influences, {{but not in}} a forthright manner. Self-censorship occurs when individuals are concerned about risking their employment status, standing in an academic course and/or ability to live without threat. It is a social action. Some dissenters fear direct actions taken against them. Self-censorship makes direct and indirect suppression unnecessary.|$|R
40|$|Copying the {{majority}} is generally an adaptive social learning strategy but {{the majority}} does not always know best. Previous work has demonstrated young children’s selective uptake of information from a consensus over a lone <b>dissenter.</b> <b>The</b> current study examined children’s flexibility in following the majority: do they overextend their reliance on this heuristic to situations where the dissenting individual has privileged knowledge and should be trusted instead? Four- to six- year-olds (N = 103) heard conflicting claims about the identity of hidden drawings from a majority and a dissenter in two between-subject conditions: in one, <b>the</b> <b>dissenter</b> had privileged knowledge over the majority (he drew the pictures); in the other he did not (they were drawn by an absent third party). Overall, children {{were less likely to}} trust the majority in <b>the</b> Privileged <b>Dissenter</b> condition. Moreover, 5 - and 6 - year-olds made majority-based inferences when <b>the</b> <b>dissenter</b> had no privileged knowledge but systematically endorsed <b>the</b> <b>dissenter</b> when he drew the pictures. The current findings suggest that by 5 years, children are able to make an epistemic-based judgment {{to decide whether or not}} to follow the majority rather than automatically following the most common view...|$|R

5|$|In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again {{tried to}} repeal the Test and Corporation Acts. Although {{initially}} {{it looked as if}} they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, {{one of the most effective}} and popular media of the time, skewered <b>the</b> <b>Dissenters</b> and Priestley. In Parliament, William Pitt and Edmund Burke argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of Letters to William Pitt and Letters to Burke in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Lennon {{had been}} a shock for Harry, as Lennon often dressed like a Teddy boy, and was a {{disruptive}} influence at the college. Despite his misgivings about Lennon, Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe, who was a small, softly-spoken and shy student, who had painted a portrait of Harry. The three often spent time together at the Ye Cracke pub in Rice Street, or {{on the top floor}} of the Jacaranda club (run by Williams, who later managed the Beatles). Harry met his then 16-year-old future wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the club. Harry, Lennon, Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960. Having been disappointed with Ellis' performance, Harry proposed the idea that they should call the assembled quartet of friends <b>the</b> <b>Dissenters,</b> and make Liverpool famous: Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings, Harry's writing and Lennon's music.|$|E
5|$|Once Birmingham Dissenters {{started to}} agitate for {{the repeal of}} the Test and Corporation Acts, which {{restricted}} Dissenters' civil rights (preventing them, for instance, from attending the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or from holding public office), the semblance of unity among the town's elite disappeared. Unitarians such as Priestley were {{at the forefront of the}} repeal campaign, and orthodox Anglicans grew nervous and angry. After 1787, the emergence of Dissenting groups formed for the sole purpose of overturning these laws began to divide the community; however, the repeal efforts failed in 1787, 1789, and 1790. Priestley's support of the repeal and his heterodox religious views, which were widely published, inflamed the populace. In February 1790, a group of activists came together not only to oppose the interests of <b>the</b> <b>Dissenters</b> but also to counteract what they saw as the undesirable importation of French Revolutionary ideals. Dissenters by and large supported the French Revolution and its efforts to question the role monarchy should play in government.|$|E

5|$|Scalia {{maintained}} that every element of {{an offense that}} helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a hate crime. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because {{whether it was a}} hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington, striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. <b>The</b> <b>dissenters</b> in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in Mistretta), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in United States v. Booker, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} for Defoe's contemporaries in assessing whether {{the work was}} ironic was {{the proximity of the}} speaker's voice to that of the High Anglicans whose views are being ridiculed. The pamphlet mixes both real observation and fabrication, and assumes the rhetorical style of his target. Defoe uses and imitates the language and metaphor of fanatical churchman, particularly Sacheverell's sermons; the speaker's comparison of <b>the</b> <b>Dissenters</b> to vipers is one that Sacheverell often made. Although The Shortest Way does not parody the genre of the Anglican sermon, it does deploy some of the same structures; the initial Aesopic fable of the Cock and the Horses is expanded upon in a way that parallels the use of a biblical quotation to initiate a sermon.|$|E
5|$|In 1679 a {{group of}} Covenanters killed Archbishop Sharp. The {{incident}} led to a rising that grew to 5,000 men. They were defeated by forces under James, Duke of Monmouth, the King's illegitimate son, at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. Two ministers were executed and 250 followers shipped to Barbados, 200 drowning when their ship went down off Orkney. The rebellion {{eventually led to the}} fall of Lauderdale, who was replaced by the King's brother, the openly Catholic James, known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany. <b>The</b> <b>dissenters,</b> led by Donald Cargill and Richard Cameron called themselves the Society People, but would be become known after their leader as the Cameronians. Reduced in number, hiding out in the moors, they became increasingly radical. On 22 June 1680, the Sanquhar Declaration was posted in Sanquhar, renouncing Charles II as king. Cameron was killed the next month. Cargill excommunicated the King, Duke of Albany and other royalists at the Torwood Conventicle and his followers now separated themselves from all other Presbyterian ministers. Cargill was captured and executed in May 1681.|$|E

50|$|While the Anglican catacombs were {{a popular}} place for interment, those below <b>the</b> <b>Dissenter's</b> chapel {{remained}} largely empty. With {{the rise of}} the cremation movement the Cemetery Company identified this as a new source of revenue, and chose to rebuild part of the Dissenters' chapel in 1915 as a crematorium with access from the main hall or/and from the west. A Tousoil Fradet & Cie gas cremator was installed in the crematorium hall, with its regenerator installed in a vacant portion of the catacombs below. A short length of track led from the hall into the crematorium for the use of a metal 'introducer' bier. This furnace was augmented {{over the next few years}} by two more cremators, designed by the cemetery superintendent Lockwood and the engineering company of Youngs. This equipment was located entirely underground, and utilised the original Bramah hydraulic lift of the catacombs to lower the coffin, where a 'marshalling yard' of narrow gauge railway track allowed the bier to be moved to the correct furnace. After <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>Dissenter's</b> chapel was rebuilt in a more modern style as a crematorium, recordia and columbarium over <b>the</b> <b>dissenter's</b> catacombs and furnaces. Its equipment has been updated several times, and it cremators are still used on a daily basis.|$|R
