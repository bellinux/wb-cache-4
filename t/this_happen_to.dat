At the end of the coup, Nhung - having shot Colonel Lê Quang Tung, the loyalist {{commander}} of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces at a grave at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base the day before - executed Diệm and his brother Ngô Đình Nhu. An investigation led by General Trần Văn Đôn, another coup plotter, determined that Nhung had repeatedly stabbed and shot the Ngô brothers while escorting them back to military headquarters after having arrested them. In a 1994 interview, [...] recalled, [...] "Nhu (Diem's brother) was alive when they put the knife in to take out some of the organs.....the gallbladder. And in the Orient when you are a big soldier, big man-this thing is very important.... They do it against Nhu when Nhu was alive..... And Diem had <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him, and later on they kill him by pistol and rifle. It was widely believed that Minh had ordered Nhung to execute the Ngô brothers. Following Nguyễn Khánh's successful January 1964 coup against Minh's military junta, Nhung died in mysterious circumstances, the only rebel fatality in the regime change.|$|E

2500|$|After {{failing to}} reach the semifinals at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3–0 {{on a tour of}} Australia and then 2–0 at home to South Africa.

Ganguly was {{appointed}} the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman Ajay Jadeja were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as [...] "the Indian cricket's worst hour".

2500|$|After {{separating}} from Gordon, Jackson cloistered {{herself in}} her home and lived alone for the first time—the first six months she stated she never actually left her house due to being terrified of Gordon seeing her. Weary after her years of public scorn, she didn't {{know what to do}} with her life and was afraid to perform again. Jackson struggled to rebuild her confidence but was plagued with self-doubt, explaining, [...] "I got to the point, [...] where—well, you know in the media they say things like, 'Oh, she can't sing. She has no talent. She can't dance.' I started believing that, and I was thinking, 'Oh my God'. And I started thinking, 'Oh gee, how could <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> me?'

After this time she started to perform in Europe and South America occasionally to start making money to pay off the huge debts which Gordon had accumulated in her name while they were married. In the wake of the September 11 attacks Jackson was moved to compose [...] "Free the World". She performed the song for friends to a positive reception. This spurred on Jackson to write more songs, ending up with a full album, Startin' Over.|$|E

2500|$|PTSD is {{an anxiety}} {{disorder}} caused {{by exposure to}} a terrifying event or ordeal involving the occurrence or threat of physical harm. [...] It {{is one of the}} most severe and well-known of the different types of psychological trauma, mostly due to its prevalence in war veterans. [...] As mentioned above, the stress of PTSD can have severe effects on the hippocampus, causing problems with transferring short-term to long-term memory. [...] There is no one way that patients' memories are affected by PTSD, as shown by a variety of studies. Typically symptoms include avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event or mention thereof, irritability, trouble sleeping, emotional numbness and exaggerated reactions to surprises. [...] One of the most common and powerful symptoms, is the recurrence of random intense memories from the event (intrusive thoughts). [...] This can manifest itself in different ways such as flashbacks of the event and unwanted thoughts about the trauma (e.g. [...] "why did <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> me?"). PTSD patients who have gone through different traumatic experiences will have small variances in their symptoms, mostly insignificant. [...] For example, PTSD patients who were rape victims will have aversion to words such as touch and dirty while patients who were in a fire or war experience will respond similarly to words like burn or fight.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Haider had {{concentrated}} his politics on Carinthia. In addition, Haider's personal life was heavily connected with {{this part of}} Austria: Haider became wealthy in 1983 when he inherited the estate of Wilhelm Webhofer, who had owned a large parcel of land in Carinthia commonly known as [...] "Bärental" [...] (bear valley). This estate has a history that {{came up in the}} 1990s in the Austrian media. The land had been owned by an Italian Jew until 1941. At that point in time the Nazis still hesitated to take possession of property owned by non-German Jews without any compensation. Inside Italy, Jewish property was not yet open for confiscation and the Mussolini government was not inclined to allow <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> Jewish nationals abroad either. Thus when the estate was sold in 1941, one Josef Webhofer (a former resident of South Tyrol, Italy, and an Optant) paid 300,000 Reichsmark (about $1.5 million today) to obtain title to the land. After the war Mathilde Roifer, the widow of the former Jewish owner of Bärental, demanded compensation. Despite a panel finding that the property was fairly sold, Webhofer paid Roifer an additional 850,000 schillings (about $1 million today). In 1955 Josef Webhofer's son Wilhelm Webhofer, not a blood relative of Jörg Haider's but rather a [...] "Wahlonkel" [...] or uncle-by-choice, inherited the estate and later bequeathed it to Haider. Today the land is estimated to be worth about $15 million.|$|E
