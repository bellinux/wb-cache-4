25|$|The Currie Cup {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} rugby {{competition}}s, with the first games played in 1889 but it was only in 1892 that it became officially known as the Currie Cup. The competition had its humble beginnings as an inter-province competition in 1884, but when the South African Rugby Board was founded in 1889 it decided to organize a national competition that would involve representative teams from all the major unions. The original participating unions were Western Province, Griqualand West, Transvaal and Eastern Province. The first tournament was held in Kimberley and was won by Western Province. For a prize they received a silver cup donated by the South African Rugby Board, now displayed at the SA Rugby Museum in Cape Town. The story of how the Currie Cup came to be comes from the first overseas rugby team to tour South Africa in 1891, The British Isles, who carried with them a particularly precious bit of cargo. Among the bags, boots and balls was a golden cup given to them by Sir Donald Currie, owner of Union-Castle Lines, the shipping company that transported them to the southern tip of Africa. Sir Donald was clear with his instructions – hand this trophy over to the team in South Africa <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> the best game; and after a spirited display where the unbeaten British Lions narrowly won 3-0, Griqualand West became the first ever holders of the Currie Cup. They then handed the trophy over to the South African rugby board and it became the floating trophy for the Currie Cup competition. The inaugural Currie Cup tournament was thus held in 1892 with Western Province earning the honour of holding it aloft as the first official winners.|$|E

He described the band's power chords as [...] "the thunder from down under <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> the second most powerful surge that can flow through your body."

500|$|... "Naomi" [...] {{was filmed}} in October 2008, {{in the same}} {{production}} block as the series' fourth episode, [...] "Pandora", and the series' opening title sequence. The riot scene {{in front of the}} college was filmed with 100 extras; Cook's petrol-bombing of the car was described by costume assistant Ros Marshall as [...] "probably the most hi-tech special effect we've had while filming Skins". The students' college common room was filmed in the show's production canteen. Originally, an entire scene was supposed to be filmed with Naomi and Emily in the lake, but the water was so cold that the actors were unable to stay in the water, and Kathryn Prescott was taken to a standby ambulance with suspected hypothermia. Director Simon Massey choreographed Naomi and Emily's sex scene prior to filming so that, on the set, the actions would come instinctively to the actors and {{they would be able to}} complete the scene in a limited number of takes. While Lily Loveless enjoyed filming those scenes because [...] "stuff like <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> experience", Prescott said that it concerned her, though she said that she was not pressured to do anything in the script that made her uncomfortable.|$|E

In March 1916 her first poems were published in Nash's Magazine. She completed her teacher training course in December 1918, and the following month obtained a teaching appointment at Bickley Park School, a small independent establishment for boys in Bickley, Kent. Two months later Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education, 1st class in botany, geography, practice and history of education, child hygiene and class teaching and 2nd class in literature and elementary mathematics. In 1920 she moved to Southernhay in Hook Road Surbiton as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude, with whom Blyton spent four happy years. Owing to a shortage of schools in the area her charges were soon joined by the children of neighbours, and a small school developed at the house.|$|E

Unlike most tours who built the stage from the bottom up, the stage was built from the ceiling down. The tour comprised 140 workers, 125 crew members, 14 tour buses, 16 dancers and 2 band members. In July 2011, Spears told MTV News she was having [...] "a blast" [...] on the tour, commenting, [...] "The shows have been equally amazing.

500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track {{in and out of}} a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> a chance to take a breath".|$|E

500|$|The audio {{received}} mixed reception. Manny LaMancha of GamePro {{said that}} the in-game voice acting (provided by such stars as Debi Derryberry and Billy West) was [...] "clear and entertaining". Tony Guidi of TeamXbox {{also noted that the}} character voices were [...] "done well" [...] and that the music [...] "isn't annoying". However, Michael Lafferty of GameZone stated that the music can become [...] "a little tiring" [...] and [...] "annoying" [...] after a while. Ryan Davis of GameSpot concluded that the sound was [...] "respectable", but added that the [...] "attitude" [...] of the character sounds bites seemed [...] "forced". Ed Lewis of IGN {{said that the}} [...] "saving grace" [...] of the [...] "Looney Tunes-style repartee and sound effects" [...] is that [...] "it was done professionally and while it's pretty silly if you listen to it, it doesn't grate and get under the skin as other games can." [...] He added that the music was [...] "bouncy and peppy and, once again, cartoony". Steven Rodriguez of Nintendo World Report described the music and sound effects as [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "plain" [...] respectively, and noted that {{the best part of the}} game's audio was [...] "that sexy talking mask <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> advice between races, but even he gets rather annoying." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Let the Right One In took place, Cloverfield {{director}} Matt Reeves signed on to write and direct an English-language version for Overture Films and Hammer Films. Hammer Films acquired the rights at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the [...] "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature", and Overture films planned to release the film in 2010. Alfredson has expressed unhappiness {{about the idea of}} a remake, saying that [...] "Remakes should be made of movies that aren't very good, <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> the chance to fix whatever has gone wrong" [...] and expressing concern that the end result would be too mainstream. Alfredson was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Lindqvist, in contrast, said that he had heard that Reeves [...] "will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film" [...] and so [...] "it'll be something completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes referred to the project as a remake of the film and later not as a remake, but just as [...] "Reeves' version". Let Me In was released in late 2010 starring Chloë Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Abby and Owen, Eli's and Oskar's respective counterparts, and received very positive reviews but under-performed at the box office.|$|E

2500|$|Dai Tanaka of Rockin' on Japan {{praised the}} song's allegorical lyrical style, {{and felt that}} [...] "The Bird Without Wings" [...] {{was one of the}} {{stand-out}} songs on Force, calling it a [...] "wonderful song <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> the courage to accept yourself as you are". CDJournal reviewers described the song as a rock song that hasg a comfortable tempo with a lightly developing structure, and similarly praised the song's message. Aki Ito of EMTG praised the song for its comfortable and honest melody, and felt that the center of both this song and [...] "Kagayaku Tsuki no Yō ni" [...] was Ochi's bold and expressive voice. She noted the song's strong blues rock-sound, and felt that the guitar backing added to the song's distinctiveness.|$|E
2500|$|In a rave {{review of}} the album upon its release, Rolling Stone writer Lester Bangs {{described}} In a Silent Way as [...] "the kind of album <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> faith {{in the future of}} music. It is not rock and roll, but it's nothing stereotyped as jazz either. All at once, it owes almost as much to the techniques developed by rock improvisors {{in the last four years}} as to Davis' jazz background. It is part of a transcendental new music which flushes categories away and, while using musical devices from all styles and cultures, is defined mainly by its deep emotion and unaffected originality". Davis' next fusion album, Bitches Brew, showed him moving even further into the area that lay between the genres of rock and jazz. The dark, fractured dissonance of Bitches Brew ultimately proved to be instrumental in its success; it far outsold In a Silent Way.|$|E

2500|$|The secretive {{attitude}} and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: [...] "Most characters like Snape {{are hard to}} love {{but there is a}} sort of ambiguity—you can’t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it’s fascinating when you think he’s going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he’s not so bad after all." [...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're not really sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy, <b>that</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> a latent tension... I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay [...] "To Sir with Love" [...] in the book Mapping the World of Harry Potter, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as Wuthering Heights Heathcliff.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2015, Reinhart gained {{widespread}} recognition {{when her}} cover of [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] {{was used in}} an Extra Gum commercial. Entitled [...] "The Story of Sarah & Juan", the advertisement first began circulating on Facebook before a full version of the song was released separately through YouTube.

Additionally, the video was a candidate in the YouTube Ads of the Year contest for 2015, and it won for the category [...] "TheYoutubeAd <b>That</b> <b>Gives</b> <b>You</b> Feels."

With this debut, her cover became the seventh version of the song to chart on the AC since Elvis Presley's original release in 1962, and the first version to chart since UB40's reggae interpretation in 1993. The song reached a peak of number 16 on the AC chart dated April 21, 2016. Of the cover, Reinhart expressed: [...] "I {{wanted to make it}} sound as if I was talking to or whispering to a loved one next to me, that kind of vibe."
