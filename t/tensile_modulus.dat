40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate all the factors contributing to early age shrinkage cracking in concrete, namely, shrinkage, tensile creep, <b>tensile</b> elastic <b>modulus,</b> <b>tensile</b> strength of concretes, and to study the effect of slag as a binder on these factors. The above-mentioned factors were measured in early age concretes made with 0, 35, 50 and 65 % level replacement of ordinary Portland cement by slag. All the concretes studied were moist cured for 7 -days. It was found that, at lower slag replacement levels (0, 35 and 50 %), the tensile strength decreased with increasing slag replacement. However, this is more than compensated by decreasing <b>tensile</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> and shrinkage. There was no significant change found in tensile creep with the changing slag levels.

50|$|Rubber like proteins, such as resilin and elastin, are {{characterized}} {{based on their}} high resilience, low stiffness, and large strain. A high resilience indicate that an sufficient amount of energy input {{can be stored in}} the material, and released afterwards. An example of energy input is to stretch the material. Natural resilin (hydrated) has a resilience of 92%, which means it can store 92% of the energy input for release during unloading, indicating a very efficient energy transfer. In order for a better understanding the stiffness and strain of resilin, Hooke’s Law should be taken into consideration. For linear springs, Hooke’s Law states that the force required to deform the spring is directly proportional to the amount of deformation by a constant which is the characteristic of the spring. A material is viewed as elastic when it can be deformed to a large extend with a limited amount of force.
