50|$|The {{primary means}} of {{financing}} the International Monetary Fund is through members' quotas. Each member of the IMF is assigned a quota, part of which is payable in SDRs or specified usable currencies ("reserve assets"), and part in the member's own currency. The difference between a member's quota and the IMF's holdings of its currency is a country's Reserve <b>Tranche</b> <b>Position</b> (RTP). Reserve <b>Tranche</b> <b>Position</b> is accounted among a country's foreign-exchange reserves.|$|E
40|$|The optimal static hedging of a CDO <b>tranche</b> <b>position</b> with a {{portfolio}} of bonds that constitute the CDO reference pool is addressed here. The hedge ratio and tranche pricing that result in a fair bet on the average and minimum hedge error measures are found for synthetic CDO tranches, employing two default models (1) Reduced form Normal Copula; (2) Structural Variance-Gamma. The sensitivities of the break-even spread, optimal hedge ratios, and un-hedged risks to the underlying credits and the CDO structure are illustrated. The relationship between the no-default carry and residual default risks of hedged CDO tranches are illustrated. In the same framework hedging a bond with a CDS is also examined. The residual hedge error dependence on recovery uncertainty and deviation of bond price from par are shown...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to the risk-neutral valuation of CDO tranches, based on a general specification of the tranche loss distributions and the index default distribution. The new model is a term-structure model, and the generality with which the basic distributions are specified allows it to be perfectly calibrated to any set of market prices (for any number of tranches and maturities) that is arbitrage-free. The use of the new model is illustrated by testing market prices for the standardized iTraxx index tranches (for all marketed tranches and maturities) to see if they are arbitrage-free. Other examples include the determination of the arbitrage-free range of prices allowed for an unmarketed standardized tranche and the determination of the cost of exiting a <b>tranche</b> <b>position.</b> For the latter example, both arbitrage-free price ranges, and a preferred price, are obtained. Prices for unmarketed maturities and unmarketed non-standard tranches are also obtained by an interpolation and extrapolation procedure. Because the model is an incomplete-market model characterized by many more parameters than market prices, it was essential to develop an efficient optimization approach to valuation. The article also makes use of {{a new approach to}} the problem of unequal recovery rates and notionals...|$|E
