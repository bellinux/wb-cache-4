5|$|After the Dutch {{recognised}} Indonesia's independence on 27 December1949, {{following a}} several month-long {{conference in the}} Hague, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a drastic increase in enrolment at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> the Church's ability to expand. In 1953 the Ministry for Religion decreed that no foreign missionaries would be allowed into the country, and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from teaching. In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E

5|$|In July 1992, the IOC {{voted to}} approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; {{it was first}} held at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. The Nagano Organizing Committee was {{hesitant}} to include the event because of the additional costs of staging the tournament, but an agreement was reached <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> the field to six teams, and ensured that no additional facilities would be built. The Canadian and American teams have dominated the event, typically losing only to each other. The United States won the first tournament in 1998. Canada won in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014.|$|E

He ran a European leading time of 10.06seconds at Papaflessia in Greece, and won the 100m and 200m races at the 2009 European Team Championships. He was the fastest entrant at the national championships but 2008 runner-up Simeon Williamson won the final by some distance. The result took Chambers by surprise and he said <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> opportunities to race had made him complacent. He later withdrew from the 200m race citing exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designed}} as a fighter-like aircraft capable of very high speeds and altitudes, the project was repeatedly scaled back over time and the U.S. Air Force eventually abandoned it. Development was then {{taken up by the}} U.S. Army for a tactical combat aircraft requirement, a sort of high-performance helicopter. In flight testing, the Avrocar proved to have unresolved thrust and stability problems <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> it to a degraded, low-performance flight envelope; subsequently, the project was cancelled in September 1961.|$|E

On July 26, Southside politicians attempted to force a vote through the Gray Commission which endorsed the Stanley plan (as redrafted by Almond), but the vote failed. The commission did vote, however, to have Mays draft legislation to implement the proposals contained in the Gray Commission report as well as the governor's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} {{democracy}} and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, disasters, a persistent communist insurgency, and a military conflict with Moro separatists. During Corazon Aquino's administration, U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines, due to {{the rejection of the}} U.S. Bases Extension Treaty, and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992. The administration also faced a series of natural disasters, including the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991. After introducing a constitution <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> presidents to a single term, Aquino did not stand for re-election.|$|E

Using the powers of Lex Hortensia, Tiberius established a commission to oversee the redistribution of land holdings from the rich to the unlanded urban poor.

5|$|Angered {{over his}} electoral loss, Randolph harangued anti-Harrison supporters, even {{challenging}} {{one to a}} duel. He was stabbed three times, but recovered and challenged Jennings in his bid for reelection in 1810. Harrison came out to personally stump on Randolph's behalf. Jennings focused on the slavery issue and tied Randolph to Harrison's continued attempts to legalize the institution. The congressional election coincided with the first popular election of delegates to the territorial legislature. In 1809, a year prior to the election, the territory's pro-slavery faction suffered a significant setback when Illinois was separated from the Indiana Territory, cutting Harrison off from his supporters in the western portion of the territory. Harrison suggested that Jennings further expanded his political base by stumping among the disaffected French residents of the territory. Jennings's defeat of Randolph in 1810 repudiated Harrison's pro-slavery policies. Following his triumph in the election, Jennings's and his anti-slavery allies were successful in enacting a legislative agenda <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> the territorial governor's authority and repealed an 1805 act regarding indentured service.|$|E
5|$|Further {{excavations}} {{were carried}} out by Louis Salzmann between 1906 and 1908, concentrating on the north-west sector of the Roman fort, the east gate and the north postern. Harry Sands undertook the clearing of debris around the medieval castle keep in 1906 and more extensive excavations in 1910. Further clearing work took place {{under the supervision of}} the Ministry of Works in 1926 following the acquisition of the castle by the state. In 1936 Frank Cottrill carried out an eight-month excavation in the area of the outer bailey. B. W. Pearce excavated outside the Roman west gate in 1938 and cleared the moat of debris the following year. The Second World War ended any further work, and it was not until 1964 <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> exploration by Stuart Rigold took place outside the south-east postern of the inner bailey. In 1993–95, a team from the University of Reading led by Professor Michael Fulford carried out a series of excavations in the area of the keep and on the Roman fortress's east side.|$|E

But access to websites was only partial: for instance, users could browse forums and blogs but not post on them. China Daily reported <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> e-mail services were also restored in Ürümqi on 8 February, although a BBC reporter writing at approximately the same time said e-mail was not accessible yet.

The New York class was {{constructed}} under new labor laws <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> the working hours of her construction crews. It was also stipulated that each ship {{cost less than}} $6,000,000, excluding cost of armor and armament. She was launched on 30 October 1912 and commissioned on 15 May 1914. The fifth ship to be named for New York State, she was sponsored by Elsie Calder, the daughter of New York politician William M. Calder. The fourth , an armored cruiser, was renamed Rochester, and was later scuttled in Subic Bay in 1941. However, the wreck site for that ship, {{which has become a}} popular recreational dive site, is still commonly referred to as USS New York.|$|E
5|$|None of the Peace dollar mintages are {{particularly}} rare, and A Guide Book of United States Coins (or Red Book) lists low-grade circulated specimens for most years for {{little more than}} the coin's bullion value. Two exceptions are the first year of issue 1921 Peace dollar, minted only at the Philadelphia mint and issued in high relief, and the low-mintage 1928-P Peace dollar. The prices for the 1928-P dollar are much lower than its mintage of 360,649 would suggest, because the U.S. mint announced <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> quantities would be produced and many were saved. In contrast the 1934-S dollar was not saved in great numbers so that prices for circulated specimens are fairly inexpensive but mid-grade uncirculated specimens can cost thousands of dollars.|$|E
5|$|Riley {{began his}} career writing verses as a sign maker and {{submitting}} poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents. Riley was an alcoholic, never married or had children, and created a scandal in 1888 when he became too drunk to perform. He became more popular {{in spite of the}} bad press he received, and as a result extricated himself from poorly negotiated contracts <b>that</b> <b>limited</b> his earnings; he quickly became very wealthy.|$|E
