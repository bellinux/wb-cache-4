Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath.

500|$|In June 1947, Le Mesurier {{went with}} fellow actor Geoffrey Hibbert to the Players' Theatre in London, where among the {{performers}} was Hattie Jacques. Le Mesurier and Jacques {{began to see}} each other regularly, although Le Mesurier was still married, albeit estranged from his wife. In 1949, when his divorce came through, Jacques proposed to Le Mesurier, asking him, [...] "Don't you think it's about <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> married?".

In describing the story, Le Guin stated: It seemed high <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{all the way into}} a kemmerhouse. With a native guide, instead of a poor uptight Earth guy trying to figure out what's going on and being disturbed by it... Left Hand gives the reader very little opportunity to experience being double-gendered [...] I wanted to explore it as a natural, universal experience, instead of a weird alien condition. Back in 1968, I and most readers needed Genly Ai's POV to mediate the strangeness. I don't think we do, now. She referred to the story as a sexual footnote to Left Hand.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained [...] "That whole time for our band was such a dark season. It was emotionally exhausting, and by the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> around {{to the point where}} we were going to start writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album..." [...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect of the whole thing is definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E
500|$|Tommy Handley died {{suddenly}} on 9 January 1949; the BBC {{decided that he}} was [...] "so much the keystone and embodiment of the actual performance" [...] of ITMA, that they cancelled the show immediately. Jacques later remarked that Handley was [...] "one of the greatest radio performers we have ever known. I learned... so much from him". Later that year Le Mesurier divorced his wife; shortly after the divorce came through, Jacques proposed to him, asking, [...] "don't you think it's about <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> married?" [...] The couple wed on 10 November that year, at Kensington Registrar's Office. After a week's honeymoon in Southsea, {{she returned to the}} Players' where she was engaged to appear as Marrygolda in the Christmas pantomime Beauty and the Beast.|$|E

500|$|By 2004, Microsoft {{brought the}} team the Xbox 360 {{hardware}} and suggested moving {{the game to}} that system, with a release date {{in the spring of}} 2006. [...] By November 2004, the whole of Pacific City was in place, and cooperative mode was possible. [...] However, in January 2005 they switched to the Renderware 4 engine, which caused many problems and was considered a [...] "gross mistake" [...] by Wilson. [...] Microsoft was able to provide additional programmers to help during 2006 to correct the problems, just in time to create a demo for the 2006 E3 Convention. [...] Wilson admitted that when Crackdown was first unveiled, the team thought the game was too early to debut. [...] "By the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the end of pre-production we were woefully understaffed and over budget", Wilson commented.|$|E
500|$|The {{end of each}} issue, {{with the}} {{exception}} of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various Watchmen characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of Watchmen, which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory. Moore said, [...] "By the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it." ...|$|E
500|$|The makeup {{time for}} the Borg {{expanded}} from the single hour needed for television to five hours, {{in addition to the}} 30minutes necessary to get into costume and 90minutes to remove the makeup {{at the end of the}} day. While Westmore estimated that a fully staffed production would have around 50 makeup artists, First Contact had to make do with fewer than ten people involved in preparation, and at most 20 artists a day. Despite the long hours, Westmore's teams began to be more creative with the prosthetics even as they decreased their preparation times. [...] "They were using two tubes, and then they were using three tubes, and then they were sticking tubes in the ears and up the nose," [...] Westmore explained. [...] "And we were using a very gooey caramel coloring, maybe using a little bit of it, but by the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the end of the movie we had the stuff dripping down the side of [...] faces—it looked like they were leaking oil! So, at the very end , they're more ferocious." ...|$|E
25|$|We {{were able}} to use archival pieces from Van Cleef & Arpels, which came with a {{revolving}} door of security guards. The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. It was really a house of cards. There were a couple of <b>times</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|R

500|$|In April 2014, Quesada stated that, beyond {{connecting}} to themselves, the Netflix series would {{connect with the}} films and other television series. In October 2014, Feige said the opportunity [...] "certainly" [...] exists for characters in the Netflix series to appear in [...] In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the Netflix series to crossover with the films and the ABC series, saying, [...] "As it is now, {{in the same way}} that our films started out as self-contained and then by the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to The Avengers, it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into Thor 2 and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of Iron Man 3. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling". In September 2015, Feige elaborated on the films referencing the television series, saying [...] "I think that's inevitable at some point ... The schedules do not always quite match up to make that possible. It's easier for [...] They're more nimble and faster and produce things quicker than we do, which is one of the main reasons you see the repercussions of Winter Soldier or [...] in the show ... by the time we start doing a movie, they'd be mid-way through a season. By the time our movie comes out, they'd be [...] So finding the timing on that is not always easy.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN graded {{the episode}} 8.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "pretty damn busy and quite fun", {{highlighting}} Skye's character {{development and the}} drama it caused, {{as well as the}} connections to [...] "Pilot", as high points of the episode. He praised the [...] "dark, but also necessary" [...] deaths depicted, and concluded that the series [...] "is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be [...] "mostly, quite good," [...] praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "might actually be as bad as the people they're trying to fight", and the character of Raina, who he called [...] "the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating [...] "while I loved the fact that they kind of, sort of, dredged up an actual Marvel character to use in this episode ... it was a shame that he too bore almost no resemblance to an actual person". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, [...] "perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight." [...] Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter decided that the [...] "episode wasn't as good as [...] "Eye Spy"—by the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the last two segments, I really didn’t care what happened to “Scorch,”—but it was still better than the first three. It was all just so very ... perfunctory." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all the things people said you have to do in this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to the last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was so sick of the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked like a bunch of Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play I looked up and one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{testimony}} by a previous detainee, detention was most often severely overcrowded and there existed {{a serious lack of}} food. [...] "Malnourishment made life in Yodok very difficult. We were given corn-rice in small quantities; at <b>times</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> only salt soup with cabbage leaves. No meat was served. We were always hungry; and resorted to eating grass in spring. Three or four people died of malnutrition. When someone died, fellow prisoners delayed reporting his {{death to the}} authorities so that they could eat his allocated breakfast." [...] Prisoners were punished with withdrawal of food as well as torture and harsh labor. Malnutrition and infectious disease caused {{more than half of the}} deaths in detention.|$|R

2500|$|Wilson's take on {{bringing}} in Budig as Greenlee hinged on her {{belief that it}} was a no-brainer. Wilson had been trying to get Budig at All My Children for years. [...] "She went on to Guiding Light about two weeks before I was going to bring her in to read for the part," [...] stated Wilson. [...] "Since then I'd spoken to her several times and tried to encourage her to come here, and this <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> lucky. I think she's a terrific young lady and a wonderful actress, and I'm really happy that we have her here at ABC." ...|$|E
2500|$|Childhood friends Eric Lewis and Merwyn Sanders {{were born}} and raised in Chicago, United States. At first, they formed a band called Quadraphonics in middle school, with Lewis on guitar, Sanders on drums, DJ Calvin on bass, and [...] "another friend named Edgwick" [...] on guitar. In high school, only Lewis and Sanders stuck together, a time when they {{acquired}} a drum machine, a Moog synthesizer and other equipment used by the burgeoning Chicago house scene. They had discovered house music at high school parties (like Mendel Catholic High School) and nightclubs such as Ron Hardy's Muzic Box, the Power Plant and The Warehouse; the duo also frequented nightclubs in Toronto, Canada. Sanders recalls: [...] "That was '80 or so, '81. We just started doing a bunch of music at home. At that <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a 4-track. So, that's what we would do, go to school, and we would hang out and do music... and go shoot some ball, then work some more music." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, the show's {{popularity}} dissolved very quickly. As the Associated Press put it, Joe Millionaire [...] "has {{gone from}} one of TV’s most surprising successes to the new season’s most spectacular flameout."

2500|$|Ford {{recalled}} to his {{son that}} Bill Holden, who had joined the Army Air Corps and he, [...] "talked about it and we were both convinced that our careers, which were just getting established, would likely be forgotten by the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back ... if we got back." [...] He was assigned in March 1943 to active duty at the Marine Corps Base in San Diego. With his Coast Guard service, he was offered a position as an officer, but Ford declined, feeling it would be interpreted as preferential treatment for a movie star and instead entered the Marines as a private. He trained at the Marine base in San Diego, where Tyrone Power, the number-one male movie star at the time, was also based. Power suggested Ford join him in the Marine's weekly radio show, Halls of Montezuma broadcast Sunday evenings from San Diego. [...] Ford excelled in his training, winning the Rifle Marksman Badge and named [...] "Honor Man" [...] of the platoon and promoted to sergeant {{by the time he}} finished.|$|E

[...] "When the pictures of the '65 Corvair arrived in our offices, the man who opened the envelope actually let out a great shout of delight and amazement on first seeing the car, and in thirty seconds the whole staff was charging around, each wanting {{to be the first to}} show somebody else, each wanting the vicarious kick of hearing that characteristic war-whoop from the first-time viewer." [...] "Our ardor had cooled a little by the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to drive the cars— then we went nuts all over again. The new rear suspension, the new softer spring rates in front, the bigger brakes, the addition of some more power, all these factors had us driving around like idiots— zooming around the handling loop dragging with each other, standing on the brakes— until we had to reluctantly turn the car over to some other impatient journalist... The '65 Corvair is an outstanding car. It doesn't go fast enough, but we love it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jessica Jones is {{the second}} of the ordered Netflix series, after Daredevil, and was {{followed}} by Luke Cage and Marvel's Iron Fist, which lead to the miniseries, The Defenders. In November 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that, if the characters prove popular on Netflix, “It’s quite possible that they could become feature films," [...] which Sarandos echoed in July 2015. In August 2014, Vincent D'Onofrio, who played Wilson Fisk in Daredevil, stated that after the [...] "series stuff with Netflix", Marvel has [...] "a bigger plan to branch out". In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the series to crossover with the MCU films and the ABC television series, saying, [...] "It all exists in the same universe.
