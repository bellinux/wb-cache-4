5|$|The {{congestion}} <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> {{being introduced}} at the access and exit ramps of two interchanges on Essingeleden {{in order to}} reduce traffic jams in peak periods, and with shorter traffic jams on Essingeleden, the surrounding roads are expected to have shorter tailbacks. The transport agencies involved expected to reduce traffic on Essingeleden by some 10% in peak hours. One week after the tax began to be charged, traffic on the motorway had decreased by 22% compared to a normal day in mid-December.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{collects}} {{personal income}} tax in five income brackets, ranging from 3.0% to 5.75%. The state sales and use tax rate is 4.3%, while the tax rate on food is 1.5%. There is an additional 1% local tax, {{for a total of}} a 5.3% combined sales tax on most Virginia purchases and 2.5% on most food. Virginia's property <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> set and collected at the local government level and varies throughout the Commonwealth. Real estate is also taxed at the local level based on 100% of fair market value. Tangible personal property also is taxed at the local level and is based on a percentage or percentages of original cost.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} taxes levied on oil {{production}} in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, {{but the overall}} form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> levied {{on the cost of}} oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.|$|E

5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
5|$|In 1198 and 1199, William was Sheriff of Devon and Sheriff of Cornwall, {{along with}} another royal servant, {{and served as a}} royal justice. In 1200 he was {{recorded}} as a receiver of the carucage, a tax on land, in the Pipe roll; whether this meant that he was a local or a national collector of the <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> unclear. By 12 September 1204, William was Archdeacon of Taunton in the Diocese of Bath, and he witnessed the election of Jocelin of Wells as the new bishop of the diocese. He was jointly placed in charge of the mints of London and Canterbury in 1205, along with Reginald de Cornhill, with whom he also shared the collection of the tax of a fifteenth on merchants, a post the two had held since 1202. In May 1205 William, along with de Cornhill, was given custody of one of three dies for the mint at Chichester; in July the king gave William's custody to Simon of Wells, the Bishop of Chichester. William was one of the officials in charge of the collection of a tax of a thirteenth in 1207.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1500s, the leidang <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> {{supplemented}} by additional taxes imposed {{when the government}} needed extra revenue, as in wartimes. From 1600 the additional <b>taxes</b> <b>was</b> imposed more frequently and around 1620 the tax became annual. The leilending (tenant farmer) <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> a property <b>tax</b> where farms <b>were</b> divided into three groups {{depending on the size}} of the farms (full farms, half farms, and deserted farms). The <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> from the 1640s dependent on the land rent. In 1665, Norway got its first land register (...) with a land rent that reflected the value of the production of the farm. The leilending <b>tax</b> <b>was</b> therefore a <b>tax</b> on the expected returns in agriculture.|$|R
