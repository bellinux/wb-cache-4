40|$|A <b>tariff-rate</b> <b>quota</b> (TRQ) is a two-tier tariff. The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture {{provides}} for the transformation of remaining import quotas into TRQs in order to eliminate quantity restricting import barriers to trade. However, {{more often than not}} are TRQs de-facto-quotas. The profit-maximizing condition for an importer confronted with two differentiated goods under a common quota is derived. The main focus of the present article is the US import regime for cheese which was transformed according to the tariffication process into a TRQ system. Analysis of cheese import quantities shows that this transformation has indeed little changed.
