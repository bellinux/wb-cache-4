5|$|Time {{is viewed}} as unredeemable and problematic, whereas eternity is {{beautiful}} and true. Living under time's influence is a problem. Within Burnt Norton section 3, people trapped in time {{are similar to those}} stuck in between life and death in Inferno Canto Three. When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as encouraging people to forget the past and care only about the present and the future. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> capable of always reminding one of the past. These moments also rely on the idea of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita that death can come at any moment, and that the divine will is more important than considering the future.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} interior appointments {{were long}} ago destroyed and <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> a restoration from the 1950s. It {{consists of a}} square pew of {{each side of the}} altar, two box pews west of the chancel screen, and seventeen slip pews in the nave.|$|E

25|$|Based on Scrope's various arguments, {{he became}} a Huttonian in that he did believe that causes in {{operation}} currently were able to have produced past geological changes – <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> a key to explaining the past. He rejected aqueous origins and Von Buch's elevation-crater theory – which held that craters were caused by the buckling of the crust below them.|$|E
25|$|God remains {{active in}} Israel. The past {{is used to}} legitimise the author's present: this is seen most clearly in the {{detailed}} attention he gives to the Temple built by Solomon, {{but also in the}} genealogy and lineages, which connect his own generation to the distant past and thus make the claim that <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> a continuation of that past.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to humanistic counseling and therapy is Gestalt therapy, which puts {{a focus on}} the here and now, especially as an opportunity to look past any preconceived notions and focus on how <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> affected by the past. Role playing also plays a large role in Gestalt therapy and allows for a true expression of feelings that may not have been shared in other circumstances. In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually be feeling, despite the feelings expressed.|$|E

25|$|During the Three Kingdoms Period, the Xuanxue (Mysterious Wisdom) school, {{including}} Wang Bi, {{focused on}} the texts of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Many of the school's members, including Wang Bi himself, were not religious in any sense. Wang Bi mostly focused on reconciling Confucian thought with Taoist thought. Because the version of the Tao Te Ching that has been passed on to <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> the one that Wang Bi commented upon, his interpretations became very influential as they were passed on alongside the Tao Te Ching. In addition, his commentary was compatible with Confucian ideas and Buddhist ideas that later entered China. This compatibility ensured Taoism would remain {{an important aspect of}} Chinese culture, and made the merging of the three religions easier in later periods, such as the Tang dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} the 'Bridge' banknotes was initiated in 2006 by the Danish National Bank. The {{theme of the}} new banknotes is Danish bridges and the surrounding landscapes, or details from these landscapes. Danish artist Karin Birgitte Lund has chosen to interpret this theme in two ways: bridges as links between various parts of Denmark and as links between {{the past and the}} present. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> represented by the bridges, the past by five distinctive prehistoric objects found near the bridges. Among the new security features is a window thread ("Motion") with a moving wave pattern. Another feature is a new, sophisticated hologram that reflects light in different colors. The new banknotes also have the traditional security features such as the watermark and the hidden security thread.|$|E
25|$|Finally, all the {{characters}} of the parade began to walk inside the pool, around its center, mixing {{the past and the}} present in a single marching beat of the drums. The confluence of the past and <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> another main theme of the opening ceremony. The music began a crescendo with choruses, when all of a sudden an olive tree was lifted from the center of the pool - symbolizing goddess Athena's preferred gift by the Greeks - land and food - over Poseidon's gift, the horse - a tool of warfare. At the music's climax, all {{the characters}} stopped and raised their arms as if worshipping the Tree, which was high above, surrounded also by the fragments of the deconstructed statues who resembled a mount.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> specious <b>present</b> {{refers to}} <b>the</b> time {{duration}} wherein one's perceptions {{are considered to}} <b>be</b> in <b>the</b> <b>present.</b> <b>The</b> experienced <b>present</b> <b>is</b> said to be ‘specious’ in that, unlike <b>the</b> objective <b>present,</b> it <b>is</b> an interval and not a durationless instant. <b>The</b> term specious <b>present</b> <b>was</b> first introduced by the psychologist E.R.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{allegations}} and court cases of police brutality, custodial death, human rights violations, fake encounter killing, extortion, filing fake cases to harass the general public, corruption {{filed against the}} Assam Police.Because of the corrupt politicians the police have always complained {{not being able to}} function properly.Different organizations and their open extortion are known to the public and the police also have been alleged to have a fair share on those.Another main acquisition of Assam police in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> that they are the friends of thieves, kidnappers and murderers rather than the public and it is said that the police has a better share in those crime money.Corruption of the organization is at peak with people fearing to go to the police against a crime as they need to pay money to file an FIR or take actions.As a victim says,"I lost my bicycle as few days back and had reported the case in the station.They called me that they had found it and asked 1000 rupees for the release.I took a new one in 1600". In fact it is said that the police waits for the crime to happen so that they can make a profit out of it.Therefore, citizens there take the law in their own hands.|$|E
500|$|Elaine Jordan argues, in her 1988 {{analysis}} of Tennyson's works, that the poem's depiction of [...] "self-infolding [...] is a negation which involves the drawing-in of forces in order perhaps to assert the self differently. Mariana {{is the most}} powerful expression, very early, of such a moment, though its assertiveness exists only as strong gloom in image and rhythm, not as narrative possibility except in the desire for an end to it all preferred over patience." [...] In 2002, Ruth Glancy writes, [...] "In the last stanza, Mariana's grip on <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> loosening, and Tennyson's mastery of sound and images is evident (even in this early poem) in his description of the house that echoes her utter desolation". Anna Barton, in her 2008 analysis, declares Mariana [...] "the most famous heroine of the 1830 volume" [...] and that both The Ballad of Oriana and [...] "Mariana" [...] are [...] "poems of greater substance that develop the poetic that Tennyson begins to establish in his briefer songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1920, T.S. Eliot wrote that [...] "the past [...] altered {{by the present}} as much as <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> {{directed}} by the past"; Charles Martindale describes this as a [...] "cardinal principle" [...] for many versions of modern reception theory.|$|E

When <b>the</b> <b>presenting</b> part <b>is</b> at <b>the</b> ischial spines the station is 0 (synonymous with engagement). If <b>the</b> <b>presenting</b> fetal part <b>is</b> above the spines, the distance is measured and described as minus stations, which range from −1 to −4cm. If <b>the</b> <b>presenting</b> part <b>is</b> below <b>the</b> ischial spines, the distance is stated as plus stations ( [...] +1 to +4cm).

2500|$|Another {{contemporary}} historian {{believes that}} {{while it is true}} that critical history [...] "began with Thucydides, one may also argue that Herodotus’ looking at the past as a reason why <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> the way it is, and to search for causality for events beyond the realms of Tyche and the Gods, was a much larger step." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Croatian {{academician}} Vjeran Pavlaković, {{an assistant}} professor in the Department of Cultural Studies at the University of Rijeka, writes in Deifying the Defeated Commemorating Bleiburg since 1990,"The blurring of the past and <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>is</b> an integral part of the Bleiburg commemorations; not only do the participants dress in Ustasa uniforms, display Ustasa insignia and iconography, and sell paraphernalia associated with the NDH and its leaders, but there is an active discourse about the Croatian War of Independence accompanied by images of heroes (as well as individuals guilty of war crimes) from the conflict in the 1990s." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Now population, when it grows, {{moves with}} a certain uniform impetus, like a body in motion; and uniform {{progress}} of population, as I have fully explained before, is multiplication in a uniform ratio. But long-continued progress {{in such a manner}} is altogether impossible — it must outstrip all physical conditions and bounds; and the longer it continues, the more severely must the ultimate check be felt. I do not hesitate to say, therefore, that the rapid growth of our great towns, gratifying as it is in <b>the</b> <b>present,</b> <b>is</b> a matter of very serious concern as regards the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1920s, {{disappointed}} by the Western cultural elite's reaction to his political manifestos, Merezhkovsky returned to religious and philosophical essays, but in the new format, that of a monumental free-form experimental-styled treatise. Some of his new books were biographies, some just extensive, amorphous researches in ancient history. Speaking {{of the first two}} of them, The Birth of Gods. Tutankhamen in Crete (1925) and Messiah (1928), Merezhkovsky thus explained his credo: [...] "Many people think I am a historical novelist, which is wrong. What I use the Past for is only searching for the Future. <b>The</b> <b>Present</b> <b>is</b> a kind of exile to me. My true home is the Past/Future, which is where I belong." ...|$|E
