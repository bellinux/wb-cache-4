5|$|The {{first edition}} was {{illustrated}} with paintings by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm {{had lived in}} England since 1768, and was quite a famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he worked very hard on 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the landscape in lead pencil, then <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shading, and finally to add a light wash of watercolour. The illustrations were engraved (signed at lower right) {{by a variety of}} engravers including William Angus and Peter Mazell.|$|E

25|$|Abu Ahmad's army at the {{beginning}} of the siege numbered approximately 7,000 soldiers. Additional troops sent from Samarra a short time later increased its size to 11,000, though a large number of the reinforcements were killed soon after their arrival. At a later point in the war, a spy for Muhammad b. 'Abdallah reported that the besieging armies on the East and West sides of Baghdad totaled 19,000 men, and that al-Mu'tazz had very few additional troops <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field, since Samarra had been almost completely emptied of soldiers.|$|E

25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. Instructors are faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has {{other things to}} do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that {{there will not be a}} problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a writing}} [...] "mini-camp" [...] {{to map out}} the fifth season, the premiere's script was written and filming began on August 19. Show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "Because You Left", and decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode a setup for most {{elements}} of season 5, specially time travel. In order to avert implementing the time travel in a confusing way, the exposition of Faraday's theories was rewritten to start earlier and be more specific. While previous seasons had been filmed in high definition, this season premiere was the first Lost episode to be edited in it.|$|E

500|$|Deadpool {{had been}} {{developed}} for his own film by Reynolds and David S. Goyer at New Line Cinema in 2003, but the project fell apart as they focused on [...] and an aborted spin-off. Benioff wrote the character into the script in a manner Jackman described as fun, but would also deviate from some of his traits. Similarly, Gambit was a character who the filmmakers had tried <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous X-Men films. Jackman liked Gambit {{because he is a}} [...] "loose cannon" [...] like Wolverine, stating their relationship echoes that of Wolverine and Pyro in the original trilogy. David Ayer contributed to the script. Benioff finished his draft in October 2006, and Jackman stated there would be a year before shooting, as he was scheduled to start filming Australia during 2007. Before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike began, James Vanderbilt and Scott Silver were hired for a last-minute rewrite.|$|E
500|$|He {{also worked}} to {{introduce}} order into the lending of money by Jewish moneylenders, and organised {{a system where}} the royal officials worked to combat fraud by both parties {{in the business of}} Jewish money lending. Walter was probably the originator of the custom of keeping an archival copy of all charters, letters, patents and feet of fines, or record of agreements reached in the royal courts, in the chancery. The first recorded [...] "foot of the fine" [...] is endorsed with the statement [...] "This is the first chirograph that was made in the king's court in the form of three chirographs, according to the command of his lordship of Canterbury and other barons of the king, to the end that by this form a record can be made to be passed on to the treasurer <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treasury." [...] The agreement concerns Walter's brother Theobald, who was the plaintiff.|$|E

500|$|Tchaikovsky's {{relationship}} with collaborators was mixed. Like Nikolai Rubinstein with the First Piano Concerto, virtuoso and pedagogue Leopold Auer rejected the Violin Concerto initially but changed his mind; he played it to great public success and taught {{it to his}} students, who included Jascha Heifetz and Nathan Milstein. Wilhelm Fitzenhagen [...] "intervened considerably in shaping what he considered 'his' piece," [...] the Variations on a Rococo Theme, according to music critic Michael Steinberg. Tchaikovsky was angered by Fitzenhagen's license but did nothing; the Rococo Variations were published with the cellist's amendments. His collaboration on the three ballets went better and in Marius Petipa, {{who worked with him}} on the last two, he might have found an advocate. When The Sleeping Beauty was seen by its dancers as needlessly complicated, Petipa convinced them <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extra effort. Tchaikovsky compromised to make his music as practical as possible for the dancers and was accorded more creative freedom than ballet composers were usually accorded at the time. He responded with scores that minimized the rhythmic subtleties normally present in his work but were inventive and rich in melody, with more refined and imaginative orchestration than in the average ballet score.|$|E
500|$|Supersonic's {{focus was}} on the {{graphics}} and game modes for smaller vehicles. As the Mega Drive was considered the leading platform, an 8-bit look was impossible. David Darling was not happy with early efforts, and had Supersonic redraw the graphics. He said the perspective was wrong and there was slowdown. He also said that getting the game running at 50 frames per second (FPS) in eight-player mode was difficult. Supersonic asked Big Red Software {{to assist with the}} graphics. Most of the background graphics were produced by Mark Neesam, using an Amiga 500. He stated that some graphics were hard, despite having access to the originals, and believed that additional colours enabled him to [...] "muddy up" [...] graphics, but also used the increased colour palette to clean some up. Richard Darling encouraged tweaking, giving the game a personality. Journalists frequently visited to check on progress. Violet Berlin, co-presenter of the television programme Bad Influence!, made a cameo appearance as a character: she made one such visit and Richard Eddy of Codemasters asked to take her picture <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. She agreed on the condition that she was made the fastest character, although it was already decided that another character would be. She was instead made the second fastest character.|$|E
500|$|On game night, coach Taylor gives a {{pep talk}} where he warns the players against taking the opponents – Westerby High School – too lightly. They say their {{rallying}} cry, [...] "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!" [...] and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, {{and at the end}} of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is the only one left to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground. The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Coach Taylor now has <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that [...] "We are all vulnerable, and we will all at some point in our lives fall." ...|$|E
