Also, doubling the concrete strength (from 40 to 80 MPa) slightly increased the capacity by 10, 3 and 5 % for connections with reinforcement ratios of 0. 90, 1. 35 and 1. 80 %, respectively. Moreover, the Canadian standard for FRP-reinforced concrete buildings provided reasonable predictions with an average experimental-to-predicted ratio of 1. 29 ± 0. 05 and 1. 22 ± 0. 05 for the NSC and HSC connections, respectively...|$|R

This paper presents an experimental study carried out to investigate the punching shear behaviour of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforced concrete (RC) interior slab-column connections made of high strength concrete (HSC). Three full-scale HSC specimens were constructed and tested up to failure. The <b>three</b> <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> reinforced with GFRP sand-coated bars with reinforcement ratios of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 % without any shear reinforcement.

The <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> subjected to vertical load and unbalanced moment that were monotonically applied through the column tips. The behaviour of the specimens in terms of the deformation and strength characteristics is discussed.

The background is provided, {{with a description of}} the cement manufacturing process. Most of the report concerns itself with the heat transfer capabilities of the plant, therefore a short description of the heat flow within the most essential equipment is provided. The investigation follows a set of steps to derive the conclusion. The first step investigates previous studies to obtain the three most feasible heat sources. The second step investigates the available heat of the selected sources. In the third step, accessing the source is discussed and investigated for both convection and radiation heat transfer methods. It also includes the sizing of the required heat exchangers. Using the new sources, the connection possibilities to existing infrastructure and its benefits are investigated in step four. The <b>connections</b> <b>were</b> made to the existing infrastructure used at kiln 8 for electrical generation and district heating supply. The selections of the most feasible solutions are provided based on heat recovery, payback period and practicality. The final step in the study provides for the final design, which consists of <b>three</b> possible <b>connections</b> or all of them combined. In the conclusion, the final design would provide for a reduction in oil burned, fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions and an increase in electricity generated by the existing system.
