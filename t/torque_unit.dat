Most important problems are encountered during the transfer of the <b>torque</b> <b>unit</b> from the accredited laboratories to the industrial laboratories. For this purpose was designed a portable calibration system named Calibration Bell, particularly dedicated to calibration of torque transducers installed in the calibration benches of its production.

40|$|After the {{development}} of the oscillating disk curemeter over 30 years ago, standard conditions for measuring scorch times (time till the onset of vulcanization) were developed. ISO 3417 and ASTM D 2084 describe t(s) 1 and t(s) 2 test parameters which are accepted by the rubber industry as a method for measuring scorch times. t(s) 1 is the time until one <b>torque</b> <b>unit</b> rise above minimum torque and t(s) 2 is the time until two torque units rise above minimum torque. These parameters are arbitrary and do not measure the 'true' scorch time. Also t(s) 1 and t(s) 2 may not be an accurate comparison for compounds which differ greatly in their state of cure. Experience has shown that some rotorless curemeter designs are far more sensitive to physicochemical changes occurring during the cure process than the conventional oscillating curemeters. The MDR 2000 (R) rotorless curemeter (MDR) and the RPA 2000 (TM) Rubber Process Analyzer (RPA) measure subtle changes in viscoelastic properties during the caring process. This paper discusses the feasibility of using the time until the viscous torque (S'') peaks (f??) to more accurately measure the 'true' scorch time. Other techniques for measuring care characteristics are also reviewed for comparison...|$|E

5000|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method of presetting torque {{is with a}} calibrated clutch mechanism. One common form uses a ball detent and spring, with the spring preloaded by an adjustable screw thread, calibrated in <b>torque</b> <b>units.</b> The ball detent transmits force until the preset torque is reached, {{at which point the}} force exerted by the spring is overcome and the ball [...] "clicks" [...] out of its socket. The advantage of this design is greater precision and both tangible and audible feedback on reaching the desired torque. The wrench will not start slipping once the desired torque is reached, it will only click and bend slightly at the head, the operator can continue to apply torque to the wrench without any additional action or warnings from the wrench. For this reason, it is important to stop applying torque as soon as the wrench gives the click sound.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the intraosseous torsional shear strength of an osseointegrated oral implant using 3 -D finite element (FE) stress analysis implemented by in vivo failure torque data of an implant. Methods A Ø 3. 5 mm × 12 mm ITI ® hollow screw dental implant in a patient was subjected to torque failure test using a custom-made strain-gauged manual torque wrench connected to a data acquisition system. The 3 -D FE model of the implant and peri-implant circumstances was constructed. The in vivo strain data was converted to <b>torque</b> <b>units</b> (N. cm) to involve in loading definition of FE analysis. Upon processing of the FE analysis, the shear stress of peri-implant bone was evaluated to assume torsional shear stress strength of the bone-implant interface. Results The in vivo torque failure test yielded 5952 μstrains at custom-made manual torque wrench level and conversion of the strain data resulted in 750 N. cm. FE revealed that highest shear stress value in the trabecular bone, 121 MPa, was located at the first intimate contact with implant. Trabecular bone in contact with external surface of hollow implant body participated shear stress distribution, but not the bone resting inside of the hollow. Conclusion The torsional strength of hollow-screw implants is basically provided by the marginal bone and the hollow part has negligible effect on interfacial shear strength. </p...|$|R
