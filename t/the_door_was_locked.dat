5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked.</b> He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked,</b> the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people in}} the dress circle, {{familiar}} with the theatre, tried to avail themselves of the other exit leading into Flood's Alley, near the corner of Johnson Street.

In the brief time it took them to discover that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> {{and return to the}} dress circle, the stage had become engulfed and they had no recourse but to attempt to work their way down the main dress circle stairs to the lobby, adding their numbers to the crush on those stairs. Fire Marshall Keady would later write that he never found evidence that the exit had been opened.|$|E
25|$|Kupcinet {{apparently}} {{went straight}} home after dining with her friends. She was visited by freelance writer Edward Stephen Rubin shortly afterward. The two were then joined by actor Robert Hathaway around 9:30 pm. They told detectives they watched TV, including The Danny Kaye Show, with Kupcinet. They all drank coffee until she fell asleep, {{sitting next to}} them on the couch. She awoke and went to her room. The men either turned the TV set off or simply lowered the volume (three days later it was still playing with a low volume), and made sure <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> behind them before departing at about 11:15 pm. Hathaway said Rubin and he returned to his place and were later joined by Kupcinet's boyfriend, Andrew Prine, who was also Hathaway's neighbor. The three young men watched television and talked until around 3:00 am.|$|E

Having ascertained that probably it was advisable that no entrance should be made into the room at that time, I remained until about 1.30p.m., when the door was broken open by McCarthy, under the direction of Superintendent Arnold.|$|E
