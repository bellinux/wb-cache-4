5|$|Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is {{recommended}} after a first non-febrile seizure to detect structural problems {{in and around}} the brain. MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected, for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available. If someone attends <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> with a seizure but returns to normal quickly, imaging tests may be done at a later point. If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging, repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson's {{depression}} returns again, when Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs {{her that}} she has an infection that requires surgery. She rejects the surgery, and is further disappointed when Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) tells her that the worst-case scenario is that she will need an ostomy pouching system. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw)'s chronic pain patient, Andy Michaelson (Zack Shada) and his mother Pam (Martha Plimpton) enter <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room,</b> so Robbins and resident Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) order a 3D MRI, which is denied by the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.).|$|E
5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, on his stomach, and taken to <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E

The winds uprooted trees, downed electricity poles, disabled bridges, triggered landslides, and damaged several roofs. Hurricane Dean tore the corrugated metal roof off Victoria Hospital's pediatric ward, but its patients had already been evacuated. St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort was also damaged when part of the roof blew off its medical ward and fell through the roof of <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> A section of the cafeteria also lost its roof, {{but no one was}} injured in either incident.|$|E

At <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room,</b> House {{suspects}} Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is just the way her husband behaves and that it is impossible for her to not love him.|$|E

Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) brings her father, Thatcher Grey (Jeff Perry), who is vomiting blood, into <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room,</b> and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) treats him. Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) admits an elderly patient, Irving Waller (Ralph Waite), with skin growths, who later reveals that he wants a penile prosthesis, to which he receives. It is revealed that Thatcher needs a liver transplantation, and Stevens is assigned to a cancerous patient, Randy (Jocko Sims), by Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) wants to ask the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) for a job as an attending surgeon, but is nervous that he will reject her, and goes out to lunch with her girlfriend Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw).|$|E
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E

5|$|The {{hospital}} receives several surgical {{residents from}} Mercy West {{as they enter}} Seattle Grace, a repercussion of the recent merger. Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is recovering from her liver transplantation surgery, after donating a portion of it to her father. In the residents' lounge, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) tries to explain to Mercy West resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner) that she should not use a certain locker, due to it formerly belonging to the deceased Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). Adamson ignores her wishes, and uses the locker, leading Stevens to threatening to fight her. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) and Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are working in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room,</b> when Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) embarrasses Yang by taking Mercy West resident Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams)' side in a disagreement. Despite her mindset that all Mercy West residents would act {{in the manner of}} Adamson, Stevens develops a friendship with Dr. Charles Percy (Robert Baker). After months of the two not speaking, Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez)'s father, Carlos (Héctor Elizondo), shows up to the hospital with a priest, trying to condemn Torres for her concurrence in homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|After {{the team}} split, Nitro, {{alongside}} Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice. In November, after serving his suspension {{and a brief}} stint back in OVW, Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM to answer an open challenge put out by The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view. At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon {{as part of a}} four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip to <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure {{one or both of the}} Hardys, even going so far as to attack and perform a Snapshot on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> {{is filled}} with victims from a chain car accident, {{one of whom is}} {{admitted}} in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they {{come to the conclusion that}} even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E
