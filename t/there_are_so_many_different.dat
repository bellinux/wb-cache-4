[...] "The Daily Show {{was based on an}} emerging 24 hour news cycle, that’s everything it was, that’s what inspired The Daily Show. Now you look at news and it’s changed. It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the 'Gawker's, the 'Buzzfeed's. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge {{is going to be an}} exciting one I'm sure is how are we going to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source — which was historically Fox News" [...] Noah said at a press conference before the shows debut.|$|E
500|$|Markus and McFeely {{stated in}} March 2014 that the series {{would be set}} in 1946 initially, {{occurring}} {{in the middle of}} the timeline established in the One-Shot, and would focus on one case for Carter. Additional seasons would then advance a year and examine a new case. Despite working on [...] at the same time, Markus and McFeely remained involved with the series after writing the first script. When the showrunners joined the series, they went on a [...] "mini-camp" [...] with Markus and McFeely to develop the series from a pilot script written by the pair. They looked to several different influences outside of Marvel in developing the series, including Raiders of the Lost Ark, L.A. Confidential, and the works of author James Ellroy. Elaborating on deviating from the comics, Fazekas said, for example, [...] "if we're using a minor character or a bad guy from an old comic book, we don't have to adhere to what that character was in that comic book from 1945. Because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> iterations of a specific character, you can't be true to every single one." [...] ABC asked the producers to not have the series follow a [...] "Gadget of the Week or Bad Guy of the Week" [...] model, and instead focus on telling the story of Carter balancing her personal and professional lives. Fazekas called this [...] "such a nice change" [...] from previous television experience, with the group feeling free to drop whole story ideas in favor of focusing on the series' central storyline.|$|E

2500|$|The {{environmental}} {{threats that}} pose the most harm toward the Great Plains include water depletion, land degradation, and increasing temperature change. The winter months have become much warmer in the Plains, {{whether it is}} in the North, near North Dakota, or in the South, throughout Texas and bordering states, excluding the winters of 2014, 2015, and 2016. Though the winters are getting warmer, it is predicted that the summer months will have a greater increase than the temperatures in the winter months. [...] The effects of this increase in temperature is predicted to cause more frequent extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. This great increase in temperature will be the cause of the increased depletion of already declining water sources. Depleting water in the Great Plains will affect all populations in a negative way. “Most of the water used in the Great Plains comes from the High Plains aquifer (sometimes referred to by the name of its largest formation, the Ogallala aquifer), which stretches from South Dakota to Texas." [...] Conserving water in the Great Plains {{is one of the most}} important factors in keeping the Great Plains sustainable. It is also very important that farmers who use the land are sustainable in their practices. Since there are many different sustainable ways of farming, it is hard to decide which way would be the most sustainable. However, according to the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, farmers are not very likely to change their ways, leaving the outcome questionable for the Great Plains. “What is really needed are new methods, concepts, and measuring techniques”. The biggest challenge in changing the sustainability in such a large ecoregion is getting the a large portion of farmers using the land to practice in a way that does not harm the land, which poses to be a challenge since <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> farming practices. [...] "Prairie conservation requires: 1) New technology...to prioritize and set context to save prairie, 2) ecologically based initiatives to reverse significant losses in area and condition of native grasslands, 3) rethinking of standardized tools in the range management profession, and 4) a new natural resource agency." ...|$|E

6000|$|On {{throwing}} {{these results}} into a common statistical hotch-pot, I first examined into {{the rate at}} which these associated ideas were formed. It took a total time of 660 seconds to form the 505 ideas; that is, at about the rate of 50 in a minute, or 3000 in an hour. This would be miserably slow work in reverie, or wherever the thought follows the lead of each association that successively presents itself. In the present case, much time was lost in mentally taking the word in, owing to the quiet unobtrusive way in which I found it necessary to bring it into view, so as not to distract the thoughts. Moreover, a substantive standing by itself is usually the equivalent of too abstract an idea for us to conceive properly without delay. Thus {{it is very difficult to}} get a quick conception of the word [...] "carriage," [...] because <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> kinds--two-wheeled, four-wheeled, open and closed, and all of them in so many different possible positions, that the mind possibly hesitates amidst an obscure sense of many alternatives that cannot blend together. But limit the idea to say a laudau, and the mental association declares itself more quickly. Say a laudau coming down the street to opposite the door, and an image of many blended laudaus that have done so forms itself without the least hesitation.|$|E

Learn, too confident boy, that Mercedes de Guzman was the companion of my childhood; my warmest, dearest friend, next to Her Highness; and that she put all faith in my disposition to do full justice by her child. She died by slow degrees, and the fate of the orphan was often discussed between us. That she could ever become the wife of any but a Christian noble, neither of us imagined possible; but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> characters under the same outward professions, that names deceived us not.
