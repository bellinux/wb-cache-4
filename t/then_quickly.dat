5|$|Deathroy, {{the small}} {{creature}} {{that has been}} on Nene's shoulder removes himself from his masters body and absorbs Nene's remaining life force. Deathroy is revealed to be Destroy, the biomechanical weapon that destroyed the legendary ancients that once tried {{to bring peace to}} the world. The party defeats Destroy, melting him in lava. The party <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> escapes from the melting cube to rejoin their families.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed {{east of the}} Bahamas on September6. It moved slowly northwestward towards {{the coast of the}} United States and attained hurricane strength early on September9. The cyclone continued travelling northwest along the US coast, becoming a Category 2 hurricane whilst off the coast of Georgia on September 11. On September 13 the cyclone made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, but <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> weakened to a {{tropical storm}} and turned eastward into the Atlantic on September14. Throughout September15, whilst over water, the storm regained hurricane strength and continued northward before becoming extratropical in the mid-Atlantic on September17.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> take off again after the Bunch.|$|E

5|$|For torpedo {{training}} it {{was even}} more difficult. Shallow water was needed to recover training duds. Torpedoes usually sank by 20 to 50 feet before making their run. Thorney Island was selected but <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> ruled out as a useful site. It was later used, but at the time, its location near Portsmouth was considered too near the English Channel and as a result Turnberry in south-west Scotland was selected instead with Fighter Command giving up the site to Coastal Command. These Torpedo Training Units (TTU) were formed in January 1943. Training in this regard enabled the Command to cope with increasing demands for trained aircrews.|$|E
5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E
5|$|Severe thunderstorms, {{which can}} spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind shear to {{organize}} the storm {{in such a way}} as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time. This occurs as the storm's inflow becomes separated from its rain-cooled outflow. An increasing nocturnal, or overnight, low level jet can increase the severe weather potential by increasing the vertical wind shear through the troposphere. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air and kills the thunderstorm.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} theatrically in the United States and Canada in September 1982 and <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> withdrawn {{because of its}} poor performance at the box office. It has never been released on home video, although it has sometimes been broadcast on television. It was the largest financial loss in film of 1982, earning less than $2 million. Reviewers at the time gave it consistently bad reviews and later commentators including Newsweek, TV Guide and Canadian Press have classed Inchon among the worst films of all time.|$|E
5|$|With Germany {{suffering}} major defeat on all fronts, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and {{his ring}} of conspirators decided to eliminate Hitler and the Nazi leadership, {{establish a new}} government and save the country from total destruction. On 20 July 1944, during a military conference at the Wolf's Lair, Stauffenberg planted a briefcase bomb underneath Hitler's conference table and <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> left, claiming {{he had to make}} an important telephone call. Shortly after, the bomb exploded, fatally wounding three officers and the stenographer, who died shorty thereafter. Hitler survived with only minor injuries, as did everyone else who was shielded from the blast by the conference table leg.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} formed {{north of}} Hispaniola on August 25. It moved westward, passing over the Inagua Islands before striking {{the north coast}} of Cuba as a Category 2 hurricane on August27. The cyclone weakened to Category 1 strength as it crossed the island, close to Matanzas, but regained first Category 2 and then Category 3 strength as it moved north through the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone made landfall near Panama City, Florida, on August31 as a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, it <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> weakened to a tropical storm while moving northward through Georgia and South Carolina. The storm entered the Atlantic {{from the state of}} Virginia on next day and dissipated on September3.|$|E

5|$|After the two rivers merge, the Avon {{then turns}} south east {{away from the}} Cotswolds and <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> south into the clay Dauntsey Vale, where it is joined by the River Marden, until it reaches the biggest town so far, Chippenham. The wide vale {{is now known as}} the Avon Vale, and the river flows on via Lacock to Melksham, then turns north-west through Bradford on Avon, where the centre of the town grew up around the ford across the river Avon, hence the origin of the town's name ("Broad-Ford"). This was {{supplemented}} in Norman times by the stone bridge that still stands today. The Norman side is upstream, and has pointed arches; the newer side has curved arches. The Town Bridge and Chapel is a grade I listed building. It was originally a Packhorse bridge, but widened in the 17th century by rebuilding the western side. On the bridge stands a small building which was originally a chapel but later used as a town lock-up.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese {{operations}} to invade the Philippines began. Forty-three planes bombed Tuguegarao and Baguio in the first preemptive strike in Luzon. The Japanese forces <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> conducted a landing at Batan Island, and by December 17, General Masaharu Homma gave his estimate that {{the main component of}} the United States Air Force in the archipelago was destroyed. By January 2, Manila was under Japanese control and by January 9, Homma had cornered the remaining forces in Bataan. By April 9, the remaining of the combined Filipino-American force was forced to retire from Bataan to Corregidor. Meanwhile, Japanese invasions of Cebu (April 19) and Panay (April 20) were successful. By May 7, after the last of the Japanese attacks on Corregidor, General Jonathan M. Wainwright announced through a radio broadcast in Manila the surrender of the Philippines. Following Wainwright was General William F. Sharp, who surrendered Visayas and Mindanao on May 10.|$|E

5|$|In Season 4, Kurt joins Rachel in New York {{after she}} reveals {{that she is}} unhappy with her roommate and life at that point. After the {{encouragement}} of Blaine and his father, he decides to sell his car and fly to New York, where he finds a loft in Bushwick for him and Rachel to move into. Kurt applies for a job at Vogue.com and his editor, Isabelle Wright, who is also from Ohio, hires him partially based upon his portfolio of outfits and is impressed with his intuition and style. Early on, she leans on his support, and <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> returns his support when he decides to give Rachel a makeover in the Vogue closet. Instead of being angry, she loves his idea to do a musical makeover for the website and joins in the makeover. Kurt becomes increasingly busy with his job at Vogue, and Blaine cheats on him in Lima. He comes to New York to tell Kurt what happened, and they break up.|$|E
5|$|Males {{that have}} been unable to court a female {{successfully}} may try to achieve reproductive success in other ways. In sunfish species, like the bluegill, larger, older males known as parental males, which have successfully courted a female, construct nests for the eggs they fertilise. Smaller satellite males mimic female behaviour and coloration to access a nest and fertilise the eggs. Other males, known as sneaker males, lurk nearby and <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> dash to the nest, fertilising on the run. These males are smaller than satellite males. Sneaker males also exist in Oncorhynchus salmon, where small males that were unable to establish a position near a female dash in while the large dominant male is spawning with the female.|$|E
5|$|On June 1, a {{tropical}} depression formed off western Cuba from an organized cloud system. It moved slowly northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto traveled generally northeast on an erratic course, and briefly intensified to a Category1 hurricane, {{one of the}} earliest hurricanes of June, and the earliest date for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Due to strengthening vertical wind shear, Alberto <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> weakened into {{a tropical}} storm, doubled back to the west, and dissipated near the Florida Keys on June 6. Alberto {{is an example of a}} storm to enter the Gulf of Mexico and dissipating while never make landfall, which is an unusual event.|$|E

5|$|The typical hunting {{strategy}} of the diamond stingray is to cruise just above the sea floor, landing atop any prey encountered. It <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> levers its body up-and-down with its disc, producing negative pressure to extract the prey from its burrow. This ray has also been known to excavate large pits by undulating its disc and spitting jets of water, so as to uncover buried prey. Diamond stingrays are frequently trailed by smaller fishes, including Mexican hogfish (Bodianus diplotaenia), Galapagos porgies (Calamus taurinus), greybar grunts (Haemulon sexfasciatum), spinster wrasses (Halichoeres nichols), and long-spine porcupinefish (Diodon holocanthus), which {{take advantage of the}} invertebrates stirred up by the ray's activities. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium bullardi, A. dasi, A. rajivi, and A. soberoni, Anthocephalum currani, Parachristianella tiygonis, and Pseudochristianello elegantissima, the flukes Anaporrhutum euzeti and Probolitrema mexicana, and the monogenean Listrocephalos kearni.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} {{centered}} on Maroon 5 playing in a dimly-lit house/factory. Throughout {{the course of the}} video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with their instruments are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the end of the corridor, he is face to face with a wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E
5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which <b>then</b> <b>quickly</b> cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E
