He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> look great.

Despite the setback, the Wanderer meets with Eden who is revealed to be a sentient ZAX series supercomputer that {{took control of the}} Enclave after President Dick Richardson was killed off the West Coast. Seeking to repeat Richardson's plans, Eden reveals his intentions of using Project Purity to infect the water with a modified strain of FEV <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> toxic to any mutated life, thus killing off most life in the wasteland including humans. The Enclave, who would be immune to the effects because of their genetic [...] "purity" [...] {{as a result of their}} isolation, would be free to take control of the area. Forced to take a sample of the new FEV, the Wanderer leaves the base, regardless of doing so peacefully or convincing Eden to self-destruct. Returning to the Citadel, where news of the Enclave's possession of the G.E.C.K. is known to the Brotherhood, the Lone Wanderer joins them in an assault on the Jefferson Memorial, which is spearheaded through the use of a giant, military robot named Liberty Prime. Reaching the control room and dealing with Colonel Autumn, where the player has the choice to either convince Autumn to leave or they can kill him, Li informs the Wanderer that the purifier is now ready for activation, but that the code must be inputted manually within the control room, meaning whoever goes in would be subjected to lethal amounts of radiation. To make matters worse, the purifier has been damaged and will self-destruct if not activated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{islands of}} Madeira {{have a long}} {{winemaking}} history, {{dating back to the}} Age of Exploration when Madeira was a standard port of call for ships heading to the New World or East Indies. To prevent the wine from spoiling, neutral grape spirits were added. On the long sea voyages, the wines would be exposed to excessive heat and movement which transformed the flavour of the wine. This was discovered by the wine producers of Madeira when an unsold shipment of wine returned to the islands after a round trip. Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process which involves heating the wine. The wine is placed in stainless steel vats that are heated via a serpentine method. Hot water, at a temperature between 45 and 50 degrees Celsius , runs through this serpentine system for a period of never less than three months. Once this heating process ("estufagem") is completed, the wine is subjected to a [...] rest period ("estÃ¡gio") of at least 90 days in order to acquire the conditions <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible for the oenologist to finish the wine so that it may be placed in a bottle with the required quality guarantee. These wines may never be bottled and commercialised before the 31st of October of the second year following the harvesting and are typically batch wines. Because of this unique process, Madeira is a very robust wine that can be quite long lived even after being opened.|$|E
