My readers will be able from them to form some opinion {{as to whether or not}} slavery or apprenticeship existed in the Transvaal. If they come to the conclusion that it did, it must be borne in mind that what existed in the past will certainly exist again in the future. Natives are not now any fonder of working for Boers <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> few years back, and Boers must get labour somehow. If, on the other hand, it did not exist, then the Boers are a grossly slandered people, and all writers on the subject, from Livingstone down, have combined to take away their character.|$|E
6000|$|Holbach's {{work may}} be said to spring from the {{doctrine}} that the social deliverance of man depends on his intellectual deliverance, and that the key to his intellectual deliverance is only {{to be found in the}} substitution of Naturalism for Theism. What he means by Naturalism we shall proceed shortly to explain. The style, we may remark, notwithstanding the energy and coherence of the thought, is often diffuse and declamatory. Some one said of the System of Nature, that it contained at least four times too many words. Yet Voltaire, while professing extreme dislike of its doctrine, admitted that the writer had somehow caught the ear of the learned, of the ignorant, and of women. [...] "He is often clear," [...] said Voltaire, [...] "and sometimes eloquent, yet he may justly be reproached with declamation, with repeating himself, and with contradicting himself, like all the rest of them."[150] Galiani made an over-subtle criticism on it, when he complained of the want of coolness and self-possession in the style, and then said that it looked as if the writer were pressed less to persuade other people than to persuade himself. This was a crude impression. Nobody can have any doubt of the writer's profound sincerity, or of his earnest desire to make proselytes. He knows his own mind, and hammers his doctrines out with a hard and iterative stroke that hits its mark. Yet his literary tone, in spite of its declamatory pitch, not seldom sinks into a drone. Holbach's contemporaries were in too fierce contact with the tusks and hooked claws of the Church, to have any mind for the rhythm of a champion's sentences or the turn of his periods. But now that the efforts of the heterodox have taught the Churches to be better Christians <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> hundred years ago, we can afford to admit that Holbach is hardly more captivating in style, and not always more edifying in temper, than some of the Christian Fathers themselves.|$|E

50|$|Neoclassical {{models of}} the economy tend not to {{incorporate}} the idea of feedback.

50|$|The {{conservation}} status for pink fairy armadillo is still uncertain, {{and it is}} listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The decline in population for this species has generally been attributed to farming activities and predators including domestic dogs and cats. Pink fairy armadillos are found less commonly <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> few decades ago, and the field sightings have been rare and incidental. Individuals that have {{been caught in the}} wild had a tendency to die during or a couple days after they were transported from their natural habitat to captive facilities. There is a sole record for the longevity of a pink fairy armadillo that was held in captivity more than 4 years; however, that particular case lacks proper scientific description and thus cannot be considered fully valid.Armadillos' evolutionary distinctiveness, combined with their restricted geographic range, ongoing threats, and rarity makes the urgent conservation attention extremely important for these species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{archaeologist}} Barry Cunliffe {{believed that}} the Celts held [...] "reverence for {{the power of the}} head" [...] and that [...] "to own and display a distinguished head was to retain and control the power of the dead person" [...] while the archaeologist Anne Ross asserted that [...] "the Celts venerated the head as a symbol of divinity and the powers of the otherworld, and regarded it as the most important bodily member, the very seat of the soul." [...] The archaeologist Miranda Aldhouse-Green meanwhile stated that [...] "I refute any suggestion that the head itself was worshipped but it was clearly venerated as the most significant element in a human or divine image representing the whole." [...] The historian Ronald Hutton however criticised the idea of the [...] "cult of the human head", believing that both the literary and archaeological evidence did not warrant this conclusion, noting that [...] "the frequency with which human heads appears upon Celtic metalwork proves nothing more <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> favourite decorative motif, among several, and one just as popular among non-Celtic peoples." ...|$|E

50|$|Longitudinal {{analysis}} can explore associations {{in a way}} that cross-sectional studies cannot. EarlyBird established early on that insulin resistance is no longer associated with birth weight (a surrogate for gestational nutrition) - rather, the driver in contemporary children is weight gained during the early years. It showed how the large majority of excess weight gained by a child before puberty was gained before 5y. Obesity is not the result of inactivity in children, but the cause, and physical activity imposed at one time of day is compensated for - with remarkable precision - at another, supporting the concept of the ‘activitystat’, and questioning the value of imposing physical activity as a means of weight reduction in childhood. It went on to establish that today’s obese girls are largely the daughters of obese mothers (not fathers), and obese boys the sons of obese fathers (not mothers). The offspring of normal weight parents are no heavier <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> generation ago. Children who have the privilege of sports clubs record no more activity than those who do not and, worryingly, parents are unaware of their children's overweight. Height, like weight, is dependent on nutrition and, while the focus has been on overweight, there is evidence that many of today’s children are overheight, with independent metabolic consequences. Finally, EarlyBird offers unique evidence that the stress of insulin resistance among overweight children erodes their insulin production to the point where over 20% of the cohort showed evidence of pre-diabetes by the age of 16 years (in preparation). This is the most worrying spectre of all to have emerged from the EarlyBird study, because pre-diabetes frequently spells diabetes within a few years.|$|E
