5|$|Through July {{and early}} August, Montgomery and Schuyler {{continued}} to organize their force, raising {{the men and}} materials needed for an invasion. While they organized, Washington decided to expand the invasion, ordering Benedict Arnold to lead another invasion force that would invade Quebec from Maine. It was <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> Schuyler's army outside Quebec City, where they would launch a joint attack on to the city.|$|E
5|$|As it was {{the middle}} of the Chinese New Year, most of the Chinese Volunteers Corps were on leave, leaving Singapore almost defenceless against the mutiny. The British {{government}} was caught unprepared, and other mutineers went on a killing spree at Keppel Harbour and Pasir Panjang, killing 18 European and local civilians. Martial law was imposed and every available man from HMS Cadmus went ashore <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> British, Malay and Chinese Volunteer units and the small number of British regular troops forming part of the garrison. British Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram sent a radio message requesting help from any allied warships nearby.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the island's {{population}} {{consisted of}} about two hundred former pirates and several hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King's Pardon to those former pirates on the island {{who had not yet}} accepted it, and started to rebuild the island's fortifications, which had fallen into decrepitude under pirate domination. However, less than a month into his residence on New Providence, Rogers was faced with a double threat: Vane wrote, threatening <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas.|$|E

5|$|By 1 September, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{was down}} to 4,290 men, having {{suffered}} 500 casualties in its month of Korean service, and was preparing {{to move back to}} Pusan to evacuate to Japan. There, the brigade was <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> Marine reinforcements to re-form the 1st Marine Division, which would then be a part of X Corps for a counterattack at Inchon. However, the North Korean Great Naktong Offensive delayed these plans, as the brigade was needed to repel one more North Korean crossing of the Naktong River.|$|E
5|$|Following von Spee's {{withdrawal}} from the Pacific, Australia was belatedly ordered on 8 November 1914 <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> several Japanese cruisers off Mexico to resume {{the hunt for the}} German cruisers. By this time, the German squadron had made its way to the South Atlantic, and in early December was destroyed by a British squadron in the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Australia was sent to join the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron at Rosyth, Scotland, and was made flagship of the squadron after a short refit.|$|E
5|$|In {{late summer}} of 1777, British General John Burgoyne led a major {{invasion}} army south from Quebec, {{with the intention}} of splitting off rebellious New England. But General Howe in New York took his army south to Philadelphia instead of going up the Hudson River <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> Burgoyne near Albany—a major strategic mistake. Meanwhile, Washington rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe, while closely following the action in upstate New York, where the patriots were led by General Philip Schuyler and his successor Horatio Gates. The ensuing pitched battles at Philadelphia were too complex for Washington's relatively inexperienced men and they were defeated.|$|E

5|$|Kawaguchi's Center Body of 3,000 troops {{began their}} attacks {{on a ridge}} south of Henderson Field {{beginning}} on 12 September in what was later called the Battle of Edson's Ridge. After numerous frontal assaults, Kawaguchi's attack was repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese, who retreated back into the jungle on 14 September. Oka's assault {{in the west and}} the Kuma Battalion's assault in the east were also repulsed by the U.S. Marines over the same two days. Kawaguchi's units were ordered to withdraw west to the Matanikau Valley <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> Oka's unit {{on the west side of}} the Lunga Perimeter. Most of Kawaguchi's men reached the Matanikau by 20 September.|$|E
5|$|Readville has {{an unusual}} layout {{because it is}} built on the {{crossing}} of two rail lines. The Fairmount Line and Franklin Line each have a single track atop an embankment. The Fairmount Line has a single side platform, while the Franklin Line has two. The Fairmount Line track continues atop a bridge over the Northeast Corridor <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> the Franklin Line. This connection is used by several trains each rush hour, allowing trains from the Franklin Line to avoid congestion in the crowded Southwest Corridor.|$|E
5|$|The Duke {{repeatedly}} {{sought a}} post with Allied forces fighting against France, but {{was sent to}} the Continent only as an observer. In 1807, he advocated sending British troops <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> the Prussians and Swedes and attack the French at Stralsund (today, in northeastern Germany). The Grenville government refused to send forces. Shortly afterwards, the government fell, and the new Prime Minister, the Duke of Portland, agreed to send Ernest with 20,000 troops. However, they were sent too late: the French defeated Prussia and Sweden at the Battle of Stralsund before Ernest and his forces could reach the town.|$|E

5|$|At 12:00, Dornal de Guy on Manche {{pulled away}} from her {{battered}} opponent, obeying Hamelin's order <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> his flagship. Hamelin then sent Manche and Créole after the slow Charlton and United Kingdom, using Vénus to chase Windham. Stewart had used the break in the action to effect rudimentary repairs to his battered ship and, with the agreement of his officers, determined to abandon the other ships and escape alone. Manche and the corvette rapidly overhauled and captured Charlton and United Kingdom, their captains Charles Mortlock and William D'Esterre making no serious attempt to resist or escape. Vénus however became embroiled in a lengthy chase as Stewart threw all not essential stores overboard {{in an effort to}} make his ship lighter and faster. For five days, Windham led Vénus in pursuit across the Bay of Bengal and it was not until 10:30 on 22 November that Hamelin finally closed with the British ship and forced her surrender.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} Ways and Means committee, but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E
5|$|Early in March 1676, a Danish {{fleet of}} 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but {{experienced}} adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania {{and the island}} of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another {{in the battle of}} Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.|$|E

5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must {{go out and try to}} help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle also {{despatched}} several officers, including Hoste, {{to operate}} independently. Hoste in Bacchante returned to Apulia and attacked {{a string of}} ports, castles and anchorages, while Captain George Cadogan in HMS Havannah effectively halted the movement of supplies along the northern Italian coast {{in support of the}} approaching Austrian armies. In June, Fremantle himself led his whole squadron against the important port city of Fiume, seizing or burning 90 vessels from the harbour and huge quantities of naval stores after a sharp battle in the city streets. Three months later, Fremantle attacked the city of Trieste, blockading it from the sea, bombarding its defences and landing marines and cannon <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> the besieging Austrian armies and force the city's surrender.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Rowland officially became {{ambassador}} for MTV's Staying Alive Foundation, {{which aims to}} reduce stigma against people living with HIV and AIDS. She visited projects in Tanzania and Kenya to promote the charity, and underwent an HIV test in Africa {{to raise awareness of}} the disease. In 2009, Rowland connected with Serve.MTV.com, MTV's platform to connect young people with local volunteerism opportunities, for a series of on-air PSAs. From battling homelessness to beautifying impoverished neighborhoods to saving whales, Rowland was joined by the likes of Cameron Diaz, will.i.am, and Sean Kingston as they discuss causes they volunteer to support, and urge young people <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>with</b> their friends in making civic service a part of their lifestyle. That same year, she spearheaded a bone marrow drive, and joined fellow singers Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to create T-shirts for River Island in aid of the Prince's Trust, profits from which help change young lives.|$|E
