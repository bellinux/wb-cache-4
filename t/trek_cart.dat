50|$|Infernal Machine is an action-adventure and, as such, {{features}} {{a hybrid of}} various gameplay mechanics. The player sees Indiana Jones from a third-person perspective and controls him through 17 levels of a fully polygonal 3D world. A recurring element of Infernal Machine are platforming sections, for which a combination of running, jumping, climbing, {{and the use of}} the protagonist's trademark bullwhip is required. Furthermore, several human, animal and supernatural enemies are encountered during the course of the game, which the player can fight off with numerous firearms, the aforementioned whip, and a machete. In addition to these obstacles, the game largely focuses on solving puzzles and discovering treasures. Some levels include vehicle-themed portions such as rafting, jeep <b>treks,</b> and mine <b>cart</b> chases. The main objective of the game is to collect four machine parts in order to complete the titular Infernal Machine.|$|R
