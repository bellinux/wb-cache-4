5|$|As a Klingon moon, Praxis, explodes without warning, the {{starship}} USS Excelsior, commanded by Captain Hikaru Sulu, {{is struck by}} the shock wave and its crew discovers {{that much of the}} moon has been obliterated. The loss of their key energy production facility and the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> homeworld's ozone layer throws <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> Empire into turmoil. No longer able to maintain a hostile footing, the Klingons sue for peace with their longstanding enemy, the United Federation of Planets. Accepting the proposal before the Klingons revert to a more belligerent approach, Starfleet sends the USS Enterprise-A to meet with <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> Chancellor, Gorkon, and escort him to negotiations on Earth. Enterprises captain, James T. Kirk, whose son David was murdered by Klingons years earlier, opposes the negotiations and resents his assignment.|$|E
5|$|In orbit, the {{undermanned}} Enterprise is {{attacked and}} disabled by Kruge. In the standoff that follows, Kruge orders {{that one of}} the hostages on the surface be executed. Marcus is killed defending Saavik and Spock. Kirk and company feign surrender and activate the Enterprises self-destruct sequence, killing <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> boarding party while the Enterprise crew transports to the planet's surface. Promising the secret of Genesis, Kirk lures Kruge to the planet and has him beam his crew to <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> vessel. As the Genesis planet disintegrates, Kirk and Kruge engage in a fistfight; Kirk emerges victorious after kicking Kruge off a cliff into a lava flow. Kirk and his officers take control of <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> ship and head to Vulcan.|$|E

25|$|Several {{decades later}} <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> {{encountered}} <b>the</b> Federation and developed Klingon-human fusions by kidnapping humans from lone starships. <b>The</b> <b>Klingons</b> knew about <b>the</b> Federation for {{nearly twenty years}} before the Federation learned of <b>the</b> <b>Klingons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinction}} between empire-building races—such as <b>the</b> <b>Klingons,</b> <b>the</b> Humans and Vulcans with their Federation, and the Romulans—and less driven races, whom <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> use as servants (kuve).|$|R
25|$|Several {{decades later}} <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> {{encountered}} a race {{they call the}} Kinshaya, {{on the side of}} their empire opposite to the Federation. This led to a period of total war which nearly resulted in the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> by <b>the</b> Kinshaya. The war lasted for five years and ended in a stalemate with continuing skirmishes. Unable to expand in this direction, <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> started a war of expansion against the Federation, called The Four Years War. It ended in a humiliating loss by <b>the</b> <b>Klingons,</b> and they conceded territory to the Federation. After a decade of rebuilding, another effort at expansion into the Federation was halted when <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> encountered <b>the</b> Organians (as seen in the original series episode Errand of Mercy).|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Sulan kills Durst and grafts {{his face}} {{over his own}} to appear more {{appealing}} to <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> Torres. Klingon Torres escapes from Sulan's laboratory, and rescues her human version. After arguing about their respective weaknesses, and past expulsion from Starfleet Academy, the two halves formulate a plan. Human Torres suggests shutting down the shields for the complex so that Voyager can transport them to the ship, while <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> Torres deals with guards. Chakotay, disguised as a Vidiian guard {{with the help of}} , breaks into the facility at the same time Torres deactivates the shields. Klingon Torres sacrifices herself to protect {{the rest of the crew}} members from Sulan. Transported back to Voyager, Klingon Torres refuses medical help to die an honorable death. The Doctor explains that Human Torres would not survive without her Klingon half and restores her to her original self by reintegrating <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> DNA. Human Torres admits to feeling incomplete without her Klingon half. After being restored, she realizes that she will spend the rest of her life dealing with her inner conflict.|$|E
50|$|The Original Series {{missions}} {{take place}} between Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. The first mission involves the Enterprise escorting a Vulcan ambassador to {{peace talks with}} <b>the</b> <b>Klingons.</b> <b>The</b> next few missions see the player pursuing <b>the</b> <b>Klingons.</b> In <b>the</b> last mission, <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> are searching for fragments of the Genesis device (featured in Star Trek II) whilst the Genesis Planet explodes and the player must outrun the shockwave.|$|R
2500|$|For [...] (1979), <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> were retconned {{and their}} {{appearance}} and behavior radically changed. To give the aliens {{a more sophisticated}} and threatening demeanor, <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> were depicted with ridged foreheads, snaggled and prominent teeth, and a defined language and alphabet. Lee Cole, a production designer, used red gels and primitive shapes in <b>the</b> design of <b>Klingon</b> consoles and ship interiors, which took on a dark and moody atmosphere. The alphabet was designed as angular, with sharp edges harkening to the Klingons' militaristic focus. Costume designer Robert Fletcher created new uniforms for <b>the</b> <b>Klingons,</b> reminiscent of feudal Japanese armor.|$|R
2500|$|The {{culture of}} <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> began to {{resemble}} revised western stereotypes of civilizations {{such as the}} Zulu, the Vikings, and various Native American nations — as a proud, warlike and principled race. Whereas <b>the</b> TOS <b>Klingons</b> served as an allegory to contemporary totalitarian regimes, <b>The</b> Next Generation <b>Klingons</b> held principles {{more in line with}} Bushidō; actor Michael Dorn stated that without <b>the</b> revision in <b>Klingon</b> culture, his character, Worf, would not have been a Starfleet officer. With the first Klingon-centric story in The Next Generation, the first-season episode [...] "Heart of Glory", <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> once again became {{an important part of the}} Star Trek universe, and by the advent of <b>the</b> series , <b>Klingons</b> had become heroes rather than villains, albeit often at cross purposes to the Federation.|$|R
5|$|Realizing his foolishness, Sybok sacrifices {{himself in}} an effort to combat the {{creature}} and allow the others to escape. Intent on stopping the being, Kirk orders the Enterprise to fire a photon torpedo at their location, to little effect. Spock and McCoy are beamed back to the ship, but Klaa's vessel attacks the Enterprise before Kirk can be transported aboard. The vengeful entity reappears and tries to kill Kirk when Klaa's vessel destroys it in a hail of fire. Kirk is beamed aboard <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> ship, where Spock and <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> General Korrd force Klaa to stand down. The Enterprise and Klingon crews celebrate a new détente, and Kirk, Spock, and McCoy resume their vacation at Yosemite.|$|E
5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it. The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> Empire is ready for it.|$|E
5|$|To save money, many sets, {{particularly}} interiors, were redresses {{of existing}} sets. The Enterprise bridge was reconfigured {{to stand in}} for the Grissom, with the chairs reupholstered and the central computer consoles moved to modify the floor plan. An Earth bar and <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> medical bay were redresses of the Enterprise sickbay. <b>The</b> <b>Klingon</b> bridge was a set that Nimoy appropriated from another production. Many blinking consoles were rented from a props company rather than being fabricated. The Enterprise bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though the floor was repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better. The most drastic change was made to Spock's quarters. Nimoy had felt the previous grey color scheme did not express a Vulcan style, and had it brightened with yellows and oranges.|$|E
5000|$|The pilot {{turns out}} to be Cyrano Jones, an intergalactic trader well known to Captain Kirk and crew (Kirk refers to Jones as a [...] "nuisance"). <b>The</b> <b>Klingons</b> desperately want Jones for {{introducing}} <b>the</b> tribble to <b>Klingon</b> planets where it has become a major pest, and for stealing a glommer, an animal <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> created via genetic engineering to prey on tribbles. Jones had stolen the only glommer prototype in existence.|$|R

5|$|Believing Marcus {{killed his}} crew, Khan {{engineers}} attacks on a Starfleet archive and Starfleet leadership, before fleeing to <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> homeworld Qo'noS. Marcus arms Enterprise with 72 advanced torpedoes and sends Kirk and Enterprise to Qo'noS to kill Harrison. Against orders, Kirk attempts to capture him alive. Upon learning {{the number of}} torpedoes on board Enterprise, Khan surrenders, revealing his identity, the presence of his followers in the torpedoes, {{and the reasons for}} his attacks.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Phlox, {{played by}} John Billingsley, is {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise. A Denobulan member of the Inter-Species Medical Exchange, Phlox is brought aboard the Enterprise to care for <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> {{passenger}} during the ship's first mission. Afterwards, he volunteers to stay on, delighting {{in the experience of}} humanity taking its first steps onto the galactic stage. An exceedingly cheerful alien, Dr. Phlox uses many animals and naturalistic cures in practicing medicine, in addition to the usual technological methods.|$|E
5|$|Other actors {{from the}} {{television}} series who returned include Majel Barrett as Christine Chapel, a doctor aboard the Enterprise; and Grace Lee Whitney as Janice Rand, formerly one of Kirk's yeomen and now a transporter operator. David Gautreaux, who had been cast as Xon in the aborted second television series, cameos as Branch, {{the commander of the}} Epsilon 9 communications station. Mark Lenard portrays <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> commander in the film's opening sequence; he also played Spock's father, Sarek, in the television series and in later feature films.|$|E
2500|$|With {{a greatly}} {{expanded}} budget for makeup and effects, <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> were completely redesigned in [...] (1979), acquiring ridged foreheads {{that created a}} continuity error [...] not explained by Star Trek canon until 2005. In later films and in the spin-off series , the militaristic traits of <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> were bolstered by an increased sense of honor and strict warrior code {{similar to those of}} bushido.|$|R
5000|$|The Organians {{disguise}} Kirk {{as one of}} {{them and}} have Spock pose as a Vulcan merchant of trillium. <b>The</b> <b>Klingons</b> seize control of the planet without resistance and install <b>the</b> ranking <b>Klingon</b> officer, Kor, as the military governor. Kor, noticing that Kirk is the only Organian who doesn't smile all the time, takes a liking to him and demands that he act as the Organian liaison. Spock is taken for questioning to verify his background as a trader but resists the [...] "mind sifter" [...] device that <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> use.|$|R
5000|$|A {{song about}} <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> of Star Trek, set during events from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine ...|$|R
5|$|The crew of {{the newly}} {{commissioned}} USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A) are enjoying shore leave after the starship's shakedown cruise goes poorly. At Yosemite National Park James T. Kirk, recently demoted back to Captain after {{the events of the}} previous two films, is camping with Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy. Their leave is interrupted when the Enterprise is ordered by Starfleet Command to rescue human, Klingon, and Romulan hostages on the planet Nimbus III. Learning of the Enterprises mission, <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> Captain Klaa decides to pursue Kirk for personal glory.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ship}} unable to {{decrease}} speed below warp 5, and the warp core reaching dangerous levels, Columbia and Commander Tucker rendezvous to provide assistance. However the crew realise that the transporter {{cannot be used}} at warp, so the ships will need to maneuver in close proximity in order for Tucker to be transferred. Captain Archer releases Lieutenant Reed from the brig to perform the transfer. Once on Enterprise, Tucker successfully performs a rapid non-standard cold boot on the warp engine, which purges <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> subroutines.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{approaches}} within transporter range, and beams an away team (including Phlox) to the facility. They are soon detected, however, {{and imprisoned}} with the facility's staff. Meanwhile, Commander T'Pol, having {{lost contact with}} the team, attempts to destroy the station, but <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> ship intervenes. Malik uses Phlox's friendship to finally coerce the security codes from Lucas (by threatening to expose him to a pathogen as well). Soong, who had previously stolen 19 genetically enhanced and frozen embryos from C-12, is now able to access the remaining 1,800, a carry-over from the Eugenics Wars. Soong and the Augments then escape, but not before Malik kills Smike, helps himself {{to a number of}} pathogen samples, and sets the viral containment fields to fail.|$|E
50|$|In the episode, {{an alien}} force drives {{the crew of}} the Enterprise into brutal {{conflict}} with <b>the</b> <b>Klingons.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{this book}} {{a race of}} aliens who have fought with <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> for centuries, called the Kreel, find a large stash of {{advanced}} weapons hidden on a strange planet on the Kreel-Klingon border. The Kreel are as scavengers and had, plundered the destroyed colony that was Worf's childhood home. They declare war on <b>the</b> <b>Klingons,</b> and <b>the</b> crew of the USS Enterprise are asked {{to help with the}} peace negotiations.|$|R
50|$|As {{the war is}} now in full swing, Starfleet is {{continually}} finding itself outmaneuvered by the Dominion, who seem to know everything Starfleet is doing. The {{reason for this is}} a massive sensor array in a remote region of space near Betazed, hidden in an asteroid belt. Starfleet decides that to have any chance in the war, they must destroy the array. Having done so, however, it soon becomes apparent that even without that tactical advantage, the Dominion are building ships much faster than either Starfleet or <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> can. A Klingon task force is dispatched to attack and cripple a Dominion shipyard, but a Dominion fleet is simultaneously sent to attack <b>the</b> now defenceless <b>Klingon</b> border. As such, Starfleet must race {{to get in touch with}} <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> and defend <b>the</b> borders until <b>the</b> <b>Klingons</b> return.|$|R
5|$|Greg Jein, {{best known}} as the builder of the alien {{mothership}} from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime Star Trek fan who had constructed the props for The Final Frontier, but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from Buck Rogers, while the frong was detailed with a prop from Buckaroo Banzai. Elements from The Final Frontier were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in The Final Frontier became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the zero gravity scenes. Since <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. <b>The</b> <b>Klingon</b> sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.|$|E
5|$|In 2273, a Starfleet {{monitoring}} station, Epsilon Nine, detects {{an alien}} force, {{hidden in a}} massive cloud of energy, moving through space towards Earth. The cloud destroys three of <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> Empire's new K't'inga-class warships and the monitoring station en route. On Earth, the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; her former commanding officer, James T. Kirk, has been promoted to Admiral and works in San Francisco as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Starfleet dispatches Enterprise to investigate the cloud entity as the ship {{is the only one}} in intercept range, requiring her new systems to be tested in transit.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) has a near-death {{experience}} and {{is sent to}} <b>the</b> <b>Klingon</b> version of Hell known as Gre'thor. There she encounters her Klingon mother Miral (Karen Austin), who is damned because of Torres' refusal to fully accept her own identity as a Klingon. After being resuscitated by the Voyager crew, Torres becomes intent on revisiting Gre'thor to save her mother. The episode also guest stars Eric Pierpoint as Kortar, who ferries {{the souls of the}} dishonored on the Barge of the Dead, and Sherman Augustus as the dead Klingon Hij'Qa.|$|E
