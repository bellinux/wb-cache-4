30|$|To {{understand}} classroom interactions {{we use a}} model {{based on}} the notion of a symbolic economy (Bourdieu, 1980, 1998) and a didactical contract (Brousseau, 1997).

The foundational hypothesis is that inside educational institutions, the teacher and her students enter into this economy because of their obligation to a didactical contract that brings students and teachers together to <b>teach</b> <b>and</b> <b>learn</b> mathematics. A didactical contract specifies what it means to <b>teach</b> <b>and</b> <b>learn</b> <b>and</b> what the content is that needs to be taught <b>and</b> <b>learned.</b>|$|R
