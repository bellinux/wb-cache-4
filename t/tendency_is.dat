The first repetitive dive {{uses the same}} repetitive group selection as the U.S. Navy tables but subsequent dives use more conservative tables which place the diver in a higher repetitive group than the Navy tables would for the same profile.

5|$|Theorists {{also try}} to {{generate}} or modify models {{to take into account}} new data.

In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson's primary {{offensive}} attribute is his shot. Rather {{than relying}} on stickhandling in the offensive zone, his primary <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> to direct the puck towards the net, hoping for a rebound. Before becoming an offensive threat later in his career, he established himself first as a defensively responsible forward in the NHL, earning time on the penalty kill and against opposing team's top players. Strong on his skates, he is also noted to play aggressively, as well. As a result, Samuelsson {{is known as a}} versatile, two-way player.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} develop the {{ontology}} of tendencies {{for use in the}} representation of medical knowledge, <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> compared with other kinds of entities possessing the realizable-realization-structure, specifically: dispositions, propensities, abilities and virtues. The peculiarities of <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> discussed and a standard schema of <b>tendency</b> ascription <b>is</b> developed in order to represent the relations between the ascriptions of tendency tokens to particulars and the ascriptions of tendency types to universals. Two non-standard cases and their epistemic variants are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E

50|$|In social psychology, group {{polarization}} {{refers to}} the tendency for a group to make decisions that are more extreme than the initial inclination of its members. These more extreme decisions are towards greater risk if individuals' initial <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> to be risky and towards greater caution if individuals' initial <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> to be cautious. The phenomenon also holds that a group's attitude toward a situation may change {{in the sense that}} the individuals' initial attitudes have strengthened and intensified after group discussion, a phenomenon known as attitude polarization.|$|R

Decrease in number of platelets was not specific to the massive transfusions of preserved blood, and was also observed in the cases transfused saline solution, red cell suspension, hemolized blood, massive fresh blood or plasma.

25|$|The {{story of}} Jonah has {{numerous}} theological implications, {{and this has}} long been recognized. In early translations of the Hebrew Bible, Jewish translators tended to remove anthropomorphic imagery {{in order to prevent}} the reader from misunderstanding the ancient texts. This <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> evidenced in both the Aramaic translations (e.g. the Targums) and the Greek translations (e.g. the Septuagint). As far as the Book of Jonah is concerned, Targum Jonah offers a good example of this.|$|E

They also thought it was selfish of parents to want to control their children and that this did not give room for the child to grow as their own person.|$|E

The theory does not appear to address how trait-relevant behavioral <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> converted into work behaviors.

40|$|The present thesis {{presents}} {{a body of}} research examining collectivistic (vs. individualistic) tendencies in status hierarchies. The literature on natural hierarchies (social class, gender and ethnicity) shows that individualistic <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> conspicuous in high-status groups, whereas collectivistic <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> prominent in low-status groups. These status differences are assumed to stem from specific socialization processes that occur in high-status and in low-status groups. This thesis extends this perspective by proposing a mere status hypothesis which states that socialization processes are sufficient but not necessary to predict the status discrepancy on collectivistic (vs. individualistic) <b>tendencies.</b> It <b>is</b> argued that the mere asymmetry on a valued dimension between the ingroup and a relevant outgroup would drive collectivistic or individualistic tendencies depending on the ingroup status. A pilot study and sixteen studies tested this hypothesis and explored the boundary conditions in which status differences on collectivistic (vs. individualistic) <b>tendencies</b> <b>are</b> observed...|$|R

The same <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> evident in Metzinger's Portrait of Apollinaire exhibited in the same salon. According to Apollinaire this was the 'first Cubist portrait'. Apollinaire himself has pointed out in his book The Cubist Painters (1913), that Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist.|$|E
25|$|Self-verification theory {{predicts that}} when people {{interact}} with others, {{there is a general}} tendency for them to bring others to see them as they see themselves. This <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> especially pronounced when they start out believing that the other person has misconstrued them, apparently because people compensate by working especially hard to bring others to confirm their self-views. People will even stop working on tasks to which they have been assigned if they sense that their performance is eliciting non-verifying feedback.|$|E
25|$|In {{representative}} democracies, it may {{not benefit}} incumbents to conduct fair elections. A study showed that incumbents who rig elections stay in office 2.5 times as long as those who permit fair elections. Democracies in countries with high per capita income {{have been found to}} be less prone to violence, but in countries with low incomes the <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> the reverse. Election misconduct is more likely in countries with low per capita incomes, small populations, rich in natural resources, and a lack of institutional checks and balances. Sub-Saharan countries, as well as Afghanistan, all tend to fall into that category.|$|E

25|$|Parachutists, {{especially}} those flying smaller sport canopies, often land with dangerous amounts of kinetic energy, {{and for this}} reason, improper landings are the cause of more than 30% of all skydiving related injuries and deaths. Often, injuries sustained during parachute landing are caused when a single outstretched limb, such as a hand or foot, is extended separately {{from the rest of}} the body, causing it to sustain forces disproportional to the support structures within. This <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> displayed in the accompanying chart, which shows the significantly higher proportion of wrist and ankle injuries among the 186 injured in a 110,000 parachute jump study.|$|E
25|$|The tallit gadol is {{typically}} either all white, white with black stripes, white with blue stripes, or white with twelve-colored stripes. The all-white and black-and-white varieties {{have traditionally been}} the most common, with the blue-and-white variety, in the past {{said to be in}} remembrance of the blue thread or tekhelet, becoming increasingly prevalent in recent years among non-Orthodox Jews on account of the association of blue and white with the State of Israel. The all-white variety is customary among Sepharadic communities, whereas among Ashkenazic communities the <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> toward white tallitot with black stripes. One explanation for the significance of the black stripes is that their black color symbolizes the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the exile of the Jews from the land of Israel.|$|E
