5|$|Following {{the battle}} Philippicus rewarded <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> had {{distinguished}} themselves and divided {{the spoils of}} the defeated Persians among them. He then proceeded to invade Arzanene again. However, his attempt to capture the fortress of Chlomaron was thwarted when Kardarigan arrived with reinforcements. The Byzantine army retreated to the fortress of Aphumon, fighting rear-guard actions with the shadowing Persians.|$|E

5|$|In every {{review and}} study {{conducted}} to date, the courage, valor, and discipline of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> fought at Wanat have been universally praised. These soldiers were well-trained, well-led, and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in Wanat. They persevered {{in a fashion}} that deserves broad recognition of their bravery and tenacity. Our hearts {{go out to the}} families of the fallen soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{concerns}} for secrecy kept the military designation of the Katyushas from being known by <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> operated them. They were called by code {{names such as}} Kostikov guns, after {{the head of the}} RNII, the Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute, and finally classed as Guards Mortars. The name BM-13 was only allowed into secret documents in 1942, and remained classified until after the war.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 artwork here {{is called}} In Memory of The Lost Battalion by Pablo Tauler.

A monument to <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> died stands at CFB Shilo (as Camp Shilo has been redesignated), where a memorial parade is conducted each year on the anniversary of the crash. It was dedicated on November 21, 1952.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd centuryBC, Roman {{territory}} saw {{an overall}} decline in population, partially {{due to the}} huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into lower classes of the census and the proletarii. As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of}} the state, since many of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> made up its lower classes were now impoverished proletarii in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had advised her to fabricate the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{felt the}} money from the bonds should not go to the soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from <b>the</b> <b>soldiers,</b> <b>who</b> had shown little faith in the country's future. The process of {{attempting}} to track down the original bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton. As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency on a national scale.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, US12 was {{dedicated}} to the 32nd Infantry Division. The division used a red arrow as its insignia to symbolize how they pierced the German Hindenburg Line during World War I and Japanese defenses during World War II. <b>The</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> composed the division were drawn from the Michigan and Wisconsin National Guards. After other proposals failed, US12 was named the Red Arrow Highway on August 30, 1952, and dedicated on March 22, 1953. Jurisdiction {{of most of the}} roadways that composed US12 at that time has passed to local governments as I-94 was built, but the highway still bears that name in Berrien County.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{as part of}} Remembrance Week observances for the Canadian Senate, five {{family members}} of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> died in the crash were {{presented}} with Memorial Crosses. Other family members were due to receive them at a later date. The dead were not given posthumous Canadian Volunteer Service Medals as they never reached the Korean theatre; Tom Boutillier, a survivor of the crash, considers that an injustice and has campaigned for medals to be awarded.|$|E

5|$|In a naval {{battle the}} Athenians led by Pericles and nine other generals {{defeated}} {{the forces of}} Samos and imposed on the island an Athenian administration. When the Samians revolted against Athenian rule, Pericles compelled the rebels to capitulate after a tough siege of eight months, which resulted in substantial discontent among the Athenian sailors. Pericles then quelled a revolt in Byzantium and, {{when he returned to}} Athens, gave a funeral oration to honor <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> died in the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{constructed}} by George Mills {{under the direction}} of Richard Worsley, the Captain of the Island, on land belonging to the Crown, possibly on the site of a church destroyed during the events of 1543. Henry had dissolved the monasteries in England a few years before, and stone from the local Quarr Abbey was probably reused {{in the construction of the}} castle. It was finished by 1547, when Mills was paid £1,000 for his work and to discharge <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> had been guarding the site during the project.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{arrived at}} Fremantle on 18 February. The {{sight of the}} Australian coast had been eagerly {{anticipated}} by <b>the</b> <b>soldiers,</b> <b>who</b> broke into cheers when it became visible shortly before noon that day. Nieuw Amsterdam and Queen of Bermuda berthed in Fremantle Harbour, {{and the other three}} troop ships dropped anchor at Gage Roads. The Western Australian members of the 9th Division were disembarked, and the ships loaded supplies and mail. As Queen of Bermuda left the convoy at Fremantle, her remaining 517 passengers were transferred to Nieuw Amsterdam. This resulted in considerable overcrowding {{for the remainder of the}} liner's voyage.|$|E

5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} {{had left the}} county to search for armed resistance {{in other parts of}} Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by the arrests. It is likely that the rumor of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated claims by Republicans that the cabin was a fort. A structure that may have once been this cabin was rediscovered on July 13, 2007. In December 1864, <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> left Columbia County went on to Clearfield County to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} prosecuted {{four people}} {{in connection with the}} 1991 killing of the prisoners of war, and convicted and sentenced them to 15 to 20 years in prison. Another person was tried and convicted in connection with the 1993 bombing, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In 1998, the Chapel of Nativity of Mary was built in Kusonje at the initiative of the parents of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> were killed there, and a commemorative plaque containing the names of the 23 killed was placed at the chapel. The events of 1991 and 1993 are commemorated annually in Kusonje, with civilian and military representatives attending. In 2014, a feature film titled Number 55, based on the 1991 events in Kusonje, was released. The title of the film refers to the number of the house where the ZNG troops took shelter on 8–9 September 1991.|$|E
5|$|In late 1863, the New Zealand {{government}} requested {{troops to}} assist in the invasion of the Waikato province against the Māori. Promised settlement on confiscated land, more than 2,500 Australians (over half of whom were from Victoria) were recruited to form four Waikato Regiments. Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers. Despite experiencing arduous conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle, and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties. Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko, Pukekohe East, Titi Hill, Ōrākau and Te Ranga. Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action. The conflict was over by 1864, and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867. However, many of <b>the</b> <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities {{by the end of the}} decade, while many others had returned to Australia.|$|E
