60|$|Cecilia {{returned}} to her scattered thoughts. They lay there still, with a gleam of sun from the low window smearing their importance; she felt somehow {{that it did not}} now matter very much whether she and Stephen, in the interests of science, saw that man fall from his balloon, or, in the interests of art, heard Herr von Kraaffe sing his Polish songs; she experienced, too, almost a revulsion in favour of <b>tinned</b> <b>milk.</b> After meditatively tearing up her note to Messrs.

50|$|Kumar was {{inspired}} to take up wrestling by his father, himself a wrestler, and his cousin Sandeep. Sandeep later stopped competing as the family could only support one wrestler. Kumar trained in pehlwani wrestling at the akhada (wrestling school) in the Chhatrasal Stadium {{from the age of}} 14. With minimal funds and poor training facilities for wrestling in India, even for the 2008 Olympic team, his family made sure he obtained the necessary dietary supplements by sending him <b>tinned</b> <b>milk,</b> ghee and fresh vegetables. He is a devoted Hindu and strict vegetarian.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{intersection}} of consumption, Christianity and the nation in Western Province, Papua New Guinea. It examines {{the significance of the}} adoption of European-introduced clothing and the consumption of trade store foods like tea, tinned fish, rice, sugar and <b>tinned</b> <b>milk</b> for Gogodala communities of PNG. Although initially disgusted by the idea of consuming substances that seemed reminiscent of mother's milk, Gogodala now embrace trade store foods with enthusiasm. The paper traces the transformation of Gogodala attitudes to such products in terms of the development of a 'national culture' as well as a more globalising Christianity. It suggests that, for the Gogodala, consumption is an arena for what Foster has termed 'everyday nation making'. Yet, in this case, 'the nation' is understood and realised through a metaphoric association with Christian others, particularly Europeans. The basis of national subjectivity for the Gogodala, then, is an enduring relationship between Gogodala and expatriate Europeans. Alison Dundo...|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{increasing}} importation of infant formula (powdered formula) from foreign countries, the milk powder shortage intensified greatly {{due to the}} intense parallel trading activity in Hong Kong.

Furthermore, ringleader traders hired women with children and the elderly to help them to transport the milk powder across the border to avoid being inspected.|$|R

50|$|Carnation {{built an}} {{evaporated}} milk factory in Dumfries {{that opened in}} 1935, eventually constructing three units producing <b>tin</b> cans, evaporated <b>milk</b> and latterly Coffeemate. The original factory had private siding access to the station's good yard, which gave access for milk trains to the facility, in both delivering raw product as well as distribution to London. Milk trains stopped in the mid-1970s. The US-parent company was bought by Nestle in 1985, after which {{a decline in the}} facility began. CoffeeMate production ceased in 2000, after which the site was fully redeveloped as an industrial estate.|$|R
