5|$|Another {{study in}} July 2017 by Miriam Hirt et al., {{published}} in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of Tyrannosaurus was around 17mph (27km/h). Other dinosaurs including Triceratops, Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus were also analyzed in the study, as were many living animals like elephants, cheetahs and rabbits. The speed of Tyrannosaurus was calculated by factoring its weight in conjunction with the medium upon which it travelled (in the case of the theropod, land) and by the assumptions that: one; animals reach their maximum speeds during comparatively short sprints, and two; Newton's laws of motion dictate that mass has to overcome inertia. It found that large animals like Tyrannosaurus exhaust their energy reserves long before they reach their theoretical <b>top</b> <b>speed,</b> resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and speed. The equation can calculate the <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of an animal with almost 90% accuracy and can be applied to both living and extinct animals.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} routes out of Atlanta being {{considered}} for high/higher speed rail. In 2012, during the study for the Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement, two main alternatives for higher speed rail have been considered. The first alternative is called Shared Use with <b>top</b> <b>speeds</b> of 90 mph to 110 mph. The second alternative is called Hybrid High Performance with <b>top</b> <b>speeds</b> of 130 mph. There are also high-speed rail alternatives in the same study with <b>top</b> <b>speeds</b> of 180 mph to 220 mph or higher.|$|R

The Tier 1 Draft EIS was {{released to the public}} in early 2014 and eliminates the alternatives with <b>tops</b> <b>speeds</b> of 160 mph and 220 mph due to high costs. The five alternatives that remain under consideration include the base alternative with <b>top</b> <b>speeds</b> remaining at 79 mph as well as higher <b>speed</b> rail with <b>top</b> <b>speeds</b> of 90 mph (options A and B), 110 mph, and 125 mph.|$|R

5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter.

5|$|Dragon Challenge (known as Dueling Dragons from 1999 to 2010) {{was a pair}} of intertwined, {{inverted}} {{roller coasters}} in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter area of Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, United States. The ride was themed to two chasing dragons, one side being Chinese Fireball and the other Hungarian Horntail. It featured a layout in which the two trains shared adjacent lift hills but traversed two unique courses. The ride was designed by Bolliger & Mabillard of Switzerland. The Chinese Fireball dragon reached a <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of 60mph, and the Hungarian Horntail dragon reached a <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of 55mph. Both versions featured five inversions and a total ride time of two minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E

5|$|In June 1947, the {{military}} requirements were updated and the Model 464-17 met {{all of them}} except for the range. It was becoming obvious to the Air Force that, even with the updated performance, the XB-52 would be obsolete {{by the time it}} entered production and would offer little improvement over the Convair B-36; as a result, the entire project was postponed for six months. During this time, Boeing continued to perfect the design, which resulted in the Model 464-29 with a <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of 455miles per hour (395kn, 730km/h) and a 5,000-mile range. In September 1947, the Heavy Bombardment Committee was convened to ascertain performance requirements for a nuclear bomber. Formalized on 8 December 1947, these requirements called for a <b>top</b> <b>speed</b> of 500miles per hour (440kn, 800km/h) and an 8,000mile (7,000nmi, 13,000km) range, far beyond the capabilities of 464-29.|$|E

5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for <b>top</b> <b>speed.</b> This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming <b>top</b> <b>speed.</b> The facilitator was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the facilitator only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E
