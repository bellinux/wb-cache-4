25|$|Professor Ruut Veenhoven {{showed that}} social {{security}} payments {{do not seem to}} add to happiness. This {{may be due to the}} fact that non-self-earned income (e.g., from a lottery) does not add to happiness in general either. Happiness may be the mind's reward to a useful action. However, Johan Norberg of CIS, a free enterprise economy think tank, presents a hypothesis that as people who think that they themselves control <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> more happy, paternalist institutions may decrease happiness.|$|E
25|$|Rogers {{suggested}} that the incongruent individual, who {{is always on the}} defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> not authentic this is a difficult task and they are under constant threat. They deploy defense mechanisms to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: distortion and denial. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.|$|E
25|$|H-2A visas are {{temporary}} visas {{that allow}} {{people from other}} countries {{to work in the}} United States, with some benefits contractors need to provide to them.

Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow.

When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain {{the events of the last}} several years could not have happened without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E

500|$|Dragonflies are predators, both {{in their}} aquatic larval stage, when they are known as nymphs or naiads, and as adults.

They are fast, agile fliers, {{sometimes}} migrating across oceans, and are often found near water. They have a uniquely complex mode of reproduction involving indirect insemination, delayed fertilization, and sperm competition. During mating, the male grasps the female {{at the back of the}} head or on the prothorax, and the female curls her abdomen under her body to pick up sperm from the male's secondary genitalia at the front of his abdomen, forming the [...] "heart" [...] or [...] "wheel" [...] posture.|$|E

[...] Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Nate Christensen, added, [...] "Extraordinary achievement directly impacting combat operations at this level deserves to be recognized with a distinctive medal, not a device on an existing medal.
