5|$|Lance Henriksen was {{concerned}} {{that it would be}} out of character for Frank Black to recklessly take untested drugs, and suggested adding a line of dialogue—"I don't even take aspirin"—to the script to help clue the audience in to the fact that his involvement in the clinical trial was an attempt to aid his daughter. The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>things</b> I do not wish to; I cannot forget the things I wish to forget". The phrase is found at the beginning of Book II of the work.|$|E
5|$|The genre has {{received}} both {{a great amount}} of critical acclaim and criticism throughout the years. Progressive rock has been described as parallel to the classical music of Igor Stravinsky and Béla Bartók. This desire to expand the boundaries of rock, combined with some musicians' dismissiveness toward mainstream rock and pop music, insulted critics and led to accusations of elitism. Its intellectual, fantastic and apolitical lyrics and its shunning of rock's blues roots were abandonments of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>things</b> that many critics valued in rock music. Progressive rock also represented the maturation of rock as a genre, but there was an opinion among critics that rock was and should remain fundamentally tied to adolescence, so that rock and maturity were mutually exclusive. Criticisms over the complexity of their music provoked some bands to create music that was even more complex.|$|E
500|$|In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers observed, [...] "Mulholland Drive makes movies feel alive again. This sinful {{pleasure}} is a fresh triumph for Lynch, {{and one of}} the best films of a sorry-ass year. For visionary daring, swooning eroticism and colors that pop like a whore's lip gloss, there's nothing like this baby anywhere." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice stated, [...] "This voluptuous phantasmagoria... is certainly Lynch's strongest movie since Blue Velvet and maybe Eraserhead. <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>things</b> that failed him in the bad-boy rockabilly debacle of Lost Highway—the atmosphere of free-floating menace, pointless transmigration of souls, provocatively dropped plot stitches, gimcrack alternate universes—are here brilliantly rehabilitated." ...|$|E

500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Sengstack {{wrote that}} [...] "Myst is an {{immersive}} experience that draws you in and won't let you go." [...] Writing about Mysts reception, Greg M. Smith noted that Myst {{had become a}} hit and was regarded as incredibly immersive despite most closely resembling [...] "the hoary technology of the slideshow (with accompanying music and effects)". Smith concluded that [...] "Mysts primary brilliance lies {{in the way it}} provides narrative justification for <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>things</b> that are most annoying" [...] about the technological constraints imposed on the game; for instance, Macworld praised Mysts designers for overcoming the occasionally debilitating slowness of CD drives to deliver a consistent experience throughout the game. The publication went on to declare Myst the best game of 1994, stating that Myst removed the [...] "most annoying parts of adventure games — vocabularies that [...] don't understand, people you can't talk to, wrong moves that get you killed and make you start over. You try to unravel the enigma of the island by exploring the island, but there's no time pressure to distract you, no arbitrary punishments put in your way".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson, in {{a letter}} {{discussing}} the weaknesses of the trial, in October 1945 told U.S. President Harry S. Truman that the Allies themselves [...] "have done or are doing some of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>things</b> we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention {{in the treatment of}} prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practising it. We say aggressive war is a crime and one of our allies asserts sovereignty over the Baltic States based on no title except conquest." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars and wrote that Judge [...] "treats his {{characters}} a little like cartoon creatures. That works. Nuances of behavior are not necessary, because in the cubicle world every personality trait is magnified, and the captives stagger forth like grotesques". In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle writes, [...] "Livingston is nicely cast as Peter, a young guy whose imagination and capacity for happiness are <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>things</b> making him miserable." [...] In USA Today, Susan Wloszczyna wrote, [...] "If you've ever had a job, you'll be amused by this paean to peons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Helms, nonetheless, {{continued}} {{to enjoy the}} support of many in the CIA, both active agents and retired veterans, including James Angleton. [...] "He was sworn not to disclose <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>things</b> {{that he was being}} requested by the [...] Committee to disclose," [...] Edward Bennett Williams, Helms's defense attorney, told the press. Williams added that Helms would [...] "wear this conviction like a badge of honor, like a banner", a sentiment later seconded by James R. Schlesinger, who had followed Helms as DCI in 1973. After his court appearance and sentencing, Helms attended a large gathering of CIA officers in Bethesda, Maryland, where he received a standing ovation. A collection was taken, netting enough to pay his fine.|$|E
2500|$|... "Stool Pigeon" [...] was {{inspired}} by a newspaper article Darnell had read about a former Mafia boss who had been let out of jail after providing information about his former colleagues, and had now had his identity changed and protected by the FBI. Darnell said, [...] "I actually had compassion for the guy. I thought, wow, what a way to go. And I could understand why he did it. He sold out for the money and the comfort, I guess <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>things</b> that had brought him into the underworld." [...] The song also features Darnell's attempt at the then newly fashionable art of rapping—he later confessed, [...] "That's just me goofing at being a rapper, which was the last thing I ever wanted to do".|$|E

2500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "faithful, intelligent, admirably acted, superbly shot" [...] and added, [...] "It {{also offers a}} near-perfect case study {{of the ways in}} which film is {{incapable}} of capturing certain crucial literary qualities, in this case <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>things</b> that elevate the book from being a merely insightful study of a deteriorating marriage into a remarkable one... Even when the dramatic temperature is cranked up too high, the picture's underpinnings seem only partly present, to the point where one suspects that what it's reaching for dramatically might be all but unattainable—perhaps approachable only by Pinter at his peak." [...] McCarthy later significantly qualified his review, calling Revolutionary Road [...] "problematic" [...] and that it [...] "has some issues that just won't go away". He concludes that Revolutionary Road suffers in comparison to Billy Wilder's The Apartment and Richard Quine's Strangers When We Meet because of its [...] "narrow vision", even arguing that the television series Mad Men handles the issues of conformity, frustration, and hypocrisy [...] "with more panache and precision".|$|E
