5|$|After 1910, Sai Baba's fame {{began to}} spread in Mumbai. Numerous people started visiting him, because <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> him as a saint {{with the power of}} {{performing}} miracles or even as an avatar. They built his first temple at Bhivpuri, Karjat.|$|E
5|$|Literacy {{began to}} decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political Crisis of the Third Century. Although the Church Fathers were well-educated, <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> Classical {{literature}} as dangerous, if valuable, and reconstrued it through moralizing and allegorical readings. Julian, the only emperor after {{the conversion of}} Constantine to reject Christianity, banned Christians from teaching the Classical curriculum, {{on the grounds that}} they might corrupt the minds of youth.|$|E
5|$|Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an {{independent}} protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall. The {{objective of the}} group, called L'Elefant Blau was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> as a corruption of the club's traditional values. Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.|$|E

5|$|After the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several {{attempts}} were made to revive the organisation, culminating {{in the formation of the}} Socialist International (Second International) in 1889. This, in turn, was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over World War I. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the Labour and Socialist International, supporters of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks had already set up the Communist International (Comintern), which <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> as the Third International. This was organised on a democratic centralist basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|All royal {{charters}} issued {{during the}} first six months of Mary's reign emphasized that she had lawfully inherited her father's crown. However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the very idea of a female monarch. <b>They</b> <b>regarded</b> Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom of Naples, Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France's unclehad invaded Southern Italy in the previous year.|$|E
5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield {{resigned}} his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten {{played a crucial role in}} ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E

5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> him as a popularizer.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a jaw of Sudamerica. Because {{some of this}} jaw's features {{were thought to be}} incompatible with a multituberculate identity, <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) as Mammalia incertae sedis. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) and multituberculates. The controversy is partially due to disagreement over the assignment of two upper premolars and the jaw fragment described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996; Gurovich and Beck identify these as Ferugliotherium, while Kielan-Jaworowska and others regard them as indeterminate multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, 1769, Boone began {{a two-year}} hunting {{expedition}} in Kentucky. On December 22, 1769, a fellow hunter and he were captured by {{a party of}} Shawnees, who confiscated all of their skins {{and told them to}} leave and never return. The Shawnees had not signed the Stanwix treaty, and since <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> Kentucky as their hunting ground, they considered white hunters there to be poachers. Boone, however, continued hunting and exploring Kentucky until his return to North Carolina in 1771, and returned to hunt there again in the autumn of 1772.|$|E

5|$|Sawyer and {{his wife}} were both Republicans in the 1940s. After {{witnessing}} political corruption and voter fraud in their own ward and around the city, they became disillusioned with the party organization in the city and joined the reform effort led by Joseph S. Clark, Jr., and Richardson Dilworth. Clark and Dilworth brought together Democrats, independents, and disaffected Republicans like Sawyer in a coalition against the Republican political machine, which <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> as irredeemably corrupt. In 1949, Sawyer served as a Democratic committeeman and Clark and Dilworth won city offices that year.|$|E
5|$|The decision, while widely {{praised by}} foreign intellectuals and politicians, was {{attacked}} by the Chinese government and the state media. A number of countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, also denounced the award and what <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> as interference in China's domestic affairs. Following the announcement, official censorship was applied within China—on the Internet, television, and in print media. The government strongly denounced the award, and summoned the Norwegian ambassador in Beijing to make a formal protest. The Chinese authorities arrested citizens who attempted to celebrate. Liu's wife was put under house-arrest before {{the decision of the}} Nobel Committee was announced.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratification}} {{of this law}} was not devoid of conflict, despite support from 66% of the population. Roman Catholic authorities in particular were adamantly opposed, criticising what <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> as the weakening {{of the meaning of}} marriage. Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians and gays adopting children. Demonstrations for and against the law drew thousands of people from all parts of Spain. After its approval, the conservative People's Party challenged the law in the Constitutional Court.|$|E

5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. <b>They</b> <b>regarded</b> his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E
5|$|After {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E
5|$|Khánh's deposal of {{the prime}} {{minister}} nullified a counter-plot involving Hương, which had developed during the civil disorders that forced him from office. In an attempt to pre-empt his deposal, Hương had backed a plot led by some Dai Viet-oriented Catholic officers, reported to include Generals Thiệu and Nguyễn Hữu Có. They planned to remove Khánh and bring Khiêm back from Washington. The US Embassy in Saigon was privately supportive of the aim, but was not ready to give full support. <b>They</b> <b>regarded</b> it as poorly thought out and potentially a political embarrassment due to the need to use an American plane to transport some plotters, including Khiêm, between Saigon and Washington. As a result, the Deputy Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson only promised asylum for Hương if the plot failed.|$|E

5|$|On February 10, a VNQDD member injured a {{policeman}} at a Hanoi checkpoint; at night, Arts students threw bombs at government buildings, which <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> {{as part of}} the repressive power of the colonial state. On the night of February 1516, Học and his remaining forces seized the nearby villages of Phu Duc and Vĩnh Bảo, in Thái Bình and Hải Dương provinces respectively, for a few hours. In the second village, the VNQDD killed the local mandarin of the French colonial government, Tri Huyen. On February 16, French warplanes responded by bombarding the VNQDD's last base at Co Am village; on the same day, Tonkin's Resident Superior René Robin dispatched 200 Gardes indigènes, eight French commanders and two Sûreté inspectors. A few further violent incidents occurred until February 22, when Governor-General Pierre Pasquier declared that the insurrection had been defeated. Học and his lieutenants, Chinh and Nguyen Thanh Loi, were apprehended.|$|E
5|$|One {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the Cifelli #2 quarry, a right dentary catalogued as CEUM 34447, is unusual {{compared to other}} Eolambia specimens, including both adults and juveniles. While the ratio between the mid-point depth and overall length of the dentaries in other individuals generally ranges from 0.19 to 0.24, the same value in CEUM 34447 is 0.31, making it unusually deep. The dentary also does not deepen substantially at the front end, and thus lacks one of the distinguishing traits of Eolambia dentaries. However, the other distinguishing trait, which is {{the expansion of the}} front end of the coronoid process, is present in the specimen. Although it is possible that this individual represents an unusual Eolambia specimen, McDonald and colleagues cautioned that it may represent a distinct hadrosauroid that differs in the morphology of the dentary from Eolambia (albeit one that is not suggested by any of the other materials at the quarry). Thus, <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> it as an indeterminate basal hadrosauroid.|$|E
5|$|Simon Spies, {{owner of}} Spies Rejser, speculated in February 1971 {{that he might}} merge his airline Conair of Scandinavia with Trans Polar, {{although}} he also stated that once his airline received new aircraft {{it would no longer}} necessarily need to charter aircraft from other airlines. Trans Polar was subject to a lawsuit by a laid-off pilot which the airline owed NOK26,600 in pay and compensation for him paying his own connection flights to reach Trans Polar charters. The company had issued several cheques and bills of exchange that had bounced and the pilot threatened to bankrupt the airline unless he was paid. The company responded that he would have a very difficult time bankrupting them and the press should instead write about the airline's future, which <b>they</b> <b>regarded</b> as very bright.|$|E
