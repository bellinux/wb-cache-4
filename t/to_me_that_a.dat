25|$|Rorke, who is {{six feet}} four inches, {{has a very}} short run which {{produces}} tremendous pace, and is another bowler whose action is subject to criticism. His delivery, to say the most, was unusual, and it was amazing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> bowler could generate so much pace from such a short run...he lands some four feet beyond the batting crease {{at the moment of}} delivery, with a tremendous drag, and it means he delivers the ball from some nineteen yards.|$|E
500|$|... what is {{interesting}} about this film, perhaps, is the moment when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it absolutely impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{followed}} Chuck D's {{concept of}} two planets, the [...] "Black" [...] planet and Earth, eclipsing. The group enlisted B.E. Johnson, a NASA illustrator, {{to create the}} cover. Cey Adams, creative director for Def Jam at the time, later said of the creative decision for the artwork, [...] "It was so interesting <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> black hip-hop act did an illustration for their album cover. At that time black hip-hop artists, for the most part, had photos of themselves on their covers. But {{this was the first}} time someone took a chance to do something in the rock'n'roll vein".|$|E

500|$|Biller {{sought to}} give a more {{interesting}} look at the Borg, rather than simply focusing on their pursuit of assimilation. With this in mind, he thought of an idea based upon the Tower of Babel. He said that the Borg was a [...] "incredibly interwoven, complex community" [...] and [...] "once you knocked it all down you would have all these people who spoke different languages, and couldn't communicate with each other. It occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> group of ex-Borg {{would be a very}} interesting community to explore." [...] He wanted the potential reunification of the ex-Borg to be a moral dilemma. This was based on the growing favorable views of Communism in the Eastern bloc during the mid-1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E

Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided I needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E
500|$|By 4:00 in {{the morning}} the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or {{gathered}} nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired.

One commented: [...] "There was a certain beauty {{in the aftermath of the}} riot... It was obvious, at least <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street." [...] Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on {{the applause}} {{given to the}} Madres during the PopMart concert in Buenos Aires, the U2 {{magazine}} Propaganda called the result [...] "about the most moving thing I've ever seen on a rock stage. It {{was one of those}} ideas that really could have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment." [...] Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv... anywhere music meant more than entertainment". He added [...] "to be able to address General Pinochet from the stage on live television in Chile and say, 'Give the dead back to the living. Please, General Pinochet, tell these women where the bones of their sons and daughters are.' That was an extraordinary moment... certainly in my life and U2's." [...] When asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band Bono said it had not, stating [...] "it's proof <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> rock 'n' roll audience are not lemmings.... If they don't agree with you, they will let you know – but that doesn't mean they're not fans.... I was flattered that we weren't just playing to people who agreed with us." [...] U2's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the Chilean Parliament against Pinochet, who {{was in the process of}} becoming a Senator for life after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces. The opposition party brought in the Madres, who again held pictures of their disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies.|$|E

"The initial {{impetus for}} {{creating}} the Xeric Foundation was frustration -- when the Turtle thing started getting really huge, people started {{coming out of the}} woodwork to ask for money.

2500|$|The Guardian on 24 August 1945 called Animal Farm [...] "a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on {{the rule}} of the many by the few". Tosco Fyvel, writing in Tribune on the same day, called the book [...] "a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us." [...] Julian Symons responded, on 7 September, [...] "Should we not expect, in Tribune at least, {{acknowledgement}} {{of the fact that it}} is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State—Soviet Russia? It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground.

2500|$|In 1965, Frank Pantridge {{turned his}} {{attention}} to this vexing problem of heart attacks and sudden cardiac death. His sensitivity to the problem came from two sources. First, personnel in the emergency department of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast frequently commented on the number of patients coming in dead on arrival (DOA). Second, Pantridge had recently read a telling study in a medical journal that indicated that among middle-aged or younger men with acute myocardial infarction (MI), more than 60% died within 1hour of the onset of symptoms. Thus the problem of death from acute MI had to be solved outside the hospital, not in the emergency room or the coronary care unit. [...] "The majority of deaths from coronary attacks were occurring", he wrote, [...] "outside the hospital, and nothing whatever was being done about them. It became very clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> coronary care unit confined to the hospital would have a minimal impact on mortality." [...] He wanted his coronary-care unit in the community.|$|E
2500|$|The {{families}} of the victims expressed varying reactions to the report. Kevin Skelton, whose wife Philomena died in the attack, said that, [...] "After the bomb at Omagh, we were told by Tony Blair and the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, that no stone would be left unturned... It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> lot of stones have been left unturned," [...] but then expressed doubt that the bombing could have been prevented. Lawrence Rush, whose wife Elizabeth died in the attack, said that, [...] "There's no reason why Omagh should have happened – the police have been in dereliction of their duty." [...] Other Omagh residents said that the police did all that they could. The Belfast Telegraph called the report a [...] "watershed in police accountability" [...] and stated that it [...] "broke the taboo around official criticism of police in Northern Ireland". Upon leaving office on 5 November 2007, Nuala O'Loan stated that the report was not a personal battle between herself and Sir Ronnie, and did not lead to one. She stated that the [...] "recommendations which we made were complied with".|$|E

Previous to this, white men visited us and warned us to be on our guard against Sioux attacks, and I was a trifle skeptical as to the truth of the story told by our white visitors. But one of the men, a young man about my age at the time, appeared to be so sincere in his efforts to impress upon me that the warning should be heeded, that I took him to Sky Chief who was in command that day, for a conference. Sky Chief said the men were liars; that they wanted to scare the Pawnees away from the hunting grounds so that white men could kill buffaloes for hides. He told me I was squaw and a coward.

2500|$|DeLillo {{followed}} White Noise with Libra (1988), a speculative fictionalized take on {{the life}} of Lee Harvey Oswald up to the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. For this novel DeLillo undertook a vast research project, which included [...] reading {{at least half of the}} Warren Commission report (subsequently DeLillo described it as [...] "the Oxford English Dictionary of the assassination and also the Joycean novel. This is the one document that captures the full richness and madness and meaning of the event, despite the fact that it omits about a ton and a half of material.") Originally written with the working title of either [...] "American Blood" [...] or [...] "Texas School Book", Libra became an international bestseller, one of five finalists for the National Book Award, and winner of the next year's Irish Times Aer Lingus International Fiction Prize. The novel also elicited fierce critical division, with some critics praising DeLillo's {{take on the}} Kennedy assassination while others decried it. George Will, in a Washington Post article, declared the book to be an affront to America and [...] "an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship". DeLillo has frequently reflected on the significance of the Kennedy assassination to not only his own work but American culture and history as a whole, remarking in one 2005 interview [...] "November 22nd 1963 marked the real beginning of the 1960s. It was the beginning of a series of catastrophes: political assassinations, the war in Vietnam, the denial of Civil Rights and the revolts that occasioned, youth revolt in American cities, right up to Watergate. When I was starting out as a writer it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> large part of the material you could find in my novels – this sense of fatality, of widespread suspicion, of mistrust – came from the assassination of JFK." ...|$|E
