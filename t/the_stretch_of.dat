5|$|Fishing is {{permitted}} at Colton Point State Park. Anglers must descend the Turkey Path to reach Pine Creek. The {{species of fish}} found in Pine Creek are trout, smallmouth bass, and some panfish. There are several small trout streams that are accessible from within the park.

5|$|However, the {{controlled}} access highways on Hamersley's southern and western boundaries physically isolate the suburb from its neighbours and limit southbound exits to just two, Erindale Road and Wanneroo Road. This results in considerable rush hour congestion on <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> Erindale Road between Eglinton Crescent and Reid Highway. In 2004, Main Roads Western Australia provided {{a grant of}} $48,000 to the City of Stirling under its Black Spot Programme to improve the traffic flow in this area.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> canal from Abergarwed locks to Tyn-yr-Heol lock at Tonna was {{polluted}} when iron-bearing water began discharging from a mine adit of the Ynysarwed coal mine.

40|$|We discuss {{experimental}} and numerical {{studies of the}} effects of Lagrangian chaos (chaotic advection) on <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> a drop of an immiscible impurity in a flow. We argue that the standard capillary number used to describe this process is inadequate since it does not account for advection of a drop between regions of the flow with varying velocity gradient. Consequently, we propose a Lagrangiangeneralized capillary number CL number based on finite-time Lyapunov exponents. We present preliminary tests of this formalism for <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> a single drop of oil in an oscillating vortex flow, which has been shown previously to exhibit Lagrangian chaos. Probability distribution functions (PDFs) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> this drop have features that are similar to PDFs of CL. We also discuss on-going experiments that we have begun on drop stretching in a blinking vortex flow...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the tight bound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Delaunay triangulation by studying <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chain (Xia 2011).

We then present an improved lower bound of 1. 5932 for <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Delaunay triangulation. This bound is derived from a sequence of chains sharing a set of properties. We conjecture that these properties are also shared by a chain with <b>the</b> worst <b>stretch</b> factor...|$|R
5|$|The blue {{men of the}} Minch, {{also known}} as storm kelpies or in Scottish Gaelic as na fir ghorma, fear gorm or sruth nam fear gorm, are mythological creatures inhabiting <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> water between the {{northern}} Outer Hebrides and mainland Scotland, looking for sailors to drown and stricken boats to sink.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> canal from Sharpness to Purton runs {{very close}} to the river. At a high spring tide they were {{separated}} by little more than the width of the towpath. The canal also has no locks, and owing to its width, not even any stop locks. Any damage to the canal bank could thus render the entire canal unnavigable.|$|E
5|$|During World War I many Shetlanders {{served in}} the Gordon Highlanders, a further 3,000 {{served in the}} Merchant Navy, and more than 1,500 in a special local naval reserve. The 10th Cruiser Squadron was {{stationed}} at Swarbacks Minn (<b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> water {{to the south of}} Muckle Roe), and during a single year from March 1917 more than 4,500 ships sailed from Lerwick as part of an escorted convoy system. In total, Shetland lost more than 500 men, a higher proportion than any other part of Britain, and there were further waves of emigration in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E

40|$|Molecular {{simulations}} and {{an energy}} landscape analysis {{are used to}} examine <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> a model protein. A mapping of the energy landscape shows that <b>stretching</b> <b>the</b> protein causes energy minima and energy barriers to flatten out and disappear, and new energy minima to be created. The implications of these landscape distortions depend on the timescale regime under which <b>the</b> protein is <b>stretched.</b> When <b>the</b> timescale for thermally activated processes is longer than <b>the</b> timescale <b>of</b> <b>stretching,</b> <b>the</b> disappearances <b>of</b> energy barriers provide the mechanism for protein unfolding. When the timescale for thermally activated processes is shorter than <b>the</b> timescale <b>of</b> <b>stretching,</b> <b>the</b> landscape distortions influence <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> process by changing the number and types of energy minima in which the system can exist...|$|R
5|$|During the screenwriting process, Parker and Colesberry began {{scouting}} locations. They visited {{eight states}} based on suggestions {{made by the}} location department. The shooting script required that a total of 62 locations be used for filming. In December 1987, Parker and Colesberry traveled to Mississippi to visit <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> road where Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were murdered. The filmmakers were initially reluctant about filming in Mississippi; they expressed interest in filming in Forsyth County, Georgia before being persuaded by John Horne, head of the Mississippi's film commission. Parker also met with Mississippi governor Ray Mabus, who voiced his support of the film's production.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is {{permitted}} {{at the state}} park, though anglers must descend the Turkey Path to reach Pine Creek. This has been designated as approved trout waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, which means the waters will be stocked with trout and may be fished during trout season. Other species of fish found in Pine Creek include smallmouth bass and some panfish. Several small trout streams are accessible from within the park, which had 2,597anglers in 2003. Historically, fishermen of note on <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> Pine Creek in the park include President Theodore Roosevelt and Pennsylvania Governor William A. Stone.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{plans were}} made for US 140 to be decommissioned, with PA 97 to replace the section in Pennsylvania. This {{proposal}} was made in order to eliminate short routes from the United States Numbered Highways system. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved {{the removal of the}} US 140 designation on October 28, 1977. In December 1978, the borough of Littlestown protested the renumbering of US 140 to PA 97. When the US 140 designation was retired on January 1, 1979, it was replaced by MD 140 from Baltimore to Westminster, and Maryland and Pennsylvania coordinated to have matching routes 97 {{on both sides of the}} state line between Westminster and Gettysburg. The northern terminus of PA 97 was located at the US 15 interchange, while <b>the</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the former US 140 north into Gettysburg became unnumbered Baltimore Pike. With this change, the US 140 signs were removed from the square in downtown Gettysburg, and no signs directing motorists to PA 97 were put in their place. This move hurt businesses in the Littlestown area as motorists were unable to get to them without a marked route. The state did put signs directing motorists to PA 97 at the US 15 interchange and at the intersection of US 15 Business and Baltimore Street; however, signs for PA 97 were not placed in the square due to opposition from local officials in Gettysburg who did not want sign clutter in the square. <b>The</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> Baltimore Pike from the bypass to US 15 Business became State Route 2035 by 1989. PA 97 and the adjacent portion of Baltimore Pike were widened through the US 15 interchange in 2000.|$|E
