Reacting to these criticisms, in March 2005 New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that he opposed the rail tunnel project. However, in early July 2007, Mayor Bloomberg told Rep.

25|$|Thomas bowled over 63,000 balls for Northamptonshire, and {{opposing}} batsmen scored {{off of the}} Welsh medium-pacer at {{an average}} of just under two runs an over. It was his control that was a significant feature of the clubs bowling attack following the First World War. Furthermore, his approach to life mirrored his approach to cricket; sound, level-headed and a calming influence on some of his more temperamental colleagues. Billeted in Northampton during the war years, Thomas had attracted the attention of groundsman Alf Stockwin when he came to bowl in the nets at Wantage Road. His debut, against the Australian Imperial Forces side in 1919, was not a great success, but Northampton Grammar School took him on as groundsman and coach, giving Northamptonshire the opportunity to keep tabs on him. They decided to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> and he justified their interest with 9-30 against Yorkshire at Bradford in 1920 with the last seven wickets only costing him six runs, and one lifting ball hit wicketkeeper Walter Buswell in the eye and put him out of the match. Only 'Bumper' Wells' dismissal of Roy Kilner prevented the county's first 'all-ten'.|$|E
500|$|Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew {{was being}} wooed by {{supporters}} of {{the former vice president}} Richard Nixon, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his [...] "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as Pat Buchanan, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a [...] "formidable candidate" [...] but did not commit his support: [...] "A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal... I think I've got to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> at this situation".|$|E

500|$|Allusions to the {{painting}} were common in vaudeville acts, becoming stock gags in the Orpheum Circuit. Stage imitations of {{the painting}} were also created. In 1913, for instance, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. cast Ann Pennington as the model {{as part of his}} Follies. In this successful version of September Morn, the subject bore a sheer cape, with leaves placed strategically over her body, and stood on a stage made-up as water. A burlesque act, deeming itself the [...] "September Morning Glories", was also created, as was a three-act musical based on the painting. The latter– featuring a fifty-strong chorus line– was put on by Arthur Gillespie and Frank Tannehill, Jr. and debuted at the La Salle Theater in Chicago. In Milwaukee, a man wearing [...] "little or no clothing" [...] passed himself off as [...] "September Morn" [...] at the 1915 Wisconsin State Fair; he was brought to trial and fined $25. Theatrical references {{to the painting}} continued into the 1950s. For instance, in Tennessee Williams's 1957 play Orpheus Descending, the character Val sees it hanging in his room and mentions he [...] "might keep turning the light on to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> at it".|$|E
500|$|In 2015, McAdams starred with Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Stanley Tucci as {{journalist}} Sacha Pfeiffer in Tom McCarthy's Spotlight, Academy Award's Best Picture winner drama, {{about the}} child-abuse scandal in Boston's Catholic Church. To prepare for her role, McAdams {{spent time with}} Pfeiffer. The movie garnered universal critical acclaim, mainly for its detailed story and the cast performances. Justin Chang of Variety felt she [...] "imbues Pfeiffer with sensitivity and grit." [...] Nonetheless, he was surprised by McAdams' subsequent Academy Award nomination: [...] " [...] has the sort of fine-grained subtlety that voters too rarely notice. <b>Take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> at that scene in which she gently, skillfully encourages an abuse survivor to lay bare his most lacerating secrets—a small master class in how {{the simple act of}} listening can become a conduit for compassion." [...] For her role, McAdams received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations in the categories of Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role and Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.|$|E
500|$|After leaving college, Oppong {{took part}} in the draft combine for the newly-formed National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) in August 2011. He was later {{selected}} by the Halifax Rainmen as the 13th overall pick {{in the second round of}} the 2011 NBL Canada draft. He made his professional debut with the Rainmen on November 3, 2011, scoring 6 points and recording 4 rebounds in a loss to the London Lightning. Through the next seven games, he saw very limited playing time, spending over 10 minutes on the court in just three contests. After averaging three points per game, Oppong was released by Halifax in early December 2011. Nevertheless, he still drew the attention of Gary Durrant, the director of basketball operations for the Oshawa Power, who pursued Oppong in the draft combine itself. Oppong said, [...] "Gary actually called my agent and said they wanted me to come back to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> at me. They liked me and it worked out." [...] He was pleased at the idea of joining the Power because of it was located very close to his hometown as well. Oppong made his first appearance for Oshawa on January 12, 2012, but was scoreless with 3 personal fouls vs the Summerside Storm. He scored a season-best 10 points on January 29, lifting his team to a victory over the Moncton Miracles.|$|E

500|$|Hewett {{began the}} 1893 season in good form, {{reaching}} his half-century {{in each of}} his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May. Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly after, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, during which time George Wood replaced him as a substitute. In July 1893, the touring Australians played Somerset at Taunton {{for the first time since}} 1882, when both the ground and the county team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and because talented, Australian-born Sammy Woods was playing for Somerset, the match was eagerly anticipated. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the umpires inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself. The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the Quantock Hills. Hewett, along with Woods and Vernon Hill, arranged to play golf in Minehead. The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> at the ground. Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences, claiming that [...] "the decision not to play was premature." [...] At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee. The Australian players were recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that [...] "Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon and... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once." [...] David Foot offered a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's [...] "mind wasn't on the game." [...] No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets. Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that [...] "if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him." [...] Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season. Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy prospects.|$|E

"For me, 1960 or thereabouts {{was a time}} to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>look</b> at the {{philosophy}} and art of the Orient--particularly Japanese art--that I had become familiar with in my youth. Through my travels and my studies of traditional Japanese arts I was able to reaffirm my conviction in the Oriental view of nature which sees man as one part of nature, a part that must live {{in harmony with the}} rest of nature. From 1960 on, I attempted to express this relationship between man and nature in my works. My sumi-e drawings are a direct response to nature; my fountain sculptures are an attempt to unify water--the life force of the universe that flows in an elusive cyclical course throughout eternity--with an immutable metal sculpture."—George Tsutakawa ...|$|E
