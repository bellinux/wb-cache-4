5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> {{that people}} see that spirituality {{is at the}} base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the {{mechanics}} of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

I think it's {{important}} {{that any of}} the companies engaged in promoting these types of goods have some sense of responsibility and also some sensitivity to the feelings of others.

I've no doubt this debate will go on for a significant period of time, but I do agree.

500|$|Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional {{copies and}} met {{employees}} {{of a number}} of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album. When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it and these guys would look at us like we were crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> that the artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill." ...|$|E

500|$|Kemp was {{a critic}} of {{association}} football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Kemp proclaimed: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football, where you throw it and kick it and run with {{it and put it}} in your hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport." [...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer's main problem is [...] "it doesn't have a quarterback". Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have [...] "changed" [...] his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a [...] "boring game".|$|E

"I {{believe the}} loss of the Thresher should not be viewed solely as the result of failure of a {{specific}} braze, weld, system or component, but rather should be considered a consequence of the philosophy of design, construction and inspection that has been permitted in our naval shipbuilding programs.

5000|$|Ninety-nine {{percent of}} <b>it</b> (Migrant) <b>was</b> written on piano, so I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> felt {{right to keep}} that a focal point. But also, I <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{conscious}} decision to make it a slightly more stripped-down record, as far as the scope and the grandeur goes. The idea was to keep the tone in general a little bit smaller with not so many doubles and big rock guitar and heavy spots on the record...with the lyrics of this new record being transparently about myself, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> to not dehumanize the performances by over-layering them or over-doubling them. As you double vocals, they lose their intimate inflection, and whatever transparent emotion that's trying to be conveyed in them is washed out, which can be a good thing. For this record, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important</b> not to do that.|$|R

Taft {{eventually}} acknowledged his error, but did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>important,</b> and Hoover did not retake the oath. In Taft's view, his departure from the text did not invalidate the oath.|$|R

Personally, I do not object to us writing Portuguese, but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to make clear that Portuguese is (at least in Brazil) only a written language. Our mother tongue is not Portuguese, but Brazilian Vernacular. This is not a slogan, nor a political statement, it is simply recognition of a fact.... There are linguistic teams working hard in order to give the full description of the structure of the Vernacular. So, there are hopes, that within some years, we will have appropriate grammars of our mother tongue, the language that has been ignored, denied and despised for such a long time." ...|$|E

60|$|There was a Jere. Clemens {{who was a}} United States Senator, and in his day {{enjoyed the}} usual Senatorial fame--a fame which perishes whether it spring from four years' service or forty. After Jere. Clemens's fame as a Senator passed away, he was still remembered for many years on account of another service which he performed. He shot old John Brown's Governor Wise in the hind leg in a duel. However, I am not very clear about this. It may be that Governor Wise {{shot him in the}} hind leg. However, I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>{{important}}.</b> I think that the only thing that is really important is that one of them got shot in the hind leg. It would have been better and nobler and more historical and satisfactory if both of them had got shot in the hind leg--but it is of no use for me to try to recollect history. I never had a historical mind. Let it go. Whichever way it happened I am glad of it, and that is as much enthusiasm as I can get up for a person bearing my name. But I am forgetting the first Clemens--the one that stands furthest back toward the really original first Clemens, which was Adam.|$|E
