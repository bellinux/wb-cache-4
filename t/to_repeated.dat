5|$|Placing {{an integer}} {{superscript}} after the name or {{symbol of a}} function, as if the function were being raised to a power, commonly refers <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> function composition rather than repeated multiplication. Thus, f 3(x) may mean f(f(f(x))); in particular, f −1(x) usually denotes the inverse function of f. Iterated functions are {{of interest in the}} study of fractals and dynamical systems. Babbage was the first to study the problem of finding a functional square root f 1/2(x).|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{advanced}} on {{the town}} with the 3rd and 4th divisions supported by over 50 T-34 tanks. Each North Korean division, normally operating with 11,000 men, was at 60 to 80 percent strength, giving them nearly a two to one numerical superiority over the American forces. The morale of the two divisions was low, owing <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> air attacks on equipment and overall exhaustion from continuous combat. Political officers promised the divisions {{they would be able}} to rest in Taejon after they took the city.|$|E

5|$|When {{tissue is}} {{deficient}} or mutilated {{by the loss}} of teeth, implants are placed and allowed to osseointegrate, then the gingiva is surgically moved around the healing abutments.

The choice of one or two-stages, now centers around how best to reconstruct the soft tissues around lost teeth.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1944, the USNavy {{pressed for}} B-29s {{to be used}} to lay naval mines in Japan's home waters to {{strengthen}} the blockade of the country. Arnold and his staff were unenthusiastic about these proposals, however, as they believed that such missions would divert too many Superfortresses away from precision bombing attacks. In response <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> requests from the Navy, Arnold decided in November 1944 to begin mine-laying operations once sufficient aircraft were available. In January 1945, LeMay selected the 313th Bombardment Wing to be the Twentieth Air Force's specialist mine-laying unit, and the Navy provided assistance with its training and logistics. LeMay designated the aerial mining campaign Operation Starvation. As the United States had only occasionally used mines up to this time, the Japanese military had placed relatively little emphasis on keeping its minesweeping force up to date. As a result, the IJN was unprepared for the large-scale USAAF offensive.|$|E
5|$|From the 18th century onwards, Royton's {{economy was}} closely tied {{with that of}} Britain's textile {{manufacture}} during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the cotton spinning sector. However, Royton also lies on the Oldham Coalfield, and coal mining had an economic role for the area in {{as early as the}} 17th century. Mining peaked in the 19th century with over 200collieries in the town. Royton's pits were prone <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> flooding, and owners began to close them. Coal production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry, with the last pit closing in 1902.|$|E

5|$|Further showers breathed extra {{life into}} the pitch, and Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Miller dropped Hutton from Lindwall's bowling before he had scored and played and missed multiple times. Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42, England's highest opening partnership of the series thus far, before Hutton edged Lindwall to Johnson and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> short balls, before Toshack removed both in quick succession to leave England at 65/3. However, Compton and Dollery added 41 in the last 30 minutes to have England close at 106/3.|$|E
5|$|Hutton and Washbrook {{took the}} score to 42—England's highest opening {{partnership}} {{of the series}} thus far—before the latter edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> short balls, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. However, they survived Lindwall's spell of bowling. Late in the day, Lindwall was brought back {{to put pressure on}} Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance.|$|E
5|$|In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became {{governor}} of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal. As {{a result of the}} survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered {{the construction of a new}} port, named Santo Tomás de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake. Work then began on building a highway from the port to the new capital of the colony, modern Antigua Guatemala, following the Motagua Valley into the highlands. Indigenous guides scouting the route from the highlands would not proceed further downriver than three leagues below Quiriguá, because the area was inhabited by the hostile Toquegua.|$|E

As a result, WMATA did not change {{the name of the}} National Airport Station (which never included the full name of the airport). In response <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only {{at the request of the}} local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding.|$|E
5|$|In 916 Emperor Taizu (Abaoji) officially {{designated}} {{his eldest}} son, Yelü Bei, as his successor. Succession by primogeniture was a long-held standard in Chinese culture {{but was not}} accepted among the Khitans, creating a friction between Taizu's desires and the beliefs of the Khitan elites, including Taizu's wife, Empress Shulü Ping. Taizu, sensing {{the possibility that the}} succession process would run into difficulty, forced the Khitan leadership to swear allegiance to Yelü Bei after he was installed as heir apparent. To the Khitans, this was considered a radical move. This friction between primogeniture and succession by the strongest candidate would lead <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> succession crises, the first of which occurred after Taizu's sudden and unexpected death in 926.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the Roman–Persian Wars {{continued}} until 561 when the envoys of Justinian and Khosrau {{agreed on a}} 50-year peace. By the mid-550s, Justinian had won victories in most theatres of operation, with the notable exception of the Balkans, which were subjected <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> incursions from the Slavs and the Gepids. Tribes of Serbs and Croats were later resettled in the northwestern Balkans, {{during the reign of}} Heraclius. Justinian called Belisarius out of retirement and defeated the new Hunnish threat. The strengthening of the Danube fleet caused the Kutrigur Huns to withdraw and they agreed to a treaty that allowed safe passage back across the Danube.|$|E

30|$|The “replicate” {{indicates}} {{the number of}} times <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the clustering, each with a new set of initial cluster centroid positions. k-means returns the solution with the lowest value for sum of distance. The times <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the clustering depends on the distinction in clustering data. The choice of the initial clustering center has a large effect on the clustering results. It may lead bad results if the initial clustering center is not appropriate. In this case, increase the times <b>to</b> <b>repeat</b> the clustering with different set of initial cluster centroid positions can improve the accuracy of clustering results.|$|R
5|$|Justice John McKinley's {{death in}} 1852 led <b>to</b> <b>repeated,</b> fruitless {{attempts}} by the president to fill the vacancy. The Senate took no action on the nomination of New Orleans attorney Edward A. Bradford. Fillmore's second choice, George Edmund Badger, asked that his name be withdrawn. Senator-elect Judah P. Benjamin declined to serve. The nomination of William C. Micou, a New Orleans lawyer recommended by Benjamin, was not acted on by the Senate. The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore's term, when President Franklin Pierce nominated John Archibald Campbell, who was confirmed by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of {{the fossil}} record {{continued}} to advance rapidly {{during the first few}} decades of the 19th century. By the 1840s, the outlines of the geologic timescale were becoming clear, and in 1841 John Phillips named three major eras, based on the predominant fauna of each: the Paleozoic, dominated by marine invertebrates and fish, the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles, and the current Cenozoic age of mammals. This progressive picture of the history of life was accepted even by conservative English geologists like Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland; however, like Cuvier, they attributed the progression <b>to</b> <b>repeated</b> catastrophic episodes of extinction followed by new episodes of creation. Unlike Cuvier, Buckland and some other advocates of natural theology among British geologists made efforts to explicitly link the last catastrophic episode proposed by Cuvier to the biblical flood.|$|E
