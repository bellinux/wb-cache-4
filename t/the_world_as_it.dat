25|$|For Friedrich Nietzsche, life {{is worth}} living {{only if there}} are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw {{nihilism}} ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is, in itself, and, therefore, all ideations take place from a particular perspective.|$|E

25|$|It {{may now be}} {{understood}} that Henri Bergson was dissatisfied with Kantianism, which limited the bounds of reason {{to such an extent}} that it deemed knowledge of the absolute an impossibility. His method of intuition can in fact be seen as a response to Immanuel Kant, who believed that we can only know <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> appears to us, not as it is in itself. He maintained that the attempt to know the absolute always resulted in antinomies, a kind of philosophical paradox caused by the limits of reason.|$|E
25|$|While {{recording}} Henry Cow's last album, differences emerged {{between the}} group members over the album's content. Frith and Chris Cutler favoured song-oriented material, while Hodgkinson and Lindsay Cooper wanted purely instrumental compositions. As a compromise, Frith and Cutler agreed, early in 1978, {{to release the}} songs already created on their own album, Hopes and Fears, under the name Art Bears (with Dagmar Krause). The instrumental material was recorded by Henry Cow on Western Culture later that year, after which the band split. The Art Bears trio continued purely as a studio group until 1981, releasing two more albums, Winter Songs in 1979 and <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> Is Today in 1981.|$|E

It was seen live on television around <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> crashed into the South Tower, being filmed from multiple vantage points. al-Shehhi flew the plane faster and lower into the tower than Atta did, into {{the eastern half of}} the South Tower's southern facade close to the southeast corner, leading to the South Tower collapsing before the North Tower, which was the first to be hit.|$|E
25|$|Another famous {{philosophy}} is that formulated by Nachman of Breslov and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast {{to most of}} his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the corporeal world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics {{and the manner in}} which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive faith in their reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to see <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> truly is.|$|E
25|$|Thus, Deleuze {{at times}} refers to his {{philosophy}} as a transcendental empiricism (empirisme transcendantal), alluding to Kant and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. In Kant's transcendental idealism, experience {{only makes sense}} when organized by forms of sensibility (namely, space, and time) and intellectual categories (such as causality). Assuming the content of these forms and categories to be qualities of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> exists independently of our perceptual access, according to Kant, spawns seductive but senseless metaphysical beliefs (for example, extending the concept of causality beyond possible experience results in unverifiable speculation about a first cause). Deleuze inverts the Kantian arrangement: experience exceeds our concepts by presenting novelty, and this raw experience of difference actualizes an idea, unfettered by our prior categories, forcing us to invent new ways of thinking (see below, Epistemology).|$|E

25|$|Finnish mythology {{and more}} {{specifically}} the Finnish national epic Kalevala were also acknowledged by Tolkien as an influence on Middle-earth. In {{a manner similar to}} The Lord of the Rings, the Kalevala centres around a magical item of great power, the Sampo, which bestows great fortune on its owner, but never makes clear its exact nature. Like the One Ring, the Sampo is fought over by forces of good and evil, and is ultimately lost to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is destroyed {{towards the end of the}} story. In another parallel, the work's wizard character, Väinämöinen, is similar to Gandalf in his immortal origins and wise nature, and both works end with the wizard character departing on a ship to lands beyond the mortal world. Tolkien also based elements of his Elvish language Quenya on Finnish.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E
500|$|God's {{consequent}} nature, on {{the other}} hand, is anything but unchanging – it is God's reception of the world's activity. [...] As Whitehead puts it, [...] " [...] saves <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> passes into the immediacy of his own life. [...] It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved." [...] In other words, God saves and cherishes all experiences forever, and those experiences go on {{to change the way}} God interacts with the world. [...] In this way, God is really changed by what happens {{in the world and the}} wider universe, lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance.|$|E
