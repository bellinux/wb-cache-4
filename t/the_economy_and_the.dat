5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would {{have a negative impact on}} <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established to make use of the Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E

5|$|Before the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) by Sima Qian (14586 BCE), {{there existed}} terse chronicles of {{events such as}} the Spring and Autumn Annals and the chronicle found at Shuihudi {{covering}} events in the State of Qin and Qin dynasty from 306 to 217 BCE. There was also the Classic of History—part of the Confucian canon—which recorded the deeds of past rulers and political events (sometimes mythological instead of historical). However, Sima's work is considered the first of China's Standard Histories, laid the groundwork for Chinese historiography by creating the first universal history of China. He divided his work of one hundred and thirty chapters into basic annals, chronological tables in grid format (with year-by-year accounts since 841 BCE, the start of the Gonghe Regency), treatises on general subjects (such as <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> calendar), histories of hereditary houses and states, biographies on individuals arranged in roughly chronological order, and his own autobiography as the last chapter. Being a court archivist allowed Sima to utilize eighty textual sources in addition to memorials, edicts, and stone inscriptions. These sources enhanced the enormous scope of his work, which mentions roughly four thousand people by name. He also traveled extensively to interview witnesses for more recent accounts.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{remained}} aloof {{from the}} Italian conflict, however. Over {{the spring and}} summer of 307AD, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid any involvement in the Italian turmoil; now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308AD, he raided the territory of the Bructeri, and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium (Cologne). In 310AD, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence, and supporting <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among his people, and strengthened his power base in the West. Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–308AD, but soon fell out with his son. In early 308AD, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.|$|E
5|$|During the 1995 {{legislative}} campaign, Ryzhkov {{defended his}} own tenure as Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, claiming that Russians were far worse off under capitalism than Soviet communism. Russian TV channel NTV broadcast a debate featuring only Ryzhkov and Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal politician who strongly supported economic reforms. At the election, {{he was elected}} to the State Duma Federal Assembly as an independent candidate. Once elected, he headed the Power to the People bloc, a communist faction with nationalist tendencies. The Power to the People bloc came about through the merger of Ryzhkov's supporters and the All-People's Union headed by Sergey Baburin. Its policies were left-wing and included revival of the Soviet Union, the introduction of a planned economy, more state involvement in <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> promotion of nationalism and patriotism. During the 1996 presidential election Ryzhkov endorsed Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) candidate, for the presidency.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{financial}} crisis {{as an opportunity to}} examine a number of key questions about the relationship of <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city. We argue that weak conceptualisation {{of the nature of the}} relationship between <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city, as well as a lack of clarity about what <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> is, has subverted debates about this important topic. This paper comprises four major sections: the first introduces the field of <b>the</b> creative <b>economy,</b> <b>the</b> second section seeks to clarify what exactly we mean by the term financial crisis; here we highlight the multifaceted character of <b>the</b> financial crisis <b>and</b> is variable impacts across the field of <b>the</b> creative <b>economy.</b> <b>The</b> third part outlines <b>the</b> range <b>and</b> diversity of <b>the</b> actually existing relations between <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city. In the fourth section we reflect upon the earlier argument to consider what we can learn about <b>the</b> impacts (actual <b>and</b> expected) of <b>the</b> financial crisis on <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city, <b>and</b> additionally to reflect upon what this might indicate about <b>the</b> changing <b>and</b> perhaps transformed relationship between <b>the</b> creative <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city in the last quarter century...|$|R

5|$|In April 1955, a Caltrans {{official}} {{announced that}} US 80 {{would be built}} as a freeway for its entire length in California, {{as it was to}} be included in the Interstate Highway System. In the meantime, while plans moved further along on US 101, the mayor of San Diego asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track. However, the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80, compared to other local highways. State Assemblyman Hegland raised the issue in the Assembly Highway subcommittee in December, stating that the construction of the freeway would help <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Port of San Diego. State Senator Collier went even further and blamed the delay on San Diego County officials, in addition to linking the delay to damaging the program to develop the port. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the High Court ruling, and with the {{appropriation}} bills due to be considered by the Senate on 16 October, Fraser was undecided whether to block supply. His biographer, Philip Ayres, contends that, had there been no further government scandals, he would not have done so. Khemlani, however, had alleged - contrary to government statements - that Connor had never revoked his authority to obtain loans and had been in regular contact with him even into mid-1975. On 13 October, the Melbourne Herald printed documents in support of Khemlani's allegations, and on the following day, Connor resigned. Fraser determined to block supply, convened a shadow cabinet meeting and received the unanimous support of the Coalition frontbench. At a press conference, Fraser cited the poor state of <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> continuing scandals as reasons for his decision. Without the passage of fresh appropriations, supply would be exhausted on 30 November.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890. A {{month later}} the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without {{consulting}} the Swazis)—the South African Republic {{could build a}} railway through it to Kosi Bay {{on the condition that}} the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes's Chartered Company in Matabeleland and its environs. Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> civil service—now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports—caused opposition to grow. The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and price gouging.|$|E
