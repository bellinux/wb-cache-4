5|$|Pope John Paul II {{provided}} a moral focus for anti-communism; {{a visit to}} his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> movement that galvanized opposition and {{may have led to}} his attempted assassination two years later.|$|E
5|$|The new Contract Sejm, {{named for}} the {{agreement}} that had been reached by the communist party and <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> movement during the Polish Round Table Talks, would be dominated by Solidarity. As agreed beforehand, Wojciech Jaruzelski was elected president. However, the communist candidate for Prime Minister, Czesław Kiszczak, who replaced Mieczysław Rakowski, failed to gain enough support to form a government.|$|E

5|$|Olaf {{knows that}} Kjartan, who was {{involved}} in a love triangle with Bolli and Bolli's wife Gudrun Osvifrsdottir, caused his own downfall by acting aggressively. In Icelandic terms, Kjartan had surpassed the acceptable limits of immoderation. Whereas Olaf wants to maintain <b>the</b> <b>solidarity</b> of the larger family, keeping workable relations with his siblings and their children, Thorgerd's concerns are different. She focuses more narrowly on the honour of her nuclear family.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} support for <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> was unique: no other {{movement}} {{in the world was}} supported by Ronald Reagan and Santiago Carrillo, Enrico Berlinguer and the Pope, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Benn, peace campaigners and NATO spokesman, Christians and Western communists, conservatives, liberals and socialists. The international community outside the Iron Curtain condemned Jaruzelski's actions and declared support for Solidarity; dedicated organizations were formed for that purpose (like Polish Solidarity Campaign in Great Britain). US President Ronald Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland, which eventually would force the Polish government into liberalizing its policies. Meanwhile, the CIA together with the Catholic Church and various Western trade unions such as the AFL-CIO provided funds, equipment and advice to <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> underground. The political alliance of Reagan and the Pope would prove important to the future of Solidarity. The Polish public also supported what was left of Solidarity; a major medium for demonstrating support of Solidarity became masses held by priests such as Jerzy Popiełuszko.|$|E
5|$|This {{restriction}} {{and kind}} of state monopoly {{on the use of}} national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government. It became customary – and still is – for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on strike. This is why the Polish flag, as a symbol of patriotism and resistance against the Communist rule, is part of <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> trade union logo.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was Paul-Henri Spaak MEP, {{one of the}} {{founding}} fathers of the Union. Other founding fathers include Alcide de Gasperi MEP and Robert Schuman MEP. The two female Presidents were Simone Veil MEP in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and Nicole Fontaine MEP in 1999, both Frenchwomen. The previous president, Jerzy Buzek was the first East-Central European to lead an EU institution, a former Prime Minister of Poland who rose out of <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> movement in Poland that helped overthrow communism in the Eastern Bloc.|$|E
5|$|After {{months of}} strikes and {{political}} deliberations, {{at the conclusion}} of the 10th plenary session of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR, the Polish communist party), the government agreed to enter into Round Table Negotiations that lasted from February to April 1989. Wałęsa was an informal leader of the non-governmental side in the negotiations. During the talks, he traveled throughout Poland giving speeches in support of the negotiations. At the end of the talks, the government signed an agreement to re-establish <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> Trade Union and to organize semi-free elections to the Polish parliament; in accordance with the Round Table Agreement, only members of the Communist Party and its allies could stand for 65 percent of the seats in the lower house, the Sejm.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Poland was {{undergoing}} yet more upheaval: in 1978, John Paul II was elected Pope, providing a national figurehead of world importance; in 1980, the influential movement Solidarność was created, led by Lech Wałęsa; and in 1981, martial law was declared by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland {{as a gesture}} of solidarity with the artists' boycott. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be photographed in their company. In 1983, {{as a gesture of}} support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the Third Symphony to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, he was awarded <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.|$|E
2500|$|While {{remaining}} {{active and}} outspoken after 1989, Walentynowicz distanced herself from various political parties allied with <b>the</b> new <b>Solidarity.</b> She felt <b>the</b> new <b>Solidarity</b> elites abandoned <b>the</b> workers and ordinary people, not {{living up to}} <b>the</b> core <b>Solidarity</b> values of social justice. She felt that Solidarity had been co-opted by self-interested individuals who reneged on their promises. Walentynowicz avoided anniversary celebrations organised by <b>the</b> new <b>Solidarity.</b> In 1995 she wrote an open letter to Wałęsa. In 2000 she declined an honorary citizenship of the city of Gdańsk. During the strike at the docks in Gdynia in February 2002 she said: ...|$|R

5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland {{with the emergence}} of <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> mass movement. By the end of October, Solidarity had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of the respondents supported Solidarity. With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority did not want to impose martial law, as suggested by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Endara {{broke with}} the Arnulfista party over {{differences}} of opinion with the party's leader, Panamanian president Mireya Moscoso, and accused the party of corruption. He ran in the 2004 presidential election as the candidate of <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> Party, {{on a platform of}} reducing crime and government corruption. His primary rival was Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Martín Torrijos, son of the former military dictator Omar Torrijos. Martín Torrijos ran on a platform of strengthening democracy and negotiating a free trade agreement with the US, and was supported by popular musician and politician Ruben Blades. Endara finished second, receiving 31% of the vote to Torrijos' 47%.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E

40|$|The article {{concerns}} {{the significance of}} <b>the</b> idea of <b>solidarity</b> for <b>the</b> rule of law within contemporary constitutional democracies. The author presents, with reference to P. Ricouer’s philosophy, the dialectical nature of solidarity which mediatises ideals of love and justice. He also presents <b>the</b> <b>solidarity’s</b> place within liberal and republican political thought. The author points the limitations imposed on <b>the</b> idea of <b>solidarity</b> by <b>the</b> model of liberal constitutionalism. At {{the same time he}} emphasises that legal recognition related to liberal culture of human rights gains its social complement in <b>the</b> idea of <b>solidarity.</b> He argues that <b>the</b> idea of <b>solidarity</b> might determine <b>the</b> concept of legitimization of power in its modern formula. <b>The</b> idea of <b>solidarity</b> and <b>the</b> concept of rule of law both realise – in different ways and on different levels – the common values oriented towards elimination of arbitrariness of power and ensuring conditions for cooperation between members of political community. The constitutional justice may perform a leading role in fulfilment <b>the</b> idea of <b>solidarity</b> as it watches over distribution of political power and secures processes of free communication within political community. 5137623 Filozofia Publiczna i Edukacja Demokratyczn...|$|R

5|$|Man of Iron (1981) {{is another}} Andrzej Wajda film about <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> movement. The main character, a young worker Maciej Tomczyk (Jerzy Radziwiłowicz) is {{involved}} in the anti-Communist labor movement. Tomczyk is clearly portrayed as a parallel to Wałęsa, who appears as himself in the movie. The film was made during the brief relaxation of censorship in Poland between the formation of Solidarity in August 1980 and its suppression in December 1981. Waida was awarded both the Palme d'Or and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Film Festival for the film. In 1982 it was nominated for Oscar as the Best Foreign Language Film and gained seven other awards and nominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} {{communist}} regime marked {{a new chapter in}} the history of Poland and in the history of Solidarity. Having defeated {{the communist}} government, Solidarity found itself in a role it was much less prepared for — that of a political party — and soon began to lose popularity. Conflicts among Solidarity factions intensified. Wałęsa was elected Solidarity chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, Władysław Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wałęsa declared that Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> logo.|$|E
5|$|The main {{villages that}} {{supported}} Shahin's government were Rayfoun, Ajaltoun, Ashqout, Qleiat and Mazraat Kfardebian. The representatives of these villages {{were able to}} gain <b>the</b> <b>solidarity</b> of other villages by persuading their inhabitants through both peaceful and coercive means that as Christians they were all a part of single community with a united purpose. The leaders of some villages, {{such as those of}} Ghosta, Aramoun, Ghazir and Ftuh opposed Shahin and his revolt. Shahin's popularity among the Christian peasants of Mount Lebanon grew as he came to be viewed as their savior from both the Druze nobles and the traditional Maronite elites. This reputation was further solidified after Shahin's men backed Christian residents in a clash with Druze residents in the mixed village of Beit Meri in Matn in August 1859.|$|E

5|$|White House Counsel Fred Fielding {{immediately}} {{prepared for}} a transfer of presidential powers under the 25th Amendment, and Chief of Staff James A. Baker and Counselor to the President Edwin Meese went to Reagan's hospital still believing {{that the president was}} unharmed. Within five minutes of the shooting, members of the Cabinet began gathering in the White House Situation Room. Haig, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and National Security Advisor Richard Allen discussed various issues, including the location of the nuclear football, the apparent presence of more than the usual number of Soviet submarines unusually close off the Atlantic coast, a possible Soviet invasion of Poland against <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> movement, and the presidential line of succession. Although normally no tape recorders are allowed in the Situation Room these meetings were recorded with the participants' knowledge by Allen, and the tapes have since been made public.|$|E
5|$|Yet while Solidarity {{was ready}} to take up {{negotiations}} with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> movement {{as the only way}} out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1987, in Chicago's {{municipal}} elections, Vrdolyak, rather than seeking re-election as alderman, was <b>the</b> <b>Solidarity</b> Party's candidate challenging Washington for mayor. Washington won re-election, and Washington allies won twenty-five City Council seats. Burke led opposition in the City Council, but Washington supporter Alderman Timothy C. Evans replaced Burke as Chairman of the Committee on Finance. Ousted from the spacious Finance Committee staff offices, Burke never used the relatively modest office allocated to him in City Hall and instead worked out of his private law office two blocks away. In the days {{following the death of}} Mayor Washington in office, Burke supported the Council's selection of Alderman Eugene Sawyer over Evans to serve as mayor. Sawyer prevailed, but Burke was the alderman who least often voted in support of the legislative agenda of Mayor Sawyer, Chicago's second black mayor. After Richard M. Daley was elected mayor in {{the spring of}} 1989, Daley nominated Burke as Finance chairman, a position he has held ever since.|$|E
