The band stumbles into a gig at Bob's Country Bunker, a local honky-tonk. They win over the rowdy crowd, but run up a bar tab higher than their pay, and infuriate the country band that was actually booked for <b>the</b> <b>gig,</b> the Good Ol' Boys.|$|E
5|$|However, the PlayStation 2 version {{does not}} include this {{challenge}} feature. Rather than doing the challenges to unlock avatars/content, all one must do is complete <b>the</b> <b>gig</b> by successfully completing all songs. Not all gigs have content to unlock, rather just those to which a particular unlockable applies (for example the Johnny Cash gig allows Johnny Cash to be unlocked as a playable avatar).|$|E
5|$|However, {{the gradual}} estrangement of Brian Jones and his {{decreasing}} musical contributions – {{he had only}} appeared on two tracks on the then in-progress Let It Bleed — made a return to touring problematic. They had shelved The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus after having been upstaged by The Who. By June 1969, matters had finally come to a head and {{it was decided that}} Jones should be replaced for <b>the</b> <b>gig.</b>|$|E
50|$|Three {{unplugged}} gigs {{in different}} parts of the UK were recorded for the 'Hope' album in January 2002. <b>The</b> <b>gigs</b> and subsequent album raised money for AIDS orphans in Africa through the charity Hope HIV.

5|$|In late 2014 {{the band}} {{performed}} the album in full {{for the first}} time, at concerts in Glasgow, Manchester, Dublin and London, marking the 20th anniversary of its release. Following the UK concerts, the Manics took The Holy Bible tour to North America, and in April 2015 the band played in Washington DC, Toronto, New York, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago. They also played in the Cardiff Castle with 10,000 fans attending <b>the</b> <b>gig,</b> it was broadcast nationwide by BBC Two Wales.|$|E
5|$|On 4 June 2009, Oasis {{played the}} first of three concerts at Manchester's Heaton Park and after having to leave the stage twice due to a {{generator}} failure, came on the third time to declare <b>the</b> <b>gig</b> was now a free concert; it delighted the 70,000 ticket holders, 20,000 of whom claimed the refund. The band's two following gigs at the venue, on 6 and 7 June, proved a great success, with fans turning out in the thousands despite the changeable weather and first night's sound issues.|$|E
5|$|The British Live 8 concert {{took place}} in Hyde Park on 2 July 2005, as a concert {{organised}} by Bob Geldof {{to raise awareness of}} increased debts and poverty in the third world. Acts included U2, Coldplay, Elton John, R.E.M., Madonna, The Who and Paul McCartney, and the most anticipated set was the reformation of the classic 1970s line-up of Pink Floyd (including David Gilmour and Roger Waters) {{for the first time since}} 1981. <b>The</b> <b>gig</b> was the Floyd's final live performance.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{arranged}} by U2 management to showcase the band's live act {{and to promote}} them to American audiences. It depicts the band's performance at Red Rocks on a rain-soaked evening. The concert was almost cancelled because of the inclement weather, but the band had invested in the filming with Island Records and concert promoter Barry Fey and wished to proceed with <b>the</b> <b>gig.</b> The rain and the torch-lit atmosphere of the surroundings made U2's performance dramatic. Segments of U2 Live at Red Rocks were shown in regular rotation on MTV, and were also broadcast on other television networks.|$|E
5|$|The {{music that}} would {{ultimately}} become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape. The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at <b>The</b> <b>Gig</b> on Melrose. However, they were initially {{turned down by}} most of the major labels and several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros. Records in 1999, {{due in large part to}} the constant recommendations of Jeff Blue, who had joined the label after resigning from Zomba.|$|E
5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley <b>the</b> <b>gig.</b> Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the American craft were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E

50|$|Louisville Crashers {{was formed}} in 2004. Vest took part in one of <b>the</b> <b>gigs</b> <b>the</b> band was playing {{at the time and}} liked the style the band brought. As of 2014, they've {{released}} their debut self-titled album through digital outlets.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>gigs</b> were {{extremely}} well received by fans, with word-of-mouth and internet forums allowing {{renewed interest in}} the band to spread rapidly. Most of <b>the</b> <b>gigs</b> were very well attended, with many being full to capacity. Within six months, a CD entitled Fairy Light Nights was released, this being a recording of performances taken from various gigs. A year later, attendance at <b>the</b> <b>gigs</b> and sales of the CD were such that it was considered viable to release a second album, Fairy Light Nights 2, containing further songs which had been recorded {{at the same time}} but not included on the original album.|$|R
5|$|Some time in 1974, on the {{recommendation}} of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club the Hard Rock. Browning had previously managed Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, unsuccessfully trying to break them into the UK market. He did not like their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following <b>the</b> <b>gig,</b> they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and Harry Vanda.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live bootleg, or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this, which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a bootleg may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless <b>the</b> <b>gig</b> is so large that everything needs to be amplified {{and sent to the}} desk.|$|E

25|$|In September 2005, {{the band}} {{had won a}} local radio contest judged by My Chemical Romance. <b>The</b> <b>gig</b> awarded them the {{opportunity}} to open a show on the band's headlining tour with Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect, which subsequently led to Escape the Fate's record deal with Epitaph.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October 2017, Gallagher {{announced}} on Johnny Vaughan's radio show on Radio X {{that he would}} be doing a one-off concert in Finsbury Park (which coincidently, was a location on Oasis' Heathen Chemistry tour in 2002) on 29 June 2018. <b>The</b> <b>gig</b> sold out within minutes of ticket sales being announced.|$|E

25|$|In 2006 a Finnish Mid Summer event, OHM-Fest, {{announced}} Deuteronomium {{as their}} headliner {{claiming that the}} band would play a one-off show.
