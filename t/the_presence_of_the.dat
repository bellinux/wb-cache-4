5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin {{with some of}} the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate. This {{is an example of a}} halogen addition reaction.|$|E

5|$|An uncompetitive {{inhibitor}} cannot bind to {{the free}} enzyme, only to the enzyme-substrate complex; hence, these types of inhibitors are most effective at high substrate concentration.

Even before the discovery of its cause, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syndrome in all races, its association with older maternal age, and its rarity of recurrence had been noticed. Medical texts had assumed it was caused by a combination of inheritable factors that had not been identified. Other theories had focused on injuries sustained during birth.|$|E
5|$|At this time, {{the first}} serious student revolts started to emerge, {{motivated}} by the local and global changes of the decade, like the Vietnam war, the European student movement, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peace Corps in Latin-America and specially in Colombia, {{the rejection of the}} IDB loan and <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreign foundations. On February 15, 1971, after the unconsulted election of the Dean of the Division of Social Science and Economics, some students took the rectory. This marked the first incursion of the police force to the university campus. For these events, some professors and students were expelled of the university. Nevertheless, the support for the rector dropped, who had to resign. Since mid February to April, the university was closed until the new rector was appointed.|$|E

5|$|Chachaklum's {{principal}} phase of occupation appears to {{date to the}} Terminal Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, together with <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> E-Group, suggests a longer occupational period than was immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further investigations have revealed a long occupational history beginning in the Late Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> de novo pathway, the salvage {{reactions}} are essential in humans; {{a lack of}} niacin in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions {{does not change the}} overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E

5|$|In 1920 Victor Emmanuel II's {{grandson}} King Victor Emmanuel III {{donated the}} park's original 21 square kilometres (5,189 acres), {{and the park}} was established in 1922. It was Italy's first national park. There were approximately 4,000 ibex in the park when it was protected. Despite <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park, ibex were poached until 1945, when only 419 remained. Their protection increased, and there are now almost 4,000 in the park.|$|E
5|$|In {{a similar}} reaction, pentaisopropylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 can be {{synthesised}} from pentamethylrhodocenium hexafluorophosphate PF6 in 80% yield. These reactions {{demonstrate that the}} acidity of the methyl hydrogens in a pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complex can be considerably increased by <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal centre. Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds with potassium hydroxide deprotonating a methyl group and the resulting carbanion undergoing nucleophilic substitution with methyl iodide {{to form a new}} carbon–carbon bond.|$|E
