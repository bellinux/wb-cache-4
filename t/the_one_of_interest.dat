5000|$|Positron Emission Tomography (PET), was {{the most}} {{frequently}} used brain mapping technique before the development of fMRI. There are a number of advantages that are presented in comparison to PET. According to D’Esposito, they include that fMRI “does not require an injection of radioisotope into participants and is otherwise noninvasive, has better spatial resolution, and has better temporal resolution." [...] The first MRI studies employed the use of “exogenous paramagnetic tracers to map changes in cerebral blood volume”, which allowed for the assessment of brain activity over several minutes. This changed with two advancements to MRI, the rapidness of MRI techniques were increased to 1.5 Tesla {{by the end of the}} 1980s, which provided a 2-d image. Next, endogenous contrast mechanisms were discovered by Detre, Koretsky, and colleagues was based on the net longitudinal magnetization within an organ, and a “second based on changes in the magnetic susceptibility induced by changing net tissue deoxyhemoglobin content”, which has been labeled BOLD contrast by Siege Ogawa. These discoveries served as inspiration for future brain mapping advancements. This allowed researchers to develop more complex types of experiments, going beyond observing the effects of single types of trials. When fMRI was developed one of its major limitations was the inability to randomize trials, but the event related fMRI fixed this problem. Cognitive subtraction was also an issue, which tried to correlate cognitive-behavioral differences between tasks with brain activity by pairing two tasks that are assumed to be matched perfectly for every sensory, motor, and cognitive process except <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Next, a push for the improvement of temporal resolution of fMRI studies led to the development of event-related designs, which according to Peterson, was inherited from ERP research in electrophysiology, but it was discovered that this averaging did not apply very well to the hemodynamic response because the response from trials could overlap. As a result, random jittering of the events was applied, which meant that the time repetition was varied and randomized for the trials in order to ensure that the activation signals did not overlap.|$|E

40|$|In single clock {{models of}} {{inflation}} the coupling between modes of very different scales {{does not have}} any significant dynamical effect during inflation. It leads to interesting projection effects. Larger and smaller modes change the relation between the scale a mode of interest will appear in the post-inflationary universe and will also change the time of horizon crossing of that mode. We argue that there are no infrared projection effects in physical questions, that there are no effects from modes of longer wavelength than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> at the time of reheating. These potential effects cancel when computing fluctuations as a function of physically measurable scales. Modes on scales smaller than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> change the mapping between horizon crossing time and scale.

40|$|For in vivo {{research}} {{experiments with}} small sample sizes and available historical data, we propose a sequential Bayesian method for the Behrens-Fisher problem. We {{consider it as}} a model choice question with two models in competition: one for which the two expectations are equal and one {{for which they are}} different. The choice between the two models is performed through a Bayesian analysis, based on a robust choice of combined objective and subjective priors, set on the parameters space and on the models space. Three steps are necessary to evaluate the posterior probability of each model using two historical datasets similar to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Starting from the Jeffreys prior, a posterior using a first historical dataset is deduced and allows to calibrate the Normal-Gamma informative priors for the second historical dataset analysis, in addition to a uniform prior on the model space.

Bayesian and frequentist methods have been compared on simulated and real data. In accordance with FDA recommendations, control of type I and type II error rates has been evaluated.

40|$|Many {{classification}} problems {{must deal}} with imbalanced datasets where <b>one</b> class – <b>the</b> majority class – outnumbers the other classes. Standard classification methods do not provide accurate predictions in this setting since classification is generally biased towards the majority class. The minority classes are oftentimes <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> (e. g., when they are associated with pathological conditions in patients), so methods for handling imbalanced datasets are critical. Using several different datasets, this paper evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art classification methods for handling the imbalance problem in both binary and multi-class datasets. Different strategies are considered, including the one-class and dimension reduction approaches, {{as well as their}} fusions. Moreover, some ensembles of classifiers are tested, in addition to stand-alone classifiers, to assess the effectiveness of ensembles in the presence of imbalance. Finally, a novel ensemble of ensembles is designed specifically to tackle the problem of class imbalance: the proposed ensemble {{does not need to be}} tuned separately for each dataset and outperforms all the other tested approaches. To validate our classifiers we resort to the KEEL-dataset repository, whose data partitions (training/test) are publicly available and have already been used in the open literature: as a consequence, it is possible to report a fair comparison among different approaches in the literature.

However, <b>the</b> storage and computation of all accurate PPR vectors can be prohibitive for large graphs, especially in caching them in memory for real-time online querying. In this paper, we propose a distributed framework that strikes a better balance between offline indexing and online querying. The offline indexing attains a fingerprint of the PPR vector of each vertex by performing billions of "short" random walks in parallel across {{a cluster of}} machines. We prove that our indexing method has an exponential convergence, achieving the same precision with previous methods using a much smaller number of random walks. At query time, the new PPR vector is composed by a linear combination of related fingerprints, in a highly efficient vertex-centric decomposition manner. Interestingly, the resulting PPR vector is much more accurate than its offline counterpart because it actually uses more random walks in its estimation. More importantly, we show that such decomposition for a batch of queries can be very efficiently processed using a shared decomposition. Our implementation, PowerWalk, takes advantage of advanced distributed graph engines and it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by orders of magnitude.
