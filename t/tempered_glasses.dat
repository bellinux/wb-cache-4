50|$|In <b>tempered</b> <b>glasses,</b> air jets {{are used}} to rapidly cool {{the top and bottom}} {{surfaces}} of a softened (hot) slab of glass. Since the surface cools quicker, there is more free volume at the surface than in the bulk melt. The core of the slab then pulls the surface inward, resulting in an internal compressive stress at the surface. This substantially increases the tensile strength of the material as tensile stresses exerted on the glass must now resolve the compressive stresses before yielding.|$|E
40|$|The {{correlation}} between K + -Na+ diffusion coefficient and mechanical properties of chemically tempered and hybrid tempered (chemically tempered subsequent to thermally tempered) aluminosilicate glass are investigated. Firstly, the potassium ion concentration profiles are experimentally measured and the diffusion coefficient is calculated {{according to the}} Boltzmann-Matano approach. Secondly, the flexure strength and Weibull modulus are determined using a combined experimental (coaxial double ring) and finite element analysis method. The {{results indicate that the}} flexural strength decreases with the diffusion coefficient of the air side for both types of glass samples while there is no significant relationship between diffusion coefficient and Weibull modulus. Diffusion coefficient on air side shows a higher value than that of the tin side. With the same diffusion coefficient, the flexural strength of chemically <b>tempered</b> <b>glasses</b> are found to be higher than that for hybrid <b>tempered</b> <b>glasses.</b> The effect of diffusion coefficient on modulus of rupture (MOR) for hybrid tempered glass is more remarkable.

40|$|Since {{the glass}} is a {{birefringent}} material, the analysis of residual stress in glass is usually carried out by means of photoelastic methods. This paper considers the automation of the “test fringes” method {{which is based on}} the use of a Babinet compensator or of a beam subjected to bending. In particular, two automated methods are proposed: the first one is based {{on the use of the}} centre fringe method in monochromatic light and the second one is based on the use of RGB photoelasticity in white light.

50|$|Francois Barthelemy Alfred Royer de la Bastie (1830-1901) of Paris, France is {{credited}} with first developing a method of <b>tempering</b> <b>glass</b> by quenching almost molten glass in a heated bath of oil or grease in 1874, the method patented in England on August 12, 1874, patent number 2783. <b>Tempered</b> <b>glass</b> is sometimes known as Bastie glass after de la Bastie.

40|$|International audienceNickel {{sulphide}} inclusions {{are known}} to be responsible for delayed fracture in <b>tempered</b> <b>glasses</b> due to phase transformation within the inclusion. Microstructural identification of the phase transformation mechanisms in the Ni-S system close to the NiS composition were carried out on a series of partially transformed states. Observations allow to investigate the morphological evolution during transformation, the phase orientation relationships and the first stages of the transformation were investigated by optical microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The transformation mechanisms change significantly with the change in sulphur content of the alpha-NiS phase. Massive transformation is observed for near-stoichiometric composition. For over-stoichiometric composition, the transformation is controlled by a long-range diffusion mechanism. The influence of stoichiometry and impurities (Fe) on the microstructural evolution and transformation mechanisms has also been studied...|$|E
40|$|Breakage patterns, {{residual}} stress, and fractured surfaces on <b>tempered</b> <b>glasses</b> are investigated to {{find the}} correlation among glass thickness, tempered level, {{and the number of}} fragments, particularly when the glass thickness is less than 4 mm. Relatively thin glasses require high compressive stress for producing fragments, and the required compressive stress is increased with decreasing glass thickness (3. 2 to 2. 1 mm). By analyzing the residual stress of glasses before and after the fragmentation test, we observe that a relatively thin glass spends more stored energy to generate a new fracture surface and stores less energy for the second cracking as compared to thick glasses. Fractography shows that all glasses have a similar characterization on the fractured surface irrespective of glass thickness. However, the only dif- ference is the depth of the compressive layer. By reducing the depth of the compressive layer to less than approx. 20 % of the glass thickness, it is observed that the possibility of producing small fragments is dramatically decreased. There- fore, this study confirms that the compressive stress and its depth are essential as key factors contributing to the achievement of a relatively high fragmentation using a thin glass...|$|E
40|$|Glass drinkware {{is widely}} used in the UK. However, glasses are {{sometimes}} used as impulsive weapons in incidents related to alcohol consumption, particularly with imperial pint glasses (568 ml). In {{order to reduce the}} potential for injury with such glasses, glass manufacturers adapted thermal tempering processes to produce tempered (also referred to as toughened) pint glasses. Tempered glass is known for its dense fracture properties and {{is considered to be a}} safer alternative to non-tempered (annealed) glass. Tempered pint glasses are now widely used throughout the UK. However, there is no standard which regulates the quality of tempered drinking glasses. This lack of standardisation has been identified as a cause for varying effectiveness of using tempered drinking glasses to reduce injury potential. This thesis aimed to examine the injury potential of pint glasses and to provide a foundation for a future standard for tempered drinking glasses. The work included: examination of the fracture properties of annealed and tempered drinking glasses; replication and analysis of physical attacks with pint glasses; and assessments into the sharpness of various glass fragments as an indicator of injury potential. The base region of tempered pint glasses was found to fracture extensively, limiting certain methods of glass attacks. Fragments from the near-rim region were found to vary significantly in size between glasses due to lower wall thicknesses and residual stress. Replications of glassing attacks indicated high forces are involved with such attacks, although the damage severity is lessened with <b>tempered</b> <b>glasses.</b> Sharpness assessments revealed little significant change in fragment sharpness due to tempering. This suggests that changes in injury potential are more likely due to practical considerations such as reduced fragment size, rather than a change in inherent sharpness properties...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{residual}} stress measurement in industrially manufactured <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> components has been {{addressed by the}} development and application of an experimental stress analysis technique known as pulsed magneto-photoelasticity. In the manufacture of <b>tempered</b> <b>glass,</b> residual stress is intentionally introduced in order to strengthen the material. However, {{the exact nature of}} the stress distribution remains unknown and, as a consequence, the strength of <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> products can vary significantly. A pulsed magneto-polariscope has been developed to allow the residual stress in glass to be quantified both through the thickness of the material and over the surface plane. Developments to the theory of the technique have enabled optical data, collected in the presence of multiple magnetic fields, to be used to provide a more detailed analysis of the residual stress distribution than has previously been possible. In the first phase of development, a pulsed magneto-polariscope with a continuous bore solenoid coil was designed and constructed. This enabled the proposed developments to be validated by testing birefringent specimens of epoxy resin and sectioned <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> test specimens. In addition, computer programs were developed to reduce the experimental complexity of the technique and to provide a platform upon which further research can be undertaken. The technique was extended by the design and inclusion of a novel component termed the dual coil solenoid which enabled high instantaneous magnetic flux densities to be generated, homogenously, over a wo. rking volume thereby allowing industrially manufactured <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> products to be analysed. Furthermore, this enabled test specimens of glass to be placed under known loads in order to precisely validate the proposed methodology. The pulsed magneto-polariscope was used to successfully quantify the residual stress distribution within a selection of automotive <b>tempered</b> <b>glass</b> products. The results demonstrated the ability of the developed technique to measure the residual stress in these components and to detect defects incurred in the manufacturing process.
