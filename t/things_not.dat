5|$|N. R. Malkani finds Aurobindo's {{theory of}} {{creation}} to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences. He says {{the theory is}} an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing <b>things</b> <b>not</b> based upon truth of existence. Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests {{there would be no}} need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better <b>things,</b> <b>not</b> with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

25|$|It is fruitless to do {{detailed}} {{planning for}} <b>things</b> <b>not</b> within {{the capabilities of}} the HN and FID organization. For example, plans that call for the placement of forces not accessible by roads, or where the roads are unsafe, will not be practical unless the forces can reach their destinations by air or water.|$|E
25|$|The {{lyrics are}} quite personal. I like rap music, and rappers use real-life {{language}} and don’t hold back {{in what they}} talk about. My lyrics aren’t generic pop lyrics just there because they rhyme. I’ve tried to write things as I’d say them, so it sounds more like me. There’s a song called Sticks And Stones, which is about when I was 17 and I thought I’d won the jackpot when I got in the band , and then <b>things</b> <b>not</b> turning out as I might have expected. The middle eight on that song is very honest and truthful.|$|E
25|$|Hitzfeld {{was born}} in Lörrach in {{the valley of the}} Wiese in {{southwest}} Germany, close to the Swiss border. He grew up there and is the youngest of five children. Hitzfeld said that when he first left Bayern in 2004 he 'felt burnt out' and 'was a bit depressed', and 'it took me two years to recover.' He then had 'the best years at Bayern' on his return. He stated his views that people should not get too excited about <b>things,</b> <b>not</b> get too down about things, and treat each situation individually. His uncle was the World War II general Otto Hitzfeld.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{features}} a monologue expounding the narrator's observations that [...] "people everywhere" [...] are [...] "still having sex;" [...] {{no matter how}} authority figures such as parents and counselors try, and despite the risk posed by AIDS, [...] "nothing seems to stop them." [...] In the album edit of the song, the lyrics were originally written as [...] "This AIDS <b>thing's</b> <b>not</b> working". It was changed to [...] "This safe <b>thing's</b> <b>not</b> working" [...] for radio airplay.|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} view, {{from the}} world of the Semantic Web focuses instead on making all <b>things</b> (<b>not</b> just those electronic, smart, or RFID-enabled) addressable by the existing naming protocols, such as URI. The objects themselves do not converse, but they may now be referred to by other agents, such as powerful centralized servers acting for their human owners.Integration with the Internet implies that devices will use an IP address as a unique identifier. Due to the limited address space of IPv4 (which allows for 4.3 billion unique addresses), objects in the IoT will have to use the next generation of the Internet protocol (IPv6) to scale to the extremely large address space required.|$|E
25|$|Other {{observers}} {{have criticized the}} thoroughness of the investigation, and the validity of its conclusions. The author James Baldwin, in his essay The Evidence of <b>Things</b> <b>Not</b> Seen (1985), raised questions about Williams' guilt. Members of his community {{and several of the}} victims' parents did not believe that Williams, the son of two professional teachers, could have killed so many. On May 6, 2005, DeKalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ordered the reopening of the murder cases of four boys killed in that county between February and May 1981 that had been attributed to Williams. The announcement was welcomed by relatives of some victims, who said they believe the wrong man was blamed for many of the murders.|$|E
25|$|Aerial {{survey is}} {{conducted}} using cameras attached to airplanes, balloons, UAVs, or even Kites. A bird's-eye view {{is useful for}} quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document {{the status of the}} archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many <b>things</b> <b>not</b> visible from the surface. Plants growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as middens) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening grain, which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs ultraviolet, infrared, ground-penetrating radar wavelengths, LiDAR and thermography.|$|E

25|$|While the PATH {{resembles a}} typical intraurban heavy rail rapid transit system, {{it is in}} fact under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). PATH continues to be subject to FRA regulations because it used to share trackage with the Pennsylvania Railroad between Hudson interlocking near Harrison and Journal Square. In more recent past the line connected to the Amtrak mainline near Harrison station and also near Hudson tower. These connections have since been severed as the track layout at Hudson interlocking has been modified considerably. While PATH operates under several grandfather waivers, it is required to do <b>things</b> <b>not</b> typically seen on American transit systems. Some of these include the proper fitting of grab irons to all PATH rolling stock, the use of federally certified locomotive engineers, installation of positive train control (PTC), and compliance with the federal railroad hours of service regulations.|$|E
25|$|The total {{estimated}} price tag, more than $22 million, dampened {{the enthusiasm of}} many supporters, who were expecting more like $4 million to $5 million. At a convention in December 1826, they attempted to discredit the engineers' report, and offered lower estimates: Georgetown to Cumberland, $5,273,283; Georgetown to Pittsburgh, $13,768,152. Geddes and Roberts were hired to make another report, which they gave in 1828: $4,479,346.93 for Georgetown to Cumberland. With those numbers to encourage them, the stockholders formally organized the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company in June 1828. In the end, the final construction cost to Cumberland in 1850 was $11,071,075.21. Compared to the original cost given by the engineers in 1826 of about $8 million, removing <b>things</b> <b>not</b> in the estimate such as land purchases, engineering expenses, incidental damages, salaries, and fencing provision, the cost overrun was about 19%, which can be justified by the inflation rate of the period. The cost overrun of the other proposal (Geddes and Roberts) was about 51% thus showing that the original engineer's estimate was good.|$|E

When interviewed as to this project, Gerner stated that his pervasive use of black was a reference to [...] "the censure, to the night, the obscurity (the evil), the mystery of <b>things</b> <b>not</b> entirely revealed".|$|E
500|$|The lamentable and loudly detestable sins of this tottering age, {{surrounded}} by the dire barkings of obscene and fearsome mortality, challenge and urge us, not carefree in a homeland where peace has been attained but, as it were, teetering over an abyss of fetid corruption, that we should flee those <b>things</b> <b>not</b> only by despising them together with their misfortunes with the whole effort of our mind but also by hating them just like the wearisome nausea of melancholy, striving towards that Gospel text, [...] "Give {{and it will be}} given unto you".|$|E
500|$|Thousands of {{supporters}} argued that her death sentence {{should have been}} commuted to life imprisonment. Lewis' attorney James E.

[...] Her low IQ also became a matter of discussion, with supporters citing this as a reason she should not have been sentenced to death. Legal novelist John Grisham echoed those sentiments and argued that evidence indicated Shallenberger, who had an IQ of 113, was the actual mastermind. Grisham quoted from an affidavit by co-conspirator Rodney Lamont Fuller: [...] "As between Mrs. Lewis and Shallenberger, Shallenberger was definitely the one in charge of <b>things,</b> <b>not</b> Mrs. Lewis." ...|$|E
