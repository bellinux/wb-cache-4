500|$|In August 2016, Bendis stated issue #5 {{was delayed}} due to birth of Marquez's son and that Marvel {{extended}} series to eight issues explaining, [...] "David [...] has been handing {{in about a}} page {{a day for the}} last couple of weeks so we're getting back on track. So much so that Marvel greenlit an 8th issue for us. I came up with a better ending but needed the pages. Very grateful that <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> do our thing." [...] The delay also caused the remaining issues to be pushed back with issue #8 being released in December 2016.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello. When asked about his experience with making songs for No Name Face {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "DreamWorks has been amazing in letting us make the record. They're super-artist-friendly. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> make our record the way we wanted to make it. It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as far as what it's about for me personally. I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing people telling what's it's about to them because then I can go, 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still." [...] It was released on March 25, 2002 by DreamWorks Records.|$|E
500|$|This season's episodes were {{produced}} {{in a process}} {{similar to those of}} the previous season. Each episode was outlined in two-to-three pages that contained the necessary plot information. These outlines were then handed to storyboard artists, who created full storyboards. Design and coloring were done in Burbank, California, and animation was handled overseas in South Korea by Rough Draft Korea or Saerom Animation. The season was storyboarded and written by Cole Sanchez, Rebecca Sugar, Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, Ako Castuera, Moynihan, Bert Youn, Somvilay Xayaphone, and Steve Wolfhard. Ward was proud with the writing staff for the season, saying, [...] "Everyone [...] is super talented [...] And they're all a bunch of brainiacs, super smart". He explained that [...] "They're amazing in helping us because <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> write really cool ideas [...] they're really supportive, is what I am trying to say, of what we're trying to do." [...] The season was produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios.|$|E

500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E
2500|$|The differing {{marketing}} {{choices of}} the groups contributed to the conflict. Zong is resentful that Danone was happy just {{to sit back and}} collect money, and wanted to stop him from investing: [...] "Whenever we wanted to expand the business, they said no. They refused to invest more. But <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> spend the money and then when the ventures made money they wanted in," [...] he says.|$|E
2500|$|At the gallery, the album's back cover, {{along with}} {{multiple}} inside album artworks were revealed. The album's back cover features {{the same image}} this time from behind. The seven pieces of artwork were all named and featured a poem written by Mitchell or Nachum, {{the front and back}} covers were titled [...] "If <b>They</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Us</b> Part I" [...] and [...] "If <b>They</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Us</b> Part II" [...] and featured a poem that was split over the front and back, another piece entitled [...] "If They Let Us" [...] was commissioned and featured the full reading of the poem. The inside booklet contains a further five pieces entitled [...] "Fire Part I", [...] "Fire Part II", [...] "Fire Part III" [...] and [...] "R". Billboard ranked the artwork {{as one of the best}} covers of the albums released in 2016 and wrote, [...] "What's black and white and red all over? One of the most intoxicating albums of any genre in 2016, with an equally indelible lead image to match." ...|$|E

2500|$|Matchee and Brown, both {{members of}} 2 Commando, then {{proceeded}} to beat Arone. Matchee used a ration pack to beat the youth, {{as well as a}} broomstick, and sodomised the teenager with it. Brown participated in the abuse, but was primarily an observer and took sixteen [...] "trophy photos" [...] of the beating, including one of Matchee forcing Arone's mouth open with a baton, and one of himself holding Pte. David Brocklebank's loaded pistol to Arone's head. At approximately 23:20, Master Cpl. Giasson entered the bunker, Matchee showed him Arone, who was now semi-conscious and bleeding, and boasted that [...] "in Canada we cannot do that, and here <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> do it".|$|E
2500|$|Over the red, {{black and}} white canvas there is a poem written in Braille by poet Chloe Mitchell; the braille follows {{the theme of the}} album's singles artwork which also {{features}} the same technique. Speaking on her choice to use the language, Rihanna commented, [...] "Sometimes the ones who have sight are the blindest." [...] During the cover's designing stage, Rihanna met with Mitchell, in which they [...] "drank" [...] {{and came up with a}} poem that would be used for the artwork and liner notes entitled If <b>They</b> <b>Let</b> <b>Us.</b> Mitchell explained the poem and its meaning to Rolling Stone magazine, stating it was about being misunderstood, but still be able to stand out while doing what is right for you. She further said that the poem speaks about not conforming to society and being a leader as well as accepting that being misunderstood is a positive thing.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, why did <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>us</b> in?" [...] cried my wife in an {{anguish of}} {{compassion}} and vexation. She repeated her question to Miss Bentley, who came down almost immediately, looking pale, indeed, but steady, and making a brave show of welcome.|$|E
