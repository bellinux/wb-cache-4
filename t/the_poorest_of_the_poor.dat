Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutes including Grameen Bank is high {{compared to that of}} traditional banks; Grameen's interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.|$|E
25|$|Those in the {{business}} have considered domesticating the mopane worms {{in a manner that}} is similar to the domestication of silkworms. The industry would thus be less susceptible to the pitfalls that are associated with it, such as climatic change, drought and other factors that could compromise a harvest. For a domesticated industry to succeed on a small scale and be accessible to <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor,</b> the cost of production would have to be comparable with the cost of wild worms or dried worms at the market.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{development}} did {{not bring}} prosperity to all. During the 1960s many of the rural poor felt increasingly dissatisfied with their condition in society and disillusioned by their treatment by the central government in Bangkok. Efforts by the Thai government to develop poor rural regions often {{did not have the}} desired effect in that they contributed to the farmers' awareness of how bad off they really were. It {{is interesting to note that}} it was not always <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> who joined the anti-government insurgency. Increased government presence in the rural villages did little to improve the situation. Villagers became subject to increased military and police harassment and bureaucratic corruption. Villagers often felt betrayed when government promises of development were frequently not fulfilled. By the early 1970s rural discontent had manifested itself into a peasant's activist movement.|$|E

2500|$|If {{someone is}} from an {{ethnicity}} whose recent ancestors {{had no problem}} with public nudity (parts of Africa, Asia, pre-European Americas, Australia, and the Pacific Islands), it might be thought of as being [...] "primitive" [...] by modern standards, and lacking in social status. (i.e. [...] "Only <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> would go about without clothing.") This contrasts with the more Western attitude that nudity and sexuality are somehow related, but nonetheless causes them to shy away from social nudity.|$|E
2500|$|Muhammad Yunus ( [...] ; born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, economist, {{and civil}} society leader who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for {{founding}} the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. These loans are given to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. In 2006, Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize [...] "for their efforts through microcredit to create {{economic and social development}} from below". The Norwegian Nobel Committee said that [...] "lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty" [...] and that [...] "across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> can work to bring about their own development". Yunus has received several other national and international honours. He received the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2016, {{international}} aid agencies have thrown their full support behind the antipoverty program of Vice President Leni Robredo, joining a summit scheduled {{on the same}} month where they will partner with the country’s poorest local government units.

[...] Some of the participants such as UN Children’s Fund, World Food Program, the UN Development Program, the EU, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will help in “research, knowledge sharing, technical assistance, small grants for capacity building and the like,” said Georgina Hernandez, head of the OVP’s Anti-Poverty and Advocacies Programs. Following the onslaught of Super Typhoon Lawin, Robredo visited Cagayan and met with Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba and local disaster officials to inquire about the damage, which will be the basis for the kind of assistance her office will provide. [...] The anti-poverty program, also known Angat Buhay Program has benefited 83,707 families across the country in its first year of implementation.|$|E
