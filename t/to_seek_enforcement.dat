5|$|The Right to Constitutional Remedies {{empowers}} {{citizens to}} approach the Supreme Court of India <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>enforcement,</b> or protection against infringement, of their Fundamental Rights. Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy, {{in the form of}} a Fundamental Right itself, for enforcement of all the other Fundamental Rights, and the Supreme Court is designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has been empowered to issue writs, namely habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights, while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 – which is not a Fundamental Right in itself – to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to enforce the Fundamental Rights even against private bodies, and in case of any violation, award compensation as well to the affected individual. Exercise of jurisdiction by the Supreme Court can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared.|$|E

50|$|The Court further {{supported}} its holding {{by pointing to}} three reasons why reviewing an agency's decision not to act is unsuitable to judicial review. First, agency decisions whether to initiate enforcement actions are usually based on a complicated balancing of multiple factors, such as efficient allocation of limited resources, likelihood of success, {{and the relationship of}} the potential action to the overall enforcement strategy of the agency. The courts are ill-suited to performing such an analysis. Secondly, the court noted when an agency chooses not to act, they are not exercising any coercive power over others that might be worthy of heightened judicial protection. Third, the Court found an agency’s discretion not <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>enforcement</b> as being analogous to exercises of prosecutorial discretion that courts have traditionally been unwilling to review.|$|E

Instead, the ALJ may refer a matter to an Article III Court <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>enforcement</b> or sanctions.

40|$|Two {{state supreme}} courts, California and Georgia, have ruled that pre-dispute {{contractual}} jury waivers are not enforceable. Those jurisdictions that permit such waivers use {{a wide array}} of “safeguards not typical of commercial law” to protect the constitutional right to jury trial. The multiple safeguards used by courts, and the different ways of applying them led the California Supreme Court to note “the difficulties experienced in other jurisdictions [with respect to pre-dispute jury waivers], where disagreements persist concerning such matters as allocation of the burden of proof when a party resists enforcement of a contractual waiver of jury trial. ” These disagreements must be settled before such waivers can be used appropriately and effectively. This Article resolves the burden of proof question by arguing that several factors support assigning the burden of proof <b>to</b> the party <b>seeking</b> <b>enforcement</b> of the waiver, which in employer-employee disputes will usually be the employer. Allocating the proof burden in this way will standardize judicial treatment of pre-dispute jurywaivers, allowing them to be used optimally to manage the risks of dispute resolution. Part II of this Article assesses the use of pre-dispute jury waivers in the employment context and explains their appeal. Part III analyzes the various ways that federal courts have treated pre-dispute jury waivers and notes specific inconsistencies in the treatment ofsuch waivers in several recent federal employment cases. Part IV argues that in the employment context, public policy considerations, and convenience and fairness concerns, all call for assigning the burden of proof <b>to</b> the party <b>seeking</b> <b>enforcement</b> of the waiver...|$|R

Hansen decree was accurately implemented and abided by led to further legal action, calling for the “equalization of all per-pupil expenditures from the regular school budget within a tolerance of plus or minus 5 percent of the mean for all elementary schools.” In 1969, Hobson, who was by then an elected member of the Board, “returned to court <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>enforcement</b> of the order rendered in Hobson I,” launching yet another legal battle, Hobson II. Decided in 1971, the court sought to “set a standard for expenditures which will not interfere with the successful operation of the school system but which will ensure that it operates in a substantially nondiscriminatory fashion,” in its decreed remedies, bringing an end to the Hobson legal episodes.|$|E

50|$|Although another initial {{intention}} of Chardón-influenced PRRA was <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> <b>enforcement</b> of the 500-acre law and aid in land distribution among Puerto Rican citizens, the agency took no steps {{in this regard}} as it was not within its legal power to do so. Legal enforcement of the 500-acre law came with the Puerto Rican government’s 1940 victory in a U.S. Supreme Court case against the Robert Hermanos Company, which owned 12,000 acres on the island. This pivotal lawsuit upheld {{the validity of the}} 500-acre law and set the stage for subsequent land reform in the 1940s. In 1941, the Land Authority of Puerto Rico was created under legislation entitled Law 26 of April 12, 1941. The Land Authority’s parcelas provision allowed for the allotment of one to three acres of land to many poor, rural landless workers. With Chardón as its head, by 1945 the organization had parceled out plots to 14,000 families and by 1959 the number of families with acreage reached 52,287. Puerto Rican New Deal policies also did little in the way in improving wages for the island’s workers. In 1940, the average per capita income for Puerto Rican workers remained roughly the same as per capita income from1930. From its inception other problems such as minor financial mismanagement, opposition from members of the U.S. Congress and sugar companies also plagued the PRRA, and it was also criticized by the Puerto Rican Republican-Socialist coaliton for purported political and economic corruption. Three years after its inception, statistics show that PRRA expenditures often benefitted business interests in the United States. By 1938, the program’s total funding had reached $57,953,189.00 an estimated 12 percent of which had been used to buy goods and supplies from the mainland. Additionally, approximately 80 cents per dollar spent by the administration was funneled back into the United States economy.|$|E

50|$|On December 20, 1828, {{the state}} {{legislature}} of Georgia, fearful that the United States would not enforce (as a matter of Federal policy) {{the removal of the}} Cherokee people from their historic lands in the state, enacted a series of laws which stripped the Cherokee of their rights under the laws of the state. They intended to force the Cherokee to leave the state. Andrew Jackson, who had long favored removal, was elected US president in 1828, taking office in 1829. In this climate, John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, led a delegation to Washington in January 1829 to resolve disputes over the failure of the US government to pay annuities to the Cherokee, and <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> Federal <b>enforcement</b> of the boundary between the territory of the state of Georgia and the Cherokee Nation's historic tribal lands within that state. Rather than lead the delegation into futile negotiations with President Jackson, Ross wrote an immediate memorial to Congress, completely forgoing the customary correspondence and petitions to the President.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{a general}} {{reluctance}} to enforce foreign judgments which involve multiple or punitive damages. In this context, {{it is noted that}} the U.S. is not a signatory to any treaty or convention and there are no proposals for this position to change. When it comes <b>to</b> <b>seeking</b> the <b>enforcement</b> of U.S. judgments in foreign courts, many states are uncomfortable with the amount of money damages awarded by U.S. courts which consistently exceed the compensation available in those states. Further, the fact that the U.S. courts sometimes claim extraterritorial jurisdiction offends other states' conceptions of sovereignty. Consequently, {{it can be difficult to}} persuade some courts to enforce some U.S. judgments. The Hague choice of court convention provides for the recognition of judgement given by the court chosen by the parties in civil and commercial cases in all other parties to the convention. The convention has as of 2013 not entered into force.

40|$|The article {{outlines}} {{a simple}} thesis: that international investment arbitration – pursuant to regional and bilateral investment treaties – offers the clearest example of global administrative law, strictly construed, yet to have emerged. We present this thesis by explicating four key features of investment treaties: they permit investor claims {{against the state}} without exhausting local remedies; they allow claims for damages; they allow investors <b>to</b> directly <b>seek</b> <b>enforcement</b> of awards before domestic courts; and they facilitate forum-shopping. Our argument is that, owing to this unique conjunction of features, the regulatory conduct of states is, to an unusual extent, subject to control through compulsory international adjudication. Having highlighted these features, we then claim that investment arbitration is best analogized to domestic administrative law rather than to international commercial arbitration, especially since investment arbitration engages disputes arising from the exercise of public authority by the state as opposed to private acts of the state. Further, we claim that the linkages between investment arbitration and domestic legal systems are more direct and more closely integrated than other forms of international adjudication in the public sphere. For these reasons, we argue that the emerging regime of investment arbitration is {{to be understood as}} constituting an important and powerful manifestation of global administrative law...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Unlike {{litigation}} and arbitration, mediation {{is a more}} informal way to settle disputes. The process has been considered to be quick, cheap and interest-based and {{it is said to}} promote amicable settlements. Yet mediation is not commonly used as a dispute resolution method in Sweden today. However, mediation as a dispute resolution method is promoted by the EU institutions and the European Parliament and the Council has adopted a directive which will secure that the EU citizens, in some cases, will have the possibility to choose extrajudicial mediation as a dispute resolution method. Until now, it has not been possible for parties <b>to</b> immediately <b>seek</b> <b>enforcement</b> of the content of a Swedish extrajudicial mediation settlement agreement. However, the directive will also ensure that the EU Member States provide the EU citizens with such enforcement possibilities. According to the wording of the directive, the request of enforcement will require all parties' explicit consent. This means, that if such consent is not given, the content of the agreement cannot be made enforceable. The uncertainty whether such consent will begiven in {{the end of the process}} or not may contribute to people waiving to initiate a mediation process because the actual outcome of the process could be difficult to predict. For the mediation process to be considered as an equivalent way to settle disputes to the e. g. litigation proceeding, it is necessary that the parties also experience the results of the processes as equivalent. The requirement of consent is not totally abandoned in the proposed Swedish Mediation Act by which the directive shall be implemented. Instead of choosing the wording of the directive, there are other perspectives on the matter of enforcement which the Swedish legislature perhaps could be inspired by when implementing the directive...|$|R
