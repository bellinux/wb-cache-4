5|$|A Franco-Belgian {{comic book}} (bande dessinée) {{on the life}} of Escrivá was {{published}} by Coccinelle BD in 2005. The title is <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains,</b> in reference to Escriva's escape from the Republican zone <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> of Andorra during the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} few months of the war, the {{division}} was engaged in the defence of the northern Adriatic coast and Lika. On 8 April 1945, the city of Senj fell to the Partisans. The following day, during desperate fighting to control the Vratnik pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> from Senj to Brinje, Mickl personally took part in the fighting and {{was shot in the head}} around noon. He was transported to hospital in Rijeka on a tank, but died the following day.|$|E
5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies up <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> {{to the front}} lines. This method of transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor for nearly all unskilled work, {{at an average of}} about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.|$|E

5|$|On 15 May 1800, Napoleon and {{his army}} of 40,000not {{including}} the field artillery and baggage trains(35,000 light artillery and infantry, 5,000 cavalry) began the arduous journey <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> During the five days spent traversing the pass, Napoleon's army consumed almost 22,000 bottles of wine, {{more than a}} tonne {{and a half of}} cheese, and around 800 kilograms of meat.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to subdue}} Basarab, the king ordered the retreat <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> But {{in a long}} and narrow valley, the Hungarian army was {{attacked}} by the Romanians, who had taken up positions on the heights. The battle, called the Battle of Posada, lasted for four days (November 9–12, 1330) and was {{a disaster for the}} Hungarians whose defeat was devastating. The king was only able to escape with his life by exchanging his royal coat of arms with one of his retainers.|$|E
5|$|But in 1960, Jacob Dekema, the {{district}} highway engineer, stated {{that due to}} lower traffic on US 80, {{the completion of the}} freeway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> would be delayed until at least 1971. Construction of the section of US 80 from Magnolia Avenue to Third Street was contracted for $2.7 million in April. That year, work continued on the freeway, and in August, only one traffic signal was left on the highway west of El Cajon, at Ward Road. In August, Dekema announced that bids for the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month; once that was completed, the entire freeway west of El Cajon would be complete. Eastbound lanes between US 395 and Fairmount Avenue opened on November 23.|$|E

5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, moving <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> {{in small groups}} to reach P'ohang-dong. The {{division}} was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no ammunition for them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division {{would be able to do}} this effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June, Prpić {{launched}} a three-pronged assault to clear the routes to Nevesinje. Prohaska commanded the push east along the Mostar–Nevesinje road by a force close to two battalions, Francetić led his unit of Ustaše north from Berkovići <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> via Odžak to approach Nevesinje from the south, and two companies of the 11th Battalion thrust southwest along the road from Plužine. Once this task was complete, the NDH forces were to vigorously pursue the rebels and destroy them.|$|E
5|$|SR 3 {{begins at}} the {{junction}} with SR 36 south {{of the town of}} Peanut in Trinity County. SR 3 is also known as Bramlot Road from its southern terminus to Hayfork. This stretch of road through the Shasta-Trinity National Forest parallels the Hayfork River. Once SR 3 reaches the town of Hayfork, it travels along Hyampom Road east and snakes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> to Douglas City and the junction with SR 299. From there, SR 3 runs concurrently with SR 299 north to the town of Weaverville. SR 3 then separates from SR 299, providing access to the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area and Trinity Dam along Lewiston Lake.|$|E

5|$|The Advance Guard {{crossed the}} Rhine River at Kehl, and {{marched to the}} northeast. François Joseph Lefebvre was indisposed—suffering from ringworm—and Jourdan had {{appointed}} General of Division Dominique Vandamme to direct the march. Vandamme had been lobbying with Jourdan for a larger and more important command but, given the claims of other officers, {{this was the best}} Jourdan could do for him. Vandamme led the Advance Guard <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> via Freudenstadt. On 5 March, Lefebvre returned to his command. Within a week, part of the advance guard broke off from the main body and, under command of Vandamme, moved to Stuttgart, to investigate the rumored presence of Habsburg units.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens {{has long}} {{been used as a}} {{delivery}} and courier horse, as well as being used by local farmers. It has also been used by the winemakers of Languedoc, gardeners and dock workers, as well as continuing to be used by French armies, who appreciated its endurance. The breed was used in the mines, both under saddle and in harness. It was used by smugglers moving goods <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> between France and Spain, mainly carrying wood and minerals, and was known for its endurance and sense of direction.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens is now {{considered}} a multi-purpose recreational horse that is also attached to the cultural identity of the Ariege region. They are used for leisure and competitive trail riding. They are consistently ranked in the French national competitive trail riding championships, and in 1998, a Mérens {{finished second in the}} European Championships. In 1998, Stéphane Bigot made a crossing of the Pyrenees on a Mérens. Many tourist facilities now offer guided trail rides <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> of Ariege on Mérens horses, with some centers having a stable consisting entirely of members of the breed.|$|E

5|$|The group, {{with the}} legal {{authority}} and financial assistance of SirDoi, buy {{the help of the}} town of Ochiai {{in order to create a}} trap. They also enlist the help of Makino, a minor lord whose daughter-in-law was raped and son murdered by Naritsugu. With troops, Makino blocks the official highway, forcing Naritsugu to head into town and the trap. During the assassins' own journey to the town, they are attacked by ronin who have been paid off by Hanbei to kill the plotters. The group decides to head <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> but end up getting lost. In the process they encounter a hunter named Kiga Koyata who becomes their guide; Shinzaemon eventually recruits him as the thirteenth assassin.|$|E
5|$|This {{force was}} then {{guided by the}} Ephesians <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> to Sardis, Artaphernes's satrapal capital. The Greeks caught the Persians unaware, {{and were able to}} capture the lower city. However, Artaphernes still held the citadel with a {{significant}} force of men. The lower city then caught on fire, Herodotus suggests accidentally, which quickly spread. The Persians in the citadel, being surrounded by a burning city, emerged into the market-place of Sardis, where they fought with the Greeks, forcing them back. The Greeks, demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus.|$|E
5|$|After his {{retreat from}} Mani {{due to the}} defeats at Vergas and Diros Pasha renewed his {{offensive}} in August. Ibrahim's army was led by a Laconian from Bardounia named Bosinas who had assistance from the Egyptian fleet. On August 27, he reached Kariopoli {{in an attempt to}} take a safe path <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> Before he reached the town of Polytsaravos, his army of 8,000 Egyptians was delayed by Theodoros Stathakos and his family of thirteen men who refused to let the invaders past their tower. Bosinas tried to negotiate with Stathakos. Stathakos, feigning surrender, told Bosinas to come and take his family's guns. As Bosinas came to retrieve the guns, the Stathakos family killed him. In retaliation, the Egyptians used their two cannons and blew up the tower.|$|E

5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending from the mountains to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> in the west.|$|E
5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, moving <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> {{in small groups}} to reach P'ohang-dong. UN {{planners}} had not anticipated that the 12th Division {{would be able to}} cross the river effectively, and thus were unprepared. In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division was heavily engaged with the NK 5th Division along the coastal road to P'ohang-dong. The divisions' clashes centered on the town of Yongdok, with each side capturing and recapturing the town several times. On August 5, the North Koreans attacked, again taking the town from the South Korean forces and pushing them south. On August 6, the South Koreans launched a counteroffensive to retake the town. However, NK 5th Division forces were able to infiltrate the coastal road south of Yongdok at Hunghae. This effectively surrounded the ROK 3rd Division, trapping it several miles above P'ohang-dong. The NK 766th Independent Regiment advanced around the ROK 3rd Division and took the area around P'ohang-dong.|$|E
5|$|Negron, in a {{flashback}} tells of his war {{experiences as a}} young corporal of the segregated 92nd Infantry Division in Italy in 1944. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded {{on the wrong side}} of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that he found in Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. Sam and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village, where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One Italian villager, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a love triangle with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.|$|E
