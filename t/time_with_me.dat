5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E
500|$|Holtz's {{first job}} at {{his alma mater}} was to serve as wide {{receivers}} coach, and he filled the position for two years. In 1992, the team began {{a search for a}} new offensive coordinator. Lou's first choice, Joe Moore, declined. Lou then asked Skip for recommendations to fill the position. Skip initially said he wanted the position but said of Lou, [...] "he couldn't do it at that <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> [...] being his son." [...] Skip then mentioned Mark Richt, who was then the offensive coordinator at Florida State. Lou Holtz called Coach Bowden to ask permission to speak to Mark Richt. Coach Bowden said Holtz could hire Richt {{as long as he could}} hire Skip. Coach Holtz said, [...] "Well, if I'm just going to switch coaches, I might as well hire Skip." [...] Skip became Notre Dame's offensive coordinator in 1992. Between 1992 and 1994, Skip and his father recorded 40 wins, eight losses, and one tie, an 82.7% winning percentage. Together, they coached Notre Dame to the Cotton Bowl Classic twice, beating Texas A both times. Skip had the third-best total offense in the NCAA during the 1992 football season.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, IDW Publishing {{released}} {{a comic book}} of the game, adapted by Bob Gale and Erik Burnham, and released over five issues from May to September 2016. The comic follows {{the story of the}} game albeit with some minor changes, which according to Bob Gale: [...] "...I convinced IDW to go back in <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to correct a few mistakes we made the first time around, as well as to set up some things that pay off cleverly in true BTTF style." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Chandler came to {{work with}} Wilder he was already a {{recovering}} alcoholic. As Wilder noted, [...] "He was in Alcoholics Anonymous, and I {{think he had a}} tough <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> – I drove him back into drinking..." [...] By the time the picture was released, Chandler was thoroughly disillusioned with the writers' lot in Hollywood; he published an angry piece titled [...] "Writers in Hollywood" [...] for The Atlantic Monthly in November 1945 in which he complained: [...] "The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award (if that means anything), but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio." [...] He neglected, however, to mention that the studio had kept him on salary during the eight-week shooting schedule and that no changes to the script were allowed without his approval – a very rare accommodation for screenwriters, particularly newcomers, in those days. Offended, Wilder responded by saying, [...] "We didn't invite him? How could we? He was under the table drunk at Lucy's," [...] a nearby watering hole for Paramount employees. This relationship with Chandler is what drew Wilder to his next project, the Best Picture-winning The Lost Weekend, about an alcoholic writer. Wilder made the film, in part, [...] "to explain Chandler to himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Los Angeles, California on November 20, 2007. It premiered on music video {{channels}} MTV, BET, and Fuse TV {{during the week of}} December 3, 2007. In a November 8, 2007 interview with MTV, Brown stated that he co-directed the video as well. [...] "And it shows me more solo. Like, it shows the grown side of Chris – it doesn't show the kiddie side. 'Cause with this album, I wanted to blend, I wanted to do all different visuals of me. The first [...] 'Wall to Wall,' the acting, the vampires, the spookiness, then you go to 'Kiss, Kiss,' that had the little goofy part, now this one is solo, the main [...] is me. Me freestyle dancing – just showing people me naturally, not a choreographed routine, just me dancing and showing you what I'm capable of. But at the same time, I was just having fun with the camera, and just one-on-one <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and my audience." [...] The video was quite popular in American television, reaching number 1 on BET's 106 & Park for 6 days, and staying on the countdown for 38 days. It has also reached number 1 on MTV TRL for 10 days, replacing Flo Rida's [...] "Low" [...] and finally retired at number 1 after it stayed on the countdown for 35 days.

6000|$|When midnight sounded Miss Tita got up; but {{she stopped}} {{at the door of}} the house only after she had wandered two or three <b>times</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> round the garden.

6000|$|... "Yes, it's all a long <b>time</b> ago <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and I {{never was}} a girl. Besides, the frank and direct {{behavior}} of Kenby and Mrs. Adding has been very obliterating to my early impressions of love-making." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{elevator}} runs regularly, if not rapidly; {{the papers}} arrive unfailingly in the reading-room, including a solitary London Times, which even I do not read, perhaps because I have no English-reading rival to contend for it with. Till yesterday, an English artist sometimes got it; but he then instantly {{offered it to}} me; and I had to refuse it because I would not be outdone in politeness.

60|$|That evening I {{thought it}} {{desirable}} to invite {{a friend to}} pass the <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> As long as my liquor lasted he stopped; when it was gone, he went away.

6000|$|Eliz. What {{will they}} think! What pleases them. That argument's a staff Which breaks whene'er you lean on't.

60|$|On last Wednesday I {{received}} your letter, {{and on the}} Monday {{before one}} from Mr. Burk, from both of which I much regretted to learn of Simpson's continued ill health.
