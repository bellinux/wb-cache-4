50|$|Plasticine {{is used in}} {{long jump}} and triple jump {{competitions}} to help officials determine if the competitors are making legal jumps. A 10 cm wide 'indicator board' is placed beyond and slightly above the <b>take-off</b> <b>line.</b> The edges of this are chamfered and edged with plasticine If an athlete leaves a mark in the plasticine, it is considered proof that the jump was a foul, and the attempt is not measured. Plasticine is used rather than sand, so that several boards may be prepared in advance: if a board is marked it may {{be replaced by a}} smoothed board immediately to avoid delaying the competition, but keeping the marked board available in case of challenges. An indicator board is used, rather than a wide strip of plasticine, as this provides a firm footing should the athlete step on it.|$|E
40|$|EP 1500697 A UPAB: 20050218 NOVELTY - Test tissue {{engineering}} is bio-artificial tissue with primary blood vessels. The tissue matrix is decellularized, {{has at least}} one blood vessel channel and is colonized with human tumor, stem, precursor or liver cells. The tissue is contained in a bioreactor containing culture medium and has an arterial feed and a venous <b>take-off</b> <b>line.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Test {{tissue engineering}} is bio-artificial tissue with primary blood vessels. The tissue matrix is decellularized, {{has at least one}} blood vessel channel and is colonized with human tumor, stem, precursor or liver cells. The bioreactor (1) holds the tissue matrix and/or test tissue (5) within a tissue culture chamber (4) within a vessel (2). The culture medium (15) is delivered through a feed line (6) into the lower section of the vessel. An arterial feed (10) is connected to the arterial blood vessel (13) in the tissue and a venous <b>take-off</b> <b>line</b> (12) is connected to a venous blood vessel (17) in the tissue. USE - The test tissue is engineered especially for testing new pharmaceutical products, using targeted changes on the RNA and protein plane of the pharmaceutical concentration and/or the duration of the pharmaceutical application and/or the radio therapeutic treatment. The changes in the test tissue relate to the cell cycle, proliferation, synthesis rate, metabolism, generation rate of new blood vessels, variations in the expression pattern of adhesion molecules, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. ADVANTAGE - The test tissue is engineered to give an ex vivo test site where samples are unaffected by extraneous conditions which can occur in an in vivo environment...|$|E
40|$|Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) are {{developing}} a Laser-Based Item Monitoring System (LBIMS) for advanced safeguards at nuclear facilities. LBIMS uses a low-power laser transceiver to monitor the presence and position of items with retroreflective tags. The primary advantages of LBIMS are its scalability to continuously monitor {{a wide range of}} items, its ability to operate unattended, its low cost of implementation, and its inherent information security due to its line-of-sight and non-broadcasting operation. The primary proposed safeguard application of LBIMS is described in its name: item monitoring. LBIMS could be implemented in a storage area to continuously monitor containers of nuclear material and the area in which they are stored. The system could be configured to provide off-site notification if any of the containers are moved or removed or if the area is accessed. Individual tags would be used to monitor storage containers, and additional tags could be used to record information regarding secondary storage units and room access. The capability to register small changes in tag position opens up the possibility of several other uses. These include continuously monitoring piping arrangements for design information verification or recording equipment positions for other safeguards systems, such as tracking the opening and closing of autoclaves as part of a cylinder tracking system or opening and closing valves on a sample or product <b>take-off</b> <b>line.</b> Combined with attribute tags, which transmit information from any kind of sensor by modulating the laser signal, LBIMS provides the capability to wirelessly and securely collect safeguards data, even in areas where radio-frequency or other wireless communication methods are not practicable. Four application types are described in this report: static item monitoring, in-process item monitoring with trigger tags, multi-layered integration with trigger tags, and line-of-sight data transfer with attribute tags. Field trials for each of these applications are described...|$|E
