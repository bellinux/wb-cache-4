5|$|The {{illusion}} of endless rows of Klingons {{was created by}} brightly lighting the accused {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using miniatures. Inspired by a scene in Ben-Hur, matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available Worf dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying to meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E

25|$|Quarto do Rei D. Luís (King Luís's Room), {{covered in}} wood paneled wainscoting, painted white and gold remains {{as one of}} the few rooms in the Palace painted in its {{original}} un-restored wall colors. The painted ceiling, depicting an allegorical representation of Paz by Cyrillo Volkmar Machado that includes figures, mythical figures and flowers in each corner, while the main ceiling is designed as a fanciful open-air Cupola. The walls are painted simply in white with gold trim, divided in square panels, while the floor is paved in parquet. An ornate bed, table and white-velvet chairs decorate <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> writer’s desk along one wall, while statues stand in the window niches on the opposite wall from the bed. Paintings of many of the Portuguese monarchs are located on one of the walls, while over the desk the full-size painting of King Carlos of Portugal is hung.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Tent Room is drawn from the original use of striped fabric draped {{on the walls and}} hung in swaths from the ceiling in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a dining hall. The room today has a wall covering of vertically sriped red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling and trimmed around the perimeter of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scallop edged valence of simple passementerie and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double door into the Long Gallery on the opposite wall, and between them a continuous frame and panel wainscotting. All this woodwork, including the door frames and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his very}} weak heart, Poirot conceives {{that he must}} end the string of murders by killing Norton. Poirot invites Norton for hot chocolate: at their meeting, he tells Norton what he {{suspects}} and his plan to execute him. Norton, arrogant and self-assured, insists on swapping cups: anticipating this move, Poirot had drugged both cups, knowing {{that he had a}} higher tolerance for a dose that would incapacitate Norton. Poirot moves the sleeping Norton back to his room using the wheelchair: Poirot could walk, one reason he needed a new valet who was unaware of that for this last case. Then, being the same height as Norton, he disguises himself as Norton by removing his wig and false moustache, ruffling up his grey hair, then donning Norton's dressing-gown and walking with a limp. Having Hastings establish that Norton was alive after he left Poirot's room, Poirot shoots Norton, leaves the pistol on the table and locks <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> duplicate key. Poirot then writes his story, and ceases to take his amyl nitrite heart medicine. He cannot say it was right to commit murder, but on balance he was sure he prevented yet more instigated by Norton. His last wish for Hastings is typical for Poirot, the matchmaker: he suggests that Hastings should pursue Elizabeth Cole.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy {{learned of}} the deaths on the {{following}} morning when National Security Council staffer Michael Forrestal rushed into the cabinet room with a telegram reporting the Ngô brothers' alleged suicides. According to General Maxwell Taylor, [...] "Kennedy leaped {{to his feet and}} rushed from <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> look of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before." [...] Kennedy had planned that Ngô Đình Diệm would be safely exiled and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. recalled that the US President was [...] "somber and shaken". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was [...] "particularly abhorrent" [...] and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that [...] "It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam." [...] When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ngô brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied [...] "No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nikkatsu {{agreed to}} Tani's conditions, but there {{remained}} {{the problem of}} convincing Oniroku Dan to allow the studio to film his novel. After lengthy, inconclusive negotiations, Dan invited director Masaru Konuma and scriptwriter Yozo Tanaka to his home for [...] "further discussions." [...] In {{the middle of the}} meeting, the electrical power suddenly went out, and Dan called for someone to light a candle. At this point, Naomi Tani, in traditional Japanese kimono, appeared in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lantern. Konuma later said, [...] "This was Dan's theatrical sense - his way of saying yes." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (1983) Employees used a {{respirator}} (PAPR): air flow 184 l/min, {{the degree of}} air purification with filters 99.97%. But they are often discovered climbing of its face shield, and the minimum protection factors reaches 1.1, 1.2 ... Some of respirators do not provide a snug fit to {{the face of the}} faces. Measurement results showed that the rest in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> clean air greatly reduces the impact of air pollution on the workers, and that respirators alone can not reliably protect them. It was also found that the calculation of the protection factors may give different results for different chemicals (for the same measurement carried out).|$|E

2500|$|A power-law [...] has a {{well-defined}} mean over [...] only if , {{and it has}} a finite variance only if most identified power laws in nature have exponents such that the mean is well-defined but the variance is not, implying they are capable of black swan behavior. This {{can be seen in the}} following thought experiment: imagine a room with your friends and estimate the average monthly income in the room. Now imagine the world's richest person entering <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> monthly income of about 1 billion US$. What happens to the average income in the room? Income is distributed according to a power-law known as the Pareto distribution (for example, the net worth of Americans is distributed according to a power law with an exponent of 2).|$|E

[...] Sir Henry then passes through <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pair of revolvers {{on his way to the}} shooting range, revealing that Lucy is an accomplished markswoman while convincing Midge to join him at the targets. [...] Henrietta enters as shots are heard from off-stage, {{quickly followed}} by Gerda who is alarmed by the gunfire. [...] Henrietta convinces Gerda to try shooting, and the two leave for the target alley. [...] John enters and begins to write letters as Lucy leaves with a basket of eggs. [...] Veronica enters, interrupting John and revealing that she sent the note delivered by Gudgeon at the top of the act. [...] Veronica's lighter is now working, and she reveals that her residence at Dovecotes was part of a plot to reunite with John. [...] She expresses an interest in leaving her current husband and marrying John, but John rebuffs her, expressing a newfound satisfaction with his marriage and regret over the romantic activities of his overnight visit to Dovecotes. [...] Veronica leaves in a rage, but not before threatening John with the telling line, [...] "If I can't have you, no one shall." [...] John finds himself alone, hears a noise from offstage, and goes to investigate. [...] Gunshots are heard, and as John staggers and collapses, a revolver is thrown onstage. [...] Gerda is the first to enter, and picks up the revolver. [...] The entire cast quickly enters, and John musters the strength to call the name [...] "Henrietta." [...] Henrietta wrests the revolver from Gerda, and Gudgeon calls for a doctor as the curtain falls.|$|E

60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. Matravers {{glanced around}} <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inward shiver. <b>The</b> usual horrors of a {{suburban}} parlour were augmented by a general slovenliness, and an obvious disregard for any sort of order.|$|R
60|$|It {{was decided}} that the twins should occupy one of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> double bed. Gif and Spouter took the other double bed, and Fred and Jack went into one of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> {{containing}} two single beds.|$|R
