Jitter PSD consists of SS, SN and NN components. Each component of jitter variance is obtained by integrating the corresponding jitter PSD over a finite frequency domain in a bandlimiting scheme. The <b>total</b> jitter <b>variance</b> is obtained as the sum of three components. The dependencies of calculated jitter variance on the system parameters: SNR, ρ, alphabet size, M, transmission scheme, PLL normalized noise bandwidth, bL, and roll-off factor, α, are evaluated. Particularly, the SS component increases with increasing M. However, this increase is limited within a finite range. Since the SN and NN components are independent of M, the dependence of the <b>total</b> jitter <b>variance</b> on M is small. At low and medium SNRs, the <b>total</b> jitter <b>variance</b> is independent of M. At high SNRs, the <b>total</b> jitter <b>variance</b> increases with increasing M, but the increase is rather small when M is greater than 4. Calculated values of the SS, SN, and NN components of jitter variance in QAM are tabulated. The numerical values in QAM {{can be used to}} determine the numerical values in PAM and ASK...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{waves in}} the {{vicinity}} of Cape Town, South Africa, were measured by means of an N. I. O. (England) ship-borne wave recorder, in water depths varying from 12 - 140 metres. One dimensional frequency spectra were computed from the records, by power spectrum analysis, based on the method of Blackman and Tukey, using an I. B. M. 1130 Computer. Assumptions of normality and stationarity were tested. The Gaussian assumption of the waves was found to be acceptable for the waters off Cape Town. At the 5 % critical level, using the chi-square test, 3 out of 23 records tested were found to be non-Gaussian. No significant difference between the Gaussian properties of the deep and the shallow stations was found. Tests for stationarity applied to 3 selected records showed 1 record as clearly non-stationary. However, this recording was obtained under fluctuating wind conditions. Comparison of the <b>total</b> <b>variances</b> of the power spectra obtained in shoaling water showed a systematic decrease of variance with depth. Normalised spectra did not show a systematic selective attenuation of the variances with frequency. Factors which might have caused the systematic reduction of the <b>total</b> <b>variances</b> with depth have been examined. The bottom friction factor for this coast was estimated. The mean value of the bottom friction is 0. 22. This is higher than found by other workers...|$|R

40|$|The {{tropical}} Atlantic Ocean exhibits several {{modes of}} interannual variability {{such as the}} equatorial (or Atlantic Niño) mode, and meridional (or Atlantic dipole) mode.

40|$|A {{total of}} 61 PM 10 samples in Huangshi (HS), Central China, were {{collected}} every sixth day from April 2012 to March 2013 and were analyzed for water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) by ion chromatography. The sum of three major ions (SO 42 −, NO 3 −, and NH 4 +) accounted for 75. 8 % {{of the total}} WSIIs on average. The results of a non-parametric test (Kruskal-Wallis) show that, except for Na+ (p > 0. 05), the other ions present a distinctly seasonal variation with {{a statistically significant difference}} (p < 0. 05). The minimum concentrations of all ions were found in summer, while the maximum values presented in autumn (for Ca 2 +) and winter (for Cl−, NO 3 −, SO 42 −, K+, NH 4 +, Mg 2 +). Based on the highest ratio of Cl−/Na+ (3. 02) and the highest concentration of K (4. 37 μg·m− 3), Ba (0. 37 μg·m− 3), and Sr (0. 07 μg·m− 3) in February 2013, it can be concluded that firework powders have aggravated the haze weather during the Spring Festival of 2013. The micro-equivalent concentrations of cations and anions were calculated and the comparisons between the calculated and measured NH 4 + concentrations were conducted. The results illustrate that aerosol particles in HS are acidic and there may exist some other cationic ions not detected in this study. An obvious positive correlation and good linear regression among WSIIs suggest that the chemical forms in HS aerosols show a great variety of combinations, such as NH 4 NO 3, NH 4 HSO 4, (NH 4) 2 SO 4, NH 4 Cl, KCl, KNO 3, NaCl, NaNO 3, Ca(NO 3) 2, CaSO 4, MgCl 2, Mg(NO 3) 2, and MgSO 4. The WSIIs have large positive correlation and linear regression with the elements, suggesting that WSIIs in mining cities are strongly influenced by element constituents. Principal component analysis implies that WSIIs in PM 10 are probably from three sources. NH 4 +, Mg 2 +, NO 3 −, K and K+, Cl− and Cl, SO 42 −, and S accounted for 46. 9 % of the <b>total</b> <b>variances,</b> suggesting likely anthropogenic sources, especially coal combustion, vehicular exhaust, and biomass burning.
