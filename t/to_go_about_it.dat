He met friend Peter Nolan, who later gave evidence at the inquest that Orton told him that he had another boyfriend and wanted to end his relationship with Halliwell, but did not know how <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Yorkists regroup, {{and at the}} Battle of Towton, Clifford {{is killed}} and the Yorkists are victorious. Following the battle, Edward is proclaimed king, George is proclaimed Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, {{although}} he complains to Edward {{that this is an}} ominous dukedom. King Edward and George then leave the court, and Richard reveals to the audience his ambition to rise to power and take the throne from his brother, although as yet he is unsure how <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Theoretical {{physicist}} Kip Thorne was {{a scientific}} {{consultant for the}} film to ensure the depictions of wormholes and relativity were as accurate as possible. [...] "For the depictions of the wormholes and the black hole," [...] he said, [...] "we discussed how <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and then I worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so {{what you see is}} based on Einstein's general relativity equations." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the UDI, ZANU {{officials}} mapped {{an elaborate}} {{plan for the}} [...] "liberation of Zimbabwe" [...] which called for attacks on white farmers, destruction of cash crops, disrupting electricity in urban areas, and petrol bombings. Sithole and Nkomo both insisted {{on the need for}} armed struggle, but disagreed on the means <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> For example, ZAPU tended to follow Soviet thinking, placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu. ZANU preferred to politicise populations in areas which they intended to seize. Neither force, however, had acquired basic knowledge of guerrilla warfare. Debate on political theory and insurgent tactics became the obsession of nationalists at this stage.|$|E
2500|$|... "California" [...] {{follows the}} abusive {{relationship}} featured in [...] "Massachusetts". [...] "California" [...] refers to {{getting out of}} the relationship and forgetting about it despite the difficulties in doing so. The music for [...] "To Live and to Lose" [...] was the first piece of music written for the album and Told said [...] "it was strange to start the writing process with such an experimental track". Told was unsure at first about how <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> vocally and lyrically. Told, with his girlfriend's help, placed himself as the character he was writing. [...] "With Second Chances" [...] went through the most changes before the final version appeared on the album. The band were fighting about what they should do with the song. Told defended the song as he liked the chorus the fact it had [...] "a lot of different ideas" [...] in it. With [...] "Departures", the band knew what the intention was {{for the end of the}} song but where unsure about the beginning of the song. Rousseau brought up the idea of using [...] "backward effects, playing things forward and then reversing them", as Told mentions.|$|E
2500|$|While Borges was {{the great}} popularizer of the review of an {{imaginary}} work, he had developed the idea from Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, a book-length review of a non-existent German transcendentalist work, and the biography of its equally non-existent author. In This Craft of Verse, Borges says that in 1916 in Geneva [...] " [...] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read Sartor Resartus, and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart." [...] In the introduction to his first published volume of fiction, The Garden of Forking Paths, Borges remarks, [...] "It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better way <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them." [...] He then cites both Sartor Resartus and Samuel Butler's The Fair Haven, remarking, however, that [...] "those works suffer under the imperfection that they themselves are books, and not a whit less tautological than the others. A more reasonable, more inept, and more lazy man, I have chosen to write notes on imaginary books." ...|$|E

[...] "You can, if {{you know}} how <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> get {{provisions}} cheap after ten o'clock on Saturday night, and I have had the usual difficulty in making ends meet this week.

60|$|It became necessary, therefore, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in {{a manner}} that should leave him unsuspicious of the theft.

60|$|Money is a {{troublesome}} thing. But it {{has got to}} {{be thought}} about even by those who were not brought up to it. If, on account of money matters, one has been driven to come over to America in the hope of borrowing money, the awkwardness of how <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> naturally makes one gloomy and preoccupied. Had there been broad fields of turnips to walk in and Holstein cattle to punch in the ribs, one might have managed to borrow it in the course of gentlemanly intercourse, as from one cattle-man to another. But in New York, amid piles of masonry and roaring street-traffic and glittering lunches and palatial residences one simply couldn't do it.|$|E

"Now, look here, Miss Mason," [...] he began, {{slowly and}} stumblingly at first, but {{accelerating}} into a rapidity of utterance {{that was almost}} incoherent; [...] "I'm a rough sort of a man, I know that, and I know I don't know much of anything.
