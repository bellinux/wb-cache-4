50|$|Forest Technology, which {{includes}} training in <b>timber</b> <b>cruising</b> & surveying, wood procurement and logging operations, was {{offered at the}} college for over 60 years. The first participants received a certificate {{upon completion of the}} 12-month program, but graduates in 1970 invested two years to receive an Associate of Science degree in Forest Technology. At the time, LCCC was one of only two, 2-year forestry programs east of theMississippi river. Timber Harvesting Technician changed from a certificate program to an AS degree in Forest Engineering Technology in 1974, but was merged into Forest management in 1989. Over half of the instruction was provided in the field, where hands-on experience was emphasized. Over the years, technology reduced the number of jobs available in forestry, and by the mid-1990s, there were fewer than 30 students, so the program was scaled back and moved to the Golf Landscape Operations department. Ten years later, enrollment had fallen to just over 20, which did not justify two instructors, so one left and the program was changed back to a one-year certificate in Forest Operations. For several years, class size was in the teens, and the program completion rate was under 50%. Following graduation of the class in May, 2010, the Forestry program was discontinued due to lack of interest.|$|E

50|$|A <b>timber</b> <b>cruise</b> is {{a sample}} {{measurement}} of a stand {{used to estimate}} the amount of standing timber that the forest contains. These measurements are collected at sample locations called plots, quadrants, or strips. Each of these individual sample areas is one observation {{in a series of}} observations called a sample. These sample areas are generally laid out in some random fashion usually {{in the form of a}} line plot survey. Depending on the size of the plot and the number of plots measured, the data gathered from these plots can then be manipulated to achieve varying levels of certainty for an estimate that can be applied to the entire timber stand. This estimate of stand conditions, species composition, volume and other measured attributes of a forest system can then be used for various purposes. For example, in British Columbia the sale of Crown timber is a business proposition and both the buyer and the Ministry of Forests and Range (seller) must know the quantity and the quality of timber being sold. Our satellite provides the essential data and information for determining stumpage rates, for establishing conditions of sale and for planning of the logging operations by the licensee. Generally a <b>timber</b> <b>cruise</b> includes measurements or estimates of timber volume by forest product sort (and sometimes grade), log defect, and log lengths, whether the estimates are made in the field or using computer software.|$|R

5000|$|President Grover Cleveland {{protected}} {{the forests of}} the Olympic Peninsula with the Olympic Forest Reserve in 1897. [...] Initially the reserve consisted of over 2 million acres, nearly the entire peninsula. [...] Forest Service surveyors Dodwell and Rixon spent three years surveying, <b>timber</b> <b>cruising,</b> and mapping the new reserve. Their report, published in 1902, reported {{that most of the}} land was not suited to agriculture, but local politicians had already convinced President William McKinley to remove the most valuable lowland timber from the reserve, claiming it should be open to homesteading. Private timber companies paid ‘homesteaders’ to file claims on land that they then sold to the timber company. [...] At the same time, commercial hunters reduced the Olympic elk herds to fewer than 2000 animals, prompting the state legislature to impose a temporary moratorium on elk hunting in the Olympics. The Forest Reserve was reorganized under Gifford Pinchot as the Olympic National Forest in 1905, with an emphasis on commercial utilization of timber and minerals and fire protection, as well as hunting and trapping. [...] With the passing of the Antiquities Act in 1906, which allowed the president to designate national monuments, Mount Olympus National Monument, administered by the Forest Service, was proclaimed by Theodore Roosevelt in 1909 {{in order to protect the}} elk herds. In 1914, the new supervisor of the Forest Service, Henry Graves, made a trip to the Olympics to determine if commercial timber and minerals were being tied up in the national monument. [...] As a result of Grave’s report, President Woodrow Wilson removed a third of a million acres from the monument.|$|E

40|$|Executive summary This study {{involved}} {{the analysis of}} <b>timber</b> <b>cruise</b> data 1 {{to learn more about}} the abundance and distribution of large-diameter red cedar (Thuja plicata), and yellow-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis) on British Columbia’s Haida Gwaii/Queen Charlotte Islands.

While this project focused specifically on Haida Gwaii, the results may also be relevant for other areas in the Pacific Northwest where cedar is a subject of concern. The study attempted to answer three specific research questions: What is the approximate density of large-diameter cedar in remaining old-growth stands on the Queen Charlotte Islands?

40|$|Equations for {{predicting}} tree height {{as a function}} of diameter outside bark at breast height are presented for various tree species common to southwest Oregon. Data for damaged and undamaged trees were analyzed with weighted nonlinear regression techniques. The effects of specific damaging agents and their severity on the height-diameter relationship were explored. Damage correction multipliers were estimated, then used to correct predicted height where damage was noted. Because the relationship between height and diameter changes with the competitive position of the tree in a stand, alternative equations are presented that include the average height and diameter of the 40 largest-diameter undamaged conifer trees per acre. Foresters can use these "height-diameter" equations to reduce the time-consuming task of measuring heights of every tree in an inventory, stand exam, or <b>timber</b> <b>cruise.</b> They can also use these equations to estimate the change in height as diameter changes.

40|$|Foresters {{routinely}} {{estimate the}} economic {{potential of a}} standing forest resource as lumber. It is usual to consider the straightness and size of a tree to estimate gross recovery {{and the range of}} lumber products that might be produced. However, such estimates are usually subjective and depend on the knowledge and experience of the assessor. Several conversion modeling packages are available to assist with such appraisals, but these require an established library of log data, or require detailed and expensive log measurements. Fortunately, many tree attributes that influence lumber out-turn can be easily and objectively appraised, and these easy-to-measure attributes can be used to infer a larger suite of log characteristics. This paper briefly describes a computer-based conversion modelling system that emulates components of a woodprocessing system and enables users to create a custom wood-processing facility producing lumber, veneer, or other products. It examines the attributes of trees that need to be quantified for such simulation to proceed, describes how routine <b>timber</b> <b>cruising</b> can record these details, and discusses how a user may modify these attributes to reflect different silvicultural regimes. It also describes the accounting module which enables detailed financial analysis of conversion strategies, and of the whole value chain. The system challenges forest managers to examine silvicultural options in a broader context, focusing not on a “better log”, but on creating more value in the lumber marketplace...|$|E
40|$|Though {{limited in}} spatial extent, {{riparian}} forests {{are among the}} most dynamic and diverse environments in the Pacific Northwest. At the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, riparian environments host an array of critical plant and animal species, enrich the region’s aesthetic landscape, and support an array of crucial ecological services like nutrient processing/transformation, water quality protection, and flood hazard reduction. Our knowledge of riparian forest ecology has expanded rapidly over the last 30 years. However, there is little information on historical changes to riparian forests and this knowledge gap hinders effective ecosystem management. In this study, we combined archival land survey records and contemporary field surveys to reconstruct historical riparian forest conditions and chart ecosystem change in Hood Canal, Washington.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Terrestrial laser {{scanning}} (TLS) {{may provide a}} way to increase timber value recovery by replacing manual <b>timber</b> <b>cruising</b> with a simple-to-use, cost-effective alternative. TLS has been studied in several trials worldwide. Past studies have not compared TLS based estimates with mill estimates of stem value and volume. Three differently stocked stands of hybrid poplar were selected for diameter, stem sinuosity and height measurement using manual cruising and TLS. Selected trees were harvested and transported to a mill where they were scanned and then processed into lumber and chips. Data gathered using both manual and TLS methods were used to obtain stem volume and value estimates to compare with mill estimates. Results indicated that TLS diameter measurements were more accurately matched to mill and manual measurements up to about 7. 5 meters on the stem than above 7. 5 meters on the stem in all three stands. Stem curvature comparisons indicated that the variation between TLS and mill centerline measurements {{was similar to the}} variation between repeat mill scan measurements of the same stems. Using TLS as a pre-harvest inventory tool showed that additional revenue could be obtained from the reallocation of saw-log and chip log volume to veneer logs of various sizes in all three stands. It was also shown that the sampling error required to estimate stand value was greater than was required to estimate stand volume within the same error limits...|$|E
40|$|Current {{regulations}} {{require that}} all dead trees over 3 m tall are felled when an area is being logged (Workers’ Compensation Board regulation 60. 38). This clearly protects workers because tree-falling, especially handfalling, is more dangerous when other trees, live or dead, could {{interfere with the}} falling tree. Snags must also be removed within 1. 5 tree heights of work areas. This buffer is intended to decrease the risk that a worker in a block will be injured by a falling dead tree. However, there are several costs to snag-falling: • Ecological damage. Many wildlife species require snags, including 35 % of bird species and 30 % of mammal species in British Columbia (Bunnell and Kremsater 1990). Different species require different stages of decay, from recently dead snags to soft stubs, and many species require canopy-sized snags. Many other, lesser-known species are linked to snags, including lichens (Goward and Arsenault 1997), fungi, and invertebrates— in Sweden, 268 species of invertebrates are threatened or endangered due to loss of snags in managed forests (Berg et al. 1994). • Worker hazard. Snag-falling {{is one of the}} most dangerous occupations in forestry. It is particularly dangerous in the 1. 5 tree-height buffer around cutblocks because these areas are not accessible by mechanical harvesters, and because standing live trees can interfere with the snag-falling. Piles of fallen snags also make subsequent work hazardous, including <b>timber</b> <b>cruising</b> and surveying of adjacent stands. • Economic costs. Because their job is so dangerous, snag-fallers are well-paid, and the work cannot be done quickly. As a result, snagfalling costs are high ($ 670 /ha in 1995 at the Sicamous Creek site). Also, snag-falling buffers around cutblocks can be large areas—a 10 ha cutblock, 400 x 250 m, requires snag-falling in 6. 5 adjacent hectares if trees are 30 m tall...|$|E
40|$|From the 1870 s to the 1930 s, {{the lumber}} {{industry}} in the United States behaved as a “great nomad,” in former Forester William B. Greeley’s words, with the center of production moving from the Great Lakes region during the 1880 s and 1890 s, to the South after 1900. Despite its mobility at regional and local levels, the industry simultaneously structured and controlled these production spaces both long before and long after workers removed and processed the valuable portions of the forest environment. In valuing the forest, establishing logging camps and sawmill towns, and selling cutover farms, firms created sets of working and living environments and regional landscapes that shaped northern Minnesota and Louisiana from the 1870 s through the 1930 s, and beyond. Historians who have only followed the “frontier” of lumber production have missed {{the tension between the}} industry’s mobility and its long-term influence over the spaces of production. By stretching the spatial and temporal frame I show how the lumber industry sought to control workers and nature (not without difficulty) in several phases of its development and in different ways and at different scales in Minnesota and Louisiana. <b>Timber</b> <b>cruising</b> represented the initial structuring of the forest spaces by lumber firms, as they sought to ascertain the number of board feet of timber on their land. The “radical simplification” of forests inherent in timber estimating proved challenging for firms, and the professionalization of this task by forestry school trained foresters offered a way toward more authoritative valuations of the forest. Next, loggers and millworkers faced the forest not as figures of board feet and prices per acre, but through workplaces and homes defined by the needs of lumber firms. These spaces were also defined by Jim Crow (in Louisiana) and challenged by workers’ brief union movements. Finally, the post lumber regime owed its landscape to the lumber industry but the social purpose to which this deindustrialized space was put – smallholder agriculture – was also outlined by the industry through its extensive landownership and by its agricultural boosterism. Their vision of the cutover foundered on its assumptions about nature and society...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{study of}} highlead logging {{operations}} {{through the use}} of statistical models is investigated, and their potential use for estimating and control of operations examined. During the preliminary phases of the study 16 work elements and 26 influencing variables are identified and measurement criteria developed for each. A coding system is also developed to aid recording the variables previously identified in a manner understandable to an electronic computer. Based on the variables and elements to be measured and recorded, data sheets and field procedures are developed and tested. It was proven necessary to use a two man field team to insure that all of the data on each turn, or cycle, was recorded accurately. The procedures necessary to convert the field data into computer input are explained and illustrated with a set of data sheets and summary sheet. The computing methods used in a stepwise regression analysis are discussed in general and its effects on selected lists of variables for each element are shown and discussed. Statistical models of each of the ten regular elements are computed from data taken on 590 turns, or cycles. The resulting models are then analyzed as to their effect on total cycle time and their relation to the form expected by logging estimators and supervisors. The majority of the deviations from expected form are explained but several remain unresolved, and pose a problem for future study. The frequency, mean duration, and proportion of total time consumed by the six irregular elements are computed and their relation to usual job efficiency experienced on similar operations is examined and found to be of the same order. Ten statistical models for the regular elements are recombined into gross element models to provide more convenient data for field use. The gross element and total cycle models were recomputed from the original field data using the variables from the appropriate element models. The resulting gross element models are then tabularized and sample sheets included to illustrate the general procedure for determining cycle times from the tabular data and correction factors. The reliability of the existing models is discussed and it is shown {{that it is impossible to}} develop statistical measures of spread or deviation from the computed regression line from the existing data. The measures of the probability of observing and computing a model on only a chance variation are very small, all are less than 2. 5 percent. Because of this the conclusion is drawn that causal relationships do exist in highlead logging. To calibrate the existing models an independent data sample is needed. The multivariate calibration procedures necessary are identified and a proposed computing method to reduce the size of the confidence belt is discussed. The study pointed out several areas for future study. They are: 1. The present element and gross element models should have confidence limits placed on them. 2. Several of the models indicate higher than expected standard error. These should be studied for possible improvements. 3. The range of the variables should be enlarged as soon as possible to reflect conditions in other logging areas. 4. A cause analysis study be instituted to study machine breakdown history and causes. 5. Development of a training manual for future investigators to reduce the instruction time and enable them to better answer questions from the men in the field. 6. A comparison study of the results predicted by the models with the estimates and historical records of logging. performance. 7.

Upon arriving at the meeting point of the Wisconsin and Pelican Rivers {{at the site of}} John Curran's trading post, and seeing the high banks along the rapids and the excellent pine stands, Anderson Brown envisioned a mill town with a lumber mill powered by the waters of the Wisconsin River. Brown's vision would not come to fruition for some years, however after subsequent expeditions with others including his brother and Rhinelander's first mayor, Webster Brown, the brothers managed to convince their father and uncle to purchase the land from the federal government and build a town. In its charter, the city was named Rhinelander after Frederic W. Rhinelander of New York, who was president of the Milwaukee, Lake Shore & Western Road at the time. This was part of a bid by the Brown brothers to induce the railroad to extend a spur to the location to further their lumbering business. Ultimately, after over ten years of negotiations, the Brown family agreed to convey half their land holdings in the area to the railroad in exchange for a rail line to their future city. In 1882, the railroad line from present-day Monico to Rhinelander was completed, jump starting the development of Rhinelander as the commercial hub of the region.|$|R
