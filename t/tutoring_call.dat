40|$|INTRODUCTION In this poster an {{intelligent}} assessing <b>tutor,</b> <b>called</b> ASSA is presented, having the general structure of an ITS. ASSA {{is designed to}} assess students of elementary school who show low performance in arithmetic word problem solving. In order to teach low-attainers in mathematics there is the need {{of the existence of}} an individualised curriculum, in other words the use of a teaching strategy in accordance with the student's individual characteristics [5]. A first aim of the system {{is to be able to}} adapt its performance to the student's knowledge state and mainly to his observed strengths. To do this ASSA uses different appropriate dynamically generated assessing strategies, individualising thus the assessing procedure. A second aim of the system is to show motivation-based tactics as defined by Malone and Lepper [8] and Keller [6] and become a motivational competent tutor as suggested by Lepper, Woolverton, Mumme, & Gurtner [7]. 2. THE DOMAIN ASSA assesses the student's u...|$|R

40|$|The Tutoring Research Group at the University of Memphis has {{developed}} a computer <b>tutor</b> (<b>called</b> AutoTutor) that simulates the discourse patterns and pedagogical strategies of a typical human tutor. The dialog tactics {{were based on a}} previous project that dissected 100 hours of naturalistic tutoring sessions. AutoTutor is currently targeted for college students in introductory computer literacy courses, who learn the fundamentals of hardware, operating systems, and the Internet. Instead of merely being an information delivery system, AutoTutor serves as a discourse prosthesis (or collaborative scaffold) that assists the student in actively constructing knowledge. A dialog manager coordinates the conversation that occurs between a learner and a pedagogical agent, whereas lesson content and world knowledge are represented in a curriculum script and latent semantic analysis. The agent is a talking head with discoursesensitive facial expressions and synthesized speech. Evaluations of AutoTutor have shown that the tutoring system improves learning and memory of the lessons by. 5 to. 6 standard deviation units.

UNED, the largest open university in Europe, is the pioneer in distance education in Spain.

This university is redefining, on the lines of other universities, many of its academic processes to meet the new requirements of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Since its inception, more than 30 years ago, the methodology chosen by UNED has been blended learning. Today, this university combines face-to-face tutorial sessions with new methodological proposals, mediated by ICT. Through a quantitative methodology, the perception of students and tutors of the new model of virtual <b>tutoring,</b> <b>called</b> AVIP Classrooms, was analyzed.

40|$|We {{created an}} {{application}} specialized in prosodic <b>tutoring,</b> <b>called</b> the Prosodic Module(PM). The PM {{is composed of}} two different sets of Learning Activities, the first one dealing with prosodic problems at word syllabic level, the second one dealing with prosodic problems at phonological phrase and utterance level. The PM is able to detect significant deviations from a master's word/ phrase / utterance and offers visual aids and a written diagnosis of the problem as well as indications on how to overcome and correct the error. This is achieved {{by means of a}} comparison between the two signals, the master and the student one; elements of comparison are constituted by the acoustic correlates of well-known prosodic elements such as intonational contour, sentence accent and word stress, duration at syllable, word and sentence level. We argue that the use of Automatic Speech Recognition as Teaching Aid should be targeted to narrowly focussed spoken exercises, for intermediate or higher level students, disallowing open-ended dialogues, in order to ensure consistency of evaluation. In addition, we support the conjoined use of ASR technology and prosodic tools to gauge Goodness of Pronunciation for linguistically consistent feedback. 1...|$|R
