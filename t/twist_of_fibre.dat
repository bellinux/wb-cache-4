40|$|Free stream tidal {{turbines}} are {{a source}} of growing interest in the marine renewable energy field. Some designs use variable pitch blade control devices in order to maximize the efficiency of the turbines; however these are complex to design, construct and maintain under the severe load conditions sub sea devices experience. There is an interest in the use of composite materials for potential improvements in hydrodynamic and structural performance of Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbines (HATT). In addition to the advantages of high strength-to-mass and high strength to stiffness ratios, anisotropy of the laminated fibre composites can be designed to allow 3 D tailoring of the blade deformation. Anisotropic structures show different levels of elastic coupling, depending on the ply angle in the layers that comprise such a material. Passive control of a turbine blade can be achieved by taking advantage of the directionality of the anisotropic composite material. A structure that undergoes both bending and twisting due to a pure bending load is said to exhibit bend-twist coupling. This type of behaviour has been identified as a potential method for load reduction - particularly fatigue loads, and an increase in both efficiency and annual energy capture in wind turbines [1]. Preliminary studies have since shown that this may also be the case for HATTs [2]. A computationally efficient, yet realistic, model has been developed in order to estimate the amount of induced twist present on a bend-twist coupled blade in a tidal stream. This model takes into account the effect on the induced <b>twist</b> <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> orientation, blade loading and cross section, material mechanical properties, and shell thickness. The method has been incorporated into a Blade Element Momentum code, modified to predict the performance of free stream tidal devices; such that the performance of a HATT with composite bend-twist coupled blades could be estimated. It has been shown that, when compared to a free stream tidal turbine with fixed blades of a similar configuration, a HATT that utilises composite bend-twist couple blades can reduced fatigue loading, bring the turbine efficiency closer to the Betz limit and increase the annual energy capture...|$|E

Ihe WDMs accept two input wavelengths {{in a common}} state of polarisation, and produce orthogonally polarised outputs which are spatially separated using a polarisation-selective element. The maximum separation demonstrated is 1. 5 nm, and the minimum 0. 04 nm, which is two orders of magnitude better than that achieved b most other in-line WDMs. A few metres <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> only are required. Instantaneous cross- talk values below - 15 dB have been measured experimentally, and theoretical analysis of the devices predicts that values below - 28 dB should be attainable. Temperature sensitivity currently limits long-term cross-talk, but also offers the possibility of tuning the centre wavelength. Methods of reducing environmental sensitivity include judicious choice <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> type and appropriate packaging of the WDMs. These techniques are investigated and discussed.

40|$|Type I {{collagen}} fibrils have circular {{cross sections}} with radii mostly distributed in between 50 and 100 nm and {{are characterized by}} an axial banding pattern with a period of 67 nm. The constituent long molecules of those fibrils, the so-called triple helices, are densely packed but their nature is such that their assembly must conciliate two conflicting requirements : a double-twist around the axis of the fibril induced by their chirality and a periodic layered organization, corresponding to the axial banding, built by specific lateral interactions. We examine here how such a conflict could contribute to {{the control of the}} radius of a fibril. We develop our analysis with the help of two geometrical archetypes : the Hopf fibration and the algorithm of phyllotaxis. The first one provides an ideal template for a <b>twisted</b> bundle <b>of</b> <b>fibres</b> and the second ensures the best homogeneity and local isotropy possible for a twisted dense packing with circular symmetry. This approach shows that, as the radius of a fibril with constant double-twist increases, the periodic layered organization can not be preserved without moving from planar to helicoidal configurations. Such changes of configurations are indeed made possible by the edge dislocations naturally present in the phyllotactic pattern where their distribution is such that the lateral growth of a fibril should stay limited in the observed range. Because of our limited knowledge about the elastic constants involved, this purely geometrical development stays at a quite conjectural level...|$|R

Classically, {{the elastic}} {{behaviour}} of cardiac tissue mechanics is modelled using anisotropic strain energy functions capturing the averaged behaviour of its fibrous microstructure. The strain energy function {{can be derived}} via representation theorems for anisotropic functions where a suitable nonlinear strain tensor, e. g. the Green strain tensor, describes locally {{the current state of}} strain [57, 150, 158]. These kinds of approaches, however, are usually of phenomenological nature and do not elucidate on the complex heterogeneous material composition of cardiac tissue characterized by different fibre hierarchies interwoven by collagen, elastin and coronary capillaries [61, 115]. Thus, pathological changes of microstructural constituents, e. g. with regards to the extra cellular matrix, and their implications on the macroscopically observable material behaviour cannot be directly investigated. In this research the fibrous characteristics of the myocardium are modelled by one dimensional Cosserat continua. This additionally allows for the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>fibre</b> motion relative to the matrix representing the non-local material response due to <b>twisting</b> and bending <b>of</b> <b>fibres.</b> In this sense, a so-called characteristic scaling parameter associated with the micro structure, becomes a material parameters of the formulation. The ability to explicitly account for torsion and bending in the constitutive law gives this approach a natural advantage over classical formulations. Moreover, the additional degrees of freedom in the kinematic description allow for more complex, realistic deformations. The assumed hyperelastic material behaviour of myocardial tissue is represented by a nonlinear strain energy function which includes the contributions linked to the Cosserat fibre continuum and the complementary terms which refer to the extra-cellular matrix.
