40|$|Background: Lung tumors showing {{ground-glass}} opacities on high-resolution {{computed tomography}} {{indicate the presence}} of inflammation, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, or localized bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. We adopted a <b>two-staged</b> video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy strategy involving completion lobectomy for localized bronchioloalveolar carcinoma with an invasive component according to postoperative pathological examination by permanent section after partial resection. Methods: Forty-one patients with undiagnosed small peripheral ground-glass opacity lesions underwent partial resection from 2001 to 2007 in Hokkaido University Hospital. Localized bronchioloalveolar carcinoma was classified according to the Noguchi classification for adenocarcinoma. Malignant lesions other than Noguchi types A and B were considered for completion lobectomy and systemic mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Perioperative data of completion video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomies were compared with data of 67 upfront video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomies for clinical stage IA adenocarcinoma performed during the same period. Results: Postoperative pathological examination revealed 35 malignant and 6 non-malignant diseases. Histologically, all of the malignant diseases were adenocarcinomas of Noguchi type A (n = 7), B (n = 9), C (n = 18), and F (n = 1). Eleven of 19 patients (58 %) with Noguchi type C or F underwent <b>two-staged</b> video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy. Three patients refused a second surgery. There was no cancer recurrence. The <b>two-staged</b> lobectomy group had a significantly longer operative time and more blood loss than the upfront lobectomy group. There was no surgical mortality or cancer recurrence. Conclusions: <b>Two-staged</b> lobectomy for undiagnosed small peripheral ground-glass opacity lesions showed satisfactory oncological results.
