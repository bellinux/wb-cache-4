5|$|University of Chicago {{scholars}} {{have played a}} major role in the development of many academic disciplines, including: <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of economics; <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of sociology; law and economics theory in legal analysis; <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of literary criticism; <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of religion; and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction (Chicago Pile-1) beneath the viewing stands of university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits are aided through its operation of world-renowned institutions, including the nearby Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Although Keynes {{has been}} widely criticised – {{especially}} by members of <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of economics – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was {{a firm believer in}} balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure {{to meet the needs of}} exceptional circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The University of Chicago {{has been}} the site of some {{important}} experiments and academic movements. In economics, the university has {{played an important role}} in shaping ideas about the free market and is the namesake of <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of economics, the school of economic thought supported by Milton Friedman and other economists. The university's sociology department was the first independent sociology department in the United States and gave birth to <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of sociology. In physics, the university was the site of the Chicago Pile-1 (the first controlled, self-sustaining man-made nuclear chain reaction, part of the Manhattan Project), of Robert Millikan's oil-drop experiment that calculated the charge of the electron, and of the development of radiocarbon dating by Willard F. Libby in 1947. The chemical experiment that tested how life originated on early Earth, the Miller–Urey experiment, was conducted at the university. REM sleep was discovered at the university in 1953 by Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinsky.|$|E

5|$|Chicago {{initially}} {{led the way}} in skyscraper design, {{with many}} constructed {{in the center of the}} financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E

5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained Keynesian policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in <b>the</b> <b>Chicago</b> <b>school</b> of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E

Mead, on social reform issues, including promoting women's rights, ending child labor, and mediating during the 1910 Garment Workers' Strike.

At one point, his reputation as percussion composer landed him a commission from the Columbia Broadcasting System to compose a soundtrack for a radio play by Kenneth Patchen.
