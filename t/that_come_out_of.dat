A gruff loner, Wolverine is also a father-figure to Rogue and feels love toward Jean.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, an {{experimental}} satellite-based weapon that fires miniature black holes, called the Dimension Tide, opens a wormhole through which a prehistoric dragonfly enters {{the present and}} deposits a single egg before exiting through the wormhole. A boy finds the egg and takes it {{with him when he}} moves to Tokyo. The egg starts oozing a strange liquid, so the boy throws the egg in the sewer. The egg, actually a mass of hundreds of eggs, splits up and starts growing when exposed to water, hatching into large dragonfly larva called Meganulon <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sewer to feed. They flood a portion of the city and molt on the sides of buildings, becoming adult Meganula.|$|E

25|$|Wetlands are an {{important}} part of the Reno/Tahoe area. They act as a natural filter for the solids <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the Great Basin. However, the area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt, destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.|$|E
500|$|The storyline in this episode, which {{features}} Tracy having to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor alcohol levels in his sweat {{due to a}} {{driving under the influence}} arrest, is based on events which actually happened to actor Tracy Morgan, who portrays Tracy Jordan. Morgan has twice been arrested for drunk driving: once in December 2005 and once in November 2006. He was sentenced to 36 months probation, fined US$390, and mandated to attend an alcohol education program at the 2005 arrest. As a result of the 2006 arrest, Morgan was fined US$1000 and had his drivers license suspended for six months. Morgan was also ordered to wear a Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring (SCRAM), [...] "an ankle bracelet worn to test for alcohol vapors <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the skin".|$|E
500|$|Weapon XI is {{a genetically}} altered mutant killer. He has powers taken from other mutants killed or kidnapped in the film, {{as well as}} {{retractable}} blades in his arms. He is referred to by Stryker as [...] "the pool, the mutant killer: Deadpool" [...] because the compatible powers of the other mutants have been 'pooled' together into one being. This interpretation of Deadpool is lacking his traditional red suit and mask, and also includes a mouth sewn shut and the abilities of Cyclops' optic blasts, Wraith's teleportation, and samurai swords <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his fists from within his arms, similarly to Wolverine's claws. [...] Ryan Reynolds portrays Weapon XI for close-ups, standing shots, and simple stunts while Scott Adkins {{is used for the}} more complicated and dangerous stunt work.|$|E

Robert Canning of IGN {{gave it a}} [...] "good" [...] rating of 7 out of 10, and noted [...] "hit and miss musical performances, random quirky and funny bits, and storytelling choices that kind of sort of work". TVLine Michael Slezak was more enthusiastic, {{and said it was}} the [...] "best episode" [...] of the third season; he credited both Helen Mirren and [...] "some righteous plot development that stays true to core characters". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post commented that Glee had [...] "returned to its frequent habit of dropping plots twists on us <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nowhere", and MTV's Kevin P.

After the aliens are defeated, Masha chooses {{to stay with}} Ichigo when she goes to London with Masaya. In {{addition}} to detecting the chimera animals, Masha eats the jelly-fish like parasites <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the victims after they are defeated. She can also merge with Mew Aqua found by the Mew Mews to transform into the Mew Aqua Rod, allowing any of the Mew Mews to perform the Ribbon Aqua Drops healing attack. Primarily communicating by repeating the sounds [...] "pi" [...] and [...] "tweet", Masha {{does not appear to}} be designed to support high-level speech initially, though in Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode she is once shown speaking in a complete sentence. In the Tokyo Mew Mew anime adaptation, Masha is male instead of female, has a more extensive vocabulary, and tries, unsuccessfully, to assist the Mew Mews in some battles.|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film 4 (out of 5) stars, {{saying that it}} was [...] "attention-grabbing from {{inception}} till conclusion. The drama only soars higher and the complex love story gets more and more gripping as the conflict between the characters come to the fore." [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: [...] "At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And it is just that. JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation." [...] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Bollywood." [...] Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flawthe story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed." [...] Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes {{you fall in love with}} love all over again." [...] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But I recommend that you see it. Because only Yash Chopra could make heartache so attractive and ennobling that his characters wear it like a badge of honor." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all we need is a Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E

[...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I think she would never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death.

GLAAD itself criticized the storyline [...] "for reinforcing the idea that being gay is something to be ashamed of," [...] while TV Guide noted [...] "It's hard to disagree with those who say that's a lousy representation of gay folks." [...] Executive Producer Frank Valentini defended the story, saying, [...] "This is a story about the harsher side of intolerance and about one man not being true to himself. There are going to be meaningful, frank discussions <b>that</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this."
