50|$|During Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 3, the thirst {{and body}} <b>temperature</b> <b>meter</b> has been {{replaced}} by a stress meter. The meter rises after engaging in angry conversations and witnessing/experiencing various traumatic incidents. The player can choose from several responses during conversations, allowing them to choose how to behave towards fellow survivors. These responses allow the player to control the character's personality, and also have occasional effects on the character, such as lowering or raising their stress levels. High stress will affect the character's movements, causing them to have trouble walking. The character's health meter will drop during hazardous situations, such as touching fire or remaining in the vicinity of a gas leak. The character's status bars can be replenished or reduced by consuming food and medicine, or completely restored by resting on a bench, which also allows the player to save the game.|$|E

However, unlike that aforementioned Mirai Ninja, he has no [...] "life meter", just a <b>temperature</b> <b>meter</b> which increases when he is hit, and decreases when he is not hit - but, if the timer should run out, his cooling device will break (indicated by the text of [...] "COOLING DEVICE BROKEN" [...] {{at the bottom of the}} screen). And if he should overheat (which usually happens when there are too many enemies firing at him at once), the game will immediately be over (as six texts about impossible continuation appear on the screen and he explodes); the game is composed of four stages which must be finished twice (like in Namco's own Rolling Thunder), and are all named after songs by the rock band Rush: [...] "Middletown Dreams", [...] "Distant Early Warning", [...] "Subdivisions", and [...] "Grace Under Pressure".|$|E

Because this light is often greenish, a magenta filter may correct it. More sophisticated colorimetry tools can be used if such meters are lacking.|$|R

40|$|Lowering {{uncertainty}} in crude oil volume measurement {{has been widely}} considered as one of main purposes in an oil export terminal. It is found that crude oil <b>temperature</b> at <b>metering</b> station has big effects on measured volume and may cause big uncertainty at the metering point. As crude oil flows through an aboveground pipeline, pick up the solar radiation and heat up. This causes the oil <b>temperature</b> at the <b>metering</b> point to rise and higher uncertainty to be created. The amount of temperature rise is depended on exterior surface paint color. In the Kharg Island, there is about 3 km distance between the oil storage tanks and the metering point. The oil flows through the pipeline due to gravity effects as storage tanks are located 60 m higher than the metering point. In this study, an analytical model has been conducted for predicting oil temperature at the pipeline exit (the metering point) based on climate and geographical conditions of the Kharg Island.

40|$|AbstractGathering {{information}} that is capable to explain customersâ€™ needs is usually seen as a quite straightforward part of the traditional construction process: a customer {{should be able to}} tell all relevant needs in the first stage so that a building could be designed and built according to the gained information. But the process is lacking of service abilities if a customer wants to modify the given information due to a change in circumstances, albeit such a change is easily caused due turbulent economic situations and long spans in real-estate development projects. Hence the customer perspective regarding the construction management (CM) process should be accommodated better. In this paper, the case studies of the four premises improvement projects are reported upon, where the CM process was altered to include and apply the concepts of continuous improvement and co-creation. The process documentation covered the impacts of the case project on the usability of the premises, the indoor climate conditions (carbon dioxide and <b>temperature)</b> <b>metering,</b> the time lapse cameras and the on-line user feedback system.
