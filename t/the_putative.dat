5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, <b>the</b> <b>putative</b> hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of <b>the</b> <b>putative</b> hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E

In the present study, these putative NPFF agonists/antagonists containing different N-terminal sequences were further examined for their pharmacological profiles in thermoregulatory and nociceptive tests. The {{results indicated that the}} two dansylated agonists potently possessed similar thermoregulation (rank order of potencies: dansyl-GSRFamide ≫ NPFF > dansyl-PQRFamide) and different modulation of opioid-induced analgesia; in contrast, both of <b>the</b> two <b>putative</b> antagonists exhibited marked hypothermia (rank order of potencies: dansyl-PQRamide > dansyl-GSRamide) and facilitation of morphine analgesia (rank order of potencies: dansyl-PQRamide > dansyl-GSRamide). These data reveal that the difference of the N-terminal residues of <b>the</b> two <b>putative</b> agonists causes their dissociation of pharmacological pro- and anti-opioid effects. In addition, their N-terminal part is important to determine the potency of the dansylated agonists/antagonists. Our work might be helpful to develop a highly potent and fluorescent NPFF ligand.

5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, <b>the</b> <b>putative</b> therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
5|$|The first {{science fiction}} magazine, Amazing Stories, {{appeared}} in 1926. By {{the end of}} the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several magazines. In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later. Galaxys appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic Mike Ashley, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, when the market dipped again as a side effect of US Senate hearings into <b>the</b> <b>putative</b> connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.|$|E

5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened {{the future of the}} new government at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats and a group of Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by the new government, they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to the new government. At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include <b>the</b> <b>putative</b> 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E
5|$|Motif finding, {{also known}} as profile analysis, is a method of {{locating}} sequence motifs in global MSAs that is both a means of producing a better MSA and a means of producing a scoring matrix for use in searching other sequences for similar motifs. A variety of methods for isolating the motifs have been developed, but {{all are based on}} identifying short highly conserved patterns within the larger alignment and constructing a matrix similar to a substitution matrix that reflects the amino acid or nucleotide composition of each position in <b>the</b> <b>putative</b> motif. The alignment can then be refined using these matrices. In standard profile analysis, the matrix includes entries for each possible character as well as entries for gaps. Alternatively, statistical pattern-finding algorithms can identify motifs as a precursor to an MSA rather than as a derivation. In many cases when the query set contains {{only a small number of}} sequences or contains only highly related sequences, pseudocounts are added to normalize the distribution reflected in the scoring matrix. In particular, this corrects zero-probability entries in the matrix to values that are small but nonzero.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>putative</b> {{artifact}} goes back almost a century. The earliest record {{goes back to}} a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the inscriptions. Identification of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|E

40|$|Timothy, Arcaro, No More Secret Adoptions: Providing Unwed Biological Fathers with Actual Notice of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Putative</b> Father Registry, 37 Capital University Law Review 449 (2008). In 2003, the Florida Legislature {{approved}} {{sweeping changes}} to Florida 2 ̆ 7 s codified Adoption Act. At {{the heart of}} these changes was the promulgation of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Putative</b> Father Registry. <b>The</b> 2003 Florida Adoption Act created a legal presumption that every unwed biological father in Florida had knowledge {{of the existence of}} the registry and its requirements even though the father received no actual notice. This presumption ultimately worked as a waiver of parental rights for those fathers who failed to timely register. Unwed biological fathers who registered properly preserved their right to receive actual notice of an intended adoption involving their offspring. Where an unwed biological father established compliance with the additional requirements set forth in the statute, his consent to the adoption would also be required. The 2003 Florida Adoption Act obligated the Florida Department of Health to publicize <b>the</b> Florida <b>Putative</b> Father Registry. Regardless of the Department 2 ̆ 7 s publicity efforts, however, unwed biological fathers were legally presumed to know and understand their legal obligations relating to the Registry requirements. While an unwed biological father was entitled to receive an adoption disclosure relating to an intended adoption of his offspring, that document did not provide any reference to <b>the</b> Florida <b>Putative</b> Father Registry. <b>The</b> 2003 Adoption Act raised constitutional concerns regarding the Registry because the Act failed to provide actual notice to unwed biological fathers in adoption proceedings, it eradicated all defenses for failing to register with the Registry, and it created a series of questionable legal presumptions. The Florida Supreme Court had the opportunity to address these issues in Heart of Adoptions, Inc. v. J. A. The court chose to avoid the constitutional issues implicated in the statute by reconciling the statutory language to provide actual notice of intended adoptions to putative fathers. 9 Although the court resolved the notice issue, other questions regarding the construction, application, and constitutionality of <b>the</b> Florida <b>Putative</b> Father Registry remain...|$|R
