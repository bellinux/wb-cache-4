5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top to bottom, right-to-left; the first column being {{on the right side of}} <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> <b>and</b> the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation. A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, who said {{that they did not know}} what had happened to the original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>and</b> protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E
5|$|Once Nate {{emerges from}} the vessel, he and Sully are confronted by another {{treasure}} hunter named Gabriel Roman (Simon Templeman), to whom Sully owes {{a great deal of}} money. Backed by his partner, archaeologist Atoq Navarro (Robin Atkin Downes), Roman forces Nate to hand over <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>and</b> shoots Sully dead when he tries to intervene. Before he can kill Nate, a loose torpedo charge previously accidentally triggered by Nate causes the U-boat to explode, distracting the gang long enough for Drake to escape. He runs into Elena, who agrees to help him find the statue, and together they use Sully's plane to travel to the old colony.|$|E

5|$|On 22 May 2013, Valor por Tamaulipas {{released}} a video {{sent to the}} page by an alleged organized crime group. In the video, {{a man and a}} woman are interrogated by alleged drug traffickers and ask the administrator to close <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>and</b> reveal his true identity. The couple was presented as supposed family members of the administrator; however, he later indicated that they were not his family, and that the criminal organization had either confused them or simply targeted a random family to pressure to administrator to close the page. Valor por Tamaulipas responded by sending a message to the authorities in Tamaulipas and blamed them for the death of a person who died of a cardiac arrest after the couple was kidnapped; the administrator also accused the Tamaulipas authorities of protecting Los Zetas drug cartel.|$|E

25|$|The {{broadcaster}} constantly {{sends out}} pages in sequence {{in one of}} two modes: Serial mode broadcasts every page sequentially whilst parallel mode divides VBI lines amongst the magazines, enabling one page from each magazine to be broadcast simultaneously. There will typically be a delay of a few seconds from requesting <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>and</b> it being broadcast and displayed, the time being entirely dependent in the number of pages being broadcast in the magazine (parallel mode) or in total (serial mode) and the number of VBI lines allocated. In parallel mode, therefore, some magazines will load faster than others.|$|E
25|$|A Web crawler {{starts with}} a list of URLs to visit, called the seeds. As the crawler visits these URLs, it {{identifies}} all the hyperlinks in <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>and</b> adds them to the list of URLs to visit, called the crawl frontier. URLs from the frontier are recursively visited according to a set of policies. If the crawler is performing archiving of websites it copies and saves the information as it goes. The archives are usually stored in such a way they can be viewed, read and navigated as they were on the live web, but are preserved as ‘snapshots'.|$|E

Grant was buried on 4 December 1995 at Hellingly Cemetery, with the funeral service held at St Peter and St Paul's Church, Hellingly, East Sussex. His eulogy was read by longtime friend Alan Callan.

25|$|Miyazaki {{drew the}} Nausicaä episodes {{primarily}} in pencil. The work was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Frederik L. Schodt observed differences between Nausicaä and other Japanese manga. He {{has noted that}} it was serialized in the large A4 size of Animage, {{much larger than the}} normal size for manga. Schodt has also observed that Miyazaki drew much of Nausicaä in pencil without inking, and that <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>and</b> panel layouts, as well as the heavy reliance on storytelling, are more reminiscent of French comics than of Japanese manga. In appearance and sensibilities, Nausicaä reminds Schodt of the works of Mœbius.|$|E
25|$|Knowing her {{background}} in anthropology and various Native American organizations, {{it is not}} surprising that the most prevalent image in her poetry are bones. In her poetry, the image of battered bone is the direct link to native American sense of self. The bones of dead Indians almost form the words on <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>and</b> are the spine holding together each of her volumes of poetry. Stemming from her work with anthropology, she writes about bones auctioned, objects sold, and bodies stuffed for our edification in a museum display. Those dead Indians both form the phantoms that haunt her poetry and at the same time are given new life and the chance to speak out in her poetry.|$|E

25|$|Spiral binding is {{the most}} {{economical}} form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases and other publications where it is necessary or desirable {{to be able to}} open the publication back on itself without breaking the spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along {{the entire length of the}} spine of <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>and</b> winding a wire helix (like a spring) through the holes to provide a fully flexible hinge at the spine. Spiral coil binding uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.|$|E
25|$|A Hasse diagram is {{a simple}} picture of a finite {{partially}} ordered set, forming a drawing of the partial order's transitive reduction. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on <b>the</b> <b>page</b> <b>and</b> draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from x to y precisely when x < y {{and there is no}} z such that x < z < y. In this case, we say y covers x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.|$|E
25|$|Applied seals, by contrast, were {{originally}} used to seal a document closed: {{that is to}} say, the document would be folded and the seal applied {{in such a way}} that the item could not be opened without the seal being broken. Applied seals were used on letters close (letters intended only for the recipient) and parcels to indicate whether or not the item had been opened or tampered with since it had left the sender, as well as providing evidence that the item was actually from the sender and not a forgery. In the post-medieval period, seals came to be commonly used in this way for private letters. A letter writer would fold the completed letter, pour wax over the joint formed by the top of <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> <b>and</b> then impress a ring or other seal matrix. Governments sometimes sent letters to citizens under the governmental seal for their eyes only, known as letters secret. In general, seals are no longer used in these ways except for ceremonial purposes. However, applied seals also came to be used on legal instruments applied directly to the face of the document, so that there was no need to break them, and this use continues.|$|E

5000|$|Search engine {{optimization}} {{is the use}} of keywords in a {{web site}} to increase its ranking and thus visibility in the organic, crawler-based listings of search engines.

Based on this data, the search engines then index <b>the</b> <b>pages</b> <b>and</b> rank <b>the</b> websites accordingly.
