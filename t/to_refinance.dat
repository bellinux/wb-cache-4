In 1990, the airport company was forced <b>to</b> <b>refinance,</b> and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county.

40|$|This paper studies early {{refinancing}} {{activities in}} the corporate bond market and its impli-cations for debt maturity structure. In additional to interest rate reduction, speculative-grade firms constantly extend maturity through early refinancing. Moreover, they take advantage of accommodating credit market conditions to extend maturity on a large scale, leading to pro-cyclical debt maturity structure. The evidence is consistent with precautionary maturity management, where speculative-grade firms extend maturity in order to hedge against future refinancing risk, as the longer maturity reduces {{the possibility of being}} forced <b>to</b> <b>refinancing</b> at high yield rates.

5|$|Air Europe {{fell under}} {{financial}} distress in 1991 and terminated all its Gatwick operations on 8 March. This resulted in Norway Airlines having to ground both its aircraft. Before operations could commence, the two creditors of the aircraft, Fokus Bank and Christiania Bank, had <b>to</b> <b>refinance</b> the two holding companies. As the aircraft remained grounded {{when the military}} contract started on 1 April, Norway Airlines had to lease aircraft externally to operate the charters. The aircraft were freed up {{towards the end of}} April, allowing the services with Gullivers Reiser to commence on 28 April. Originally the leases on the aircraft expired 1 April 1993 and 1994, respectively, but Norway Airlines renegotiated them to both expire 1 April 1994. The Gullivers Reiser contract involved flying from Norway to Greece, Spain, Portugal and Turkey. Air Europe's bankruptcy cost Norway Airlines NOK6 million and required the company to reduce its staff from 196 to 106 employees. One aircraft was fully utilized, although the second was occasionally operated for Star Tour, Vingreiser and British Airways.|$|E

The annual interest payable on the bond came to approximately £45million per annum, with the bond due to mature on 1 February 2017. Contained within the bond prospectus were covenants that would allow the Glazers to filter large sums of money out of the club to repay the PIKs by 2015.

We present such a new refinancing model, derived from the first principle, based on a single assumption that each loan has an incentive threshold above which its borrower will refinance. In this model, the refinancing prepayment of a cohort is a dynamic self-selection process that evolves by itself according to the encountered mortgage rate environment with the cohort concurrently acquiring its memory along the way. ...|$|R

The model shows how banks' reactions interact with extended refinancing operations and asset purchases by the central bank.
