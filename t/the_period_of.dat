5|$|Determining {{the nature}} of the planet has not been straightforward; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter-mass planet on an {{eccentric}} orbit.

40|$|Recently, {{the flood}} tidal sand bars have been {{developed}} at the entrance channel of Toufutsu Lake located along Okhotsk Sea in Hokkaido, and they affect flood control, inland water fisheries in lake, and so forth. In this study, we aimed to reveal the developmental process of sand bars by observations, which are velocity observation, water level observation, bed material investigation and video monitoring. Followings were major accomplishments of this study. (1) The maximum magnitude of reverse velocity at St. 400 in the entrance channel during <b>the</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> flood-tide was faster than that of normal velocity during <b>the</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> ebb-tide.
