Vieira scored two goals, the following match against Charlton Athletic, in what was his final appearance before a five-match suspension. It was feared that Vieira was prepared to turn his back on English football as he felt victimised – Wenger, several Arsenal players and fans supported him publicly, amid speculation that Italian club Juventus were prepared to offer Vieira an [...] "escape route". Vieira himself, after the ban, expressed his desire to remain at Arsenal, but noted he could never alter his style of play: [...] "...because, basically, I don't want to change.

In 1804 {{he and his wife}} agreed to a separation, and their relationship was further poisoned the following year after Knight brought a case of criminal conversation with his wife against Col. Fuller, his sister’s brother-in-law. He was awarded damages of £7,000. In 1813, Mrs Knight gave birth to a son, of an unknown father. She gave notice that, on her husband’s death, she would claim the Knight property for her son. Knight collected testimonies to prove that the child was not his, but on Mrs Knight’s death in 1842, an agreement was reached between the son and the next heir to the entail to sell the land and divide the proceeds [...] Knight thereupon left Barrells and settled at Chadshunt, near Gaydon. [...] The contents of Barrells Hall were regarded by Knight as his personal property and descended in the family of his only grandson, Maj. Edward Raleigh King, of Chadshunt, son of his daughter, Georgiana, who married Col. Edward Bolton King.

50|$|The {{adaptation}} {{started with}} a scandal. The entire first act of the play was censored and consequently not performed on stage. However, this censorship only referred to the actual events on stage {{but not to the}} written text. The script of Richard III was fully printed and included all censored lines and words. The visualisation on stage was thought to create parallels to <b>the</b> actual <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>England.</b> <b>The</b> spectators might become deeply involved in the action on stage because of the contemporary costumes which made scenes look like real <b>life.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> showing of brutal scenes was feared to have a bewildering effect on the audience. Another reason for the censorship lies in the fear that the rewritten first act might show parallels to James II and may help to create sympathy for him. The political fear behind this accusation is very clear, but the idea that Cibber used the play to strengthen Jacobite ideas is far-fetched.|$|R

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: This study {{explores the}} {{financial}} consequences of decreased acute care utilization and expanded community-based care for patients at <b>the</b> end of <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>England.</b> METHOD: A Markov model based on cost and utilization data {{was used to}} estimate the costs of care for cancer and organ failure {{in the last year}} of life and to simulate reduced acute care utilization. RESULTS: We estimated at pounds 1. 8 billion the cost to the taxpayer of care for the 127, 000 patients dying from cancer in 2006. The equivalent cost for the 30, 000 people dying from organ failure was pounds 553 million. Resources of pounds 16 to pounds 171 million could be released for cancer. CONCLUSION: People generally prefer to die outside hospital. Our results suggest that reducing reliance on acute care could release resources and better meet peoples' preferences. Better data on the cost-effectiveness of interventions are required. Similar models would be useful to decision-makers evaluating changes in service provision...|$|R

40|$|Background: Increasing {{numbers of}} childless {{men as well}} as fathers with reduced or no contact with their {{children}} have sparked concern about an erosion of fatherhood. Although the general trend is undisputed, claims about men's decreasing family involvement lack a sound empirical basis that enables comparisons between countries and sub-groups of society. Objective: This study derives long-term trends in father-child co-residence over <b>the</b> <b>life</b> course <b>in</b> <b>England</b> and Wales, and provides comparisons of these trends by level of education and ethnic origin. Methods: The paper calculates shares of father-child co-residence from the National Statistics Longitudinal Study (LS) and the British Labour-Force Surveys (LFS). Results: There has been a decline of father-child co-residence <b>in</b> <b>England</b> and Wales for men in their thirties, an even greater decline for men in their twenties, and a small increase in the shares of father-child co-residence at higher ages. The trends for different educational groups were similar, but men with a degree had particularly low rates of father-child co-residence at younger ages, and relatively high ones at older ages. Neither less-educated men, nor men from Black-Caribbean and Black-African origins showed rates of father-child co-residence as low as one might have expected. Conclusions: The steady decline of father-child co-residence among men born between 1930 and 1979 <b>in</b> <b>England</b> and Wales lends support to claims about an erosion of fatherhood. However, it is unwarranted to generalize findings from other countries about particularly low levels of father-child co-residence among less-educated men to men <b>in</b> <b>England</b> and Wales...|$|R

40|$|The {{trial of}} the Templars in the British Isles was far less {{dramatic}} than the trial in France. No Templars were burned at the stake; there were no fatal curses and no searches for missing treasure. Several Templars disappeared, {{but most of them}} later returned – from Ireland, where they had been living openly and collecting government pensions alongside the Irish Templars. King Edward II protested against the trial, but went along with it so as to protect his own interests. Although witnesses came forward to testify that the Templars were all guilty as charged, the papal inquisitors could find little solid evidence against them. Their final report to the pope was made up of second-hand rumour and gossip. Yet while the Templars insisted that they were innocent, the Church authorities <b>in</b> <b>England</b> resolved to dissolve the Order, long before the pope made the final decision for dissolution. This book follows the course of the trial <b>in</b> <b>England,</b> Scotland and Ireland, and the work of the royal administrators of the Templars’ estates, offering an insight into <b>the</b> Templars’ everyday <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>England</b> and Ireland {{at the beginning of the}} fourteenth century...|$|R
40|$|Eremitism {{is a broad}} {{movement}} and took many different forms {{during the course of}} the middle ages. This thesis is a comparative study of <b>the</b> eremitic <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>England</b> and France during the period when it had, arguably, reached the height of its popularity. While eremitism in both countries shared many common characteristics, there were also differing interpretations of how this ideal should be achieved. That is most noticeable in the way eremitic communities were structured and in the activities with which they engaged. Inevitably, modem perceptions of medieval eremitism are shaped by the sources available, notably the writings of the hagiographers, all of whom had their own objectives when choosing to write <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> of a particular hermit. Modem historians, therefore, view medieval eremitic practices through the words of these hagiographers rather than through the actions of the hermits themselves. Using extant Vitae and other relevant texts, this study begins with an assessment of the primary sources, and how the language they use has affected both medieval and modem perceptions of the hermit. The terminology adopted for differentiating between a hermit, recluse and anchorite, if indeed, this is necessary, is significant to this debate and is discussed in the first two chapters. The following three chapters (3 - 5) examine how hermits lived, the support stmctures they created and how these differed <b>in</b> <b>England</b> and France. While hermits established their own networks, they were still reliant on sponsorship from both the Church and society, which helped them to lead lives in accordance with their high ideals. The final three chapters (6 - 8) offer an analysis of the broad range of activities which hermits undertook, both spiritual and temporal, and explores how they interacted with the Church and society through these activities. It was due to such interaction that they were seen as channels for divine power and regarded by contemporaries as 'living saints'...|$|R

50|$|Simon is Lewis's {{best friend}} and roommate at Oxford {{at the start of}} the series. He disappears into Albion early on after {{entering}} a cairn in Scotland during sunset. It is later implied that this was his plan all along to escape <b>the</b> tedium of <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>England.</b> He becomes a respected member of Meldryn's army after several years and ascends to the leadership of Prince Meldron's personal guard, the Wolf Pack, also changing his name to Siawn Hy. Simon is a Machiavellian opportunist who exhibits selfish ambitions from the start, who thinks nothing of jilting his girlfriend, Susannah, without telling her of his intentions, and while he initially assists Lewis when he first stumbles into Albion himself, he quickly gains a ruthless ambition which leads to their becoming lethal enemies. He instills Prince Meldron with the idea of succeeding his father instead of following the proper course of succession through bardic choice, and eventually succeeds in having King Meldryn murdered. Simon assists Meldron in his brutal campaign to rule Albion, and does not hesitate to kill or brutalize any who oppose him. He is ultimately responsible for hundreds, if not thousands of deaths and very nearly succeeds in his plan to rule from behind the scenes. He is thwarted when Meldron is killed, and is grievously wounded before returning to his own world. He recovers and returns to the world of Albion after making a deal with greedy industrialists to strip-mine the Foul Land and exploit its resources. He also takes on the persona of the Brazen Man, and engineers a revenge plot against Llew by abducting his queen and luring Llew to the Foul Land. After dealing Llew a fatal blow, Simon meets his end when the Song of Albion restores the land to its former glory by burning away all its corrupting influences (including Simon and his cohorts).|$|R
6000|$|I {{talked a}} little while with Lord Wriothesley Russell. From him we derived {{the idea that the}} queen was {{particularly}} careful in the training and religious instruction of her children. He said that she claimed that the young prince should be left entirely to his parents, in regard to his religious instruction, till he was seven years of age; but that, on examining him at that time, they were equally surprised and delighted with his knowledge of the Scriptures. I must remark here, that such an example as the queen sets in the education of her children makes itself felt through all the families of the kingdom. Domesticity is now <b>the</b> fashion <b>in</b> high <b>life.</b> I have had occasion to see, in many instances, how carefully ladies of rank instruct their children. This argues more favorably for the continuance of English institutions than any thing I have seen. If the next generation of those who are born to rank and power are educated, in the words of Fenelon, to consider these things [...] "as a ministry," [...] which they hold {{for the benefit of the}} poor, <b>the</b> problem of <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>England</b> will become easier of solution. Such are Lord Shaftesbury's views, and as he throws them out with unceasing fervor in his conversation and conduct, they cannot but powerfully affect not only his own circle, but all circles through the kingdom. Lady Shaftesbury is a beautiful and interesting woman, and warmly enters into the benevolent plans of her husband. A gentleman and lady with whom I travelled said that Lord and Lady Shaftesbury had visited in person the most forlorn and wretched parts of London, that they might get, by their own eyesight, a more correct gauge of the misery to be relieved. I did not see Lord Shaftesbury's children; but, from the crayon likenesses which hung upon the walls, they must be a family of uncommon beauty.|$|R
