The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience {{it would be for}} Stan. This is most strongly illustrated {{at the end of the}} episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin he must not force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of [...] "natural causes", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, [...] "Basically, it is OK <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>yourself,</b> but you shouldn't ask someone else to do it and put someone else through the trip." ...|$|E

[...] "There were some really good looking girls running out with their hands over their heads...Did [...] try {{to have sex with}} any of the good looking girls?...At least if you are going <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>yourself</b> and kill all the kids, why wouldn't you have some sex?...If I was going to kill some people, I'd take them out with sex." [...] Hundreds complained to KXPK, the show's affiliate in Denver. Stern argued his comments were taken out of context, and accused critics of being overly sensitive. [...] "I dared to ask if kids had sex. So what? That's how I think. I had zero intent to make fun of the situation. The point in making that comment was an attempt to try to understand a motive. We didn't know anything about motives [...] and were trying to consider all possibilities." ...|$|E

He also {{attended}} Jackson State University, where his mother worked as a political science professor, and Millsaps College, where he was suspended for a year after taking a library book without checking it out. His suspension followed ongoing criticism from the administration, including president George Harmon, who believed his controversial pieces on race in the school newspaper adversely affected campus and alumni relations. Laymon detailed his experience of racism at Millsaps, and as a coming-of-age black man in Mississippi, in his essay for Gawker, [...] "How <b>to</b> Slowly <b>Kill</b> <b>Yourself</b> and Others in America." [...] The essay was widely read and attracted both negative and positive comments on his portrayal of his racial experiences.

Amanda produced and distributed her own zine and was an iron-willed feminist, which enthralled Armstrong. Amanda, however, was unimpressed with Armstrong and though the couple dated for some time she ultimately dumped him in 1994 and joined the Peace Corps leaving Armstrong feeling suicidal. Armstrong stated {{in an interview with}} Spin about the inspiration behind the Insomniac song Armitage Shanks in 1995, [...] "It was right before Dookie came out and I was really at odds with myself. I was like man do I really want to do this? A lot of time I was thinking about suicide, how it's so easy <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>yourself,</b> but it's so hard to stay alive. I was in a break-up with my then girlfriend, a total, raving punk rocker who didn't approve of me being on a major label. She moved down to Ecuador saying she couldn't live in a world with McDonald's and such. It was fucking me up pretty bad." [...] Armstrong has written many songs about Amanda, both during their relationship and afterwards, including [...] "She", [...] "Good Riddance", [...] "Stuart And The Ave", [...] "Sassafrass Roots", [...] "Amanda", [...] "She's A Rebel", [...] "Extraordinary Girl" [...] and [...] "Whatsername".

In addition to Laymon's satirical time-travel novel [...] "Long Division," [...] his book of autobiographical essays, How <b>to</b> Slowly <b>Kill</b> <b>Yourself</b> and Others in America was published by Agate in August 2013.

Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress and The Washington Post wrote that [...] "If Laymon’s novel runs into some plotting problems {{over the course of}} its run, it succeeds in doing something more emotionally moving, producing a series of crystalline moments when City comes to a clearer understanding of the world he lives in-and the kind of man he wants to be in it." [...] Novelist, professor, and social commentator Roxane Gay, in a piece for The Nation, called Long Division [...] "an ambitious novel, and though it is raw and flawed, it is the most exciting book I’ve read all year.

He does not wear great goblin {{spectacles}} that magnify his eyes to moons or diminish his neighbours to beetles. When he is more dignified he wears a single eyeglass; when more intelligent, a wink. He is not indeed wholly without interest in heredity and Eugenical biology; but his studies and experiments in this science have specialised almost exclusively in equus celer, the rapid or running horse. He is not a doctor; though he employs doctors to work up a case for Eugenics, just as he employs doctors to correct the errors of his dinner.

He is not a soldier, though he may have a commission in the yeomanry; nor is he generally a gentleman, though often a nobleman. His wealth now commonly comes from a large staff of employed persons who scurry about in big buildings while he is playing golf.
