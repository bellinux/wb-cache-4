5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is {{the general}} path of {{tropical}} cyclones in the eastern Pacific. They generally move north-westward or westward due to steering by the prevailing upper level winds, which takes them far out to sea and away from land.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> the {{district}} is significant is its collection of buildings and their architectural styles (Criterion C). Most of these buildings were constructed during the Indiana Gas Boom in the late 19th century or early 20th century, and have many of their original features. Three styles of architecture, Italianate, Renaissance Revival, and Romanesque Revival are all well represented, and additional styles can also be found.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but this hearing came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} {{other reasons for}} the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the {{previous}} night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, noticed and shelled by the Syrians, {{but one of the}} companies managed to climb up the Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> was that they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im had been promised replenishment, and attacked Degania short of ammunition. Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition. The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis were not aware of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.|$|E
25|$|MVI's {{simplicity}} {{was due to}} two reasons. Firstly, Digital {{had determined}} that the Alpha 21164 was already capable of performing DVD decoding through software, therefore not requiring hardware provisions for the purpose, but was inefficient in MPEG-2 encoding. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> was the requirement to retain the fast cycle times of implementations. Adding many instructions would have complicated and enlarged the instruction decode logic, reducing an implementation's clock frequency.|$|E
25|$|The first {{contribution}} to this was a large unilateral reduction which began with an announcement by Gorbachev in December 1988; these reductions continued {{as a result of}} the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and in accordance with Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaties. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> for the decline was the widespread resistance to conscription which developed as the policy of glasnost revealed to the public the true conditions inside the Soviet army and the widespread abuse of conscript soldiers.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2012, several {{national}} secular groups {{sponsored a}} Reason Rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., with a lineup of speakers and performers that included Richard Dawkins, Tim Minchin, Bad Religion, and James Randi. The stated {{purpose of the}} rally was [...] "to unify, energize, and embolden secular people nationwide". Crowd estimates ranged from 8000 to 30,000. In 2015, organizers announced plans for a <b>second</b> <b>Reason</b> Rally, but did not set a date. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> quadrennial <b>Reason</b> Rally was held on June 4, 2016 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C..|$|R
50|$|Frequently, false alarms {{occur because}} car alarm owners use high {{sensitivity}} settings. This {{may be the}} main reason why loud bass frequency sound (loud music, other cars or motorcycles with loud exhaust systems, thunderstorms, etc.) can set off car alarms. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> possible <b>reason</b> is that {{some parts of the}} alarm system may be improperly installed.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> {{has to do}} with precedent. In the 1920s, the Supreme Court {{upheld the}} {{constitutionality}} and validity of several land laws. Invalidating the California Alien Land Law would have required overturning these decisions – something that the Court is typically loath to do, especially so shortly after the decision dates. In this case, the Court was able to address the unfairness of the application of the law by focusing on the petitioners’ first contention, and effectively ignore the broader implications.|$|E
25|$|All etched or {{sintered}} anodes have a {{much higher}} surface compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. That increases the later capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, {{by a factor of}} up to 200 for non-solid aluminium electrolytic capacitors as well as for solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors. The large surface compared to a smooth one is <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> for the relatively high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared with other capacitor families.|$|E
25|$|It {{is easier}} to detect planets around low-mass stars, for two reasons: First, these stars are more {{affected}} by gravitational tug from planets. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is that low-mass main-sequence stars generally rotate relatively slowly. Fast rotation makes spectral-line data less clear because half of the star quickly rotates away from observer's viewpoint while the other half approaches. Detecting planets around more massive stars is easier if the star has left the main sequence, because leaving the main sequence slows down the star's rotation.|$|E
50|$|There {{seem to be}} {{two main}} reasons that caused the demise of Mongolic and {{emergence}} of Hazaragi amongst {{the people of the}} Hazarajat.

25|$|The Little 500 is {{much more}} than just the race. There are also several series events {{associated}} with the race. These events are held for a few reasons. The first and foremost is for fun. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is so that teams can scout out the competition and get a feel for that year's race field. And the final reason is so that all the members of a team, not just those competing in the actual race itself, can still participate and compete. There are four other series events outside of the race: Qualifications, ITTs, Miss-N-Out, and Team Pursuit.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the causes}} of the War of 1812 may have been an American desire to annex or {{threaten}} to annex British Canada in order to stop the Indian raids into the Midwest, expel Britain from North America, and gain additional land. The American victories at the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames in 1813 ended the Indian raids and removed {{one of the reasons for}} annexation. The American failure to occupy any significant part of Canada prevented them from annexing it for <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason,</b> which was largely ended by the Era of Good Feelings, which ensued after the war between Britain and the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{foraging}} {{activities of}} Vespula vulgaris are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is {{to satisfy the}} larval requirements. The workers fly off {{early in the morning}} to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is to maximize fluid foraging. Because dews and nectars are most abundant {{early in the morning and}} are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> Hacienda Buena Vista is {{significant}} {{is that it}} offers {{one of the best}} remaining examples of a Puerto Rican coffee plantation. This is important because {{in the latter part of}} the nineteenth century the coffee produced in Puerto Rico and exported to Europe and the United States was considered among the finest in the world. It is said to have even been the favorite at the Vatican at the time. Hacienda Buena Vista is also significant because it shows the evolution of the coffee industry in the region. Various periods can be appreciated. These range from the cultivation of produce such as plantains (1833–1845); to the production of flour (from rice and corn) (1847–1872). These products were staples for the subsistence of the local population.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{reasons why the}} Cynics are so named. First because of the {{indifference}} of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is that the dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third {{reason is that the}} dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.|$|E
25|$|There have been, and {{continue}} to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This {{has proved to be}} of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no exotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a hypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see what has to happen before BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This has been done to put limits on the mass of a stable tau neutrino.|$|E

25|$|It {{is known}} as the gray-sac winged bat first because of the sacs located between the wrist and the neck on the {{membrane}} of the wing, which is far more prominent and developed in males than in females. This sac is a defining feature: in this bat, the sac is {{in the center of the}} antebrachial membrane, while in others it is not centrally located. There have been reports that the inside of this sac is white, but others have stated that it varies in color and texture depending on the age of the bat and the season. Whichever the case, the sac has a proximal opening. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> this bat {{is known as}} the gray sac- winged bat is because of its coloring, which can range from the gray color it is known for to a rich brown; despite the differences, all varieties have white trim. It has darker colored fur on its back (dorsal) and lighter covered fur on its front (ventral).|$|E
25|$|Closed mode systems, by definition, {{are closed}} without a vent. When making {{measurement}}s, closed systems take a CO2 measurement of ambient air {{just after the}} soil sample chamber is sealed. This becomes the CO2 reference. The system continues to take measurements at regular intervals {{over the next few}} minutes until a final CO2 concentration is recorded at a predetermined end time over time. Closed systems have the advantages that they are used by more researchers, and they provide wind proof results. Since there is no vent, wind is not an issue. When using a closed mode system, {{it is important that the}} experimental design include a maximum measuring time for two reasons: First; if the measuring time is too long, an unacceptable positive partial CO2 pressure can build up in the chamber limiting the amount of additional CO2 from entering the chamber, causing a measuring artifact. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> is that if a chamber that is closed for too long, it can modify ambient conditions and cause measuring artifacts. Finding the optimal measuring time range is important. Tests on the soil in question can confirm the best time solution, and eliminate the partial CO2 pressure buildup from being a significant issue.|$|E
25|$|Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae {{family are}} also antigenically stable, {{meaning that the}} glycoproteins on the viruses are {{consistent}} between different strains of the same type. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that the genome is non-segmented and thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment. In order for this process to occur, segments are needed as reassortment happens when segments from different strains are mixed {{together to create a}} new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another and so there is no antigenic shift. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>reason</b> relates to the idea of antigenic drift. Since RNA dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that paramyxoviruses should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient. These viruses {{would not be able to}} survive as long compared to the more virulent strains, and so would die out.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> major <b>reason</b> is {{that the}} various {{hardware}} operating states for power management {{can be difficult to}} use effectively. This is because deeper low power states tend to have larger transition latency and energy costs than lighter low power states. For workloads that have frequent and intermittent bursts of activity, such as web search queries, this prevents the use of deep lower power states without incurring significant latency penalties, which may be unacceptable for the application.|$|R
5000|$|Crested {{penguins}} lay two eggs, {{but almost}} always raise only one young successfully. All species exhibit the odd phenomenon of egg-size dimorphism in breeding; the first egg (or A-egg) laid is substantially smaller than <b>the</b> <b>second</b> egg (B-egg). This is most extreme in the macaroni penguin, {{where the first}} egg averages only 60% the size of <b>the</b> <b>second.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> for this is a mystery remains unknown, although several theories have been proposed. British ornithologist David Lack theorized that the genus was evolving toward the laying of a one-egg clutch. Experiments with egg substitution have shown that A-eggs can produce viable chicks that were only 7% lighter at time of fledging. [...] Physiologically, the first egg is smaller because it develops while the mother is still at sea swimming and thus has less energy {{to invest in the}} egg.|$|R
