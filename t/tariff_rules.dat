50|$|Water supply {{policies}} and regulation are usually defined {{by one or}} several Ministries, {{in consultation with the}} legislative branch. In the United States the United States Environmental Protection Agency, whose administrator reports directly to the President, is responsible for water and sanitation policy and standard setting within the executive branch. In other countries responsibility for sector policy is entrusted to a Ministry of Environment (such as in Mexico and Colombia), to a Ministry of Health (such as in Panama, Honduras and Uruguay), a Ministry of Public Works (such as in Ecuador and Haiti), a Ministry of Economy (such as in German states) or a Ministry of Energy (such as in Iran). A few countries, such as Jordan and Bolivia, even have a Ministry of Water. Often several Ministries share responsibilities for water supply. In the European Union, important policy functions have been entrusted to the supranational level. Policy and regulatory functions include the setting of <b>tariff</b> <b>rules</b> and the approval of tariff increases; setting, monitoring and enforcing norms for quality of service and environmental protection; benchmarking the performance of service providers; and reforms in the structure of institutions responsible for service provision. The distinction between policy functions and regulatory functions is not always clear-cut. In some countries they are both entrusted to Ministries, but in others regulatory functions are entrusted to agencies that are separate from Ministries.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Finding cheap train {{connections}} for long-distance {{traffic is}} algorithmically a hard task due to very complex tariff regulations. Several new tariff options {{have been developed}} in recent years, partly to react on the stronger competition with low-cost airline carriers. In such an environment, it {{becomes more and more}} important that search engines for travel connections are able to find special offers efficiently. We have developed a multi-objective traffic information system (MO-TIS) which finds all attractive train connections with respect to travel time, number of interchanges, and ticket costs. In contrast, most servers for timetable information as well as the theoretical literature on this subject focus only on travel time as the primary objective, and secondary objectives like the number of interchanges are treated only heuristically. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show by means of a case study how several of the most common <b>tariff</b> <b>rules</b> (including special offers) can be embedded into a general multi-objective search tool. Computational results show that a multi-objective search with a mixture of <b>tariff</b> <b>rules</b> can be done almost as fast as just with one regular tariff.

The WTO is assumed as an arbitrator for the exchange in an oligopolistic industry and sets <b>tariff</b> <b>rules</b> according to the SDT principles; a firm's cost is private information both for the WTO and the foreign rivalries.

Furthermore, a strategy proof tariff rule has been designed in which firms can never make his revenue better off by misreporting production cost.

40|$|We {{consider}} three political-economy {{arguments in}} favor of a uniform <b>tariff</b> <b>rule</b> (UTR). First, if tariffs are determined by lobbying, adoption of a UTR creates a free-rider problem. A tariff resulting from lobbying by one sector becomes available to all other sectors. This reduces incentive for lobbying. Second, if there are imported inputs which are used by import-competing sectors, a UTR leads to a lower level of lobbying. Finally, a UTR may tie the hands of a future government expected to favor certain sectors over others, and enhance welfare ex ante. None of these presents an air-tight case for uniformity.

40|$|According to the literature, {{well known}} <b>tariff</b> reform <b>rules</b> that are {{guaranteed}} to increase welfare will not necessarily increase market access, while rules that {{are guaranteed to}} increase market access will not necessarily increase welfare. Such conflict between welfare and market access objectives of trade policy is problematic and calls for finding alternative <b>tariff</b> reform <b>rules</b> that can achieve both objectives at the same time. The present paper contributes to this aim by using {{a new set of}} tariff reforms that are based on local optimality. Using such reforms it is shown that market access and consumer welfare will always be weakly compatible, in the sense that reforms based on each objective have the same signed effect on the other objective. For strong compatibility, whereby both objectives increase {{as a result of a}} locally optimal tariff reform, we derive both a necessary and sufficient condition and a simple sufficient condition...|$|R

The Bank's structural adjustment and trade reform programs have often recommended abolition of quantitative import restrictions and increased uniformity in tariffs. This report is a formal analysis of some political economy arguments for uniform tariffs. The authors present three models in which unifrom <b>tariff</b> <b>rules</b> may be adopted {{as a way}} of minimizing the welfare costs of endogenously determined tariffs. In the first two models, tariffs are demand determined : the government is essentially unable to resist the lobbying pressure. In the third model, tariffs are supply determined {{in the sense that they}} result from the government's preference for certain sectors over others. After examining the three models, the authors conclude that in each case it is possible for a uniform tariff regime to yield higher welfare than a regime in which tariffs can diverge across sectors.

We develop an analytical framework to evaluate four major supply chain structures that we observed in practice. We derive the optimal supply chain decisions for each structure and investigate various business environments under which one of the structures is preferred over the others. Our analysis indicates that the ultimate purpose of a product sold in the China market (i. e., whether it will be consumed domestically or be assembled in another exported product) may {{have a significant impact on}} the structure preference. In addition, threshold values exist for several key business parameters over (or under) which certain supply chain structures are favored over others. Managerial insights based on such results are useful for multinational firms who are challenged to develop effective supply chain strategies in the region's increasingly volatile business environment. tax-effective supply chain management, international tax and tariff, supply chain structures...|$|E
40|$|When governments choose trade policy, {{rarely do}} they have {{complete}} information, At the time decisions are made, policy makers have only estimates of market responses, {{as well as the}} responses of foreign governments. In many realistic situations, even the policy objectives of other governments may not be known. For example, the balance of constitutional powers in the United States is often cited as a source of confusion as to objectives of U. S. trade policy. In this paper we examine the Bayesian Nash equilibria of several noncooperative tariff games with incomplete information, In the models examined, the home country has private information about whether its government is a low or high tariff type. If the foreign government is uncertain about this type in a one-shot game, its Nash equilibrium tariff will be lower (higher) than if it knew the home government were a low (high) tariff type. In two multistage games, misleading behavior by the home government is shown to be an equilibrium strategy for sufficiently high discount factors. Whether the uncertainty is persistent or can be resolved is shown to be important for welfare results in the multistage setting.
