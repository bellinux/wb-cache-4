500|$|During his {{lifetime}} Disraeli's opponents, {{and sometimes even}} his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction. Lord John Manners, in 1843 {{at the time of}} Young England, wrote, [...] "could I only satisfy myself that D'Israeli believed all that he said, I should be more happy: his historical views are quite mine, but does he believe them?" [...] Blake (writing in 1966) suggested that it is no more possible <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> now than it was then. Nevertheless, Paul Smith, in his journal article on Disraeli's politics, argues that Disraeli's ideas were coherently argued over a political career of nearly half a century, and [...] "it is impossible to sweep them aside as a mere bag of burglar's tools for effecting felonious entry to the British political pantheon." ...|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. We knew we had <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to do all that Indian mysticism stuff. I thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that. So I was nervous about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and the way all of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E

The {{manner in which}} a governmental entity establishes or interacts with a private corporation performing public services can be crucial <b>to</b> <b>answering</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> Entanglement between government and private corpo-rations can lead a court to apply certain personnel laws and rights that would otherwise not apply in the private context. Using various court cases as examples, this legal brief highlights some issues worthy of further consideration...|$|R

A {{few days later}} a Western diplomat confirmed that Fiji was on-schedule for elections in 2014: [...] "It seems fairly clear now {{that there will be}} elections of some description in Fiji in 2014. The real question {{is the extent to which}} those elections meet minimal international standards for being free and fair. Crucial <b>to</b> <b>answering</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> is seeing whether everyone is allowed to compete, and the media and civil society are able to operate in a minimally unimpeded manner." ...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{characteristic}} of oracles in myth {{is that they}} are almost always misunderstood by those who hear them; hence Oedipus's misunderstanding the significance of the Delphic Oracle.

Oedipus's assumption is incorrect, the Oracle does, in a way, answer his question: ...|$|E
2500|$|From 185 to 184, Baebius {{was one of}} the ambassadors (legati) sent to {{negotiate}} disputes between Philip, his former joint commander in the Roman-Syrian War, and surrounding Greek polities, who had lodged complaints about Philip's occupation of Aenus and Maroneia. At a hearing, Philip himself testified {{on the question of whether}} Rome had agreed that he could hold any cities he had captured during the campaign of 191, or only those cities that had been [...] "originally" [...] Aetolian. Although Baebius should have been able <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> conclusively, he appears not to have, and the commission arrived at no summation: [...] "The hearing was in fact a farce." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scalia, too, {{began by}} {{addressing}} O'Connor. The intervening years {{had not changed}} his position that the plurality's position in that case was [...] "standardless and unsupported." [...] Nor, a footnote responding to Stevens added, was the approach of that case's dissent relevant unless it was overruled at some point. Applying the test from his concurrence in that case to the instant case, he wrote, [...] "the proper threshold inquiry should be not whether the Fourth Amendment applies to messages on public employees' employer-issued pagers, but whether it applies in general to such messages on employer-issued pagers". But it was unnecessary <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> since he agreed with the majority that the search had been reasonable.|$|E

Gunmen reportedly burst into his home and demanded money, demanding to know [...] "Are you battymen?" [...] "I think his silence, his refusal <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> sealed it", said Yvonne McCalla Sobers, the head of Families Against State Terrorism. [...] "Then they opened his laptop and saw a photograph of him with his partner in some kind of embrace that showed they were together. So they took him out and killed him." [...] Six people have been charged with the killing. Their trial began and was then postponed in 2007. It was resumed in 2012, in 2014 one of the accused was set free.|$|E
2500|$|About this time, Robeson's {{belief that}} trade {{unionism}} {{was crucial to}} civil rights became a mainstay of his political beliefs as he became proponent of the union activist Revels Cayton. Robeson was later called before the Tenney Committee where he responded to questions about his affiliation with the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) by testifying {{that he was not}} a member of the CPUSA. Nevertheless, two organizations with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) and the CAA, were placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO). Subsequently, he was summoned before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and when questioned about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating: [...] "Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are about to go to jail for the failure <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> and I am going to join them, if necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|The German Millionaires risk format {{features}} an extra lifeline called [...] "Ask One of the Audience", {{in which the}} host will reread the question and ask the audience who think {{they would be able}} <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> to stand up. The contestant may choose one of these (judging by looks only) and discuss the question at length with said audience member. He may or may not choose an answer after that. If he chooses the suggested answer and it proves to be correct, the audience member will also receive a prize of â‚¬500. This lifeline is also implemented in the Costa Rican version, after the first milestone is reached. Starting in its thirteenth season, the U.S. syndicated version uses a variant of this lifeline, called [...] "Plus One", which allows the contestant to bring a companion with them for help, rather than having them select their companion from the audience.|$|E

We see these events as facilitating construction of an identity that shields the participants from backlash in a less than accommodating institutional setting.

This version of the paper concludes with indications of the direction of the development and a request for suggestion...|$|R
