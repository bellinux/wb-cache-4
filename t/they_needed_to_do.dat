25|$|The shutout win was the Patriots' {{first since}} 2006, while the Patriots' eight passing {{attempts}} were the second fewest in franchise history, behind only the three attempts in the Snowplow Game of 1982. This game also cemented an NFL {{record for the}} Patriots for the fewest penalties in a 16-game season, with 57, breaking the 2007 Seattle Seahawks' former record of 59 in a season. New England had done what <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but unfortunately watched as Miami and Baltimore won their late games and left the Dolphins as the 2008 AFC East champs, the Ravens as a wild card team, and the Patriots missing {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 2002.|$|E
25|$|The {{investors in}} the Lowell textile {{companies}} decided <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about their transportation situation. They looked toward the railroads budding in England, and now in America, for inspiration and took operations on the Summit Hill & Mauch Chunk Railroad and the construction ongoing on the Allegheny Portage Railroad and Baltimore & Ohio {{and a handful of}} other ventures as omens and inspiration. A railroad could run year round, was expandable with as many tracks as they might need, and could use the new locomotives that were being highly praised in England at the heart of recent news stories. By 1829 the B was testing a locally produced steam locomotive, the Tom Thumb, and opened for passenger operations in May 1830. With well-publicized and ambitious plans to scale one of the gaps of the Allegheny and cross the Ohio River, and New York and Pennsylvania's canal mania sprinkled with railroads, Massachusetts and New England investors were looking at bold plans everywhere.|$|E
500|$|On March 31, 1967, {{while the}} Experience waited {{to perform at}} the London Astoria, Hendrix and Chandler {{discussed}} {{ways in which they}} could increase the band's media exposure. When Chandler asked journalist Keith Altham for advice, Altham suggested that <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something more dramatic than the stage show of the Who, which involved the smashing of instruments. Hendrix joked: [...] "Maybe I can smash up an elephant", to which Altham replied: [...] "Well, it's a pity you can't set fire to your guitar". Chandler then asked road manager Gerry Stickells to procure some lighter fluid. During the show, Hendrix gave an especially dynamic performance before setting his guitar on fire {{at the end of a}} 45-minute set. In the wake of the stunt, members of London's press labeled Hendrix the [...] "Black Elvis" [...] and the [...] "Wild Man of Borneo".|$|E

500|$|By 1970, the Who had {{obtained}} significant critical and commercial success, {{but they had}} started to become detached from their original audience. The mod movement had vanished, and the original followers from Shepherd's Bush had grown up and acquired jobs and families. The group had started to drift apart from manager Kit Lambert due to his preoccupation with their label, Track Records. They had been touring since the release of Tommy the previous May, with a set that contained most of that album, but realized that millions had now seen their live performances, and Pete Townshend in particular recognized that <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something new. A single, [...] "The Seeker", and a live album, Live at Leeds were released in 1970, and an EP of new material ("Water", [...] "Naked Eye", [...] "I Don't Even Know Myself", [...] "Postcard" [...] and [...] "Now I'm a Farmer") was recorded, but not released as the band felt {{it would not be}} a satisfactory follow-up to Tommy.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{wanted to}} have gospel music {{as part of the}} song, with {{virtually}} no instrumentation, only the sound of an organ and her singing. So she started experimenting using just her vocals, giving away to the bridge being composed. After the full song was finalized, Madonna and Leonard decided to record it alongside a choir around September 1988. Both of them met with musician Andraé Crouch and vocalist Roberto Noriega, and signed their choir to provide background vocals. Crouch scrutinized the lyrics as he wanted to [...] "find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what we work with, and we liked what we heard." [...] At Jonny Yuma recording studio, he got his choir together and explained to them what <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> during the recording session. He had listened to the demo of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] in his car, and directed the choir accordingly. The choir was recorded separately, and Leonard wanted it to be added during post-production.|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} Humongous, Soule met fellow {{employee}} and video game designer Chris Taylor, and {{signed on to}} compose the soundtrack to his major project, Total Annihilation. Soule convinced Taylor that, given {{the large amount of}} other real-time strategy games coming out {{at the same time as}} Total Annihilation with techno scores, that to separate themselves <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a large orchestral score. He went so far as to bet a year's worth of reduced pay that it would pay off; Gilbert felt that it did after the first sentence of the first review of the game he read was about the music. Given the software limitations at the time, to make the sound work correctly required a full live orchestra, the first that Soule had ever worked with; the orchestral tracks in Evermore had been performed by Soule and his brother by themselves, two instruments at a time. The soundtrack earned Soule his first award, that of [...] "Best Music" [...] of 1997 from GameSpot in their year-end awards. Soule spent the next two years composing music for the game's two expansion packs and for children's games.|$|E

2500|$|Shamrock {{was portrayed}} badly on the show, feuding with his fighters and often {{appearing}} uninterested. Shamrock admitted to doing {{a poor job}} with his fighters: [...] "I failed them miserably, completely. So I {{have to figure out}} a way to get this...back in the driver's seat", Shamrock said during the show. Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: [...] "I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I’ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at one point. I was the champion and (Masakatsu) Funaki was the number one contender. The rest were all Lion's Den fighters. My reputation doesn’t have to be spoken for or defended. The UFC and Spike TV did what they thought <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for ratings, but in the end, my fans, my family and my God know exactly who I am." ...|$|E
2500|$|An early {{draft for}} the remake had moved the setting to {{northern}} California, and altered the third act to include {{elements of the}} supernatural. When that script was rejected, Carl Ellsworth {{was brought in to}} touch up the script written by Adam Alleca. Ellsworth had previously worked with Craven on Red Eye, but had never seen the original Last House on the Left. After reading the script and watching the 1972 film—the latter he found difficult to watch because of its extreme nature—Ellsworth decided that the first thing <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to establish someone whose survival you wanted the audience to root for. The writer wanted to know how the [...] "typical family" [...] would react to such a heinous act being perpetrated on their daughter, and what they were truly capable of. Craven points out that most of the early script problems were based around deciding what elements to include. They were never sure how much of the Krug family needed to be seen, what elements from the original film should be included, or even if Mari should live or die.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{of budget}} constraints, the {{production}} crew will often recycle sets to save money. For instance, the hospital corridor for Smallville Medical Center {{was transformed into}} Lex’s cell in [...] "Asylum", which was later transformed into the asylum corridor, before finally being morphed into Dr. Teng’s laboratory in later episodes. When the production crew {{could not afford to}} rent a local night club, with all of the extras they needed, for more than one night they decided to film all of the wide shots—capturing the three hundred plus extras—on the first night. Then, with their remaining funds, they filmed close-ups of the actors with a limit of fifty extras in the background. When scenes in the season three premiere called for Lex to be stranded on a deserted island, instead of traveling to a beach, the crew found a mountain range in Vancouver that had an area in front of the mountain that resembled a beach. The resemblance was close enough that all <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to bring in some palm trees to complete the aesthetic they were going for. All of the island scenes were shot in one day.|$|E
