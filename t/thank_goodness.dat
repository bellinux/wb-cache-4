Sometimes, in fact, the placement didn't matter so much because the power sent the ball through men recognized as outstanding fielders. Once such stroke, a cover-drive, was through Thomas's legs just as he got his hands there. I felt glad that the ball went between his legs and that his hands were not behind it. Not even Jehu drove more furiously than Dexter, and a direct hit on the leg or hands might well have put this accomplished fieldsman out of action.|$|E

In March 1931, Jackson felt his health had recovered sufficiently to join an exhibition tour of Far North Queensland, led by Alan Kippax. He found the tour exhausting, with arduous travel and damp weather, but played well enough to top the aggregate with over 1,100 runs {{at an average of}} 93.00. In a letter to his childhood friend and New South Wales team-mate, Bill Hunt, he wrote, [...] "Our tour of North Queensland has now concluded and <b>thank</b> <b>goodness!</b> ...

[...] According to Grossman, Kinky Boots facilitates the retraining of the eye to gender conventions and “repositions the marginalised figure as central to the spectacle of mass theatre... enacting a shift in the perspective of the viewer”. The finale “Raise You Up/Just Be” epitomises the empowerment of the individual, empowerment to “Just Be” regardless of the “oppressive gender roles directly connected to patriarchal views of legacy and inheritance” under which Charlie and Lola initially suffer.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, aged 12, he {{enrolled}} in a minor seminary in Traunstein. This period lasted until the seminary was closed for military use in 1942, and the students were all sent home. Ratzinger returned to the Gymnasium in Traunstein. During this period in the seminary, following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was enrolled in the Hitler Youth, as membership was legally required in effect beginning 25 March 1939. Following the seminary closure he continued required attendance with the Hitler Youth to avoid financial penalties in the Gymnasium tuition fees. The financial penalty (which theoretically required documentation of attendance at Hitler Youth activities) was overlooked when a sympathetic mathematics professor allowed him not to attend any meetings. In Ratzinger's book Salt of the Earth, Ratzinger says the following [...] "... <b>Thank</b> <b>goodness,</b> {{there was a very}} understanding mathematics teacher. He himself was a Nazi but an honest man, who said to me, 'Just go once and get the document so [...] that we have it' ... When he saw that I simply didn't want to, he said, 'I understand, I'll take care of it', and so I was able to stay free of it." ...|$|E

Conwell auditioned for the role because her [...] "entire family watches the show", she explained [...] "the character was one that I really wanted to play. When I went to the audition, I just really felt it and I think it came off in the audition. I really enjoy working with the cast. They are such great actors which I don’t {{think a lot of people}} realize. The whole experience has been just great". Conwell prepared for the role by researching characteristics of lawyers. Additionally, she said, [...] "I also watched a lot of movies where actors or actresses I admire played lawyers. I then added my own spin on it which I think is very important. I had been a fan of the show, so I had an idea of the role. But <b>thank</b> <b>goodness</b> for the internet." [...] Conwell said that she enjoys playing Leslie, a role which signifies [...] "growth" [...] for her career. In December 2012, after two years on recurring, Conwell was placed on contract by Bell's successor, Jill Farren Phelps however, was dropped back to recurring in August 2014.|$|E

But in Puss in Boots, that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots doesn't break any new ground in the {{storytelling}} department, and its reliance on go-go-go state-of-the-art action sequences grows wearying by the end, but the movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "It's always a pleasure to find a family film that respects its audience {{all the way up the}} line." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Remember that toy where you yank a string and hear the sound of a barnyard animal? [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has about half as much entertainment value." [...] Olly Richards of Empire gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Like most kittens, it's not always perfectly behaved, but at least this new Puss adventure doesn't have you reaching for the cinematic spray bottle. And <b>thank</b> <b>goodness</b> the spin-off does nothing to neuter the charismatic cat's appeal." [...] Stan Hall of The Oregonian gave the film a B, saying [...] "Puss in Boots isn't particularly deep, nor does it take itself seriously -- it just wants to seek glory, win affection and cash in. Done, done and done." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Jackson {{left the}} role in 1999, a recast was opposed by viewers and costars. When Jackson's {{departure}} {{had previously been}} rumored in 1996, Anthony Geary (Luke) told TV Guide that he [...] "went to (the GH powers) and said, 'If we lose him, then let's kill Lucky.' Jonathan is too {{much a part of}} us to replace him." [...] Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999. When a recast was rumored in early 2000, Jackson stated: [...] "When all the actors {{who are going to be}} working with the character don't want it, it's kind of too bad that they still do it. But I don't really get surprised with a lot of things that they do." [...] The role was recast with Jacob Young, and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000, the character had been off-screen for almost a year, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson's popularity. Young was able to become accepted by fans; in 2001, Candace Havens wrote in The Free Lance–Star: [...] "His hard work has paid off and many fans can't even remember there was ever someone else in the role." [...] Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by People magazine in 2001. In 2002, Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. Greg Vaughan, who took over the role from 2003 to 2009, was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award. However, Vaughan did have a fan following. He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar, featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas. At the start of 2008, Zap2it named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list, stating: [...] "The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well. <b>Thank</b> <b>goodness</b> we're getting to see it." [...] During Vaughan's tenure, Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) that was popular with fans. Zap2it named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth (Herbst) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), stating: [...] " [...] conceived out of a revenge plot, yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry. Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009?" [...] When Vaughan left in 2009, he reflected on his reception: [...] "I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me, whether they liked me or not. It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time." [...] Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character. In April 2008, Allison Waldman of The Huffington Post named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on General Hospital, stating: [...] "He's still the real Lucky to many people, even though two other actors have subsequently played the part." ...|$|E

6000|$|He stood a moment, {{then walked}} slowly homeward by the terrace. It {{seemed to him}} that to leave her thus, for a gain on which she herself insisted, was to know her better and admire her more. But he was aware of a vague ferment of feeling which her evasion of his {{question}} half an hour before had done more to deepen than to allay. In the midst of it suddenly, on the great terrace of the Chateau, he encountered M. de Mauves, planted there against the parapet and finishing a cigar. The Count, who, he thought he made out, had an air of peculiar affability, offered him his white plump hand. Longmore stopped; he felt a sharp, a sore desire to cry out to him that he had the most precious wife in the world, that he ought to be ashamed of himself not to know it, and that for all his grand assurance he had never looked down into the depths of her eyes. Richard de Mauves, we have seen, considered he had; but there was doubtless now something in this young woman's eyes that had not been there five years before. The two men conversed formally enough, and M. de Mauves threw off a light bright remark or two about his visit to America. His tone was not soothing to Longmore's excited sensibilities. He seemed to have found the country a gigantic joke, and his blandness went but so far as to allow that jokes on that scale are indeed inexhaustible. Longmore was not by habit an aggressive apologist for the seat of his origin, but the Count's easy diagnosis confirmed his worst estimate of French superficiality. He had understood nothing, felt nothing, learned nothing, and his critic, glancing askance at his aristocratic profile, declared that if the chief merit of a long pedigree was to leave one so fatuously stupid he <b>thanked</b> <b>goodness</b> the Longmores had emerged from obscurity in the present century and in the person of an enterprising timber-merchant. M. de Mauves dwelt of course on that prime oddity of the American order--the liberty allowed the fairer half of the unmarried young, and confessed to some personal study of the [...] "occasions" [...] it offered to the speculative visitor; a line of research in which, during a fortnight's stay, he had clearly spent his most agreeable hours. [...] "I'm bound to admit," [...] he said, [...] "that in every case I was disarmed by the extreme candour of the young lady, and that they took care of themselves to better purpose than I have seen some mammas in France take care of them." [...] Longmore greeted this handsome concession with the grimmest of smiles and damned his impertinent patronage.|$|R
