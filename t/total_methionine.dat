In the first experiment, 720 birds (50 % Lohmann LSL and 50 % Lohmann Brown) at one week of age were distributed on a completely randomized design, 5 x 2 factorial arrangement (levels of met + cys and strain), with four replications and 18 birds each. The levels of <b>total</b> <b>methionine</b> + cystine studied were 0. 536; 0. 616; 0. 696; 0. 776; and 0. 856 %. At 22 weeks of age, 240 birds were used for the second experimental phase. The diets given to birds at this phase was the same for all the treatments. In the production phase, the residual effects of the experimental diets provided during the initial phase on the production parameters were evaluated. The level of methionine + cystine recommended for white-egg and brown-egg pullets in the period from 1 to 6 weeks of age are 0. 778 % of <b>total</b> <b>methionine</b> + cystine (0. 700 % met + cis digestible) and 0. 739 % of <b>total</b> <b>methionine</b> + cystine (0. 665 % of digestible methionine + cystine), respectively.

40|$|One hundred-fourteen high-lean growth gilts (initial wt of 100 lb) {{were used}} to {{determine}} the level of digestible methionine required to optimize growth performance and carcass characteristics from 100 to 240 lb. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block with blocks based on initial BW. Three pigs per pen and six pens per treatment were used. Gilts were fed a corn and soybean meal-based diet containing. 21,. 24,. 27,. 30,. 33, or. 36 % digestible methionine (. 25 to. 425 % <b>total</b> <b>methionine)</b> in both the grower and finisher periods. The grower diet (fed from 100 to 165 lb) was formulated to contain 1. 17 % total lysine (. 94 % digestible) and. 52 % cystine, whereas the finisher diet contained 1. 01 % total lysine (. 83 % digestible) and. 49 % cystine. Cornstarch was replaced by DL-methionine to provide the experimental methionine concentrations. Average daily gain, ADFI, and feed efficiency (F/G) were not influenced by increasing digestible methionine from 100 to 165 lb, 165 to 240 lb, or 100 to 240 lb. Neither average backfat thickness nor longissimus muscle area was influenced by increasing digestible methionine at 240 lb. From 100 to 240 lb, carcass protein and lipid accretion were not influenced by digestible methionine. The data from this experiment suggest that the methionine requirement for high-lean growth gilts is not greater than. 25 % <b>total</b> <b>methionine</b> (. 21 % digestible methionine; 6 gld <b>total</b> <b>methionine</b> intake) from 100 to 240 lb.

40|$|D-methionine was {{administered}} intraperitoneally to rats in tracer (2 – 2. 5 Μmoles/kg) and large doses (4. 7 mmoles/kg) {{and the brain}} levels of total (D + L) methionine, {{as well as of}} cysteine (+cystine) and glutathione were determined. The effect of co-administering the convulsant agent, L-methionine-DL-sulfoximine (MSO) was also examined. The administration of tracer doses of C 12 -D-methionine resulted in a doubling of <b>total</b> brain <b>methionine</b> within 4 hours post-injection, but only in a moderate increase of the levels of cysteine. When C 14 -D-methionine was used as tracer, the peak increase of the isotopic methionine pool and a peak accumulation of 0. 35 % of the injected radioactivity were noted in the brain within 1. 5 hours. When 4. 7 mmoles/kg of D-methionine were administered, <b>total</b> brain <b>methionine</b> and cysteine increased by 4 - and 3 -fold respectively, the former peaking at 1. 5 hr and the latter at 2. 5 hr post-injection. The administration of MSO retarded the attainment of these peaks. It could also be shown that while about 65 % of the <b>total</b> brain <b>methionine</b> existed as the D-isomer 1. 5 hr after its administration, only 46 % was still present as the D-isomer 0. 5 hr later. When MSO {{was administered}} simultaneously with D-methionine, the corresponding percentage values stood at 70 % at 1. 5 and at 2 hr. The results, therefore, suggest that even though D-methionine reaches the brain largely unchanged, its uptake and its conversion to the natural L-isomer may be inhibited by MSO under certain conditions and hence its conversion to cysteine retarded...|$|R

This experiment aimed to evaluate chemical and energetic quality of corn obtained in a feed mill before and after pre-cleaning. Twenty samples of 30 kg of corn each were taken from trucks delivering corn to the mill. The trucks were then unloaded and the material passed through a pre-cleaning process when another sample was taken. Samples were graded and physical properties evaluated: density (g/L), grain percentages of foreign material, impurities, fragments, broken, soft, insect damaged, fire-burnt, fermented, damaged, cracked and fine particles, as well as chemical composition analysis: Apparent metabolizable energy for poultry (AME), ether extract (EE), crude fiber (CF), starch (STA), water activity (WA), crude protein (CP), digestible and <b>total</b> lysine, <b>methionine,</b> cystine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, histidine and arginine. The experiment was a randomized design with two treatments (before and after pre-cleaning) and twenty replications. Data was analyzed using SAS &# 174; and treatment differences obtained using F test. Correlations and principal components were calculated. There was a decrease in density after the pre-cleaning process, which was {{probably due to the}} removal of earth and stones rather than grain and its fractions. Significant increases were found for insect damage, fermented and damaged grain while fire-burn was significantly reduced after the pre-cleaning process. Starch increased after pre-cleaning which is a result of contaminants that normally are poor in this carbohydrate, but fiber levels increased too. Apparent metabolizable energy, aminoacids, digestible (P< 0. 05) and total (P< 0. 05) histidine, <b>total</b> lysine and <b>methionine</b> (P< 0. 1) levels were reduced after pre-cleaning.

40|$|Background: Previous {{epidemiologic}} {{research suggests}} a protective role of one-carbon nutrients in carcinogenesis. Folate, however, {{may play a}} dual role in neoplasms development: protect early in carcinogenesis and promote carcinogenesis at a later stage. We prospectively examined associations between intake of <b>total</b> folate, <b>methionine,</b> riboflavin, vitamin B 6, and risk of lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms (including subtypes) and investigated whether alcohol modified the effects of folate. Methods: The Netherlands Cohort Study consists of 120, 852 individuals who completed a baseline questionnaire in 1986, including a 150 -item food-frequency questionnaire. After 17. 3 years of follow-up, 1, 280 cases of lymphoid and 222 cases of myeloid neoplasms were available for analysis. Results: Intakes of folate, methionine, and riboflavin were not associated with lymphoid or myeloid neoplasms. For vitamin B 6, a statistically significantly increased myeloid neoplasms risk was observed (highest vs. lowest quintile: HR = 1. 87; 95 % confidence intervals, 1. 08 – 3. 25). When analyzing by lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms subtypes, no clear associations were observed for most subtypes, {{with just a few}} increased risks for some subtypes and nutrients. Some risks became nonsignificant after excluding early cases. No interaction between alcohol and folate was observed. Conclusions: We observed a few significant positive associations; however, some of these would be expected to arise due to chance alone.

Methanethiol emission was analyzed using pumpkin leaf discs. Emission was observed in darkness or light, however methanethiol emission was greately stimulated by light. Light-dependent emission started after a lag-time of 5 - 6 hr with an emission peak after 36 - 40 hr. Maximum rates obtained were {{in the range of}} 200 pmol methanethiol/min/square cm leaf area. After a period of 42 hr about 60 - 80 % of <b>total</b> <b>methionine</b> sulphur added was released as methanethiol. Addition of chloramphenicol did not alter the induction period nor the maximum emission rate of methanethiol in response to L-methionine. Emission was also observed in response to S-methyl-L-cysteine; however, the shorter lag-period for methanethiol formation occured in response to L-methionine. Feeding experiments with L-(S(35 -isotope)) methionine to leaf discs showed that more than 80 % of methanethiol emitted was derived from the labelled methionine fed. These findings suggest that plants have the capacity to degrade L-methionine to methanethiol. Whole leaves fed L-methionine by the petiole systems do not emit methanethiol, but this compound is formed and transported into the feeding solution. Thus, methanethiol is also produced by the intact leaf, but, in contrast to sulphide, is not released into the atmosphere. (IFU...|$|E

Baseline genome stability of lympho-cytes and the extent of DNA damage induced by 1. 5 -Gy g-ray were investigated using the cytokinesis-block micro-nucleus cytome assay after 9 days of culture in 96 -microwell plates. High Se concentrations (‡ 1880 mg Se/ litre) caused strong inhibition of cell division and increased cell death (P < 0. 0001). Baseline frequency of nucleoplas-mic bridges and nuclear buds, however, declined signifi-cantly (P trend < 0. 05) as Se concentration increased from 3 to 430 mg Se/litre. Se concentration (£ 430 mg Se/litre) had no significant effect on baseline frequency of micro-nuclei and had no protective effect against genome damage induced by exposure to 1. 5 -Gy g-ray irradiation. In conclusion, Se, as Se-met, may improve genome stability at concentrations up to 430 mg Se/litre, but higher doses may be cytotoxic. Therefore, a cautious approach to supplementation with Se-met is required to ensure that optimal genome health is achieved without cytotoxic effects...|$|E

The remarkable degree of conservation of the actin protein is reflected in concomitant conservation of the protein-coding nucleotide sequences of the messenger RNA, which has allowed the use of a cDNA probe to isolate actin sequences from a human phage library...|$|E
50|$|Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid {{derived from}} a plant type III PKS, and is {{synthesized}} in the glandular trichromes of hop cones. L-Phenylalanine serves as the starting material, which is converted to cinnamic acid by the PLP-dependent phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Cinnamic acid is oxidized by cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and loaded onto Coenzyme A (CoA) by 4-coumarate CoA ligase to yield 4-hydroxy-cinnamoyl CoA, the starter unit for PKS extension. This molecule is extended three times with malonyl CoA, cyclized through a Claisen condensation, and aromatized through tautomerization to form naringenin chalcone (chalconaringenin). This intermediate {{has the potential to}} form a variety of different products depending on the enzymes that modify the core structure. In the case of xanthohumol, a prenyltransferase called Humulus lupulus prenyltransferase 1 (HlPT-1) attaches a molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate from the DXP pathway. HlPT-1 has a broad substrate specificity and also participates in making other prenylated flavonoids in the hop plant. Finally, an O-methyltransferase methylates a phenol substituent using S-adenosyl <b>methionine.</b> <b>Total</b> syntheses of xanthohumol and derivatives have been achieved, though extraction from hops remains a primary source.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} a {{decrease}} in the dietary crude protein level from 16 % to 14 %, maintaining the supply of the most limiting amino acids above the recommended levels, and the addition of proteases to the feed during the growing period was investigated. Two diets were formulated to contain 16 % or 14 % CP and maintaining the same level of <b>total</b> lysine, <b>methionine</b> and threonine (0. 77, 0. 50 and 0. 58 %, respectively) by adding synthetic amino acids (14 % CP + AA’s). To study the effect of protease supplementation, 1 g/kg of commercially available PESCAZYME 5602 ® was added to the diet containing 16 % CP. The three experimental diets were offered ad libitum from weaning (35 d of age) to slaughter (63 d) in two growth trials. One hundred and eighty (60 per diet) rabbits were individually housed and 480 rabbits were collectively housed in 120 polyvalent cages (40 cages per treatment) in the growth trials. Forty rabbits (20 per treatment), were assigned to two experimental diets 16 % CP and 14 % CP + AA’s and used to determine total anaerobic bacteria in the ileum and Clostridium perfringens in the caecum. There was no mortality either in the individual or collective trial and Clostridium perfringens was not detected. However, a reduction of total anaerobic bacteria was detected at ileum (15. 9 x 108 ± 3 vs. 7. 7 x 108 ± 0. 3 CFU/g on average for diets 16 % CP and 14 % CP+AA’s, respectively). There was no effect neither for the addition of proteases no for the dietary CP level on growth performances either in the 35 to 49 d period or in the 49 to 63 d period. There was no interaction between type of diet and type of housing...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study is to examine the association between plasma <b>total</b> homocysteine, <b>methionine,</b> folate, cobalamin, pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate, riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide and pancreatic cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). We conducted a nested case-control study in the EPIC cohort, which has an average of 9. 6 years of follow-up (1992 - 2006), using 463 incident pancreatic cancer cases. Controls were matched to each case by center, sex, age (+/- 1 year), date (+/- 1 year) and time (+/- 3 h) at blood collection and fasting status. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for education, smoking status, plasma cotinine concentration, alcohol drinking, body mass index and diabetes status. We observed a U-shaped association between plasma folate and pancreatic cancer risk. The ORs for plasma folate 20 nmol/L were 1. 58 (95 % CI = 0. 72 - 3. 46), 1. 39 (0. 93 - 2. 08), 1. 0 (reference), 0. 79 (0. 52 - 1. 21), and 1. 34 (0. 89 - 2. 02), respectively. Methionine was associated with an increased risk in men (per quintile increment: OR = 1. 17, 95 % CI = 1. 00 - 1. 38) but not in women (OR = 0. 91, 95 % CI = 0. 78 - 1. 07; p for heterogeneity < 0. 01). Our results suggest a U-shaped association between plasma folate and pancreatic cancer risk in both men and women. The positive association that we observed between methionine and pancreatic cancer may be sex dependent and may differ by time of follow-up. However, the mechanisms behind the observed associations warrant further investigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

A supranutritional intake of {{selenium}} (Se) may be required for cancer prevention, but an excessively high dose could be toxic. Therefore, the effect on genome stability of seleno-L-methionine (Se-met), the most important dietary form of Se, was measured to determine its bioefficacy and safety limit. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from six volunteers and cultured with medium supplemented with Se-met in a series of Se concentrations (3, 31, 125, 430, 1880 and 3850 µg Se/litre) while keeping the <b>total</b> <b>methionine</b> (i. e. Se-met + L-methionine) concentration constant at 50 µM. Baseline genome stability of lymphocytes and the extent of DNA damage induced by 1. 5 -Gy -ray were investigated using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay after 9 days of culture in 96 -microwell plates. High Se concentrations (1880 µg Se/litre) caused strong inhibition of cell division and increased cell death (P < 0. 0001). Baseline frequency of nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds, however, declined significantly (P trend < 0. 05) as Se concentration increased from 3 to 430 µg Se/litre. Se concentration (430 µg Se/litre) had no significant effect on baseline frequency of micronuclei and had no protective effect against genome damage induced by exposure to 1. 5 -Gy -ray irradiation. In conclusion, Se, as Se-met, may improve genome stability at concentrations up to 430 µg Se/litre, but higher doses may be cytotoxic. Therefore, a cautious approach to supplementation with Se-met is required to ensure that optimal genome health is achieved without cytotoxic effects. Jing Wu, Graham H. Lyons, Robin D.

40|$|The {{production}} of selenomethionine (SeMet) derivatives of recombinant proteins allows phase determination by single-wavelength or multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing in X-ray crystallography, and this popular approach has permitted the crystal structures of numerous proteins to be determined. Although yeast {{is an ideal}} host for the {{production of}} large amounts of eukaryotic proteins that require posttranslational modification, the toxic effects of SeMet often interfere with the preparation of protein derivatives containing this compound. We previously isolated a mutant strain (SMR- 94) of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris that is resistant to both SeMet and selenate and demonstrated its applicability {{for the production of}} proteins suitable for X-ray crystallographic analysis. However, the molecular basis for resistance to SeMet by the SMR- 94 strain remains unclear. Here, we report the characterization of SeMet-resistant mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the identification of a mutant allele of the MUP 1 gene encoding high-affinity methionine permease, which confers SeMet resistance. Although the <b>total</b> <b>methionine</b> uptake by the mup 1 mutant (the SRY 5 - 7 strain) decreased to 47 % of the wild-type level, it was able to incorporate SeMet into the overexpressed epidermal growth factor peptide with 73 % occupancy, indicating the importance of the moderate uptake of SeMet by amino acid permeases other than Mup 1 p for the alleviation of SeMet toxicity. In addition, under standard culture conditions, the mup 1 mutant showed higher productivity of the SeMet derivative relative to other SeMet-resistant mutants. Based on these results, we conclude that the mup 1 mutant would be useful for the preparation of selenomethionyl proteins for X-ray crystallography...|$|E

For these reasons, {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate the effects of feeding method in lactating sows. Methods A total of 30 mixed-parity (average 4. 13) lactating sows (Yorkshire[*]×[*]Landrace) with an initial BW of 218. 8 [*]±[*] 19. 5 kg was used in a 3 week trial. Sows were allotted to 1 of 2 treatments in a completely randomized design by their body weight, backfat thickness, parity and alive litter weight. One of treatments was dry feeding and the other was liquid feeding (water to feed ratio, 1 : 1). Experimental diets contained 3265 kcal ME/kg, 12. 6 % CP, 5. 76 % EE, 1. 09 % total lysine, 0. 25 % <b>total</b> <b>methionine,</b> as fed basis. Results Dry feeding treatment had high body weight loss rather than liquid feeding treatment (P[*]=[*] 0. 04). Dry feeding treatment had tendency to increase litter weight at 21 d of lactation (P[*]=[*] 0. 06) and litter weight gain (P[*]=[*] 0. 04) during lactation period (0 – 3 week). Sows fed dry feeding method made milk containing high content of casein and total solid rather than sows fed liquid feeding method (P[*]=[*] 0. 04). In addition, dry feeding treatment had tendency to higher content of milk fat, protein and solid not fat on 21 d of lactation (P[*]=[*] 0. 07). Sows fed dry feeding type also showed higher milk energy content in milk of 21 d lactation (P[*]=[*] 0. 05). Furthermore, liquid feeding treatment showed high occurrence in feed waste during lactation period (P[*]<[*] 0. 01).

For the growth experiments, four models, specifically re-parameterized for analysing energy balance data, were evaluated for their ability to determine crude protein (CP) intake at maintenance and efficiency of utilization of CP intake for producing gain. They were: a straight line, two equations representing diminishing returns behaviour (monomolecular and rectangular hyperbola) and one equation describing smooth sigmoidal behaviour with a fixed point of inflexion (Gompertz).

40|$|Activation of {{amino acid}} {{homocysteine}} was {{compared with that}} of methionine in rabbit crude liver extracts and purified multi-enzyme complex of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Activation was studied by measuring the incorporation of radioactive amino acid into unlabelled trichloroacetic-acid insoluble materials in the absence of protein synthesis. Homocysteine synthetase activity was found in the crude extract and in the purified multi-enzyme complex of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. On a molar basis, the activation of methionine by the crude extract was five times higher than the activation of homocysteine. There was a partial loss of Hcy-tRNA synthetase activity in the purified multi-enzyme complex. Preliminary reconstitution experiments indicated a requirement for an additional factor for Hcy-tRNA synthetase activity.

The following lines of evidence suggest {{that at least one of}} these mutants is capable of initiating protein synthesis without formylation of methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (methionyl-tRNAfMet). (i) tRNA isolated (and charged in vivo with [35 S]methionine) from this mutant grown in a p-aminobenzoate-free medium contained less than 0. 4 % of the <b>total</b> <b>methionine</b> charged to the tRNA as formylmethionine. However, when the mutant was grown in the presence of p-aminobenzoate, 40 to 50 % of the total [35 S]methionine was detected as formylmethionine. (ii) Extracts of the mutant grown {{in the absence of}} p-aminobenzoate contained no formyl-tetrahydrofolate, but such extracts did contain formylatable methionyl-tRNA and a functional transformylase. (iii) Tetrahydrofolate-free extracts of the mutant were capable of supporting protein synthesis with viral RNA (from f 2) as messenger, but the resulting synthesized proteins contained no formylmethionine, and methionine residues were detected where formylmethionine residues are normally found. In the presence of formyl-tetrahydrofolate, use of a similar extract resulted in the detection of 30 to 40 % of the total polypeptide methionine as formylmethionine. (iv) Initiation of protein synthesis in vitro occurred more readily with formyl-tetrahydrofolate-free extracts of the mutant than with similar extracts prepared from the parent strain. However, in the presence of formyl-tetrahydrofolate, initiation of protein synthesis proceeded equally well with both kinds of extracts. tRNA from this mutant and another spontaneously derived mutant was found to be partially deficient in the modified nucleoside ribothymidine (rT). Analysis of extracts showed that the mutants contained decreased levels of the methylase that results in the formation of ribothymidine. In vivo studies with an independently isolated rT− strain suggest that the lack of rT in tRNA facilitates the growth of E. coli under conditions where protein synthesis is forced to take place without formylation...|$|E

The abundance and integrated biomass of three prokaryote groups (Prochlorococcus spp., Synechococcus spp. and heterotrophic bacteria) {{were used to}} detect standing stock changes and characterise community structure in the Northern and Southern oligotrophic gyres and in the equatorial region. There was no statistically significant inter-annual variability in Prochlorococcus or Synechococcus abundance or integrated biomass {{in any of the}} provinces. The abundance and biomass of the remaining prokaryoplankton was variable but this variation could not be ascribed to seasonal differences and did not follow a clear inter-annual trend. The importance of the microbial loop in recycling organic nutrients in the upper Atlantic Ocean was also studied by comparing ratios of bacterial to primary production in different oceanic provinces. A proportionately higher rate of photosynthetically fixed carbon flowed through the microbial loop in the Northern oligotrophic gyre (22 – 55 %) compared to the other provinces studied. This indicates a difference in energy flow through the ecosystem in different oceanic regions with a greater emphasis on energy flow through the microbial loop in the Northern oligotrophic gyre probably due to reduced grazing of phytoplankton and reduced export production compared to other Atlantic Ocean provinces. The role of defined groups of bacteria in the cycling of nutrients was identified using a combination of flow cytometric sorting with radiotracer uptake and CARD-FISH. The SAR 11 clade of bacteria were found to dominate the low nucleic acid group of bacterioplankton and as such it was possible to quantify the activity and abundance of these cells in the Atlantic Ocean.

Concentrations of pyridoxal and pyridoxine ranged from. 005 mM to 1. 0 mM, and concentrations of methionine ranged from. 05 mM to 1. 0 mM.

The ammonium ion affects accumulation in two ways: First it increases production of a particular metabolite within the worm which is composed partly of methionine and certain other amino acids. Production of this metabolite in turn decreases the amounts of constituent amino acids in the worm' s amino acid pool, thereby allowing for an increased apparent accumulation of those amino acids. The second way the ammonium ion affect accumulation is by inhibiting efflux of some of the neutral amino acids, particularly methionine and alanine. It can exert is inhibitory effect when present only in the efflux medium or only in the worm and not in the efflux medium, or when present both within and without the worm.

Approximately 25 mCi (1 Ci = 37 GBq) of L-[methyl- 11 C]methionine was injected intravenously, and serial images and arterial blood samples were acquired over 90 min. Data analysis was performed by fitting tissue- and metabolite-corrected arterial blood time-activity curves to a three-compartment model and assuming insignificant transamination and transmethylation in this tissue. PSR was calculated from fitted parameter values and plasma methionine concentrations. PSRs measured by PET were compared with arterio-venous (A-V) difference measurements across the hind limb during primed constant infusion (5 - 6 h) of L-[1 - 13 C, methyl- 2 H 3]methionine. Results of PET measurements demonstrated similar PSRs for paraspinal and hind limb muscles: 0. 172 +/- 0. 062 vs. 0. 208 +/- 0. 048 nmol- 1. min- 1. (g of muscle) - 1 (P = not significant). PSR determined by the stable isotope technique was 0. 27 +/- 0. 050 nmol- 1. min- 1.
