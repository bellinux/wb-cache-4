5|$|Outside urban areas, the redback is {{more often}} found in drier {{habitats}} ranging from sclerophyll forest to desert, even as harsh as the Simpson Desert. It became much more common in urban areas {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century, and is now found in all but the most inhospitable environments in Australia and its cities. It is particularly common in Brisbane, Perth and Alice Springs. The redback spider is commonly found in close proximity to human residences. Webs are usually built in dry, dark, sheltered sites, such as among rocks, in logs, tree hollows, shrubs, old tyres, sheds, outhouses, empty tins and boxes, children's toys or under rubbish or litter. Letterboxes and the undersurface of <b>toilet</b> <b>seats</b> are common sites. Populations can be controlled by clearing these habitats, squashing the spiders and their egg sacs, and using pesticide in outhouses. The CSIRO Division of Entomology recommends against the use of spider pesticides due to their toxicity, and because redbacks are rapid recolonists anyway.|$|E

25|$|A study {{completed}} in April 2011 analyzed {{the effectiveness of}} copper-alloy furnishings to lessen the microbial load on various frequently touched surfaces such as door handles, <b>toilet</b> <b>seats,</b> and railings. Of the 14 surfaces tested 8 had statistically significant decreases {{in the number of}} microbes found on them while the other 6 had a {{decrease in the number of}} microbes as well, but not in a statistically significant amount. Additionally certain microbes in particular were found in far less quantities on the copper-alloy surfaces than on the normal ones, these being Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Coliform bacteria. The study concluded that copper surfaces may be an effective adjunct to safe hygiene practices in a hospital setting.|$|E

500|$|Snake Rattle 'n' Roll first {{received}} preview {{coverage in}} January1990 in Nintendo Power magazine. The preview {{said that the}} game [...] "defies description" [...] {{and that it would}} appeal to people who have enjoyed games such as Q*bert and Adventures of Lolo. The game would be featured in the magazine's September–October 1990 issue, which featured a walkthrough of the game's first three levels. It was also featured in UK-based magazine Mean Machines, where it received high praise from editors Matt Regan and Julian Rignall. Regan praised the game's 3D environment, fun gameplay, and level of humor, as noted by the odd objects such as <b>toilet</b> <b>seats.</b> Rignall called the game's graphics [...] "stunning, with beautifully drawn scrolling forced perspective 3D backdrops and some great sprites"; he also lauded the game's playability and simple controls, challenging difficulty, and overall fun factor. Overall, they said Snake Rattle 'n' Roll was [...] "one of the most original games seen in years" [...] and was [...] "a firm favourite here in the MEAN MACHINES offices".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an economic}} {{analysis of the}} <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> etiquette, that is, whether the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> should be left up or down. I investigate whether there is any efficiency justification for the presumption that men should leave the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> down after use. I find that the “down rule ” is inefficient {{unless there is a}} large degree of asymmetry in the inconvenience costs of shifting the position of the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> across genders. I show that the “selfish ” or the “status quo ” rule that leaves the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> in the position used dominates the down rule {{in a wide range of}} parameter spaces including the case where the inconvenience costs are the same. The analysis can be applied to other shared facilities that can be customized to each user’s preference. JEL Classification: D 7, H 4...|$|R

2500|$|They {{were charged}} with making an {{extremely}} difficult trek inland over the Kapa Kapa Trail toward Jaure, where they were to flank the Japanese on the Kokoda Trail. The total distance over {{the mountains to the}} Japanese positions was over , and most of the trail was barely a goat path. The men carried only six days rations, expecting to be resupplied en route. The food however was very poor, including hardtack, rice and bully beef, some of which had become rancid and sickening many men. They had leather <b>toilet</b> <b>seats</b> but no machetes, insect repellent, waterproof containers for medicine or personal effects, and it rained heavily every day. When they received quinine pills, water chlorination tablets, vitamin pills, or salt tablets, usually a few days supply, they began to disintegrate almost as soon as the men put them in their pockets or packs.|$|E

5000|$|The first [...] "paperless" [...] <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> {{was invented}} in Japan in 1980. A spray <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> {{commonly}} known by Toto's trademark Washlet, is typically a combination of seat warmer, bidet and drier, controlled by an electronic panel or remote control next to the <b>toilet</b> <b>seat.</b> A nozzle placed at rear of the toilet bowl aims a water jet to the anus and serves the purpose of cleaning. Many models have a separate [...] "bidet" [...] function aimed towards the front for feminine cleansing. The spray <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> is common only in Western-style toilets, and is not incorporated in traditional style squat toilets. Some modern Japanese bidet toilets, especially in hotels and public areas, are labeled with pictograms to avoid language problems, and most newer models have a sensor that will refuse to activate the bidet unless someone {{is sitting on the}} toilet.|$|R
