5|$|Don't take it {{personally}} is a visual novel, or interactive fiction game {{where the majority of}} the story is told through still images of the speaking characters in front of anime-style backgrounds with text overlaid. The player's viewpoint follows one character, <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> a school, with the player seeing his thoughts as well as his and the other characters' statements. The player advances the conversations the teacher is in or witnesses at will, but cannot go backwards and has little control over what any of the characters, including the teacher, are saying except at a few key moments. At these points, the player is presented with two or three choices for what the teacher says; which option is chosen can change what path the plot takes, in either a minor or major way.|$|E

While there is no unique answer to a kōan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate {{their understanding of the}} kōan and of Zen through their responses. The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a Zen teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation.|$|E

25|$|Several factors {{should be}} {{considered}} in the development of intervention strategies. These include, but are not limited to: developmental level of the child, comorbid disabilities, environmental changes, motivating factors, and coaching strategies. It is also recommended that strategies should take a proactive approach in managing behaviour or skill deficits (when possible), rather than adopt a reactive approach. For example, an awareness of where a student may have difficulty throughout {{the course of the day}} can aid <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> planning to avoid these situations or in planning to accommodate the needs of the student.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Conklin and Wilkins shows growth and {{advances}} in reading levels among elementary students when using a guided reading approach. Working with <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> small groups gave students {{a chance to}} work on specific skills, at their reading level. Students gained confidence when reading 'just right' texts. Since they were not struggling with the text they were able to develop vocabulary, reading comprehension skills and oral language skills. Gabl, Kaiser, Long and Roemer found similar results when providing reading intervention in the form of guided reading groups to grade two and grade four students. The results showed an increase in reading fluency and comprehension after using flexible grouping in guided reading.|$|E
25|$|Souter also rebuked the {{majority}} for accepting the incorrect view that any statement {{made by a}} public employee constitutes, or should be treated as, the government’s own speech, because such a view is valid only when a public employee is hired to promote a particular policy by communicating a particular message. He further disagreed with {{the majority}}’s argument for limiting the Pickering doctrine, which held that the First Amendment protections were unnecessary {{in light of the}} existence of a comprehensive set of state and federal statutes that protected government whistle-blowers. Souter noted that speech that addressed official wrongdoing may well be unprotected under existing statutory protections (e.g., <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> Givhan would not qualify as a whistle-blower).|$|E

25|$|Around {{the year}} 1337, Hesychasm {{attracted}} the attention of a learned member of the Orthodox Church, Barlaam, a Calabrian monk who at that time held the office of abbot in the Monastery of St Saviour's in Constantinople and who visited Mount Athos. There, he encountered Hesychasts and heard descriptions of their practices, also reading the writings of <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> Hesychasm of St Gregory Palamas, himself an Athonite monk. Trained in Scholastic theology, Barlaam was scandalized by Hesychasm and began to campaign against it. As a teacher of theology in the Scholastic mode, Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the Hesychasts taught. In particular, he took exception to the Hesychasts doctrine {{to the nature of the}} uncreated light, the experience of which was said to be the goal of Hesychast practice. Barlaam held this concept to be polytheistic, inasmuch as it postulated two eternal substances, a visible (immanent) and an invisible God (transcendent).|$|E

50|$|To {{find out}} if the mean {{salaries}} of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North and South are statistically different from that of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West (the comparison category), we have to {{find out if}} the slope coefficients of the regression result are statistically significant. For this, we need to consider the p values. The estimated slope coefficient for the North is not statistically significant as its p value is 23 percent; however, that of the South is statistically significant at the 5% level as its p value is only around 3.5 percent. Thus the overall result is that the mean salaries of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West and North are not statistically different from each other, but the mean salary of <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South is statistically lower than that in the West by around $3265.

500|$|Owing to the {{suppression}} by Serbia of Apis's confession {{and of the}} Salonika trial transcripts historians did not initially link Malobabić closely to the Sarajevo attack. [...] Apis's confession, however, states that [...] "I engaged Malobabić to organize the assassination {{on the occasion of}} the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo." [...] At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulović (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified: [...] 'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [...] noting that agents of Malobabić would come and a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ilić was a teacher but it is unclear if <b>the</b> <b>teacher</b> <b>in</b> question was Ilić as Ilić can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent [...] them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and that teacher into Bosnia.' [...] Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand." [...] On the eve of his execution, Malobabić told a priest: [...] "They ordered me to go to Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, and then there was the outbreak of the war." [...] Vladimir Dedijer in The Road to Sarajevo presented additional testimonial evidence that Malobabić arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go ahead for the operation to Danilo Ilić. This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro Ŝarac had given instructions to Ilić on 16 June cancelling the assassination. [...] Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabić, Vulović, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.|$|E
