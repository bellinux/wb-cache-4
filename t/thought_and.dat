50|$|Mindfulness {{is defined}} as a mental state {{achieved}} by focusing one’s awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one’s feelings, <b>thoughts,</b> <b>and</b> bodily sensations. It is helpful to cultivate awareness and acceptance of distressful <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings in the present, a state that is necessary to be able to consciously affect change in one's condition. MDT utilizes this perspective to normalize the client's <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings, while developing healthier functional alternative beliefs. Remember that problem <b>thoughts,</b> feelings, <b>and</b> behaviors are the products of dysfunctional core beliefs that are often cultivated by distressful events.|$|R

The subconscious, {{as it is known}} in psychoanalysis, as well as viewpoints emphasizing unconscious motivations, drives, and instincts are considered to be self-defeating.

Will gives adults the ability to accept or reject <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> impulses. Recovery members achieve mental health by training their Wills to reject self-defeating <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> impulses, countering them with self-endorsing <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> wellness-promoting actions.|$|R

5|$|After Lenin's death, Stalin's {{administration}} {{established an}} ideology known as Marxism-Leninism, {{a movement that}} came to be interpreted differently by various contending factions in the Communist movement. After being forced into exile by Stalin's administration, Trotsky argued that Stalinism was a debasement of Leninism, which was dominated by bureaucratism and Stalin's own personal dictatorship. Marxism-Leninism was adapted to many of the 20th century's most prominent revolutionary movements, forming into variants such as Stalinism, Maoism, Juche, Ho Chi Minh <b>Thought,</b> <b>and</b> Castroism. Conversely, many later Western communists such as Manuel Azcárate and Jean Ellenstein {{who were involved in the}} Eurocommunist movement expressed the view that Lenin and his ideas were irrelevant to their own objectives, thereby embracing a Marxist but not Marxist-Leninist perspective.|$|E

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific underpinnings of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E
