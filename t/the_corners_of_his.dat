He rode a sleek black charger named [...] "Old Black," [...] {{and wore a}} small blue kepi-style cap, with buffed gloves over the sleeves of an immaculately tailored uniform that had a double row of gold buttons on the coat, and shiny gold spurs on his highly polished boots. He held an elegant riding crop whether mounted or walking. His moustache drooped gracefully beyond <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth and then turned upward at the ends. His hair was {{the talk of the}} Army: [...] "long ringlets flowed loosely over his shoulders, trimmed and highly perfumed, his beard likewise was curling and giving up the scent of Araby." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Eliot. Adam Bede, [...] Edinburgh and London: William Blackwood and Sons, 1859. Reprinted, e.g., {{edited by}} Carol A. Martin, page 445. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. (When Adam was reading his Bible, “Sometimes [...] [...] [...] his eyebrows would be raised, and <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth would quiver {{a little with}} sad sympathy — something, perhaps old Isaac’s meeting with his son, touched him closely [...] [...] [...] [...]”).|$|E
2500|$|In 1956, he gave an {{interview}} which was captured on tape, wherein he discussed his {{growing up in}} Montana, and learning to paint {{at the hands of}} the elders of his mother's tribe. He actively continued painting through the early 1960s. He is still considered one of the most important artists of Glacier National Park. His body of work helps to understand [...] "the significant contributions by marginalized artists who successfully negotiated the terrain of the mainstream art world." [...] Lone Wolf died in St. Mary's hospital in Tucson, Arizona, on February 9, 1970. He was cremated, and his ashes were interred near the grave of his maternal uncle Last Rider in Montana. He was buried on June 19, 1970, in an Indian ceremony which included four willow wands topped by eagle feathers placed at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grave. Paul Dyke, his adopted son, lowered the urn into the earth, and Lone Wolf's widow, Naomi, cast the first spade of earth into the grave. Afterwards, Naomi gave the eagle feathers to friends as remembrances. At some point during the next year, Naomi, despondent over Lone Wolf's death, committed suicide, using Lone Wolf's old revolver. Two years after his death, his story was highlighted, along with pictures of his paintings and sculptures, in the first issue of the 1972 edition of Montana The Magazine of Western History. The article was written by Paul Dyke.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, he {{presented}} a new show, Beajet 'm eus (" [...] I travelled [...] "). On April 7, 2015, Denez published a new studio album, [...] "An enchanting garden - Ul liorzh vurzhudus". This album, comprising 12 original songs {{written by the}} singer, including one in English, {{is the result of}} several years of writing (a hundred gwerzioù of 80 verses), trips and experiments on stage. The Breton and Celtic themes, unstructured, are interwoven with Slavonic and Armenian ("An tri seblant"), Greek ("Krediñ 'raen"), Andalusian ("Ar binioù skornet"), Bossa nova ("An tri amourouz"), Gypsy or Yiddish ("Beajet'm eus"), African ("An trucher hag an Ankoù") for an entirely acoustic music. In songs in Breton, the artist invites to discover <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> inner garden and the plurality of his influences. [...] Denez's vocal, [...] "enigmatic and inspiring" [...] (accompanied by the hang on [...] "Before dawn"), is like a link between the real and the invisible, supported by the writing of timeless stories, sometimes tragic, satirical or burlesque, such as [...] "Peñse Nedeleg", a Fisel dance describing the shipwreck of a freighter that makes the happiness of the inhabitants for Christmas or [...] "An tri amourouz" [...] whose black humor recalls that of Tim Burton. [...] "An Old Story", in English, couples with [...] "Gwechall gozh", in breton, two complaints sharing the same story: an innocent woman burnt like witch for having too many companions.|$|E
