5|$|On 23 December 2013, Captain Richard Holloway {{was serving}} with the SBS {{when he was}} killed by Taliban small arms fire while {{conducting}} an operation to suppress the <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> a joint SBS-Afghan forces raid (with air support) on Taliban insurgents in a valley east of Kabul ahead of the Afghanistan elections.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September 2010, British {{aid worker}} Linda Norgrove and three Afghan colleagues were kidnapped {{by members of}} the <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> the Kunar Province of eastern Afghanistan. She was working in the country as {{regional}} director for Development Alternatives Incorporated, a contractor for US and other government agencies. The group were taken to the nearby Dewegal Valley area. United States and Afghan forces began a search of the area, placing roadblocks to prevent the group from being moved east into Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The Taliban, however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas seized from the <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> southern Afghanistan.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is aimed (1) {{to identify the}} harms that gender inequality put on female children <b>in</b> <b>Taliban</b> society <b>in</b> Deborah Ellis’ The Breadwinner, (2) to explain the struggles of the main character of female child, Parvana, against gender inequality <b>in</b> <b>Taliban</b> society <b>in</b> the novel, and (3) {{to find out the}} significant meanings of Parvana’s struggles <b>in</b> <b>Taliban</b> society <b>in</b> the novel. Therefore, this research applied the theories of feminism and children’s empowerment in relation to children’s literature. To analyze the data, this research used qualitative descriptive content analysis. The data of the research were the words, phrases, clauses and sentences related to (1) the harms that gender inequality put on female children <b>in</b> <b>Taliban</b> society, (2) the struggles of the main character of female child, Parvana, against gender inequality <b>in</b> <b>Taliban</b> society, and (3) the significant meanings of Parvana’s struggles <b>in</b> <b>Taliban</b> society which are embedded in Deborah Ellis’ The Breadwinner. The primary instrument in this research was the researcher herself while the secondary instruments were any media and devices which contributed to the data collection and the data analysis. To ensure the data trustworthiness, triangulation was applied in this research. The results of this research show that there are three harms that gender inequality does to female children <b>in</b> <b>Taliban</b> society: fear and lack of confidence, desperation and unwillingness to struggle, and dependency. Parvana as the main female child character in the story does some struggles against gender inequality <b>in</b> <b>Taliban</b> society, namely disguising as a boy to become a breadwinner and fulfill other needs of the family, optimizing her attempts to save her family, encouraging her family, and helping other women to survive. The study also reveals that there are three significant meanings of Parvana’s struggles <b>in</b> <b>Taliban</b> society: boosting her self-esteem, improving a sense of pride on herself, and arousing a feeling of satisfaction of her efforts...|$|R
5|$|It was {{the first}} battle in the War in Afghanistan in which Afghan army units were the {{principal}} fighting force. Statements from the British Ministry of Defence (MOD) emphasised that the operation was Afghan-led, although the ability of Afghan units to function without NATO control was questioned during the battle. Military engagement over Musa Qala {{is part of a}} wider conflict between coalition forces and the <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> Helmand. Both before and after the battle, related fighting was reported across a larger area, particularly in Sangin district to the south of Musa Qala.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair. The <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced haircuts, although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E
5|$|The CIA's base at Camp Chapman {{was set up}} at the {{beginning}} of the U.S.-led offensive against al-Qaeda and the Afghan <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> 2001. It began as an improvised center for operations. A military base at {{the beginning}}, it was later transformed into a CIA base. Camp Chapman was also used as a base for the Khost Provincial Reconstruction Team, a military-led development group. In recent years, the base evolved into a major counter-terrorism hub of the CIA's paramilitary Special Activities Division, used for joint operation with U.S. special operations forces and Afghan allies. It also had a housing compound for U.S. intelligence officers.|$|E

5|$|In November 2001, {{as part of}} Operation Enduring Freedom {{with the}} United States, the United Kingdom invaded Afghanistan to topple the <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> Operation Herrick. The 3rd Division were {{deployed}} in Kabul {{to assist in the}} liberation of the capital and defeat Taliban forces in the mountains. In 2006 the British Army began concentrating on fighting Taliban forces and bringing security to Helmand Province, with around 9,500 British troops (including marines, airmen and sailors) deployed at its peak—the second-largest force after that of the US. In December 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the combat mission would end in 2014, and troop numbers gradually fell as the Afghan National Army took over the brunt of the fighting. Between 2001 and 26 April 2014 a total of 453 British military personnel died in Afghan operations. Operation Herrick ended with the handover of Camp Bastion on 26 October 2014, but the British Army maintains a deployment in Afghanistan as part of Operation Toral.|$|E
5|$|In October 2001, the Australian {{government}} {{announced that it}} was sending a special forces task group built around an SASR squadron to participate in the campaign against al-Qaeda and the <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan designated Operation Slipper. After staging through Kuwait, 1 Squadron arrived in Afghanistan in December 2001 with the other SASR squadrons rotating in at approximately six-monthly intervals. The SASR's main role in Afghanistan was to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance of al-Qaeda and Taliban positions, activities and capabilities. SASR force elements also conducted some offensive operations. After arriving at FOB Rhino, the SASR initially operated in southern Afghanistan with US Marines from Task Force 58, conducting long-range vehicle mounted patrols over several hundred kilometres around Kandahar and into the Helmand Valley near the Iranian-border. On 16 February 2002 Sergeant Andrew Russell was killed when the Long Range Patrol Vehicle (LRPV) he was travelling in hit a land mine during an operation in the Helmand Valley. Two other soldiers were wounded in the incident. Later the SASR operated under command of Task Force 64.|$|E
5|$|In late 2004, 3rd Battalion was {{notified}} {{it would be}} participating in Operation Enduring Freedom. On 31 October, the first Marines left Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii for an eight-month deployment to eastern Afghanistan. While serving in Afghanistan, 3rd Battalion conducted Operation Spurs in February 2005, where they were inserted into the Korangal valley and conducted both counterinsurgency and humanitarian operations. In March, 3rd Battalion launched a similar sweep called Operation Mavericks. During their time in Afghanistan, the Marines from 3rd Battalion engaged the <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> 22 firefights. In one of them the battalion suffered its only fatalities for the deployment when LCPL Nicholas Kirven and Corporal Richard Schoener were killed during a three-hour firefight in Alishang which also resulted in twenty-three Taliban killed. During the fighting, Lieutenant Stephen Boada was awarded the Silver Star for calmly directing bombing runs on Taliban positions, despite having been wounded several times. In May the battalion launched one final operation, Operation Celtics, in the Tora Bora region. The operation was {{for the most part}} uneventful, although NBC news journalist Ron Allen was almost killed while traveling with Kilo Company when his Humvee ran over an IED.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Arghandab (code-named Operation IBRAT by the insurgents) {{began on}} June 18, 2008, when NATO-led forces {{attacked}} <b>Taliban</b> militants <b>in</b> response to <b>Taliban</b> attacks <b>in</b> Arghandab District and Kandahar. The battle in Arghandab marked {{the second time}} {{in less than a year}} that the Taliban has tried to take control of the area.|$|R

5|$|Raphel was {{instrumental}} in coordinating the State Department's establishment of diplomatic relations with the Taliban shortly after its takeover of Kabul. A senior Unocal executive commented that the pipeline project would be far easier to implement with the <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> control, {{in reference to the}} need for central control in Afghanistan to undertake a project of the size, complexity and cost the Texas-based oil giant was considering. Unocal's consortium also included Saudi Arabia's Delta Oil, Pakistan's Crescent Group and Gazprom of Russia. The project involved building an 890-kilometer gas pipeline that would carry 1.9 billion cubic feet of gas to Pakistan each day. Unocal held detailed discussions with Taliban representatives in Houston in December 1997, striking a deal that would later collapse under the weight of rising U.S. and Afghan domestic political pressures against the Taliban's record on human rights, education and treatment of women.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 2007, an SBS team {{killed the}} Taliban leader Mullah Dadullah after JSOC and the ISA tracked {{him to a}} {{compound}} - where his associates were meeting - near Bahram Chah, Helmand province. The ISA confirmed he was there and an SBS reconnaissance element carried out reconnaissance of the compound which showed that Dadullah was protected 20 insurgents. That night, with the ISA monitoring the target, the majority of C Squadron were inserted by RAF CH-47D Chinooks whilst covered by Apache helicopters, the troops stormed the compound and a one hour long firefight took place as small groups of Taliban were hunted down and killed. 4 SBS personnel were wounded (one seriously), eventually Dadullah {{was shot in the}} chest and head, quick SSE was conducted and before the assault force was picked up by helicopter. On 24 September 2007, members of C squadron SBS and the Italian SOF unit Col Moschin rescued two Italian intelligence agents who were kidnapped by the <b>Taliban</b> <b>in</b> Herat province near Farah, they had been kidnapped 2 days before. Col Moschin parachuted onto a drop zone and marched overnight to surround the target compound, whilst the SBS were standing by in Lynx and Chinook helicopters to provide cut off groups in-case the insurgents attempted to escape, whilst a US Predator drone supported the British and Italians. The insurgents brought the hostages out of the compound and loaded them into vehicles before the Italians were in position to rescue them, the SBS closed in on the vehicles: aerial snipers using M82A1 antimaterial rifles forced the vehicles to stop. A Chinook dropped off more than a dozen SBS personnel who engaged the Taliban who were disembarking the vehicles, 8 Taliban insurgents were killed and the hostages were rescued, however one died of gunshot wounds.|$|E
