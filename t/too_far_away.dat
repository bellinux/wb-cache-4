LeMond attended Earl Wooster High School, but lived <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to participate in team sports.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the {{original}} ages was also a problem, as the rate of Kula-Farallon spreading over that time would produce a chain of seamounts much longer than observed, and <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from the continent to explain the continentally derived sediments. This objection is attenuated somewhat in that the newer ages show a smaller range of ages.|$|E
5|$|Currently Silverthrone is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcano's magma system is.

It may sense an increase in activity if the volcano becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only after the volcano has started erupting.|$|E

His {{movements}} were slow, fumbling, and inaccurate, accompanied by panting and head-swimming, as he dragged himself into a sitting-up position in the stern, his rifle beside him. He looked a long time at Elijah, but could not see whether he breathed or not, and he was <b>too</b> immeasurably <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to make an investigation.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} frozen meat exports boosted produce exports <b>too.</b> The <b>far</b> <b>away</b> British and European markets for both wool and meat demanded long {{distance}} shipping services. Well-known {{to the big}} shipping companies William Nelson and F W Williams eventually assisted {{in the formation of}} the Tyser shipping line later known as the Port Line. With the knowledge this gave them they were able to achieve some moderation of the charges made by the other shipping services. The tie with the Port Line was broken in 1969.|$|R

5|$|The ship {{took part}} in the {{operation}} off Lissa in 1866 during the Third Italian War of Independence. There, was tasked with neutralizing the Austrian coastal batteries protecting the port at Comisa, which placed her <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> {{to take part in the}} ensuing Battle of Lissa. The ship's postwar career was limited due to a combination of drastically reduced naval budgets and the appearance of more modern ironclads. In 1885, Terribile was withdrawn from service for use as a training ship. She remained in service until 1904 when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from the city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed {{to be made by}} ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E
60|$|He utters {{the common}} feeling {{when he says}} that it were against nature. But when a man has his choice between here and elsewhere, it may be feared that the other world will seem <b>too</b> desperately <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to be waited for when hungry ruin has him in the wind, and the chance on earth is so temptingly near. Hence the notion of a {{transfer}} of allegiance from God to Satan, sometimes by a written compact, sometimes with the ceremony by which homage is done to a feudal superior.|$|R

On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off the Shetlands on 20–21 April.|$|E
5|$|Rehman {{originally}} represented England, {{and played}} {{for them at}} under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels. Becoming the first English-born Pakistani to don an England senior football shirt seemed <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away,</b> however, {{due to lack of}} first team opportunities at Fulham. Due to his Pakistani parentage, and because he possessed dual Pakistani and British nationality, Rehman also qualified to represent Pakistan, and he eventually opted to play for them, as he considered it to be a more realistic option. A lot of British Asian groups were against this and wanted him to fight more for an England place to set a standard for English-Asian youth.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{continued}} to receive armaments from Ticonderoga, with guns arriving on September 21 {{and also on}} October 5. However, the artillery were positioned <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to do much damage to the fort. With {{the arrival of the}} new guns, Montgomery planned to move the emphasis of the bombardment from {{the east side of the}} fort to the north side, where they would be closer. However, his officers unanimously rejected this plan, fearing that many men would desert due to the increased danger. Montgomery ordered that a new battery be built where the Royal Savage could be threatened. On October 14, the battery was completed and then used to sink the British ship.|$|E
60|$|Then we parted, poor Savage {{looking very}} limp indeed, {{for this was}} his first {{experience}} of war. Ragnall, however, who came of an old fighting stock, seemed to be happy as a king. I who had known so many battles, was the reverse of happy, for inconveniently enough there flashed into my mind at this juncture the dying words of the Zulu captain and seer, Mavovo, which foretold that I <b>too</b> should fall <b>far</b> <b>away</b> in war; and I wondered whether this were the occasion that had been present to his foreseeing mind.|$|R
60|$|I {{loved my}} Chaucer too well, I hope, {{not to get}} some good from the best in him; and my reading of {{criticism}} had taught me how and {{where to look for}} the best, and to know it when I had found it. Of course I began to copy him. That is, I did not attempt anything like his tales in kind; they must have seemed <b>too</b> hopelessly <b>far</b> <b>away</b> in taste and time, but I studied his verse, and imitated a stanza which I found in some of his things and had not found elsewhere; I rejoiced in the freshness and sweetness of his diction, and though I felt that his structure was obsolete, there was in his wording something homelier and heartier than the imported analogues that had taken the place of the phrases he used.|$|R
50|$|The Oakland’s Children Hospital Farmer’s Market {{was started}} by Max Cadji, Dr. Jennifer Matthews, and Brett Brenner in June 2010. Max Cadji wanted {{to open up a}} new produce market and was able to {{collaborate}} with Dr. Jennifer Mathews to create a produce stand in the Hospital. This idea met the goals of Phat Beets by increasing healthy food accessibility to residents and of Dr. Mathews because it directly supports the patients of the Healthy Hearts Clinic, a child obesity clinic. Dr. Mathews realized {{that it was important to}} create a produce stand when she witnessed how difficult it was for her Healthy Hearts patients to buy the fruits and vegetable she prescribed because they were <b>too</b> expensive or <b>far</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
5|$|Vestgrensa {{had served}} the area now served by Forskingsparken since {{the opening of}} the Sognsvann Line on 10 October 1934. In 1991, the Norwegian Parliament decided to build a new {{facility}} for Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, and to serve the hospital by an extension of the Ullevål Hageby Line. Gaustad Station on the Holmenkoll Line of the rapid transit is located within a few hundred meters of the hospital. Vestgrensa was deemed <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> by planners, and a transfer station would need to be established between the light rail and the Sognsvann Line. At first, Blindern was considered, but instead it was later decided that there should be an all-new station.|$|E
5|$|Villa Real was now {{surrounded}} by hostile territory, and any Spanish help was <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> {{to be of}} value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians {{in search of food}} and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish. The battle lasted several days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, {{but the rest of the}} province of Chiapa remained rebellious.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel assumed {{command of}} the newly formed Anzac Mounted Division on 16 March 1916, the day after it {{relieved}} the 1st Division on the Suez Canal defences. Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches {{for his part in}} the defence of the Canal. His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, {{the northern part of the}} Canal, under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Lawrence was <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to control the battle, especially once the telephone lines were cut. Murray, in Ismailia, was even further back.|$|E
50|$|Tokyo is {{near the}} {{boundary}} of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying {{as if in a}} boat, ironically epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2000 km long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. Its not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these such minor quakes (magnitudes 4-6) that can be felt in single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety to not only to foreign visitors but Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either <b>too</b> small or <b>far</b> <b>away</b> as quakes tend to dance around the region, particularly active are offshore regions {{and to a lesser extent}} Chiba and Ibaraki.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{dragged him}} through the opening into the hold and felt keen relief {{when he saw that}} both pipes ran clear; then he guided him to the tunnel and, letting him lean on it, pushed him along. Clay was a big, heavy man, but his weight was counteracted by the air in his dress, and he could be moved with a push almost like a {{floating}} object. Sometimes he moved <b>too</b> <b>far</b> and fell <b>away</b> from the tunnel. Jimmy long afterward remembered with a shudder the time they spent in reaching the outlet. He could not use his lamp, because he needed both hands; and he was horribly afraid that the pipes and lines might get foul. He believed that he threw Clay down and dragged him out into the open water by his helmet, but he had only a hazy recollection of the matter.|$|R

5|$|Following the 1991 {{decision}} {{to build a}} new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to be a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve {{the northern part of the}} Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, Line 4 of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsparken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built.|$|E
5|$|I-174 {{departed}} from the major Japanese naval base at Truk on 16May1943 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Nobukiyo Nanbu and arrived off Sandy Cape, Queensland on 27May. She was the only Japanese boat operating off Australia at the time, as all other available submarines were deployed to counter Allied advances in the Solomon Islands. She made an unsuccessful torpedo attack on the American ship Point San Pedro on 1June, exchanged gunfire with U.S.Army transport EdwardChambers three days later, and on 5June was driven off by convoy PG53's escorts. On 7June, I-174 fired four torpedoes at the American Liberty ship John Bartram, all of which missed. She sighted another convoy on 13June, <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to attack. During this period, she was repeatedly attacked by Allied aircraft and warships, but did not sustain any damage.|$|E
5|$|I./StG 77 were {{to strike}} at Thorney Island with 28 Ju 87s; 28 II./StG 77 were {{assigned}} to Ford; and 31 III./StG 77 Ju 87s were to destroy Poling radar station. A fourth unit, Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 (StG 3 or Dive Bombing Wing 3), sent 22 Ju 87s to attack Gosport. The dive-bombers were supported by 157 Bf 109s; 70 from JG 27; 32 from JG 53 acting as close escort; and 55 from JG 2 which was to sweep the Portsmouth area {{in advance of the}} main raid independently. The Ju 87s were based around Caen, <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> for the attacks. So in the morning the Stukas were moved into closer airfields around Cherbourg, right on the Channel coast. There, fuel tanks were filled, bombs loaded, and crews given a final briefing.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} noted that princes and princesses of the Rashtrakuta family used pure Kannada names such as Kambarasa, Asagavve, Revakka and Abbalabbe as their {{personal}} names indicating that they were native Kannadigas. It has been pointed out that princesses of family lineage belonging to Gujarat signed their royal edicts in Kannada even in their Sanskrit inscriptions. Some examples of this are the Navsari and Baroda plates of Karka I and the Baroda plates of his son Dhruva II. It has been attested by a scholar that the Gujarat Rashtrakuta princes signed their inscriptions {{in the language of}} their native home and the race they belonged to. It is well known that the Gujarat line of Rashtrakutas were from the same family as the Manyakheta line. It is argued that if the Rashtrakutas were originally a Marathi speaking family, then the Gujarat Rashtrakutas would not have signed their inscriptions in Kannada language and that <b>too</b> in <b>far</b> <b>away</b> Gujarat. The theory that under the rule of the Badami Chalukyas of Kannada country, Kannada speaking dynasties were established in the far corners of the Chalukyan empire in Gujarat, Andhra and Berar (present day Vidharba region in modern Maharashtra) and hence the ancestors of King Dantidurga, the founder of the Manyakheta empire were Kannadigas. It is further claimed there is proof that in the locality where Dantidurga lived Kannada was the spoken language.|$|R

2500|$|According to Bunk Gardner, [...] "Cruising with Ruben & the Jets {{was an easy}} {{album to}} record. We were {{recording}} {{it at the same}} time as Uncle Meat because the songs were easy and very simple and didn't require a lot of time for arrangements and technical overdubbing. It was the beginning of the end for Ray Collins because all the new material Frank was writing was a little <b>too</b> <b>far</b> out and <b>away</b> from Ray's roots - which was Ruben-era material. Motorhead too was in his glory during the recording of this album. He loved Ruben and that was really his kind of music to get nostalgic over - on stage and doing the dance steps and playing that music [...] I really enjoyed playing a solo on Ray's tune 'Anything'. I remember Frank, Ray and Roy standing in the control booth while I recorded my solo. Frank was telling me after the first take to keep it simple. So I nailed it on the second take and everyone was happy!" ...|$|R
