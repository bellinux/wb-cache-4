5|$|Fustat was <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> of Egypt for {{approximately}} 500 years. After the city's founding in 641, its authority was uninterrupted until 750, when the Abbasid dynasty staged a {{revolt against the}} Umayyads. This conflict was focused not in Egypt, but elsewhere in the Arab world. When the Abbasids gained power, they moved various capitals to more controllable areas. They had established the centre of their caliphate in Baghdad, moving <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> from its previous Umayyad location at Damascus. Similar moves were made throughout the new dynasty. In Egypt, they moved <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> from Fustat slightly north to the Abbasid city of al-Askar, which remained <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> until 868. When the Tulunid dynasty took control in 868, the Egyptian capital moved briefly to another nearby northern city, Al-Qatta'i. This lasted only until 905, when Al-Qatta'i was destroyed and <b>the</b> <b>capital</b> was returned to Fustat. The city again lost its status as capital city when its own vizier, Shawar, ordered its burning in 1168. <b>The</b> <b>capital</b> of Egypt was ultimately moved to Cairo.|$|E
