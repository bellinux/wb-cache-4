5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Leslie (Amy Poehler) proudly announces to the parks and recreation staff that she will be judging the Miss Pawnee beauty pageant, a job she takes very seriously. Tom (Aziz Ansari), excited at the prospective of judging women on the basis of <b>their</b> <b>looks,</b> pulls some strings to get a spot on the judging panel along with Leslie. April (Aubrey Plaza) enters the contest in order to win the $600 prize, despite being disgusted with the concept of a beauty contest. She tries, unsuccessfully, to gain an advantage by sucking up to Leslie. Later, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.) visits Leslie at work to ask her out on a date. She initially accepts, but when Dave mistakes a photo of Madeleine Albright for Leslie's grandmother, Leslie becomes reluctant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did a spread called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into <b>their</b> <b>looks.</b> In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E
5|$|Some estates, {{especially}} in southern regions of Finland, {{were known to}} have used stallions of several light and hot-blooded breeds; for example, an officer in Pernaja bred Arabians. These crossbreeds were probably an attempt to create showy driving horses. A notable failing of a crossbreeding attempt happened in 1875, when a stud was founded in Porvoo to import and export Norfolk Trotters, a breed that has had important influence in several driving horse breeds, including the Standardbred. The crossbred offspring were praised for <b>their</b> <b>looks,</b> but {{turned out to have}} poor temperaments and no talent for speed. Due to a combination of the large population of horses in Finland (over 200000 animals) and the later enthusiasm for purebreeding, these estate-based crossbreeding attempts never had significant influence on the modern Finnish horse.|$|E

25|$|TRANSFIGURATION: The hero gains a new appearance.

25|$|The rest of {{the changes}} were very minor edits in effort to appeal to western audiences, such as minor {{graphical}} changes to make Ristar and other character's faces look more serious, renaming levels to names more descriptive of <b>their</b> <b>looks,</b> and adding a few non-interactive scenes to show more continuity in the game, such as a skiing sequence before the snow themed level, or putting on anti-gravity shoes to explain why Ristar is floating in a particular level.|$|E
25|$|He comprehended at {{last that}} I {{wanted to see}} a grisette. Then he showed me dozens of them. They were like nearly all the Frenchwomen I ever saw—homely. They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug noses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good {{breeding}} could overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting; they were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; I knew by <b>their</b> <b>looks</b> that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly and finally, to my thinking it would be base flattery to call them immoral.|$|E

25|$|They {{first began}} teaming {{together}} in June 2009 {{but did not}} become a proper team {{until the end of}} the year. The two were portrayed as narcissistic and vain bullies, constantly espousing their own perfection while ganging up on others and attacking <b>their</b> <b>looks.</b> They were a successful team, having won both women's titles available in WWE, the WWE Women's Championship, which they retired when they unified it with the WWE Divas Championship; both titles they claimed to hold as a tag team though this is not officially recognized. The group did court some controversy, however, receiving criticism from the Wrestling Observer Newsletter for what it considered the most disgusting promotional tactic regarding a storyline in which they bullied Mickie James for her supposed weight issues.|$|E
25|$|For the two lead male characters, {{who play}} step {{brothers}} in the film, several actors from the Tamil film industry were considered. Real-life siblings Surya and Karthi, as well as Jeeva and Githan Ramesh were considered for the roles, which were at last won by Arya, renewing his association with Bala after Naan Kadavul, and Vishal Krishna. Vishal later creditted Arya, who were friends even before entering the film industry, for {{becoming part of the}} project. Both actors had to change their looks; they reportedly tonsured their heads for their roles, and kept <b>their</b> <b>looks</b> secretive, avoiding public appearances. Vishal stated that he sports a squint and wore braces throughout the film. He reportedly became the first ever actor to attempt a squint look in a feature film, which was considered for an entry in The Guinness Book of World Records.|$|E
25|$|The Pandavas, who {{had ruled}} their kingdom meanwhile, decide to renounce everything. Clad in skins and rags they retire to the Himalaya and climb towards heaven in their bodily form. A stray dog travels with them. One {{by one the}} {{brothers}} and Draupadi fall on their way. As each one stumbles, Yudhishthira gives the rest the reason for their fall (Draupadi was partial to Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva were vain and proud of <b>their</b> <b>looks,</b> and Bhima and Arjuna were proud of their strength and archery skills, respectively). Only the virtuous Yudhishthira, who had tried everything to prevent the carnage, and the dog remain. The dog reveals himself to be the god Yama (also known as Yama Dharmaraja), and then takes him to the underworld where he sees his siblings and wife. After explaining {{the nature of the}} test, Yama takes Yudhishthira back to heaven and explains that it was necessary to expose him to the underworld because (Rajyante narakam dhruvam) any ruler has to visit the underworld at least once. Yama then assures him that his siblings and wife would join him in heaven after they had been exposed to the underworld for measures of time according to their vices.|$|E

500|$|Another common {{criticism}} of Wintour's editorship focuses on Vogues {{increasing use of}} celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards. She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a blue suit. At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a Vogue-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour {{is said to have}} personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and Diane von Fürstenberg. [...] "I don't think Vreeland had that kind of concentration," [...] says WWD publisher Patrick McCarthy. [...] "She wouldn't have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her." [...] By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in Vogue but more general-interest magazines like People and Us, which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. [...] "The end result is that Anna can control {{it all the way to}} the selling floor," [...] says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at style.com. She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it wasn't selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour <b>their</b> <b>looks</b> would not be photographed for Vogue. All complied.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Dexter {{is based on}} the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay. However, there are {{numerous}} differences, ranging from extra subplots to rearrangements and modifications of elements from the source material. The biggest change is the lead-up to and revelation of the identity of the [...] "Ice Truck Killer", called the [...] "Tamiami Butcher" [...] in the novel. In the novel, Dexter is led to believe that he might be the one committing the murders, due to a series of strange dreams that connect him to the murder. The final clue is a blurry photo, taken from surveillance footage, of a man who resembles Dexter at a crime scene. After the [...] "Tamiami Killer" [...] kidnaps Deborah, Dexter finds and confronts him. It is subsequently revealed that the killer is actually Dexter's nearly identical long-lost brother, Brian, who, like Dexter, witnessed their mother's brutal murder. Dexter is followed by Detective LaGuerta, who is slain by Brian. Debra finds out her brother is a killer and Dexter helps Brian to escape. In the television series, Brian is introduced under the fake name Rudy, a prosthetist who becomes Debra's boyfriend. Dexter hesitantly kills Brian instead of letting him escape, Debra does not discover her brother's secret, and LaGuerta is not present at all in the confrontation. In the novel, Dexter and his brother are nearly identical, whereas the actors playing the two characters are distinct from each other in <b>their</b> <b>looks.</b>|$|E
