500|$|On March 26, 2002, {{recording}} for Poodle Hat officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. By mid-2002, six originals—"Hardware Store", [...] "Party At The Leper Colony", [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", [...] "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?", [...] "Bob", and [...] "Genius In France"—had been recorded. The album's first original song is [...] "Hardware Store", which, {{as the title}} suggests, is about a new neighborhood hardware store {{and the things that}} can be purchased therein. The song was originally supposed to be a style parody of another (unspecified) artist, but it eventually evolved into its own, original composition. [...] "Party At The Leper Colony" [...] describes a party at a leper colony. The song makes heavy use of wordplay, using common English idioms to describe events wherein people literally lose body parts (e.g. [...] "Dance all night to a rotten band/Come on, people, let's give 'em a hand"). [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", a pastiche of Midnite Vultures-era Beck, consists of pick-up lines which become steadily more ridiculous and suggestive. Because the spelling of the song's title recalls the manner in which Prince titled many of his records, Yankovic specified on his website that the [...] "song is actually intended to sound like me <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like Beck <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like Prince" [...]|$|E
500|$|After {{three years}} of touring and working with {{producer}} Ross Robinson, Machine Head released its third studio album, The Burning Red, on August 10, 1999. The band added new elements to its music, including rapping vocals, a move which some believe to {{have been influenced by}} Ahrue Luster himself. This album and the band's change in image/musical direction (nu metal/alternative metal) was highly criticized, with critics and fans alike accusing the band of [...] "selling out". Nevertheless, McClain stated they weren't <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like popular bands but [...] "wanted to sound different". Rick Anderson of Allmusic stated Machine Head was [...] "sounding a bit looser and less constricted musically than they have in the past". The Burning Red became Machine Head's top selling album for a number of years, and debuted at number 88 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
500|$|Pier Dominguez, {{author of}} A Star is Made, {{commented that the}} {{sessions}} demonstrated [...] "Christina's raw vocal agility" [...] despite calling the content [...] "dull", adding [...] "Christina's hunger for success actually comes through in these songs, as she sings her heart out with strained emotion, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> as if she's letting all her inhibitions run free. If she did in fact co-write the songs then they were also a demonstration of Christina's songwriting dexterity, because the album's lyrics could be called unoriginal and perhaps even cheesy, {{it could not be}} said that they were not catchy". Similarly, Stephanie McGrath from JAM! Music also saw why Aguilera would not want the album released. Although she recognized Aguilera's potential as a vocalist, she wrote [...] "The songs themselves are terrible, dated club tracks, overwhelmed by poor effects and mundane beats." [...] Despite the negative critical reception, the album has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States and peaked at number 71 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
6000|$|Concurrently {{with these}} {{insidious}} speculations Lady Harman found herself <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> imagine how one sold jewels. She <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> Peters by {{taking up the}} story of the necklace again. But Peters was uninforming. [...] "But where," [...] asked Lady Harman, [...] "could such a thing be done?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jon Bream from Star Tribune made a {{positive}} review about the show, writing: [...] "Newton-John positively sparkled, singing into their eyes, radiating desire, devotion and delight that couldn't be denied". But stated that [...] "when she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> contemporary, she {{seemed out of}} character".|$|R
6000|$|Before {{she sent}} it she held council with her father. She {{sat on the}} foot of his bed and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> dutiful. [...] "I don't want to do {{anything}} that's bad for you, daddy. But isn't it taking your mind away from business?" ...|$|R
500|$|Ed Easton Jr. {{of radio}} station WNOW-FM called the song a [...] "cocky and hip hop based song" [...] and commented that Brown's ability to rap on [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was {{not close to}} LilWayne and Busta Rhymes' level. Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine could not imagine why Brown would want to share the song with Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes, stating [...] "One alone would've been enough to point up just how little {{personality}} he exudes on his own tracks, but putting both on 'Look at Me Now' ironically renders him invisible." [...] Music Review|work=Slant Magazine|date=March 24, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2011}} Bri LaPelusa of UR Chicago called the song [...] "the most gangsta" [...] track on F.A.M.E., and wrote [...] "the abruptly homophobic/misogynistic lyrics and elementary rhyming from Busta Rhymes and LilWayne dampen the song's appeal." [...] F.A.M.E. - Review|publisher=UR Chicago|date=March 22, 2011|accessdate=July 9, 2011}} Chad Grischow of IGN wrote, [...] "Brown tries his hand at rapping on the out-of-place 'Look at Me Now', and is left in the dust by Lil Wayne and, suddenly resurgent, Busta Rhymes." [...] Staff members of Idolator criticized Brown for <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like a second-class Soulja Boy Tell 'Em and praised Busta Rhymes' [...] "razor sharp verse" [...] as the song's highlight.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana often {{altered the}} song's lyrics and tempo for live {{performances}}. Some live {{performances of the}} song had the line [...] "our little group has always been" [...] changed to [...] "our little tribe has always been," [...] which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] " [...] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit." [...] A notable alternate performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, [...] "Load up on guns, bring your friends" [...] became [...] "Load up on drugs, kill your friends"). [...] Cobain later said he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] as the third greatest in the show's history. This performance {{can be found on}} the 1994 home video Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!.|$|E
2500|$|The {{band was}} {{inspired}} to write [...] "Counterfeit" [...] after local bands began to copy their style. According to Borland, [...] "They saw this little thing we built [...] and they were like, 'Oh, let's get baggy pants and dress like kind of hip-hoppy and, you know, play heavy metal and rap.' [...] five or six bands just popped up out of nowhere that became these, you know, groups that were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like us. It was ridiculous. That's where the song 'Counterfeit' came from." ...|$|E

5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{described}} Abracadabra as a [...] "disheartening latter-day album from ABC". He {{felt that}} ABC had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> modern by [...] "incorporating both house and smooth Philly soul flourishes to their sound". Although {{he felt that}} sometimes the results were supple and alluring", he felt the album lacked [...] "strong, melodic songs".|$|R
5000|$|Rusty {{is often}} seen to wear his {{drumming}} influences on his sleeve. In a Triple J radio J File interview he comments [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like three different drummers in every song laughs", citing Ian Paice of Deep Purple as a key influence. Other sixties and seventies influences referenced include the Super Stocks, The Pretty Things, The Honeycombs and the Who.|$|R
2500|$|Most initial reviews were positive: NME {{described}} the song as [...] "audacious, certainly, and {{very good to}} boot", adding that [...] "Editors have found their life force in death itself", while MusicOMH stated that [...] "at 5 minutes long it's worth every second." [...] However, some reviews were less favourable; Stereogum {{described the}} song as [...] "mildly warmed over post-Coldplay arena rock" [...] and described the percussion of the song as the [...] "incessant, downbeat crash cymbal bashing of every band <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> 'big'." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Driftin' Blues" [...] was {{a feature}} of Johnny Moore's Three Blazers' club repertoire. Their {{performances}} of the song were well received {{and led to a}} recording contract with Philo (soon to become Aladdin) Records. They recorded four songs at their first recording session, on September 14, 1945. To round out the trio's sound, Brown invited Otis to sit in on drums. [...] Otis recalled that Brown used a different approach for [...] "Driftin' Blues": [...] "he poured his heart into the record—not in the Nat Cole manner—but in that deep and soulful style that soon had many young R singers <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like him". [...] Brown's vocal has also been described as [...] "plaintive", as [...] "lush, mellifluous", and having a [...] "laconic grace and soothing timbre".|$|E
60|$|His face darkened {{once more}} as Hall hurried away, leaving him alone. He drew out {{the piece of}} paper from his pocket and stared at it again. Yes; it was the one he had sent to his wife. How did Van Loo get hold of it? Was he at the hotel that night? Had he picked it up in the hall or passage when the servant dropped it? When Hall handed him the paper and he first {{recognized}} it a fiendish thought, followed by a spasm of more fiendish rage, had sent the blood to his face. But his crude common sense quickly dismissed that suggestion of his wife's complicity with Van Loo. But had she seen him passing through the hotel that night, and had sought to draw from him some knowledge of his early intercourse with the child, and confessed everything, and even produced the paper with his signature as a proof of identity? Women had been known to do such desperate things. Perhaps she disbelieved her son's aversion to her, and was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> Van Loo. As for the forged words by Van Loo, and the use he had put them to, he cared little. He believed the man was capable of forgery; indeed, he suddenly remembered that in the old days his son had spoken innocently, but admiringly, of Van Loo's wonderful chirographical powers and his faculty of imitating the writings of others, and how he had even offered to teach him. A new and exasperating thought came into his feverish consciousness. What if Van Loo, in teaching the boy, had even made use of him as an innocent accomplice to cover up his own tricks! The suggestion was no question of moral ethics to Steptoe, nor of his son's possible contamination, although since the night of the big strike he had held different views; it was simply a fierce, selfish jealousy that ANOTHER might have profited by the lad's helplessness and inexperience. He had been tormented by this jealousy before in his son's liking for Van Loo. He had at first encouraged his admiration and imitative regard for this smooth swindler's graces and accomplishments, which, though he scorned them himself, he was, after the common parental infatuation, willing that the boy should profit by. Incapable, through his own consciousness, of distinguishing between Van Loo's superficial polish and the true breeding of a gentleman, he had only looked upon it as an equipment for his son which might be serviceable to himself. He had told his wife the truth when he informed her of Van Loo's fears of being reminded of their former intimacy; but he had not told her how its discontinuance after they had left Heavy Tree Hill had affected her son, and how he still cherished his old admiration for that specious rascal. Nor had he told her how this had stung him, through his own selfish greed of the boy's affection. Yet now that it was possible that she had met Van Loo that evening, she might have become aware of Van Loo's power over her child. How she would exult, for all her pretended hatred of Van Loo! How, perhaps, they had plotted together! How Van Loo might have become aware of the place where his son was kept, and have been bribed by the mother to tell her! He stopped in a whirl of giddy fancies. His strong common sense in all other things had been hitherto proof against such idle dreams or suggestions; but the very strength of his parental love and jealousy had awakened in him at last the terrors of imagination.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{in their}} career {{a number of}} reviewers dubbed their sound [...] "jamtronic" [...] for its blend of jam and {{electronic}} music, but the band rejected the label for being inaccurate.
