5|$|In 1979, William G. Dyer became {{dean of the}} school. Dyer {{oversaw the}} {{construction}} of the N. Eldon Tanner Building, which was dedicated in 1982. In 1983, an Executive MBA program was added, and in 1984 Paul H. Thompson was appointed dean of the school. Two years later (1986), the International Student Sponsor Program was started, which continues to provide financial assistance to married LDS international students to <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1988, the name of the school was changed to Marriott School of Management in honor of its benefactors—Marriott International founders J. Willard and Alice Marriott—following their $15million donation to the school. That same year, the Army and Air Force ROTC programs became a part of the Marriott School.|$|E

5|$|Mains {{electricity}} {{was introduced}} to Ambrosden in 1935. The Bicester Military Railway between Bicester and Piddington was built through Ambrosden in 1941 and remains in use to <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1951–52 the Ministry of Defence and the Central Ordnance Depot had a new housing estate of some 200 houses built in the village. The Government bought a significant area of land {{from most of the}} farms in the parish. There are three types of house, all designed by the architect R. Potter of Salisbury, all built of brick and roofed with tiles, and many sited around a green.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} modern period the house has been the country seat of several {{prominent}} families including the St Loes one of whom married Bess of Hardwick. They lived at Sutton Court and expanded the property {{in the second half}} of the 16th century. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries it was owned by the Strachey baronets and their descendants until it was sold in 1987 and converted into apartments. In the Early 1980's the house was used as a film location for the BBC Look and Read series 'Dark Towers', a series very popular to <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> Primary schools.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Matsui was executed, he was cremated and the US Army {{took away}} his ashes {{to prevent a}} {{memorial}} from being created. However, unbeknownst to them, some of the ashes had been hidden by {{the owner of the}} crematorium. He later brought these ashes to the shrine Matsui had founded, the Koa Kannon, and they remain there to <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1978, all seven war criminals executed by the IMTFE, including Iwane Matsui, were officially enshrined in Yasukuni Shrine in a secret ceremony conducted by head priest Nagayoshi Matsudaira. This event did not become publicly known until the following year.|$|E

5|$|The letter M in {{the state}} highway numbers is an {{integral}} part of the designation and included on the diamond-shaped reassurance markers posted alongside the highways. The state's highways are referred to using an M-n syntax as opposed to Route n or Highway n, which are common elsewhere. This usage dates from 1919, when Michigan's state trunklines were first signed along the roadways, and continues to <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> official and unofficial contexts. Michigan is one of only two states following this syntax, the other one being Kansas.|$|E
5|$|The main {{innovation}} of {{the pyramid}} of Unas is the first appearance of the Pyramid Texts, {{one of the oldest}} religious texts in Egypt to have survived to <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> doing so, Unas initiated a tradition that would be followed in the pyramid of the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties, {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom circa 200 years later.|$|E
5|$|Turahan {{himself was}} {{recalled}} to Adrianople in October 1455 and died ca. August 1456. He was buried at Kirk Kvak near Uzun Köprü in Thrace, but his memorial tomb (türbe) survives to <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the city. His descendants, the Turahanoğlu, were wealthy landowners in Thessaly {{until the end}} of the Ottoman rule there in the late 19th century; with the exception of his sons however, they did not rise to any wider prominence.|$|E

5|$|A B {{movie or}} B {{film is a}} low-budget {{commercial}} movie, but one {{that is not an}} arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a double feature (akin to B-sides for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased {{by the end of the}} 1950s, the term B movie continues to be used in its broader sense to <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> its post–Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|Although Gay {{tended to}} be a slow starter on the track, he worked hard to improve and broke the Lafayette High School stadium record for the 200 meters. Under the tutelage of Ken Northington, a former 100-yard dash state champion, Gay began working on his {{technique}} and rhythm. By his senior year he was a more composed athlete and he focused on the 100 meters, winning the state championship in the event and setting a new championship record of 10.60s. In spite of this, his mother noted {{that he was not}} fully applying himself and was taking his abilities for granted. Gay was also not a studious child and he failed to achieve the grades needed to enter a Division I sports college. However, the Kentucky High School State Championships in June 2001 demonstrated his abilities: he won gold in the 100m, setting a new personal best and state record with 10.46s, a record which stands to <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> the 200m he took silver with another new personal best of 21.23s. At a 2001 track event, Gay met trainer Lance Brauman and the college coach convinced him to attend Barton County Community College. It was here that Gay first met Jamaican sprinter Veronica Campbell-Brown, and the two formed a close bond, becoming training partners.|$|E
5|$|By 1683 the College {{part of the}} {{structure}} was finished. The new building was built out of plain bricks of three storeys, with basement and attic levels in addition. The College consists of an extensive range of quadrangular buildings. Apart from the hall, a porter's lodge and a public office, {{the rest of the}} building was given over to the heralds as accommodation. To the east and south sides three terraced houses were constructed for leases, their façade in keeping with the original design. In 1699 the hall, which for some time had been used as a library, was transformed into the Earl Marshal's Court or the Court of Chivalry; it remains so to <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1776 some stylistic changes were made to the exterior of the building and some details, such as pediments and cornices were removed, transforming the building to the then popular but austere Neo-Classical style.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, {{when the}} Jeffries Freeway (I-96) was completed, M-14 was {{shortened}} {{to have its}} eastern terminus at I-275 exit28 in Plymouth Township, and the portion of Plymouth Road within the city of Detroit was returned to local control. The portion of Plymouth Road–Ann Arbor Road between I-275 and the city boundary with Redford Township was retained as an unsigned trunkline, maintained {{by the state to}} <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1979, the final segment of the M-14 freeway, between M-153 and I-275 was completed. The former route of M-14 in Washtenaw County along Plymouth–Ann Arbor Road was returned to local control. The portion of Ann Arbor Road from the Wayne County line east to I-275 also became an unsigned state trunkline, also still maintained by MDOT.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the sufferings of mothers and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including her practice of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring children on the sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (Middle English: Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyȝt) is a late 14th-century Middle English chivalric romance. It {{is one of}} {{the best}} known Arthurian stories, with its plot {{combining}} two types of folklore motifs, the beheading game and the exchange of winnings. The Green Knight is interpreted by some as a representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ. Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel, it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition. It is an important poem in the romance genre, which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess, and it remains popular to <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> modern English renderings from J. R. R. Tolkien, Simon Armitage, and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.|$|E

5|$|Walt Disney Theatrical {{produced}} a musical stage {{adaptation of the}} same name, which premiered in Minneapolis, Minnesota in July 1997, and later opened on Broadway in October 1997 at the New Amsterdam Theatre. The Lion King musical was directed by Julie Taymor and featured songs from both the movie and Rhythm of the Pride Lands, along with three new compositions by Elton John and Tim Rice. Mark Mancina did the musical arrangements and new orchestral tracks. The musical {{became one of the}} most successful in Broadway history, winning six Tony Awards including Best Musical, and despite moving to the Minskoff Theatre in 2006, is still running to <b>this</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> New York, becoming the third longest-running show and highest grossing Broadway production in history.
