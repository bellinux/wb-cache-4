25|$|Bulimia is {{more common}} {{among those who have}} a close {{relative}} with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%. Other risk factors for the disease include psychological stress, cultural pressure to attain a certain body type, poor self-esteem, and obesity. Living in a culture that promotes dieting and having parents <b>that</b> <b>worry</b> about weight are also risks. Diagnosis is based on a person's medical history, however this is difficult as people are usually secretive about their binge eating and purging habits. Furthermore, the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa takes precedence over that of bulimia. Other similar disorders include binge eating disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and borderline personality disorder.|$|E
500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed <b>that</b> <b>worry</b> to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E

But it seemed to Ken <b>that</b> <b>Worry</b> did not tell the boys the whole truth, or they would not have laughed at the thing and made him out over-sensitive. And Ken was now growing too discouraged and bewildered to tell them. Moreover, he was getting stubborn. The thing was far from a joke.
