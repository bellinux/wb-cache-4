5|$|Fighters Uncaged is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters Uncaged {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and different settings and opponents. Simon is able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios and opponents. Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters Uncaged received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its motion control system as the biggest issue they had with the game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E

The US – an important export country for food stocks – converted approximately 18% of its grain output to ethanol in 2008. Across the US, 25% of the whole corn crop went to ethanol in 2007. The percentage of corn going to biofuel is expected <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, U.S. Senators introduced the BioFuels Security Act.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, the {{architect}} Eliel Saarinen {{was commissioned by}} the AIA of Michigan to compose a waterfront civic center design. However, World War II {{got in the way}} of its development, and it wasn't until the late 1940s that things got under way. The first parts <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the area were the buildings, including a veteran's hall, an auditorium, and the city-county building.|$|E
25|$|Designed with a ductile steel frame, the {{building}} was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> record time. Construction commenced in 1974 but was held up for around nine years {{as a result of}} a political standoff between the Muldoon government and the Boilermakers Union. Ongoing strikes and go-slows eventually led to the union’s deregistration and to steel construction going out of favour in New Zealand for many years. The building was eventually completed in 1984 and now stands as a striking landmark on the Wellington CBD skyline.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Dole's {{interests}} changed {{throughout the}} years. He {{laid out a}} half-mile racetrack on his property and purchased the finest horses that money could buy, soon accumulating a string of horses that was the envy of northern Illinois. It is said that Dole loved <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his tower (currently closed off) and watch his horses run. When tired of the fad of his stable, he disposed of his beautiful and valuable horses by holding an elaborate sale. The Doles lived in the mansion until the late 1890s when the property was sold to his son in law for $1.00.|$|E
50|$|In general, reduced incline rises {{are easier}} for {{wheelchair}} users to traverse and are safer in icy climates. However, they consume more space and require traveling a greater distance <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up.</b> Hence, <b>in</b> {{some cases it}} is preferable to include an elevator or other type of wheelchair lift.|$|R

25|$|Slave {{characters}} in general {{came to be}} low-comedy types with names that matched the instruments they played: Brudder Tambo (or simply Tambo) for the tambourine and Brudder Bones (or Bones) for the bone castanets or bones. These endmen (for {{their position in the}} minstrel semicircle) were ignorant and poorly spoken, being conned, electrocuted, or run over in various sketches. They happily shared their stupidity; one slave character said that to get to China, one had only <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a balloon and wait for the world to rotate below. Highly musical and unable to sit still, they constantly contorted their bodies wildly while singing.|$|E
25|$|In 1629, a moment's {{carelessness}} by two workmen caused much of {{the castle}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames in the night between the 24 and 25 September. Only the Chapel was spared by {{the strength of its}} arches. King Christian IV put great efforts into restoring the castle. Already in 1631, the work was underway, led by the architect Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger. By 1639 the exterior— which in keeping with the king's wish was reconstructed without major changes— was once again magnificent, but the interior never fully regained its former glory. Furthermore, certain modernizations were made, and portals, chimneypieces, ceiling paintings and other decorations were renewed in Baroque style.|$|E
25|$|Santos then vacated the WBO title <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> {{weight and}} pursue the WBO Light Middleweight Championship and Margarito was {{assigned}} to fight Antonio Díaz for the vacant title {{in front of an}} HBO Boxing audience. On March 16, 2002, Margarito crowned himself world champion, beating Diaz by knockout in round ten. He defended that crown with a decision in twelve over Danny Perez Ramírez and a knockout in two over former WBA title holder Andrew Lewis. Lewis was a southpaw and a hard puncher, but had been exposed as having a weak chin, while Margarito proved that he has a world class chin. He publicly asked for a unification bout with then WBC and WBA Champion Ricardo Mayorga.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{an effort}} to crack down on {{corruption}} by the eunuchs inspired by Johnston, Puyi ordered an inventory of the treasures in the Forbidden City, which caused the Hall of Supreme Harmony <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames in a case of arson on the night of 26 June 1923 as the eunuchs tried to cover up the extent of their theft. Johnston reported on the next day he “found the Emperor and Empress standing on a heap of charred wood, sadly contemplating the spectacle”. The treasures reported lost in the fire include 2,685golden statues of Lord Buddha, 1,675golden altar ornaments, 435porcelain antiques, and 31boxes of sable furs, though it is likely that most if not all of these treasures were sold on the black market before the building was set afire.|$|E

James Longstreet. [...] When Gen. Robert E. Lee assumed command of the army, Alexander was in charge of pre-positioned ordnance for Lee's offensive in the Seven Days Battles. Alexander continued his intelligence gathering by volunteering <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an observation balloon at Gaines' Mill on June 27, ascending several times and returning with valuable intelligence regarding the position of the Union Army.|$|E

Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth." [...] "It took about two hours for that cash <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames", he added. [...] "I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this." ...|$|E

25|$|During this period, the {{differences}} in ceramics from different regions become increasingly more noticeable, suggesting further degradation of trade at this time. Other than a brief 'renaissance' period that took place mid-twelfth century that brought some developments, the pottery begins to deteriorate. This decline continues {{until the end of}} LH IIIC, where there is no place <b>to</b> <b>go</b> but <b>up</b> <b>in</b> terms of technical and artistic pottery.|$|R
500|$|Critics {{have said}} that Jay Pritzker Pavilion is the {{highlight}} of Millennium Park. Fodor's travel guide described it as the park's [...] "showstopper" [...] and [...] "stunning", praising its stainless steel and sound system, {{as well as the}} variety of events it hosts. Time called the pavilion [...] "dynamic" [...] and recommended it as one of two must-see attractions in the park, while one New York Times writer found herself standing [...] "agog" [...] at what appeared to her to be a [...] "celestial gateway to another universe" [...] and a frame for the sky. Lonely Planet travel guide called the pavilion the anchor of the park, and the 2004 Year in Review issue of Time described it as the park's crown jewel. USA Today described the bandshell as a landmark and the centerpiece of Millennium Park. Another critic described the pavilion as the [...] "most spectacular structure <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> early-twenty-first-century Chicago".|$|E

The building embraces memory and aspiration, protest and reconciliation, pride and shame." ...|$|E

No. 1 gun had been {{specially}} placed {{at the top of a}} slope to cover the approach from Mateur and fired over open sights. The leading German tanks ran onto mines, were damaged and withdrew with the infantry. At [...] the Germans made another attempt on the left flank but F Troop opened fire and hit four German tanks, setting them ablaze. German infantry engaged B Company with small-arms fire but were repulsed. Around midday, the Germans prepared to attack again but massed British artillery-fire broke up the attack before it began.|$|E
2500|$|Objects {{viewed in}} a (plane) mirror will appear {{laterally}} inverted (e.g., if one raises one's right hand, the image's left hand will appear <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the mirror), but not vertically inverted (in the image a person's head still appears above his body). However, a mirror does not usually [...] "swap" [...] {{left and right}} {{any more than it}} swaps top and bottom. A mirror typically reverses the forward/backward axis. To be precise, it reverses the object in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface (the normal). Because left and right are defined relative to front-back and top-bottom, the [...] "flipping" [...] of front and back results in the perception of a left-right reversal in the image. (If you stand side-on to a mirror, the mirror really does reverse your left and right, because that's the direction perpendicular to the mirror.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Warrior only {{participated in}} three matches in WCW. The {{first was the}} WarGames match at Fall Brawl, where he competed {{as a member of}} Team WCW, {{competing}} against 8 other wrestlers for a shot at Goldberg's WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Halloween Havoc. Diamond Dallas Page won the match by pinning Stevie Ray. On Monday Nitro, he teamed with Sting to defeat Hogan and Bret Hart by disqualification, a match in which he had little participation; he was tagged in for a short exchange with Hart, then singlehandedly chased several nWo members down the entry way, whipping them with Hogan's belt. The third was his loss to Hogan at Halloween Havoc, in what is considered by Eric Bischoff {{to be one of the}} worst main event pay-per-view wrestling matches ever. In the Halloween Havoc match, the timing of the maneuvers and hits was poor; an arm injury that Warrior received at WarGames further slowed the action. An attempt to [...] "blind" [...] Warrior with a fireball backfired when Hogan faced complications igniting a piece of flash paper, causing the fire <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> Hogan's face instead. The match came to an end when Horace Hogan hit Warrior in the back with a chair while Eric Bischoff had referee Nick Patrick distracted. Hogan then scored the pinfall.|$|E
