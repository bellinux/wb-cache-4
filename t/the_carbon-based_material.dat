The study was performed on a LEFA sodium salt produced from oleic acid and lactic acid. The test method determines if microbes, in this case activated sludge inoculum, can digest a test material, thereby returning <b>the</b> <b>carbon-based</b> <b>material</b> back into the environment as carbon dioxide to complete the carbon cycle. To meet or exceed the OECD Guideline 301B criteria for [...] "readily biodegradable", a sample must produce 60% of the theoretical amount of carbon dioxide (TCO2) within a 10-day window of reaching 10% TCO2. The LEFA {{used in the study}} had a final average cumulative percent biodegradation of 92.0% and the test solution had a pH of 7.1 {{at the end of the}} 28-day test. Therefore, the test material met the criteria to be considered readily biodegradable. In the presence of water, lactylates will break down (hydrolyze) into fatty acid and lactic acid. Based on all available information, lactylates do not meet any hazard categories under SARA Title III, Sections 311-313.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} kind of new gray-scale technology. The new gray-scale technology uses a carbon- based light-attenuating material. This material can reach a very high optical density (̃ 3. 0) for deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography applications. This property is out {{the reach of the}} often-used High-Energy-Beam-Sensitive (HEBS) gray-scale mask. HEBS gray-scale mask cannot be used for wavelength below 300 nm and it cannot provide enough optical density at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm for high-resolution component fabrication. Higher optical density at shorter wavelengths means that the components of more levels and with higher resolution are achievable. Compared with Binary Half-Tone (BHT) gray-scale mask, the new mask offers a much higher resolution. Two-beam-current method is invented for the e-beam writing in the fabrication of gray-scale masks. Compared with the simpler single-current method, two-beam-current method offers two important advantages. First it can achieve a much larger dynamic range for the e-beam exposure. The second advantage is the writing time for a gray-scale mask could be reduced significantly when a large pattern is to be written. By applying the new gray-scale mask in DUV and UV lithography respectively, gray-scale patterns were successfully generated in optical resists. Finally devices were fabricated after the gray-scale patterns in resists were transferred into the substrate material in the etching step. Different micro-structures with different resolution and depth requirements have been fabricated successfully. <b>The</b> <b>carbon-based</b> <b>material</b> has a big hardness, comparable to diamond film, and stays at the quartz surface very firmly.

However, current technologies involve the use of precious metals (such as platinum) for hydrazine oxidation, which hinders the further application of hydrazine fuel-cell technologies. In addition, little attention has been devoted to the management of gas, which tends to become stuck on the surface of the electrode, producing overall poor electrode efficiencies. In this study, we utilized a nano-hill morphology of vertical graphene, which efficiently resolves the issue of the accumulation of gas bubbles on the electrode surface by providing a nano-rough-edged surface that acts as a superaerophobic electrode. The growth of the vertical graphene nano-hills was achieved and optimized by a scalable plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition method.

30|$|The {{charge storage}} {{behaviors}} of the MCNs are strongly dependent on both their macroscopic structure and local microstructure, particularly in ILE. Concentration polarization generally limits the rate capabilities of electrode materials due {{to a decline in}} the ion transfer ability with increasing current rates. Therefore, a hierarchically macroporous open structure composed of nanometer scale carbon building blocks can be an ideal platform to achieve rapid ion transfer; several studies reported the practicability of these architectures [10 – 13]. On the other hand, when ion transfer of the electrolyte is fast enough, an ohmic drop originating from inadequate electrical conductivity is a critical factor limiting the rate capabilities of the electrode materials. Graphitic carbon composed mainly of sp 2 carbon layers generally have better electrical conductivity than amorphous carbon. Although the local carbon structures can be transformed to graphitic structures by simple heating under an inert gas atmosphere, it is difficult to maintain the internal nanostructure of <b>the</b> <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> during <b>the</b> heating process, collapsing the nanoporous architecture and/or causing the aggregation of the carbon nanobuilding blocks.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of first-principles {{calculations}} of molecular electron structure, we discuss the strategy of modifying <b>the</b> <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> {{in order to increase}} their capacity to bind with molecular hydrogen. In particular, we have studied hydrogen adsorption on molecular complexes having anionic aromatic carbon-based rings stabilized by cations of alkali (Li+, Na+, K+) or alkali-earth metals (Be 2 +, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +). The adsorption depends more on the properties of the cation than on the ring itself. The interaction of the H 2 molecule with an electrostatic field leads to the binding of the hydrogen molecule with the strongly polarized ionic molecular complex. The number of the adsorbed molecules is driven by two factors acting in opposite directions: the binding energy, which should be larger than a 4 – 5 kJ/mol threshold needed to keep hydrogen molecules attached, and the area around the cation (coordination sphere), which is determined by its radius. As a compromise between these factors, we propose several promising candidates for building blocks of hydrogen storage materials, including diboratabenzene lithium, C 4 B 2 H 6 Li 2, and diboratabenzene potassium, C 4 B 2 H 6 K 2, which can adsorb 6 and 12 H 2 molecules, correspondingly.

The use of Raman spectroscopy in combination with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction establishes the amorphous nature and surface-bonding characteristics of the studied carbon materials.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of fine carbon powders (graphite and cokes) are {{generated}} as the solid waste in <b>the</b> manufacture of <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> in industry. How to utilize these abundant powders to generate products with high value still remains a big challenge. Herein, we report the preparation of porous carbon microspheres (PCMs) employing waste non-graphitized needle coke and graphitized needle coke as the fine carbon powder representatives, demonstrating their use as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. It {{was found that the}} graphitized PCMs had a size of 8 - 30 mu m and surface areas between 50 and 120 m(2) g(- 1). When used as the anode materials, their charge capacity at the current density of 50 mA g(- 1) was comparable to that of the commercial graphite microspheres, but they exhibited higher rate performance.

40|$|A {{diametrical}} {{section of}} a graphite spheroid froma ductile iron sample was prepared using the focused ion beam-lift out technique. Characterization of this section was carried out through automated crystal orientation mapping in a transmission electron microscope. This new technique automatically collects electron diffraction patterns and matches them with precalculated templates. The results of this investigation are crystal orientation and phase maps of the specimen, which bring new light {{to the understanding of}} growth mechanisms of this peculiar graphite morphology. This article shows that mapping <b>the</b> orientation of <b>carbon-based</b> <b>materials</b> such as graphite, which is difficult to achieve with conventional techniques, can be performed automatically and at high spatial resolution using automated crystal orientation mapping in a transmission electron microscope...|$|R
30|$|The {{focus of}} {{scientific}} studies of Australian rock art has been <b>the</b> dating of <b>carbon-based</b> <b>material</b> found at sites of interest [1 – 4]. Since the mid- 1980 s, radiocarbon dating of rock art using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) {{has been used}} to directly date rock paintings. Carbon isotope analysis can be carried out on charcoal pigments, as well as the organic constituents of paint residues or inclusions in mineral accretions. Suitable organic material is not always available or in an appreciable quantity to allow a reliable analysis. However, there is also potential information to be obtained about pigment sources and history from the inorganic material (e.g. mineral pigments) used in traditional paint to broaden the analytical information obtained from rock art.|$|R
