25|$|On Henry's and others' recommendations, Lowe was {{contacted}} by Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, who {{invited him to}} Washington for an audience with Secretary of War Simon Cameron and the President. On 11 June 1861, Lowe was received by Lincoln and immediately offered <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> a live demonstration with the balloon.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 8:20 pm {{local time}} (18:20UTC), the presidential jet circled once around Kigali International Airport before {{coming in for}} final {{approach}} in clear skies. A weekly flight by a Belgian C-130 Hercules carrying UNAMIR troops returning from leave {{had been scheduled to}} land before the presidential jet, but was waved off <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> priority.|$|E
50|$|The CSX-T was {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} the 1987 CSX, except the non-intercooled Turbo I engine was used.

50|$|The Italian Penal Code {{makes it}} a {{criminal}} offence to insult the honor and prestige of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> (Art. 278), and until 2006 it was an offence <b>to</b> publicly <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> responsibility for actions of the Government (Art. 279 - abrogated).|$|R

25|$|On January 13 the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP), by a {{count of}} 154-to-2, voted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> the power to declare martial law to restore order. Yet on the same day, 9 people were {{reported}} killed in fighting in Biyo-Adde in central Somalia. Prime Minister Gedi first stated that martial law would be declared on December 29, 2006; parliament's vote vested the government with the proper legal authority.|$|E
25|$|The steel industry's brief focused {{instead on}} the lack of {{statutory}} authority for this seizure, emphasizing Congress' decision when enacting the Taft–Hartley Act <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> the power to seek an injunction against strikes that might affect the national economy instead. It denied that the President had any power to seize private property without express legislative authorization, noting that Truman himself had asked for such legislative authority when the United Mine Workers of America went out on strike in 1950.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} calls by some, such as former German {{interior}} minister and current {{minister of finance}} Wolfgang Schäuble, for direct elections to take place <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> a mandate, this would strengthen the post within the European Council allowing for stronger leadership in addition to addressing the question of democratic legitimacy in the EU. However, this might cause conflict with Parliament's democratic mandate or a potential mandate for the Commission (see section below). To give a mandate to the European Council's president would signify a development of the Union's governance towards a presidential system, rather than a parliamentary system.|$|E

25|$|The {{governments of}} Iceland {{have always been}} {{coalition}} governments, with two or more parties involved, as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the Althing throughout the republican period. The extent of the political power possessed {{by the office of}} the president is disputed by legal scholars, in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently. In 1980, Icelanders elected Vigdís Finnbogadóttir as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state. She retired from office in 1996. In 2009, Iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir became prime minister.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, three younger {{members of}} the CPP were brought up on charges of {{taking part in a}} plot to blow up Nkrumah's car in a motorcade. The sole {{evidence}} against the alleged plotters was that they rode in cars well behind Nkrumah's car. When the defendants were acquitted, Nkrumah sacked the chief judge of the state security court, then got the CPP-dominated parliament to pass a law allowing a new trial. At this second trial, all three men were convicted and sentenced to death, though these sentences were subsequently commuted to life imprisonment. Shortly afterward, the constitution was amended <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> the power to summarily remove judges at all levels.|$|E
25|$|With Wolman's support, NLB Chairman Wagner {{intervened in}} the strike on March 6. AFL President William Green sought a {{compromise}} under which auto workers {{would be able}} to air their grievances and company unions would be banned but no additional organizing rights would be sought. Wolman, who had long supported company unions, pressed for the retention of these entities as a means of giving workers a voice during the Great Depression without empowering unions (which he felt would overreach themselves and inhibit economic recovery). The strike deadline passed without any action as talks continued. For a time the talks seemed to be making progress, but when the automakers refused to deal with the NLB President Roosevelt intervened personally in the negotiations. The strike was postponed <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> time to broker a deal. Relying heavily on Wolman's advice, Roosevelt negotiated a deal on March 23, but the deal collapsed and negotiations resumed. At Wolman's suggestion, Roosevelt agreed on March 25 to establish an Automobile Labor Board which endorsed Johnson's reinterpretation of the auto industry code of February 1934 and would hear grievances and cases of discrimination against workers.|$|E

García Pimentel sold the act to Florencio Gavito and he stipulated in his will that after his death, the act should be <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> Adolfo López Mateos. On November 14, 1961, the result of two opinions were <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> by which {{it was found that}} the act is one of the two originals drafted in 1821. On November 21, Florencio Gavito Jáuregui <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> document <b>to</b> <b>President</b> López Mateos.|$|R

500|$|Hanna {{was called}} upon to do only small amounts of {{fundraising}} this time: [...] no great educational campaign was required, and the corporations were willing <b>to</b> <b>give.</b> <b>The</b> <b>President</b> gave only one speech, the formal acceptance of his nomination in Canton in July. [...] Roosevelt, on the other hand, traveled widely across the nation giving speeches. [...] The New Yorker traveled [...] in the campaign, reaching 24 of the 45states. [...] Hanna was now a public figure, and wanted to campaign for the Republicans in the western states. [...] McKinley, however, was reluctant, as Hanna had varied from the administration's position on trusts in a recent speech. [...] McKinley sent Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith to Chicago, where Hanna then was, {{to talk him out}} of the trip. [...] Hanna rapidly discerned that Smith had been sent by the President, and told him, [...] "Return to Washington and tell the President that God hates a coward." [...] McKinley and Hanna met in Canton several days later and settled their differences over lunch. [...] Hanna made his speaking tour in the West. [...] According to Hanna biographer Thomas Beer, Hanna's tour was a great success, though many viewers were surprised he did not wear suits decorated with the [...] "dollar mark".|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, {{when asked}} about the war in Iraq, Pryce ended an {{interview}} with CNN by walking away. In a statement later issued to CNN, Pryce said: [...] "What's happening in Iraq is not a direct reflection on me." [...] The statement also said that [...] "I voted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> the authority to use force in Iraq; that doesn't mean I'm always happy with what I see, but I can think of nothing worse for our troops or our prospects for success than having 435 members of Congress second-guessing our commanders." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his time}} in the Senate, Edwards co-sponsored 203 bills. Among them was Lieberman's 2002 Iraq War Resolution (S.J.Res.46), which he co-sponsored along with 15 other senators, but which did not go to a vote. He voted for {{replacement}} resolution (H.J Res. 114) in the full Senate to authorize {{the use of military force}} against Iraq, which passed by a vote of 77 to 23, On October 10, 2002, he stated that: [...] He defended his vote on an October 10, 2004, appearance on Meet the Press, saying [...] "I would have voted for the resolution knowing what I know today, because it was the right thing to do <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> the authority to confront Saddam Hussein...I think Saddam Hussein was a very serious threat. I stand by that, and that's why [...] stand behind our vote on the resolution". However, he subsequently changed his mind about the war and apologized for that military authorization vote. Edwards also voted in favor of the Patriot Act.|$|E

5000|$|Sanders {{strongly}} opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and {{voted against the}} 2002 resolution authorizing {{the use of force}} against Iraq. In a 2002 speech, he said, [...] "I am opposed <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> a blank check to launch a unilateral invasion and occupation of Iraq" [...] and [...] "I will vote against this resolution. One, I have not heard any estimates of how many young American men and women might die in such a war or how many tens of thousands of women and children in Iraq might also be killed. As a caring Nation, we should do everything we can to prevent the horrible suffering that a war will cause. War must be the last recourse in international relations, not the first. Second, I am deeply concerned about the precedent that a unilateral invasion of Iraq could establish in terms of international law and the role of the United Nations." ...|$|R
2500|$|For their part, the British {{wanted the}} McMahon Act's {{restrictions}} on nuclear cooperation to be relaxed. They {{wanted to know}} the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British V-bombers, and American warheads to be fitted to British Blue Streak missiles. This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium. While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide. The United States Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, was concerned that a Special Relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies. Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> the authority he needed without arousing its ire. Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were [...] "interdependent", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.|$|E
