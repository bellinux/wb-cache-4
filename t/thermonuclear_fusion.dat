5|$|With the {{discovery}} {{during the latter}} half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt, or if it was large enough to generate energy by the <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> of deuterium.|$|E

5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>fusion,</b> which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E

5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma.

At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, a star shines due to <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>fusion</b> of {{hydrogen}} into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, these very high-energy {{neutrons}} {{are less likely}} to simply be captured without causing fission or spallation. For these reasons, nuclear weapon design extensively utilizes D-T fusion 14.1 MeV neutrons to cause more fission. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as depleted uranium (uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons. <b>Fusion</b> neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs, such as reactor grade plutonium.

25|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} that the discovery of radioactivity had invalidated Thomson's estimate {{of the age of}} the Earth.

The combination of the shock waves and a realistic equation of state for the gas in the bubble provides an explanation for the measured picosecond optical pulse widths and indicates that the temperatures {{near the center of the}} bubble may exceed 3 O eV. This leads naturally to speculation about obtaining micro-thermonuclear fusion in a bubble filled with deuterium (D{sub 2 }) gas. Consequently, we performed numerical simulations of the collapse of a D{sub 2 } bubble in D{sub 2 } 0.

Due to the features of PLD, by varying the process parameters it is possible to tailor both the structure, i. e. the nanocrystalline domain size of the deposited films, down to less than 5 nm and separately control the other relevant physical properties. This leads to modifications in growth regime and annealing dynamics, in such a way that both morphology and reflectivity achieve the properties demanded to use these films as mirrors for fusion applications, opening at the same time new possibilities for the future improvement of thermo-mechanical and adhesion properties...|$|R
