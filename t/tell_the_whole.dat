5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

25|$|While {{appointed}} Prime Minister, {{the aftermath}} of the Portella della Ginestra massacre came to haunt Scelba again. On February 9, 1954, Gaspare Pisciotta was found dead in his cell. After Pisciotta had been sentenced to life in imprisonment and forced labour, he realized that he had been abandoned by all. He declared {{that he was going to}} <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> truth, in particular who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano, which demanded the massacre at Portella delle Ginestra in exchange for liberty for the bandits and which Giuliano had destroyed immediately.|$|E

After Nicky claims she was assaulted by her mathematics tutor Rod Morris (Forbes Masson) and later admits she didn't <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> truth (but was still assaulted) and then dissowns the family when they said she was lying, Rosa decides the whole family should leave Walford to move to Leicester and besides Beppe the entire family leaves Walford in August 2000. Rosa dies {{from a heart attack}} two years later at the age of 50. Beppe then later joins the rest of his family in Leicester.|$|E
25|$|Freddie Brown captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1950–51, {{playing as}} England in the 1950-51 Ashes {{series against the}} Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. They were {{regarded}} as a weak team - some critics wanted to cancel the tour - and failed to regain the Ashes. However, these facts do not <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story as the inspirational Brown exposed flaws in the powerful Australian team. By winning the Fifth and final Test he ended Australia's record of 26 Tests without defeat and {{paved the way for}} England's victories in 1953, 1954-55 and 1956.|$|E
25|$|Shilts's {{writing was}} admired for its {{powerful}} narrative drive, interweaving personal stories with {{political and social}} reporting. Shilts saw himself as a literary journalist {{in the tradition of}} Truman Capote and Norman Mailer. Undaunted by a lack of enthusiasm for his initial proposal for the Harvey Milk biography, Shilts reworked the concept, as he later said, after further reflection: I read Hawaii by James Michener. That gave me the concept for the book, the idea of taking people and using them as vehicles, symbols for different ideas. I would take the life-and-times approach and <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story of the gay movement in this way, using Harvey as the major vehicle.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of firearms does not <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> {{story of the}} 19th century due to their mixed impact and use in many regions. Indeed, some historians argue that mere advanced technology was not the single most decisive factor {{in the outcome of}} many colonial conquests. More important, was the divided, fragmented nature of many small African polities that enabled them to be defeated separately by their enemies. Such fragmentation is not unique to Africa. Germany for example in 1815, was split into over 30 separate states. Despite these weaknesses, until well into {{the second part of the}} century, many native forces held their own until the coming of modern artillery, machine guns and rifles.|$|E
25|$|By {{elevating}} head-to-head results (rule i) above points difference (rule ii), {{a notable}} difference is created to other sports competitions, in which points difference usually determines rank for teams {{with the same}} number of match points (table points). These rules allowed the winners of Pools A, B and C to be determined by the results of the third pool matches on the weekend of 22 and 23 September. Although other teams could theoretically draw level on table points with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and exceed their points differences {{at the end of the}} pool stages, head-to-head results by that time ensured these teams could be declared winners of their respective pools, with a match to spare. This also illustrates the fact that the pool tables do not <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story.|$|E

500|$|Lulla Rosenfeld's {{remark that}} Adler [...] "...rel entirely on {{classics}} and translations of modern European plays" [...] does not quite <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story. On one hand, {{he was also}} responsible for recruiting the Yiddish theater's first naturalistic playwright, Jacob Gordin, and he scored a great triumph {{in the title role}} of Gordin's Der Yiddisher King Lear (The Jewish King Lear), set in 19th-century Russia. On the other, until his 50s, he was not hesitant to take advantage of his prowess as a dancer, and even occasionally took on roles that called for some singing, although by all accounts (including his own) this was not his forte.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade. [...] It was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello and was mixed by Brendan O'Brien. When asked about the song {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "It was the most uptempo, radio-friendly song. We all decided it was the right choice to release it as the first single." [...] He went on to describe his expectations when writing songs, saying, [...] "My ultimate goal in writing songs is to connect with people. In the lyrics, you don't <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> picture: You give a road to start on that people can relate to. We're honest, nice guys and I hope that comes across in everything we do." [...] After being asked how he wrote the song in an interview with Launch, Wade explained, [...] "I wrote that song without thinking about what was gonna happen to it and then it just kinda took over from there." [...] He also said in the interview that he wrote [...] "Hanging by a Moment" [...] in about five minutes.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E

500|$|Garfield's biographers {{were unwilling}} to {{exonerate}} him in Crédit Mobilier, with Allan Peskin writing, [...] "Did Garfield lie? Not exactly. Did he tell the truth? Not completely. Was he corrupted? Not really. Even Garfield's enemies never claimed that his involvement... influenced his behavior." [...] Rutkow wrote that [...] "Garfield's real offense was that he knowingly denied to the House investigating committee that he had agreed to accept the stock {{and that he had}} also received a dividend of $329." [...] Caldwell suggested that Garfield [...] "...while he told the truth , certainly failed to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> truth, clearly evading an answer to certain vital questions and thus giving the impression of worse faults than those of which he was guilty." [...] That Crédit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a secret badly kept, even mentioned on the floor of Congress, and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield, in his positions on committees dealing with finance, [...] "...had no more right to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this, than the sentinel has to snore on his post." ...|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{participated in}} the 1963 South Vietnamese coup that deposed Diệm, playing a minor role, {{although}} he {{claimed to be a}} key player. Khánh expected a large reward, but the junta instead sidelined him, excluding him from the twelve-man Military Revolutionary Council. In mid-December he was moved from the II Corps in the central highlands to the command of the I Corps based around Huế and Da Nang in the far north of the Republic of Vietnam. This, it was speculated, was to keep him far away from Saigon in an attempt to stop him from involving himself in politics. This was contrary to Khánh's request for a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, where most of the fighting was taking place. In an interview with journalist Robert Shaplen, Khánh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job. With respect to the 1963 coup that overthrew and killed Diệm, he cryptically commented [...] "It is too soon yet to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story, but someday I will tell it to you". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also reported that Khánh was motivated by a suspicion that Minh's junta knew he was untrustworthy and was going to give him an overseas government post to sideline him completely.|$|E
500|$|However, the Cylinder's {{account of}} Cyrus's conquest clearly does not <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> story, as it {{suppresses}} {{any mention of}} the earlier conflict between the Persians and the Babylonians; Max Mallowan describes it as a [...] "skilled work of tendentious history". The text omits the Battle of Opis, in which Cyrus's forces defeated and apparently massacred Nabonidus's army. Nor does it explain a two-week gap reported by the Nabonidus Chronicle between the Persian entry into Babylon and the surrender of the Esagila temple. Lisbeth S. Fried suggests {{that there may have been}} a siege or stand-off between the Persians and the temple's defenders and priests, about whose fate the Cylinder and Chronicle makes no mention. She speculates that they were killed or expelled by the Persians and replaced by more pro-Persian members of the Babylonian priestly elite. As Walton and Hill put it, the claim of a wholly peaceful takeover acclaimed by the people is [...] "standard conqueror's rhetoric and may obscure other facts." [...] Describing the claim of one's own armies being welcomed as liberators as [...] "one of the great imperial fantasies", Bruce Lincoln, Professor of Divinity at the University of Chicago, notes that the Babylonian population repeatedly revolted against Persian rule in 522 BC, 521 BC, 484 BC and 482 BC (though not against Cyrus or his son Cambeses). The rebels sought to restore national independence and the line of native Babylonian kings – perhaps an indication that they were not as favourably disposed towards the Persians as the Cylinder suggests.|$|E
