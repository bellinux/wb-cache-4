5|$|If {{traditional}} Hunanese customs were adhered to, the baby's {{head would}} have been shaved after four weeks, with a small tuft of hair left on the crown and {{at the nape of}} the neck; it was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the child {{would have been}} officially given its name. According to tradition, visitors probably would have gathered for this ceremony, bringing gifts of money, pork, fish, fruit, and decorated eggs.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and family dynamics. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, already existing character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E
5|$|In Vienna Brand {{was given}} a German {{passport}} {{in the name of}} Eugen Band. He cabled the Jewish Agency in Istanbul to say he was on his way, and arrived by German diplomatic plane on 19 May. Paul Rose writes that Brand had no idea at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the deportations to Auschwitz had already begun.|$|E

2500|$|Seven judges held (two judges dissenting, one leaving <b>this</b> <b>point</b> open) <b>that</b> [...] "there are no {{inherent}} or implied {{limitations on}} the power of amendment under Article 368".|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} through <b>this</b> access <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{we arrived at the}} wider concept of “Trading Zone” {{proposed}} by Peter Galison (Balducci, A. e Mantysalo, R. eds 2013).|$|R
5|$|In pre-Islamic Arabia, a time {{known as}} jahiliyyah, the Kaaba became {{surrounded}} by pagan idols. In 630 CE, Muhammad led his followers from Medina to Mecca, cleansed the Kaaba by destroying all the pagan idols, and then reconsecrated {{the building to}} Allah. In 632 CE, Muhammad performed his only and last pilgrimage {{with a large number}} of followers, and instructed them on the rites of Hajj. It was from <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Hajj became one of the five pillars of Islam.|$|E
5|$|It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the Non-Intervention Committee {{was created}} to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. It also removed {{the need for a}} {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), and had little legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E
5|$|White was {{associated}} with another high profile case, Kitzmiller v. Williams, which involved the belligerent rights of former Confederate soldiers. The case was on appeal from the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, and White argued the case before the United States Supreme Court, securing a favorable verdict. The case was significant as even though hundreds of similar cases had been previously fought, {{it was not until}} <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the rights of former Confederate soldiers were recognized.|$|E
6000|$|A {{number of}} {{emphatic}} nods and [...] "waughs" [...] at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> showed <b>that</b> Okematan {{had at last}} touched a key-note with which his braves could shout in harmony.|$|R
2500|$|Contemporary {{correspondence}} {{shows that}} Coltrane was already known as [...] "Trane" [...] by <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> and <b>that</b> {{the music from}} some 1946 recording sessions had been played for trumpeter Miles Davis—possibly impressing him.|$|R
50|$|The story ends at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> without stating <b>that</b> Peter {{caught the}} fish as Jesus predicted.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Glenn Hughes and Joe Bonamassa {{first met}} at the 2006 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California, after which they jammed {{together}} at Hughes's studio in Hollywood with the idea to make music together in the future. Bonamassa also worked with Jason Bonham that year, when the drummer performed on the guitarist's fifth studio album You & Me {{on the recommendation of}} producer and mutual friend Kevin Shirley. Hughes and Bonamassa reunited three years later in November 2009, performing together at the House of Blues in Los Angeles for Guitar Center. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the two decided to form a band. The idea of enlisting Bonham and keyboardist Derek Sherinian to complete the band's lineup was suggested by Shirley, after a second guitarist was briefly considered instead of a keyboardist.|$|E
50|$|A first {{rebuttal}} to <b>this</b> <b>point</b> suggests <b>that</b> the Lo {{phase of}} the rafts is more tightly packed due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding exhibited between sphingolipids and cholesterol that is not seen elsewhere.|$|R

5|$|In May 1098, Kerbogha of Mosul {{approached}} Antioch {{to relieve}} the siege. Bohemond bribed an Armenian guard named Firouz to surrender his tower, and in June the crusaders entered the city and killed most of the inhabitants. However, {{only a few days}} later the Muslims arrived, laying siege to the former besiegers. According to Raymond D'Aguilers, it was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> a monk named Peter Bartholomew claimed to have discovered the Holy Lance in the city, and although some were skeptical, this was seen as a sign that they would be victorious.|$|E
5|$|It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{the team}} had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, {{who had worked with}} Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who found it to be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|The FAA {{was aware}} at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> {{there was an}} {{emergency}} on board the airplane. By this time, Flight 11 had already crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and Flight 175 was {{known to have been}} hijacked and was within minutes of striking the South Tower. After learning of this second hijacking involving an American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving United Airlines, American Airlines' executive vice president Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline. The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft. At the time the airplane was hijacked, it was flying over an area of limited radar coverage. With air controllers unable to contact the flight by radio, an Indianapolis official declared that the Boeing 757 had possibly crashed at 09:09.|$|E

5000|$|David Drummond, {{senior vice}} {{president}} for corporate development, said [...] "Pulling out of China, shutting down Google.cn, is just not {{the right thing to do}} at <b>this</b> <b>point...</b> but <b>that's</b> exactly what this proposal would do." ...|$|R
5|$|The War Office and the Army were concluding, at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>that</b> light {{tanks were}} a {{liability}} and too vulnerable {{for use in}} further combat, and the Tetrarch {{was considered to be}} obsolete. This decision may have marked the end for the Tetrarch in active service; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall line}} is the geomorphologic break between the upland region of {{relatively}} hard crystalline basement rock and the coastal plain of softer sedimentary rock. The fall line is most prominent when crossed by a river. It is at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> cities developed, because riverboats could not typically travel any farther inland without portaging. In some locations, the rapid change in elevation of the water, and the resulting energy release, made the fall line a good location for water mills, grist mills, and sawmills. Because {{of the need for}} a river port leading to the ocean, and a ready supply of water power, settlements developed where rivers crossed the fall line. In Georgia, the Fall Line extends from Augusta, through Macon, and on to Columbus.|$|E
5|$|Towing two scows at {{the time}} of the collision, Stella Maris responded {{immediately}} to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight the fire with their one small hose and quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) hawser initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) hawser came down. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> the blast occurred.|$|E
6000|$|It was at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> too, <b>that</b> {{the council}} of which we write was held, in order to settle who should have the {{undesirable}} privilege of constituting the [...] "forlorn hope" [...] in their subterranean assault.|$|R

5|$|Transfer {{speculation}} linked Kisnorbo to Wigan Athletic {{at the end}} of the 2005–06 season, but {{he decided}} to extend his stay with Leicester by signing a new three-year contract, less than 12 months after joining the club. Kisnorbo began the 2006–07 season well, scoring two goals and putting in fine rear-guard displays against Coventry City and Southend United, helping the club survive relegation yet again. He was linked with a move to Fulham during the January transfer window. His performance in the 2006–07 season earned him the players' player of the season award from his teammates. It was also at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> he became a fan favourite.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} {{novel of the}} series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (published in America and other {{countries}} as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) opens, {{it is apparent that}} some significant event has taken place in the Wizarding World – an event so very remarkable, even Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it. The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> his magical background begins to be revealed.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} 2004 season opener, the Giants, behind Warner, {{went on to}} win five of their next six games to stand at 5–2. The Giants then lost two close games, to the Bears and Cardinals, to drop to 5–4. It was at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> Coughlin {{announced}} that Eli Manning would become the starter {{for the rest of the}} season. Manning struggled in his first four starts, and the Giants did not score more than 14 points in any game. However, they played better in narrow losses to the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals. The Giants won their final game of the year against rival Dallas, to finish the season 6–10. Top performers on the season included Tiki Barber, who established a personal career high in rushing yardage with 1,518yards, and also contributed 52 catches and 15 touchdowns. Following the season Ron Dayne was released. Dayne had experienced several mediocre seasons while Shaun Alexander, who the Giants bypassed to draft Dayne, had developed into a consistent Pro Bowler.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} 2016's The Forest, David Ehrlich of Slate {{took note}} of its release {{at that time of}} year. [...] "nybody with access to a calendar already knows that The Forest is bad," [...] he wrote. [...] "t <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>that's</b> less of a presumption than it is a tradition." [...] In that vein, playing on the movie's Japanese setting, he likened it to the supposed ancient custom of ubasute in that country, by which elderly people who could no longer care for themselves were purposely abandoned on mountainsides.|$|R
60|$|Ned looked uncommonly knowing at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> and {{admitted}} <b>that</b> he rather thought he could--a dozen of them, if necessary.|$|R
