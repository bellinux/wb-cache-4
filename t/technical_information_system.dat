40|$|ABSTRACT: This Conference is {{concerned}} with the history and the heritage of scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> History is composed of narratives of the past, always multiple and always incomplete. Heritage includes “received ” history, the narratives that are generally known and accepted within the social memory of a community. “The past, ” “history, ” and “heritage ” may, therefore, differ substantially. Emanuel Goldberg (1881 - 1970) pioneered some important <b>technical</b> developments in <b>information</b> storage and retrieval, notably microdots and microfilm retrieval technology, but he remained largely absent from the history and heritage of <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Goldberg’s life and work provides an opportunity to examine the mechanisms through which differences between the past, history, and heritage arise. HISTORY, HERITAGE AND THE PAST This Conference {{is concerned}} with the history and the heritage of scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper will use the life and work of Emanuel Goldberg as a case-study to explore the differences between history, heritage, and the past. It is useful to distinguish between the past, what happened; history, accounts of the past; and heritage, which is those parts of the past that affect us in the present. What is past is passed.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} meet demands {{in the context of}} <b>Technical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> (TIS) {{pertaining}} to reliability, extensibility, maintainability, etc., we have developed an architectural framework with accompanying methodological guidelines for designing such systems. With the framework, we aim at complex multiapplication <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> using a repository to share data among applications. The framework proposes to keep a strict separation between Man-Machine-Interface and Model data, and provides design and implementation support to do this effectively. The framework and methodological guidelines have been developed {{in the context of the}} ESPRIT project IMPRESS. The project also provided for “testing grounds” in the form of a TIS for the Spanish Electricity company Iberdrola. ...|$|R

It was agreed that these efforts were uncoordinated and poorly conceived, and that a clearer understanding of Japanese <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> and a clearer sense of its importance to end users was necessary. That meeting led to formal technology assessments, Congressinal hearings, and legislation; it also helped stimulate several private initiatives in JSTI provision. Four years later there exist better coordinated and better conceived JSTI programs in both the public and private sectors, but there remains much room for improvement. This paper will recount their development and assess future directions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMicrofactories are new {{specific}} and flexible systems {{to produce and}} assemble micrometric products. These systems are different of standard production platforms because they are confronted {{with a lot of}} constraints without influence at human-scale systems. This approach will lead to the development of an architecture of the <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> adapted to a modular, reconfigurable and evolutionary microfactory. In such a context of production of microproducts, the <b>technical</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> is the spinal cord of the microfactory. The definition of the data, their architecture and their organization will build up the base of the control structure.
