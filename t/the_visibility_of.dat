40|$|In conceptualising <b>the</b> new <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> postsecular {{social work}} this thesis {{develops}} alternative perspectives to former secular, liberal and neoliberal hegemonies within the profession. Firstly secularism is considered as compromising deliberative and participatory democracy by inhibiting religious citizenship {{within the public}} sphere and in response <b>the</b> new <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> postsecular social work incorporates the inclusion of religious perspectives into social welfare considerations with particular reference to faith based social action. Secondly liberalism is observed as perpetuating the marginalisation of religion, tolerated merely as a personal lifestyle choice, from public legitimacy and <b>the</b> new <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> postsecular social work therefore recognises the contribution of public religion to addressing social welfare concerns in challenging this marginalisation. Thirdly neoliberalism is critiqued as an outcome of the marginalisation of religion from the public sphere by both secularism and liberalism and accordingly <b>the</b> new <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> postsecular social work engages with political economy {{in the interests of}} social welfare and social justice.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the prevalence and associations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> im-paired <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hepatic veins (HV) on the multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) in cirrhotic patients. Materials and Methods: Eighty-seven consecutive cirrhotic patients undergoing triphasic liver MDCT were enrolled. The patency of the HV {{and the direction}} of the blood flow in the main portal vein, inho-mogeneity of the liver, portal vein thrombosis (PVT), a spontaneous splenorenal shunt, splenic indexes (cm 3), contour abnormalities, and enlargement of the fissure were evaluated. Results: The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impaired <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HV was 38 % in the patients with cirrhosis. No significant associations exist between <b>the</b> impaired <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HV and age (p= 0. 96), sex (p= 0. 14), portal vein thrombosis (p= 0. 29), or splenic indexes (p= 0. 32).

5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular <b>the</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E
