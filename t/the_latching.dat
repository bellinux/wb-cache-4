25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another {{latching}} region would allow for <b>the</b> <b>latching</b> of two input values at the two different outputs. To perform computation, a gate that takes as inputs both serial lines at their respective outputs is added. The gate is placed over a new latching region configured to process data only when both latching regions {{at the end of}} the serial lines hold the values of interest at the same instant. Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, latching regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to latching region 7. At this instant, latching region 7 will let the values latched on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring <b>the</b> <b>latching</b> regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} retaining devices {{which are used}} to latch two elements or parts together and, more particularly, to gate latches for use in locking a gate to a wall bracket in a water pit utilized to store or handle hazardous materials. A retaining latch is provided comprising a latch plate which is rotatably mounted to {{each end of the}} top of the gate and a recessed opening, formed in the gate frame, for engaging an edge of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate. <b>The</b> <b>latch</b> plate is circular in profile with one side cut away or flat, such that <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate is D-shaped. The remaining circular edge of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate comprises steps of successively reduced thickness. The stepped edge of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate fits inside a recessed opening formed in the gate frame. As <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate is rotated, alternate steps of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate are engaged by the recessed opening. When <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate is rotated such that the flat portion of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate faces <b>the</b> recessed opening in the gate frame, there is no connection between the opening and <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate and <b>the</b> gate is unlatched from the gate frame...|$|R
40|$|A load {{regulating}} mechanical latch {{is described}} {{that has a}} pivotally mounted latch element having a hook-shaped end with a strike roller-engaging laterally open hook for engaging a stationary strike roller. <b>The</b> <b>latch</b> element or hook is pivotally mounted in a clevis end of an elongated latch stem that is adapted for axial movement through an opening in a support plate or bracket mounted to a structural member. A coil spring is disposed over and around <b>the</b> extending <b>latch</b> stem and <b>the</b> {{lower end of the}} coil spring engages the support bracket. A thrust washer is removably attached {{to the other end of}} <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> stem and engages the other end of the coil spring and compresses the coil spring thereby preloading the spring and <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> element carried by <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> stem. <b>The</b> hook-shaped <b>latch</b> element has a limited degree of axial travel for loading caused by structural distortion which may change the relative positions of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> element hook and the strike roller. Means are also provided to permit limited tilt of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> element due to loading of the hook...|$|R

50|$|Wear in the {{mechanism}} is focused upon the small contact area of <b>the</b> <b>latch,</b> and <b>the</b> breech {{is difficult to}} seal properly once <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> wears.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{left side}} <b>latch</b> on <b>the</b> SAFER unit became {{unlatched}} during an EVA by astronaut Piers Sellers on STS-121 while testing shuttle repair techniques. <b>The</b> <b>latch</b> had been inadvertently bumped {{and moved to}} the unlatch position. As a precaution, Mike Fossum tethered it to him and the spacewalk continued. In subsequent spacewalks, <b>the</b> <b>latches</b> were secured with Kapton tape, a space-rated form of adhesive tape, to prevent <b>the</b> <b>latches</b> from inadvertently opening. A hard cover is being designed for future missions.|$|R

50|$|A Johnson bar is a {{hand lever}} with several {{distinct}} positions {{and a positive}} <b>latch</b> to hold <b>the</b> lever in the selected position. <b>The</b> <b>latch</b> is typically activated with a spring-loaded squeeze handle on the lever so that only one hand is needed to release <b>the</b> <b>latch,</b> move <b>the</b> lever, then re-engage <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> in a different position.

30|$|The {{assembly}} process of hydrogel units in a fluidic channel {{was carried out}} by intermeshing of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> structure and <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> block. A schematic of the {{assembly process}} is shown in Fig.Â  1 c. First, the hydrogel unit is aligned perpendicular to the direction of the fluidic channel. Then <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> blocks at both ends are fitted to groove and slot structures. <b>The</b> assembled <b>latch</b> blocks in <b>the</b> groove are structurally fixed by slot structures. This geometrical locking between the fluidic channel and the hydrogel unit makes a structural support inside a channel and maintains its condition against the flow.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a high performance, low cost, and double-node-upset (DNU) {{tolerant}} latch design (referred to as HLDUT) {{is proposed}} in 22 nm CMOS technology. <b>The</b> <b>latch</b> mainly {{consists of a}} single-node-upset (SNU) resilient cell and a 3 -input C-element, and the SNU resilient cell mainly constructs from triple mutual feedback 2 -input C-elements, thus <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> is DNU (let alone SNU) tolerant. Using clock gating methodology, high speed transmission path, and fewer transistors, <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> also performs with lower overheads regarding power dissipation, transmission delay, and silicon area.

50|$|The two {{bench seats}} in the rear were {{independently}} removable, and the large three-seat bench could also be installed in the 2nd row location via {{a second set of}} attachment points on the van's floor, ordinarily hidden with snap-in plastic covers.

Setting GRACTL Bit 2 enables <b>the</b> <b>latching</b> of all triggers. Clearing the bit returns the triggers to the unlatched, real-time behavior.|$|E
