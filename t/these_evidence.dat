Lorikeets have also been observed feeding at the flowers, as have insects, including ants, bees, and aphids. Of <b>these,</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests that only birds are effective pollinators. Insects apparently play no role in pollination, since inflorescences do not form follicles when birds are excluded in pollinator exclusion experiments; and pollination by mammals has never been recorded in this species.|$|E

5000|$|Self {{regulating}} private networks: In recent years, transnational {{corporations have}} established partnerships through private networks {{in a variety}} of schemes that encourage self-regulation of industry.

Both of <b>these</b> <b>evidence</b> the importance of NGOs in bringing market actors into the realm of environmental climate governance. Self-regulating private networks have been identified as having the potential to lead to behavioural change that could lead to successful global climate governance.

50|$|Garrett’s {{career as}} a lyricist and {{composer}} was mostly confined to the years 1917-23, and it was concentrated in Chicago, where nearly all of his music was published. (He used variations of his name somewhat indiscriminately: Lloyd F. Garrett, Lloyd Garrett, and occasionally the pseudonym Lloyd Fry.) He is most often noted {{as the author of}} the words to “Dallas Blues” in the form it became known; he also wrote both words and music for a remarkable set of four World War I songs published by Frank K. Root as part of “Songs from the Camps.” <b>These</b> <b>evidence</b> skill and wit, making accomplished use of the emerging language of jazz and playing musically upon ethnic stereotypes. Other songs, like “My Mother” and “Roses of Memory” were designed for his own somewhat elevated style of ballad singing. In 1940 he penned an unpublished campaign song, “Let Dewey Do It,” his last composition.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} collect more evidence, Azuma went to Nanjing and got support from many Nanjing {{citizens}} and the curator of the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, Tsu Cheng-shen. They provided {{a great deal of}} physical evidence to help the Japanese lawyers. <b>These</b> <b>evidence</b> included seven Nanjing maps dated December, 1937 and two aerial photos. They proved that there were three ponds in the areas. Military maps used by the Japanese army during the Battle of Nanjing were among the maps provided. Tsu Cheng-shen also gave a 1.5 meter rail mail bag to the Japanese lawyers which proved that it can hold the victim. Twenty six area residents who lived close to the crime spot in Nanjing then also provided statements that they witnessed similar cruel war crimes committed by the Japanese army soldiers. Shiro Azuma's defense lawyer Nakakita Ryutaro said, [...] "The reason why Shiro Azuma lost the first trial in April is because the trial judge at the Tokyo Area Court has no understanding {{of the history of the}} Nanjing Massacre and was confounded by the right wing group's lies."

40|$|Abstract Background Semantic Web Technology (SWT) {{makes it}} {{possible}} to integrate and search the large volume of life science datasets in the public domain, as demonstrated by well-known linked data projects such as LODD, Bio 2 RDF, and Chem 2 Bio 2 RDF. Integration of these sets creates large networks of information. We have previously described a tool called WENDI for aggregating information pertaining to new chemical compounds, effectively creating evidence paths relating the compounds to genes, diseases and so on. In this paper we examine the utility of automatically inferring new compound-disease associations (and thus new links in the network) based on semantically marked-up versions of <b>these</b> <b>evidence</b> paths, rule-sets and inference engines. Results Through the implementation of a semantic inference algorithm, rule set, Semantic Web methods (RDF, OWL and SPARQL) and new interfaces, we have created a new tool called Chemogenomic Explorer that uses networks of ontologically annotated RDF statements along with deductive reasoning tools to infer new associations between the query structure and genes and diseases from WENDI results. The tool then permits interactive clustering and filtering of <b>these</b> <b>evidence</b> paths. Conclusions We present a new aggregate approach to inferring links between chemical compounds and diseases using semantic inference. This approach allows multiple evidence paths between compounds and diseases to be identified using a rule-set and semantically annotated data, and for <b>these</b> <b>evidence</b> paths to be clustered to show overall evidence linking the compound to a disease.
