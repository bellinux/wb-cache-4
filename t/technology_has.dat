5|$|The {{solar power}} source is via {{photovoltaic}} modules that convert light directly to electricity. However, this differs from, {{and should not be}} confused with concentrated solar power, the other large-scale solar generation technology, which uses heat to drive a variety of conventional generator systems.

5|$|A pair of {{experimental}} atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute of Standards and <b>Technology</b> <b>has</b> {{set a record}} for stability. NIST physicists reported in the August 22, 2013 issue of Science Express that the ytterbium clocks' ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion (1 followed by 18 zeros), roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks.

5|$|Technological adaptations {{have also}} {{utilised}} living beetles as cyborgs. For example, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded project implanted electrodes into adult male Rhinoceros beetles, {{allowing them to}} be remotely controlled via a radio receiver held on its back. Electrical signals delivered via the electrodes command the insect to take off, turn left or right, or hover in midflight. The research was intended to suggest proof-of-concept for surveillance purposes. Similar <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> been applied to the flower beetle Mecynorhina torquata to stimulate different walking gaits and lengths of a live beetle controllable by a human operator.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{has reduced}} as wind turbine <b>technology</b> <b>has</b> improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, {{improvements}} in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance costs {{have continued to}} decline. For example, the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300feet to 400feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been {{increasing the amount of}} wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E

In vitro propagation refers to production of whole plants from cell cultures derived from explants (generally seeds).
