5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave accompanied with a {{low pressure}} system moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335miles (540km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> developed {{into an area}} of low pressure while passing over Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed to develop into a tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy <b>the</b> <b>wave,</b> as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> split in two; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} western coast of Africa on September26, quickly spawning {{an area of}} low pressure. Upon {{the formation of the}} low, <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> split into two pieces and a second area of low pressure developed along the southern portion of <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September28. The southern low attached to <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October8. A broad area of low pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> around 275miles (440kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October13, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear. The low developed enough convection late on October14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435mi (705km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 16. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> axis tracked steadily westward, and on August 23 convection increased after <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. By August 27, <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> axis was located over Cuba, with the area of convection located between Florida and the Bahamas after tracking northwestward. The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5mph (7km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230miles (370km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August8, which subsequently tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean with minimal convection. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> crossed into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August16, at which time convection increased along <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> axis. Three days later, a weak low pressure area formed along <b>the</b> <b>wave,</b> and early on August20 some broad cyclonic turning was evident within the cloud pattern. Gradually, banding features developed around the area of deep convection, and the system was expect to develop further as it moved into an increasingly favorable environment. Convection increased late on August20, although it initially remained disorganized; however, the thunderstorms consolidated near the low, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression by 1200UTC on August21, about 350mi (560km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 7.

Deep convection increased over <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> upon entering the Pacific, and early on August 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E

5|$|On October 7, a {{vigorous}} tropical wave emerged {{off the coast}} of Africa near Cape Verde, and despite semi-favorable conditions, <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> did not develop initially, due to embedded westerlies, which caused <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> to remain disorganized, despite having deep convection.

5|$|On October21, a westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Caribbean. <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> quickly developed organized convection, indicating that a possible low-pressure area had developed along <b>the</b> <b>wave.</b> Continued development {{led to the}} formation of Tropical Depression Twenty-Five (which would later be named Alpha). <b>The</b> <b>wave</b> continued to move towards the west, producing minimal shower and thunderstorm activity. Once in the southwestern Caribbean, <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> slowed, and convection gradually redeveloped on October25. The next day, with continued organization, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated that a tropical depression could develop in the following day or two. At around 18:00UTC, the NHC determined that Tropical Depression Twenty-Six had developed about 105miles (170km) north of the central cost of Panama.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{with minimal}} convection moved {{off the coast}} of Africa near Dakar between August 14 and August 15. It moved westward, and gradually developed thunderstorms across <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> axis. On August 21, while located about 450miles (725km) east of the Lesser Antilles, convection increased further within the system, though unfavorable upper-level wind shear prevented rapid development. It continued to become better organized, and though a Reconnaissance flight into the system reported strong winds, it lacked a surface circulation. Late on August 21 <b>the</b> <b>wave</b> passed through the northern Lesser Antilles, and subsequent to a decrease in wind shear the system became much better organized on August 22. A surface circulation formed, and the system developed into Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 near Saint Croix. Dean was upgraded directly to a tropical storm due to the presence of 50mph (80km/h) winds in the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} strong tropical wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the northwest}} coast of Africa on August15.
