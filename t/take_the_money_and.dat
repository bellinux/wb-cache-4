25|$|Poirot meets Sir Joseph {{and offers}} two alternatives: prosecute the {{criminal}} (whom he doesn't name), {{in which case}} he will lose his money, or just <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> call the case closed. The greedy Sir Joseph agrees to the latter option and takes Poirot's cheque. The detective turns the conversation round to murder cases and tells a rattled Sir Joseph that he reminds him of a Belgian murderer who poisoned his wife to marry his secretary. Poirot's meaning is quite clear and the shaken man gives Poirot his cheque back, telling him to keep the money. Poirot sends {{it back to the}} Misses Carnaby, telling them that it is the final contribution to their fund before it is wound up. Meanwhile, Lady Hoggin tells her relieved husband that her tonic no longer tastes so bitter.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{simultaneously}} with {{the transmission of}} Quatermass II {{in the autumn of}} 1955, Hammer Film Productions released The Quatermass Xperiment, their film adaptation of the first serial. Kneale was not pleased with the film, and particularly disliked the casting of Brian Donlevy as Quatermass, as he explained in a 1986 interview. [...] " [...] was then really on the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle." ...|$|E

500|$|Annie Hall was {{met with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim upon its release. Tim Radford of The Guardian called the film [...] "Allen's most closely focused and daring film to date". The New York Times Vincent Canby preferred Annie Hall to Allen's second directorial effort, <b>Take</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> <b>and</b> Run, since the former is more [...] "humane" [...] while the latter is more a [...] "cartoon". Several critics have compared the film favorably to Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage (1973), including Joseph McBride in Variety, who found it Allen's [...] "most three-dimensional film to date" [...] with an ambition equal to Bergman's best even as the co-stars become the [...] "contemporary equivalent of... Tracy-Hepburn." ...|$|E
500|$|Editor Ralph Rosenblum's first {{assembly}} of the film in 1976 left Brickman disappointed. [...] "I felt that the film was running off in nine different directions," [...] Brickman recalled. [...] "It was like a first draft of a novel... from which two or three films could possibly be assembled." [...] Rosenblum characterized the first cut, at two hours and twenty minutes, as [...] "the surrealistic and abstract adventures of a neurotic Jewish comedian who was reliving his highly flawed life {{and in the process}} satirizing much of our culture... a visual monologue, a more sophisticated and more philosophical version of <b>Take</b> <b>the</b> <b>Money</b> <b>and</b> Run". Brickman found it [...] "nondramatic and ultimately uninteresting, a kind of cerebral exercise." [...] He suggested a more linear narrative.|$|E
500|$|Declared [...] "eyesore of the year" [...] by The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1994, the burned, empty {{tower was}} {{an embarrassment to}} the city {{according}} to an editorial in The Inquirer. The editorial said the feeling only became worse after One Meridian Plaza {{could be seen in}} the background in the film Philadelphia. The fire left the area a commercial void. Nearly every major store in the area closed and property values fell. Neighboring property owners, such as the owner of the damaged buildings behind One Meridian Plaza, were waiting for a decision {{on the future of the}} building before going through with their own development plans. In 1996 the city of Philadelphia sued E/R Partners saying One Meridian Plaza was an environmental hazard and should be demolished or repaired. The city and Mayor Ed Rendell were afraid that when E/R Partners settled with Aetna they would <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> leave the building unfixed.|$|E

500|$|The {{popularity}} of The Quatermass Experiment gained {{the attention of}} the film industry, and Hammer Film Productions quickly purchased the rights to make an adaptation. It was released in 1955, and starred the American actor Brian Donlevy, supported by the English actor Jack Warner, with Val Guest directing and co-writing the screenplay. Nigel Kneale was unhappy with the result, and was especially displeased with the casting of Donlevy as Quatermass. He stated in an interview, [...] " [...] was then really on the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle." [...] The film was titled The Quatermass Xperiment to emphasise its X-certificate status. In America the film was renamed The Creeping Unknown after the title Shock! was considered for that territory, and an alternative opening title sequence with that name was prepared.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E
500|$|The College of Arms {{produced}} two colours for the RLI, with Queen Elizabeth II giving final approval to a Queen's colour and a regimental colour on 15 July 1963. The {{first of these}} was a standard Union Flag design; the unit's name was marked on a circle, which was placed centrally and surmounted by a crown. The second {{was based on a}} dark green background and featured the regimental badge in its centre, surrounded by a wreath of flame lilies, Rhodesia's national flower, and topped, as with the Queen's colour, with the royal crown. The Battalion took part in Operation Zephyr {{during the second half of}} 1963, a counter-intimidation action against political agitators from the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). As with the previous posting to Kariba, little to no action was necessary; it was enough of a deterrent that troops were present. When the Federation broke up on the last day of 1963, members of the Federal Army could transfer to the Southern Rhodesian Army, request a posting to Northern Rhodesia, or leave the military altogether, receiving a monetary [...] "golden handshake" [...] if they chose the last option. So many servicemen chose to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> leave that [...] "only a handful", according to paymaster Lieutenant Paddy Leen, remained in the mess on 31 December 1963. Leen had paid off over 200 RLI men since the start of work on 30 December.|$|E

He also worked as a first assistant director on some TV commercials. [...] "I didn't have a shred of desire in those areas," [...] says Hill of assistant directing. [...] "I wanted to work and be around films. I certainly took my duties fairly seriously and all that. I didn't {{see it as a}} long term kind of commitment." ...|$|E
