5|$|As {{early as}} 1926, Meyer {{had written to}} Irène Joliot-Curie {{suggesting}} that Rona work with her to learn how his laboratory could make their own polonium samples. Once Hans Pettersson was able to secure funds to pay Rona's expenses, Joliot-Curie allowed her <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> study polonium separation at the Curie Institute in Paris. Rona developed an enhanced method of preparing polonium sources and producing alpha-emissions.(α-emission). Gaining recognition as {{an expert in the}} field, she took those skills back to the Radium Institute along with a small disc of polonium. This disc allowed Rona to create lab specimens of polonium, which were used in much of the Institute's subsequent research.|$|E

5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E

In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and would not be able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.|$|E

Before he reached the town of Polytsaravos, his army of 8,000 Egyptians was delayed by Theodoros Stathakos and his family of thirteen men who refused to let the invaders past their tower. Bosinas tried to negotiate with Stathakos. Stathakos, feigning surrender, told Bosinas <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> take his family's guns. As Bosinas came to retrieve the guns, the Stathakos family killed him. In retaliation, the Egyptians used their two cannons and blew up the tower.|$|E

Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior.

5|$|Anselm stuck {{firmly to}} {{the letter of the}} papal decree, despite Henry's {{attempts}} to persuade him to give way in return for a vague assurance of a future royal compromise. Matters escalated, with Anselm going back into exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution. A distinction was drawn between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained the custom of requiring them <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> do homage for the temporalities, the landed properties they held in England. Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.|$|E
