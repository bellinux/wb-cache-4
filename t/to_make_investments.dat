5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the market size and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its market size will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>investments</b> in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance should be given to promoting exports.|$|E
25|$|Outward {{foreign direct}} {{investment}} is a new feature of Chinese globalization, where local Chinese firms seek <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>investments</b> in both developing and developed countries. It was reported in 2011 that there was increasing investment by capital rich Chinese firms in promising firms in the United States. Such investments offer access to expertise in marketing and distribution potentially useful in exploiting the developing Chinese domestic market.|$|E
25|$|The Alaska Constitution {{was written}} {{so as to}} {{discourage}} dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing {{during the time of}} its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs. Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>investments</b> within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.|$|E

30|$|Developing a {{model for}} {{predicting}} returns in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>investment</b> decisions is an important goal for academics and practitioners. Typically, the financial services industry relies on three main approaches <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>investment</b> decisions: the fundamental approach that uses fundamental economic principles to form portfolios, the TA approach, and the mathematical approach {{that is based on}} mathematical models (Leigh et al. [2002]). The first two approaches dominate practice because of their applicability; however, our paper focuses on TA approach. Blanchet-Scalliet et al. ([2007]), from the perspective of mathematical models, justify this very well and say it is impossible to specify and calibrate mathematical models that can capture all the sources of parameter instability during a long time interval if one considers a non-stationary economy.|$|R

However, by 1961 its aims had changed significantly and the plan had evolved into one which prioritised automobile transportation and began lifting sections of railway - an act which was put to an end following a series of strikes by railway workers in opposition to the plan. Later governments between 1967 and 1971 then continued investing in the railways and enacted modernisation plans, renewing much of the rolling stock and the railways continued to function well.|$|E

This disallows US persons from participating in any product which may contain US investment products. If a financial institution {{is not able to}} segregate non-US investments from other investment products, a bank may place a total ban upon US persons using their investment products. Since non-US institutions located outside the USA cannot acquire sufficient competence of US law, non-US institutions often find no exemption allowing resident US persons to purchase any financial products from their institution.|$|E

25|$|With {{the coming}} of the railways, the proprietors sought to lease the canal to a railway company in 1860. After a Bill to {{authorise}} the arrangement with the London and North Western Railway was defeated in the House of Lords in 1863, it was reintroduced the following year, and became an Act of Parliament on 29 July 1864. The canal company then received £12,665.87 per year for the lease of the northern end of the canal, which allowed them to continue paying dividends and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>investments.</b> Eventually, the railway company offered to buy the canal, and this was formalised by an Act of Parliament obtained on 16 July 1885, although they actually took over the canal on 1 July.|$|E
25|$|After two years, Congress {{had still}} not acted to {{establish}} a permanent Pennsylvania Avenue Commission, so President Johnson issued Executive Order 11347 to {{extend the life of}} the Temporary Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue by another two years. The lack of redevelopment began to have repercussions for existing businesses on the avenue. Faced with repeated threats to its existence and lower occupancy due to competition and anti-Vietnam War protests on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Willard Hotel closed suddenly on July 15, 1968. The Temporary Commission struggled to obtain any redevelopment along Pennsylvania Avenue. Local landowners refused <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>investments</b> so long as their property remained subject to condemnation. The Temporary Commission subsequently scaled the size of National Plaza down to half its original size, and began seeking private development dollars to build the square and associated buildings. In October 1969, still stymied by the lack of movement on any redevelopment, the Temporary Commission agreed (at the urging of member Elwood R. Quesada, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the L'Enfant Plaza Corporation) to seek $200 million in private financing to build several luxury apartment buildings {{on the north side of}} Pennsylvania Avenue. The Temporary Commission ceased to function on November 15, 1969, due to lack of funds.|$|E
25|$|Gaylord Broadcasting {{management}} eventually decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>investments</b> {{to expand}} the station's news operations. On August 20, 1990, KTVT began producing two long-form, half-hour prime time newscasts at 7:00 and 9:00p.m., airing only on Monday through Friday nights; the latter of the two programs was the first newscast to be offered by a commercial television station in the Metroplex in the 9:00 time slot (predating rival KDFW's addition of its own late evening newscast in that hour when it switched from CBS to Fox in July 1995, {{and the formation of}} KDAF's news department with the debut of its own 9:00p.m. newscast in 1999; PBS member station KERA-TV (channel 13) previously carried a newscast at 9:00p.m. from 1970 to 1976). Debuting under the umbrella title Newswatch 11, the newscasts were initially anchored by Mike Hambrick (whose brother, Judd, had previously served as anchor at KDFW from 1972 to 1973) and Midge Hill (who joined KTVT after a five-year stint as an anchor/reporter at WFAA), alongside chief meteorologist Bob Goosmann and sports director Bobby Estill. The 7:00p.m. newscast – the first attempt in the Metroplex at a local newscast in that timeslot since KRLD-TV/KDAF produced a one-hour news program at 7:00 from July 1984 until that station's initial news department was shut down by then-general manager Ray Schonbak in May 1986, following the completion of its purchase by News Corporation – struggled against prime time network programs on KDFW, KXAS and WFAA, and was cancelled in September 1992.|$|E

500|$|Private {{equity in}} the 1980s was a {{controversial}} topic, commonly associated with corporate raids, hostile takeovers, asset stripping, layoffs, plant closings and outsized profits to investors. [...] As private equity reemerged in the 1990s it began to earn a new degree of legitimacy and respectability. [...] Although in the 1980s, many of the acquisitions made were unsolicited and unwelcome, private equity firms in the 1990s focused on making buyouts attractive propositions for management and shareholders. [...] According to The Economist, “ig companies that would once have turned up their noses at an approach from a private-equity firm are now pleased {{to do business with}} them.” Additionally, private equity investors became increasingly focused on the long term development of companies they acquired, using less leverage in the acquisition. [...] In the 1980s leverage would routinely represent 85% to 95% of the purchase price of a company as compared to average debt levels between 20% and 40% in leveraged buyouts in the 1990s and {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. [...] KKR's 1986 acquisition of Safeway, for example, was completed with 97% leverage and 3% equity contributed by KKR, whereas KKR's acquisition of TXU in 2007 was completed with approximately 19% equity contributed ($8.5 billion of equity out of a total purchase price of $45 billion).

The government often neglects subsistence farmers and rural areas in general. The more remote and underdeveloped the area the less likely the government will be to effectively meet its needs.
