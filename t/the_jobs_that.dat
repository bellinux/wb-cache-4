25|$|By the 1920s Winter Carnaval {{celebrations}} were abandoned, and Summer Carnaval {{remained the}} only Carnaval in Santiago de Cuba. On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays {{during the month}} of June, everyone in Cuba knew one could go to Santiago to party. The major patrons of these summer festivities were local industries: Polar, La Cristal and Hatuey beers; Bacardi rum; and Eden tobacco. Many of the participants in Summer Carnaval were the newly unemployed sugar and coffee workers, who were quite willing to remain in Santiago after the harvest and work for their commercial patrons in <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> the festival season created. This combination- the unemployed and the commercial sponsor- contributed to the popularity of Summer Carnaval. During the 1940s and early 50s, Carnaval in both Santiago de Cuba and Havana became more commercialized.|$|E

2500|$|Barron, {{appearing}} on the Fox network television program The O'Reilly Factor in April, 2006, stated that opposition to present-day immigration involves skin color. He argued that Germans, Jews, Poles, Greeks, and Italians who immigrated to the United States during the late 19th century were welcomed {{because of the color}} of their skin. In contrast, [...] "All of a sudden when the complexion of immigration changes, now it's 'these people'." [...] He stated to host Bill O'Reilly that the original European immigrants had received preferential treatment: [...] "They had enough black people here already that were skilled and couldn't get <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> your people [...] were able to get."

2500|$|In 2008, however, Conservative {{politician}} Sayeeda Warsi {{stated that}} a future Conservative government would ban khat. Following lobbying by Somali community groups, in July 2013 {{it was announced}} that khat was to be classified as a class C drug and therefore banned. Khat was officially made illegal in the UK in June 2014. This move was welcomed by some Somali groups, and the Home Office minister responsible for overseeing the ban stated: [...] "We took the decision based on the strong views of the Somali community, particularly the mums and wives. They felt that khat was stopping the Somali community from integrating; it was distracting the husbands and sons from getting the education and <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> their wives and mothers desperately wanted them to get". Criticising the ban, however, the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee stated that it [...] "was based not on any evidence of medical or social harm caused by its consumption, but by a desire to avoid the UK becoming a hub for the illegal importation of khat into other EU countries".|$|E

He said that even Malaysia allow any refugees to stay there, the UNHCR should not taking any advantage of Malaysia's compassion to allowing them there, instead {{it is time for}} the United Nations to send the refugees to another third-world nation. The minister also reminded that even if Malaysia is seen as an attractive country for the refugees to taking up <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> locals did not want to take it due to dangerous, dirty or demeaning nature, both the refugees and the migrant workers should not just take the law into their own hands when in Malaysia.

2500|$|Overall, assistive {{technology}} aims {{to allow people}} with disabilities to [...] "participate more fully {{in all aspects of}} life (home, school, and community)" [...] and increases their opportunities for [...] "education, social interactions, and potential for meaningful employment". It creates greater independence and control for disabled individuals. For example, in one study of 1,342 infants, toddlers and preschoolers, all with some kind of developmental, physical, sensory, or cognitive disability, the use of {{assistive technology}} created improvements in child development. These included improvements in [...] "cognitive, social, communication, literacy, motor, adaptive, and increases in engagement in learning activities". [...] It has been found to lighten caregiver load. [...] Both family and professional caregivers benefit from assistive technology. The time needed caring for a patient significantly decreases for a family member or friend with the use of assistive technology. Studies show that care time for a professional caregiver increases when assistive technology is used, however their work load is significantly easier with assistive technology taking over some of <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> a care giver would have to provide.|$|E

2500|$|After this, Jimmy's sidekick, Guillermo, {{appeared}} in a spoof of The Bourne Ultimatum, which starred Damon. He was then chased down by Damon, who was cursing about Kimmel being behind all this. Guillermo also stopped Damon {{on the red carpet}} one time and before he could finish the interview he said, [...] "Sorry, we are out of time." [...] The most recent encounter was titled [...] "The Handsome Men's Club" [...] which featured Kimmel, along with the [...] "Handsome Men", who were: Matthew McConaughey, Rob Lowe, Lenny Kravitz, Patrick Dempsey, Sting, Keith Urban, John Krasinski, Ethan Hawke, Josh Hartnett, Tony Romo, Ted Danson, Taye Diggs, Gilles Marini, and Ben Affleck, speaking about being handsome and all <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> come with it.

2500|$|Hurt cosponsored the Balanced Budget Amendment, {{which did}} not pass the House of Representatives in November 2011. Hurt said of the bill, “By passing a Balanced Budget Amendment, Congress will be {{required}} to spend no more than it takes in, reining in out of control spending once and for all” Hurt also sponsored the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act that would exempt private equity funds advisers from certain registration and reporting standards. In July, 2011 Hurt sponsored the Market Transparency and Taxpayer Protection Act which would “protect the taxpayers of the United States by requiring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to sell or dispose of the assets of such enterprises that are not critical to their missions.” [...] However, because very little political leverage was used to pass this legislation, it most likely will die in committee. Hurt’s position on Government regulation is clear in his statement that “By reducing the unnecessary government regulations that hinder small businesses, keeping taxes low and allowing people to keep more of what they make, and cutting spending to get our fiscal house in order, the private sector will gain the confidence necessary to expand and create <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> the people of the 5th District need and deserve.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-one {{pairs of}} {{organizers}} were put through a special {{course in the}} Denver [...] office and then sent into the Southern Field. Their operation was simple, but effective. One member of each team {{was known as the}} active organizer; the other was the passive organizer. The so-called active organizer moved into the open and was known to everyone... as an organizer. His passive team-mate posed as a miner looking for work. He cussed the unions and their leadership, and obtained a job in the heavily guarded mines. He made friends with officers of the company and, where possible, hired out as a coal company spotter... Once the passive organizer was installed in the mine, his active team mate sought new members in that mine. If a miner joined, the active organizer kept the man's membership secret and sent his card directly to the Denver office... If a working miner refused to join, his name was sent to the passive organizer who immediately reported to the company that John Cotino had joined the union. The result was always the same. The company sent John Cotino packing... In this manner a constant stream of anti-union and non-union men, the confirmed strike breakers and scabs, were kept streaming [...] The companies unwittingly sent the faithful out, while the active organizer sent carefully coached men of union affiliation to apply for <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> had to be filled.|$|E

2500|$|A rich local landowner, {{generally}} {{thought to}} be a “queer creature” and described in Chapter One as having the appearance of “a huge sack of flour”. Lezhnev is about thirty years old, and seldom visits Dar’ya Mikhailovna (more often than before as the novel progresses), but is often found at Aleksandra’s Pavlovna Lipina’s house; he is friends both with her and her brother, Sergei. He was orphaned at the age of seventeen, lived at his aunt’s and studied together with Rudin at Moscow University, where they were members of the same group of intellectual young men and was good friends with him; he also knew him abroad, but began to dislike him there as “Rudin struck [...] in his true light.” Lezhnev is in fact in love with Aleksandra and in the end marries her. His character is often contrasted to Rudin’s as he is seen as everything a superfluous man is not – he is intelligent, but in a more practical way, and while he does not do anything exceptional, he doesn’t want to either. Seeley writes, that “he concentrates on doing <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> lie to hand – running his estate, raising a family – and these he does very competently. Beyond them he does not look.” Lezhnev also acts as Rudin’s biographer – {{he is the one who}} tells the reader about Rudin’s life prior to his appearance at Dar’ya Mikhailovna’s. He first describes Rudin in extremely unfavourable terms, but in the end he is also the one who admits Rudin's “genius” in certain areas of life.|$|E
