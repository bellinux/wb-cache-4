5|$|Dental {{sealants}} {{are another}} preventive therapy {{often used to}} provide a barrier to bacteria and decay {{on the surface of}} teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in an procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.|$|E
5|$|ECTunes is {{developing}} a system that utilizes directional sound equipment to emit noise when {{and where it is}} needed. According to the company, its technology sends audible signals only in the direction of travel, thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E

25|$|Cannabis use has {{increased}} dramatically {{over the past few}} decades whereas the rate of psychosis has not increased. Together, these findings suggest that cannabis use may hasten the onset of psychosis in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> already be predisposed to psychosis. High-potency cannabis use indeed seems to accelerate the onset of psychosis in predisposed patients. A 2012 study concluded that cannabis plays an important role in the development of psychosis in vulnerable individuals, and that cannabis use in early adolescence should be discouraged.|$|E
25|$|The graph {{excludes}} {{those who}} have only some Irish ancestry. Historian and journalist Louis-Guy Lemieux claims that about 40% of Quebecers have Irish ancestry {{on at least one}} side of their family tree. Shunned by Protestant English-speakers, it was not uncommon for Catholic Irish to settle among and intermarry with the Catholic French-speakers. Considering that many other Canadians throughout Canada likewise have Irish roots, in addition to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> simply identify as Canadian, the total number of Canadians with some Irish ancestry extrapolated would include a significant proportion of the Canadian population.|$|E

25|$|People {{who care}} for those {{infected}} with Ebola should wear protective clothing including masks, gloves, gowns and goggles. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that the protective gear leaves no skin exposed. These measures are also recommended for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> handle objects contaminated by an infected person's body fluids. In 2014, the CDC began recommending that medical personnel receive training on the proper suit-up and removal of personal protective equipment (PPE); in addition, a designated person, appropriately trained in biosafety, should be watching each step of these procedures to ensure they are done correctly. In Sierra Leone, the typical training period {{for the use of}} such safety equipment lasts approximately 12 days.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 2002, the Sunday Times printed {{an extract}} {{of a speech}} made by Minister of State for Health, Balaji Sadasivan, an ethnically Indian {{neurosurgeon}} who was fluent in Mandarin. He said, 'Research has also shown that the brain of homosexuals is structurally different from heterosexuals. It is likely therefore that the homosexual tendency is imprinted in the brain in utero and homosexuals must live with the tendencies that they inherit {{as a result of}} the structural changes in their brain. Within the moral and cultural constraints of our society, we should be tolerant of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> be different from most of us.' This was the first time a Cabinet Minister had publicly quoted scientific findings about homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing {{his face with}} a wide-brimmed hat, he {{systematically}} searched the parking lot, the train station and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway {{at the back of the}} building, where a locked door had prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after and held her in her arms.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{format for}} {{contemporary}} Let's Play videos is vague, {{and at times}} may be compared or considered {{the same as a}} player completing a game via streaming video for an audience. According to Patrick Lee of The A.V. Club, a good Let's Play video distinguishes itself from straightforward streaming playthroughs when the player has sufficiently familiarized themselves with the game as to be able to offer better commentary and show off more of the game to their audience, is able to provide the audience with personal recollections about the game, or can play through a game they have already completed under self-imposed challenges, such as completing a game without killing any enemy. Through this approach, Lee states, such Let's Play videos serve to help memorialize these games, helping <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> not have access to the titles (due to age or regional restrictions) to appreciate more obscure games.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>may</b> not have the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E
