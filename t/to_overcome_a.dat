5|$|Adventure was {{conceived}} as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure Colossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>a</b> variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E
5|$|Chester Alan Arthur (October5, 1829– November18, 1886) was an American {{attorney}} and politician {{who served as}} the 21st President of the United States from 1881 to 1885; he succeeded James A. Garfield upon the latter's assassination. At the outset, Arthur struggled <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>a</b> slightly negative reputation, which stemmed from his early career in politics as part of New York's Republican political machine. He succeeded by embracing the cause of civil service reform. His advocacy for, and subsequent enforcement of, the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act was the centerpiece of his administration.|$|E

5|$|Part of modern-day Route311 was {{originally}} the Philipstown Turnpike, a road built in 1815 <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>a</b> lack of transportation when the Hudson River froze {{during the winter}} months. The turnpike was a large business center for the county, though it was abandoned due to insufficient tolls to maintain it. Another section was constructed in the early 1900s, from the Patterson Baptist Church near the modern-day intersection of Route311 and Route164 to the Village of Patterson, {{by a group of}} Italian immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate {{to display}} to females, has been {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and gamete release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be done by a female <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>a</b> territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.|$|E
5|$|McDonald {{also felt}} the {{pressure}} of having to replace two popular ex-Flames in MacMillan and Lever while also working <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>a</b> separated shoulder he suffered {{earlier in the year}} with the Rockies. He made his debut with the Flames the following night, a 7–1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, after which McDonald remarked that it was the most fun he had playing the game in a long time. He was given a loud ovation by the fans who immediately embraced him as a local hero, even though it took him seven games before he scored his first goal {{as a member of the}} Flames. He scored 34goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.|$|E

5|$|Ruth {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. He played shortstop and pitched the last two innings of a 15–9 victory. In his second at-bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right field; the blast was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by Jim Thorpe in Fayetteville. Ruth made first appearance against a team in organized baseball in an exhibition game versus the major-league Philadelphia Phillies. Ruth pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down and pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In {{a game against the}} Phillies the following afternoon, Ruth entered during the sixth inning and did not allow a run the rest of the way.
