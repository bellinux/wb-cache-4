30|$|A general {{analysis}} of data compiled in Table  1 reveals that fluidized and fixed-bed reactors are more usual in gasification procedures. The variable more studied is temperature, where it is seen that at high temperature the energy production and the syngas quality increases, beyond that decrease the <b>tars</b> <b>production.</b> The particle size and the moisture have a significant influence in the gasification process, but if the particle size is reduced the syngas production increases and at high moisture contents the efficiency of gasification decrease.|$|R

The tars are then fed into the second step where a portion of the char from the first step is used as a bed material in a 0. 3 : 1 wt% ratio. This bed is heated up by microwaves up to 800 °C, allowing thermal cracking of tars and additional syngas (> 90 vol% H 2 + CO) being then produced. This new concept arises as an alternative technology to the gasification of biowastes for producing syngas with no need for catalysts or gasifying reagents to minimise <b>tars</b> <b>production.</b> The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under Grant Agreement No. 311815 (SYNPOL project).

Since then, Western Canada’s conventional oil production from wells has declined steadily and today is less than half that in 1973. The new Atlantic Ocean production will offset Western Canada’s future oil decline. By 2020, Newfoundland’s offshore conventional crude is expected to equal Western Canada’s production of some 360, 000 B/D (barrels per day).

Options to augment liquid fuel supplies in the United States have once again begun {{to focus on}} oil shale as long-term source of reliable, affordable, and secure oil. The United States government has long recognized the strategic potential of the nation’s vast oil shale resources to support national security. President Taft in 1912 established an Office of Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves and charged that office with ensuring oil for naval military operations.

A study of sewage sludge gasification process in a bubbling fluidised bed gasifier on a laboratory scale is here reported. The aim was to find the optimum conditions for reducing the production of tars and gain more information on the influx of different operating variables in the products resulting from the gasification of this waste. The variables studied were the equivalence ratio (ER), the steam-biomass ratio (SB) and temperature.

About 40 % of the world’s total supply of energy, and 95 % of the energy used in the transportation industry comes from oil and with global consumption of oil increasing to record highs, and conventional sources of oil dwindling, this makes unconventional sources of oil like the tar sands seem more economically appealing.
