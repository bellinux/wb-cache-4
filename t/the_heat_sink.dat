NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E
25|$|When the {{air flow}} through <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> decreases, {{this results in}} an {{increase}} in the average air temperature. This in turn increases <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> base temperature. And additionally, the thermal resistance of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> will also increase. The net result is a higher heat sink base temperature.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{convection}} requires {{free flow}} of air over <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> If fins are not aligned vertically, or if fins are too close together to allow sufficient air flow between them, the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> will decline.|$|E

40|$|Performance {{analysis}} of double-layer microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> was performed under non-uniform heating conditions having randomly distributed hotspots. Two parallel-channel (parallel-flow and counter-flow) and one cross-channel (transverse-flow) designs of double-layer <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> were evaluated with {{three sets of}} heating schemes. Each set of heating scheme consisted of eleven randomly distributed hotspots generated by Latin hypercube sampling. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> flux, area, and location of the hotspots were selected as the design parameters. Conjugate heat transfer {{analysis of}} <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> was performed by solving three-dimensional Navier–Stokes and energy equations.

The thermal resistance, pressure drop, maximum temperature rise, and temperature variation among hotspots were evaluated for all <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sinks.</b> <b>The</b> transverse-flow microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> exhibited <b>the</b> lowest thermal resistance, temperature rise and temperature variation among the hotspots throughout the specified range of flow rate.

25|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that concerns}} the thermal conductivity of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> material is spreading resistance. Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy {{is transferred from}} a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a heat sink, this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> base. The spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how the heat travels from the heat source location and causes a large temperature gradient between the heat source and the edges of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if the heat source were uniform across the base of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> This nonuniformity increases the heat sink's effective thermal resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{flow rate}} can be {{determined}} by the intersection of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> system curve and the fan curve. <b>The</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> system curve can be calculated by the flow resistance of the channels and inlet and outlet losses as done in standard fluid mechanics text books, such as Potter, et al. and White.|$|E
25|$|The {{inlet air}} {{temperature}} relates strongly with <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> base temperature. For example, if there is recirculation of air in a product, the {{inlet air temperature}} is not the ambient air temperature. The inlet air temperature of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> is therefore higher, which also results in a higher heat sink base temperature.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{experimentally}} investigates <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> transfer {{enhancement of}} a microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> subject to an impinging jet. In order {{to evaluate the}} cooling performance of <b>the</b> microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> subject to an impinging jet, temperature distributions are measured by using a micro-thermal sensor array manufactured through simple and convenient microfabrication processes. Based on these experimental results, the thermal resistance of <b>the</b> microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> subject to an impinging jet is obtained and compared with the thermal resistance as calculated numerically.

25|$|Epoxy is more {{expensive}} than tape, but provides a greater mechanical bond between <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> and component, as well as improved thermal conductivity. The epoxy chosen must be formulated for this purpose. Most epoxies are two-part liquid formulations that must be thoroughly mixed before being applied to <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> and before <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> {{is placed on the}} component. The epoxy is then cured for a specified time, which can vary from 2 hours to 48 hours. Faster cure time can be achieved at higher temperatures. The surfaces to which the epoxy is applied must be clean and free of any residue.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{enhancement}} of <b>heat</b> transfer from a discrete heat source in confined air jet impingement was experimentally investigated. A variety of pin-fin <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> were mounted on <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source and <b>the</b> resulting enhancement studied.

25|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} {{the performance of a}} heat sink is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory. One such method has been published by Jeggels, et al., though this work is limited to ducted flow. Ducted flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> This makes sure that all the air goes through the channels formed by the fins of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> When the air flow is not ducted, a certain percentage of air flow will bypass <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> Flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance, while remaining relatively insensitive to inlet duct velocity.|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{tests are}} one of the more popular ways to {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> thermal performance.

Vendor-supplied data is commonly provided for ducted test results. However, the results are optimistic and can give misleading data when heat sinks are used in an unducted application.

40|$|The {{problem of}} free {{convection}} fluid flow and heat transfer {{in a square}} cavity with a flush mounted heat source on its bottom wall and two <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> on its vertical side walls has been investigated numerically. Via changing the location of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sinks,</b> six different arrangements have been generated. The cavity was filled with Cu-water nanofluid. The governing equations were discretized using the finite volume method and SIMPLER algorithm. Using the developed code, a parametric study was undertaken, and effects of Rayleigh number, arrangements of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> and volume fraction of the nanoparticles on fluid flow and <b>heat</b> transfer inside <b>the</b> cavity were investigated.

While a <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> is a static object, a fan often aids a <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> by providing increased airflow over <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink—thus maintaining a larger temperature gradient by replacing the warmed air more quickly than passive convection achieves alone—this is known as a forced-air system.|$|R
25|$|A strong {{magnetic}} field {{is applied to}} the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered entropy.

25|$|For {{semiconductor}} devices {{used in a}} variety of consumer and industrial electronics, the idea of thermal resistance simplifies the selection of heat sinks. The heat flow between the semiconductor die and ambient air is modeled as a series of resistances to heat flow; there is a resistance from the die to the device case, from the case to <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> and from <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> to the ambient air. The sum of these resistances is the total thermal resistance from the die to the ambient air. Thermal resistance is defined as temperature rise per unit of power, analogous to electrical resistance, and is expressed in units of degrees Celsius per watt (°C/W). If the device dissipation in watts is known, and the total thermal resistance is calculated, the temperature rise of the die over the ambient air can be calculated.|$|E
