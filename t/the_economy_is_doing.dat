This is termed [...] "the wealth effect" [...] (compare income effect), and is generally attributed to psychological feelings of confidence - one feels rich, so one spends. The significance of the wealth effect is debated; it is generally procyclical, meaning that when <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> well, asset prices increase, causing consumers to spend more, which provides further stimulus to the economy and risks causing overheating. Conversely, if <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> poorly, asset prices fall and consumers spend less, leading to a vicious cycle and potentially a depression.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} explanations of voting behaviour is based on economic factors: when <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> well, voters reward the incumbent government and when <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> badly, voters punish the incumbent. This reward-punishment model is thought to be particularly appropriate at second order contests such as European Parliament elections. Yet operationalising this economic voting model using citizens’ perceptions of economic performance may suffer from endogeneity problems if citizens’ perceptions are in fact a function of their party preferences rather than being a cause of their party preferences. Thus, this article models a ‘strict’ version of economic voting in which they purge citizens’ economic perceptions of partisan effects and only use as a predictor of voting that portion of citizens’ economic perceptions that is caused by the real world economy. Using data on voting at the 2004 European Parliament elections for 23 European Union electorates, the article finds some, but limited, evidence for economic voting that is dependent on both voter sophistication and clarity of responsibility for the economy within any country. First, only politically sophisticated voters’ subjective economic assessments are in fact grounded in economic reality. Second, the portion of subjective economic assessments that {{is a function of the}} real world economy is a significant predictor of voting only in single party government contexts where there can be a clear attribution of responsibility. For coalition government contexts, the article finds essentially no impact of the real economy via economic perceptions on vote choice, at least at European Parliament election...|$|E

40|$|Posted by Christian Hilber and Paul Cheshire, SERC and LSE QuantitativeEasing (QE) {{has been}} pursued by Central Banks in many countries, few more {{diligently}} {{than in the}} US and in the UK. Reports from experienced watchers of commercial real estate suggest this could generate a flood of cheap money – not into productive investment but into the higher yields offered by commercial real estate or its liquid versions, Real Estate Investment Trusts. This is because QE pushes yields on bonds and securities ever further below the rate of inflation. Such shifts are already said to be visible in the US where <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> just a bit better than in the UK or Europe. Of course this pushes down yields in real estate in proportion to pushing up market values. According to the FT (£) there could already be signs of this in London...|$|E

40|$|Using Canadian {{time use}} data, we exploit {{exogenous}} variation in local unemployment rates {{to investigate the}} cyclical nature of sleep time and show that {{for both men and}} women, sleep time decreases when <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> relatively better. Our results suggest that in a recession Canadians sleep an average of 2 hours and 34 minutes more per week, or 22 minutes more per day. Given the importance of even small changes in sleep time on measures of cognitive functioning such as reaction time and concentration, our findings may help explain the countercyclical nature of mortality. Further, as we find that sleep is affected by the same economic variables (notably the unemployment rate) that affect market work time, our results also contribute to the limited literature that shows that sleep time should not be treated as exogenously determined, but, like any other resource, determined by its relative cost.

40|$|The most {{difficult}} problem facing monetary policymakers {{results from the}} long and variable lags in monetary policy's impact on the economy.
