Although intended {{to be capable of}} flying at <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds,</b> the CF-103 only proffered a moderate increase in performance and capability over the CF-100; subsequently, the aircraft never progressed beyond the mock-up stage.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds,</b> and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E

25|$|On 15 February 1956, WG777, {{the second}} Delta 2, {{performed}} its maiden flight from RAF Boscombe Down; piloted by Twiss, the aircraft proceeded to reach <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds</b> during this first flight. Following the final contractor check flight on 14 April 1956, WG777 was formally accepted, upon {{which it was}} assigned to the RAE's high-speed research programme, conducting measurement, stability and handling research. In September 1956, both aircraft performed flight displays at the Farnborough Airshow in Hampshire. The Delta 2 was typically used to conduct a multitude of tests including aerodynamics characteristics, handling, and stability performance.|$|E
25|$|It was an {{all-metal}} aircraft with a {{tricycle undercarriage}} and conventional low, straight wings with mid-mounted turbojet engines and a high-mounted tailplane {{clear of the}} jet exhaust. The Meteor F.1 exhibited some problematic flying characteristics typical of early jet aircraft; it suffered from stability problems at high <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds,</b> large trim changes, high stick forces and self-sustained yaw instability (snaking) caused by airflow separation over the thick tail surfaces. The longer fuselage of the Meteor T.7, a two-seater trainer, significantly reduced the aerodynamic instability that the early Meteors were known for.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 21 B.2 {{aircraft}} were upgraded to the B.2R standard with Conway RCo.17 engines ( [...] thrust) and facilities {{to carry a}} Blue Steel stand-off nuclear missile. Their wings were modified to incorporate two [...] "speed pods" [...] or [...] "Küchemann carrots". These were anti-shock bodies; bulged fairings that reduced wave drag at <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds</b> (see area rule), which were also used as a convenient place to house chaff dispensers. Handley Page proposed to build a further refined [...] "Phase 6" [...] Victor, with more fuel and capable of carrying up to four Skybolt (AGM-48) ballistic missiles on standing airborne patrols, but this proposal was rejected although {{it was agreed that}} some of the Victor B.2s on order would be fitted to carry two Skybolts. This plan was abandoned when the U.S. cancelled the whole Skybolt programme in 1963. With the move to low-level penetration missions, the Victors were fitted with air-to-air refuelling probes above the cockpit and received large underwing fuel tanks.|$|E

This harmful vibration can bring damage or failure to the electronic equipment fixed in aircraft. It is necessary to predict the structural dynamic response in the design course. This paper presents a new numerical algorithm and scheme to solve the structural dynamics responses when considering fluid–structure interaction (FSI). Numerical simulation for a free-flying structural model in <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> is completed. Results show that the small elastic deformation of the structure can greatly affect the FSI. The FSI vibration tests are carried out in a <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> wind-tunnel for checking numerical theory and algorithms, and the wind-tunnel test results well accord with that of the numerical simulation. This indicates that the presented numerical method can be applied to predicting the structural dynamics responses when containing the FSI...|$|R
2500|$|The Fairey Delta 1 or FD1 was a British {{research}} aircraft {{produced by}} the Fairey Aviation Company [...] for investigation of delta wing flight characteristics and control at <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds.</b> In testing, the FD1 exhibited unfavourable handling and stability leading to cancellation of two further airframes.

2500|$|The term on {{the barber}} pole is pilot jargon {{that refers to}} flying an {{aircraft}} at the maximum safe velocity. The airspeed Indicator on aircraft capable of flying at altitude features a red/white striped needle resembling a barber pole. This needle displays the VMO (Maximum Operating Velocity) or—at altitude—the MMO (Mach Limit Maximum Operating Speed) of the aircraft. This needle also indicates the maximum operating Mach number above the VMO/MMO changeover level. As the aircraft increases in altitude and the air decreases in density and temperature, {{the speed of sound}} also decreases. Close to the speed of sound, an aircraft becomes susceptible to buffeting caused by shock waves produced by flying at <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds.</b> Thus, as the speed of sound decreases, so the maximum safe operating speed of the aircraft is reduced. The [...] "barber pole" [...] needle moves to indicate this speed. Flying [...] "on the barber pole" [...] therefore means to be flying the aircraft as fast as is safe {{to do so in the}} current conditions.|$|E
50|$|In sniping, it is {{generally}} considered essential that the bullet still be traveling at a supersonic speed {{by the time it}} reaches the target, because accuracy is compromised when a bullet's velocity enters the <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> region.

40|$|A {{technique}} for approximating the modal aerodynamic influence coefficients [AIC] matrices by using basis functions {{has been developed}} and validated. An application of the resulting approximated modal AIC matrix for a flutter analysis in <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> regime has been demonstrated. This methodology {{can be applied to}} the unsteady subsonic, transonic and supersonic aerodynamics. The method requires the unsteady aerodynamics in frequency-domain. The flutter solution can be found by the classic methods, such as rational function approximation, k, p-k, p, root-locus et cetera. The unsteady aeroelastic analysis for design optimization using unsteady transonic aerodynamic approximation is being demonstrated using the ZAERO(TradeMark) flutter solver (ZONA Technology Incorporated, Scottsdale, Arizona). The technique presented has been shown to offer consistent flutter speed prediction on an aerostructures test wing [ATW] 2 configuration with negligible loss in precision in <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> regime.

40|$|The {{generation}} of reduced-order models for computing the unsteady and nonlinear aerodynamic loads on an aircraft from pitching motions in the <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> range is described. The models considered {{are based on}} Duhamel’s superposition integral using indicial (step) response functions, Volterra theory using nonlinear kernels, radial basis functions, and a surrogate-based recurrence framework, both using time-history simulations of a training maneuver(s). Results are reported for the X- 31 configuration with a sharp leading-edge cranked delta wing geometry, including canard/wing vortex interactions. The validity of the various models studied was assessed by comparison of the model outputs with time-accurate computational-fluid-dynamics simulations of new maneuvers. Overall, the reduced-order models were found to produce accurate results, although a nonlinear model based on indicial functions yielded the best accuracy among all models. This model, along with a time-dependent surrogate approach, helped to produce accurate predictions {{for a wide range}} of motions in the <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> range...|$|R
2500|$|After Willy Messerschmitt's {{death in}} 1978, the former Me 262 pilot Hans Guido Mutke {{claimed to have}} {{exceeded}} Mach1 on 9 April 1945 in a Me 262 in a [...] "straight-down" [...] 90° dive. This claim is disputed because it relies solely on Mutke's memory of the incident, which recalls effects other Me 262 pilots observed below {{the speed of sound}} at high indicated airspeed, but with no altitude reading required to determine the actual speed. Furthermore, the pitot tube used to measure airspeed in aircraft can give falsely elevated readings as the pressure builds up inside the tube at high speeds. Finally, the Me 262 wing had only a slight sweep, incorporated for trim (center of gravity) reasons and likely would have suffered structural failure due to divergence at high <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds.</b> One airframe—the aforementioned Me 262 V9, Werknummer 130 004, with Stammkennzeichen of VI+AD, was prepared as the HG I test airframe with the low-profile Rennkabine racing-canopy and may have achieved an unofficial record speed for a turbojet-powered aircraft of , altitude unspecified, even with the recorded wartime airspeed record being set on 6 July 1944, by another Messerschmitt design—the Me 163B V18 rocket fighter setting a [...] record, but landing with a nearly disintegrated rudder surface.|$|E
