Therefore, research is focusing on cutting the cost of algal biofuel production {{to the point where}} it can compete with conventional petroleum. The production of several products from algae has been mentioned as the most important factor for making algae production economically viable. Other factors are the improving of the solar energy to biomass conversion efficiency (currently 3%, but 5 to 7% is theoretically attainable)and making the oil extraction from the algae easier.|$|E

25|$|In January 1969 the Council of the Institution set up {{a working}} party to {{consider}} {{the role of women}} in engineering. Among its conclusions were that 'while women have certainly established their competence throughout the professional engineering field, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a built-in or unconscious prejudice against them'. The WISE Campaign (Women into Science and Engineering) was launched in 1984; by 1992 3% of the total ICE membership of 79,000 was female, and only 0.8% of chartered civil engineers were women. By 2016 women comprised nearly 12% of total membership, almost 7% of chartered civil engineers and just over 2% of Fellows. In June 2015 a Presidential Commission on diversity was announced.|$|E
25|$|This {{process is}} {{distinct}} {{from the use of}} imaging to delineate targets and organs in the planning process of radiation therapy. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a connection between the imaging processes as IGRT relies directly on the imaging modalities from planning as the reference coordinates for localizing the patient. The variety of medical imaging technologies used in planning includes x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) among others. The precision of IGRT is significantly improved when N-localizer technology is used in conjunction with these medical imaging technologies. Through advancements in imaging technology, combined with a further understanding of human biology at the molecular level, the impact of IGRT on radiotherapy treatment continues to evolve.|$|E
25|$|Finally, after Deleuze, René Girard {{included}} {{his account}} of sado-masochism in Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World, originally Des choses cachées depuis la fondation du monde, 1978, making the chapter on masochism a coherent part of his theory of mimetic desire. In this view of sado-masochism, {{the violence of the}} practices are an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love-object. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a similarity to Deleuze, since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance, and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by Deleuze, there is an understanding {{of the value of the}} love object in terms of the processes of its valuation, acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor.|$|E

Furthermore, Thorstein [...] "the Red" [...] Olafsson (fl. late 9th century and Hlodvir's great-grandfather) was apparently married to a granddaughter of Kjarvalr. Woolf (2007) concludes that the saga writers may have confused this story about the provenance of Sigurd Hlodvirsson with one about Thorstein, a close ally of Sigurd Eysteinsson.|$|E

2500|$|Produced in Lindisfarne by Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne, between about 690 and {{his death}} in 721 (perhaps {{towards the end of}} this period), this is a Gospel Book {{in the style of the}} Book of Durrow, but more {{elaborate}} and complex. [...] All the letters on the pages beginning the Gospels are highly decorated in a single composition, and many two-page openings are designed as a unit, with carpet pages facing an incipit ("Here begins..") initial page at the start of each Gospel. [...] Eadfrith was almost certainly the scribe as well as the artist. [...] There are four Evangelist portraits, clearly derived from the classical tradition but treated without any sense of depth; the borders around them are far plainer than the decoration of the text pages, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> a sense of two styles which Eadfrith does not attempt to integrate wholly. [...] The carpet-pages are enormously complex, and superbly executed.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{methods for}} {{reducing}} search disallow {{the generation of}} some tableau {{on the ground that}} a closed tableau can still be found by expanding the other ones. These restrictions are called global. As an example of a global restriction, one may employ a rule that specify which of the open branches is to be expanded. As a result, if a tableau has for example two non-closed branches, the rule tells which one is to be expanded, disallowing the expansion of the second one. This restriction reduces the search space because one possible choice is now forbidden; completeness if however not harmed, as the second branch will still be expanded if the first one is eventually closed. As an example, a tableau with root , child , and two leaves [...] and [...] can be closed in two ways: applying [...] first to [...] and then to , or vice versa. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> no need to follow both possibilities; one may consider only the case in which [...] is first applied to [...] and disregard the case in which it is first applied to [...] This is a global restriction because what allows neglecting this second expansion is the presence of the other tableau, where expansion is applied to [...] first and [...] afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> some {{justification}} for ranking Tours-Poitiers {{among the most}} significant events in Frankish history when one considers {{the result of the}} battle in light of the remarkable record of the successful establishment by Muslims of Islamic political and cultural dominance along the entire eastern and southern rim of the former Christian, Roman world. The rapid Muslim conquest of Palestine, Syria, Egypt and the North African coast all the way to Morocco in the seventh century resulted in the permanent imposition by force of Islamic culture onto a previously Christian and largely non-Arab base. The Visigothic kingdom fell to Muslim conquerors in a single battle on the Rio Barbate in 711, and the Hispanic Christian population took seven long centuries to regain control of the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista, of course, was completed in 1492, only months before Columbus received official backing for his fateful voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Had Charles Martel suffered at Tours-Poitiers the fate of King Roderic at the Rio Barbate, it is doubtful that a [...] "do-nothing" [...] sovereign of the Merovingian realm could have later succeeded where his talented major domus had failed. Indeed, as Charles was the progenitor of the Carolingian line of Frankish rulers and grandfather of Charlemagne, one can even say with a degree of certainty that the subsequent history of the West would have proceeded along vastly different currents had 'Abd ar-Rahman been victorious at Tours-Poitiers in 732.|$|E

Leonard then tells her that when she is ready to get married, she can propose to him. In the season finale, Leonard leaves for an overseas job for four months and Penny is confident enough in their relationship to wait for him. [...] In [...] "The Gorilla Dissolution", Leonard and Penny become engaged. Throughout season 8, a running gag is their reluctance to decide upon a wedding date. In the season 8 finale, Penny asks Leonard to marry her that night in Las Vegas. Leonard happily accepts, but during the journey, after Penny expresses happiness that they will get married while knowing everything about each other, Leonard confesses to having shared a drunken kiss with another woman while on the boat in Europe, though he adds that the woman started it and he rejected her.
