5|$|XIII-2 begins {{three years}} after the end of XIII. Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the {{collapse}} of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of XIII-2, most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of XIII-2 jumps around several different time periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro. <b>This</b> <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> realm at the end of time where the goddess keeps a dark energy called Chaos from escaping and destroying the timeline.|$|E

[...] "Only {{it seems that}} <b>this</b> <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> little {{distance}} from Paris, it is retired, one finds seclusion here.

Absolutely impossible, you know. That's what's the matter with our versatile friend up yonder. He gets all aroused over some scheme or other which comes to him in the dead of night, hops out of bed before any one civilised is awake, and rings up for ambassadors. Then at night-time he becomes normal again and takes everything back. The consequence is that <b>this</b> <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> regular diplomatic see-saw. Settling down in Berlin pretty well, aren't you, Norgate?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Marquis of Tavistock [2] {{was down}} the other day; I supped with him [...] at his tutor's--entirely a Whig party.

6000|$|I {{put down}} my mug with a gravity {{far greater than}} her own. [...] "But <b>this</b> <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Shrine!" [...] I said. [...] "Pilgrims should be pouring into it from {{wherever}} the English legend has endured alive. There {{ought to be a}} colossal statue in the market-place of the man who invented Stilton cheese. There ought to be another colossal statue of the first cow who provided the foundations of it. There should be a burnished tablet let into the ground on the spot where some courageous man first ate Stilton cheese, and survived. On the top of a neighbouring hill (if there are any neighbouring hills) there should be a huge model of a Stilton cheese, made of some rich green marble and engraven with some haughty motto: I suggest something like 'Ver non semper viret; sed Stiltonia semper virescit.'"

50|$|The Old Norse form of {{the name}} was Hjarðkinn. The first element is {{probably}} the stem form of hjǫrðr m 'herd, flock of cattle or sheep', the last element is kinn n 'steep mountainside'.

6000|$|BRODIE (solus). My head! my head! It's the {{sickness}} of the grave. And those bells go on!... go on ... inexorable as death and judgment. (There they go; the trumpets of respectability, sounding encouragement {{to the world}} to do and spare not, {{and not to be}} found out. Found out! And to those who are they toll as when a man goes to the gallows.) Turn where I will are pitfalls hell-deep. Mary and her dowry; Jean and her child--my child; the dirty scoundrel Moore; my uncle and his trust; perhaps the man from Bow Street. Debt, vice, cruelty, dishonour, crime; the whole canting, lying, double-dealing, beastly business! [...] "My son the Deacon--Deacon of the Wrights!" [...] My thoughts sicken at it. (O, the Deacon, the Deacon! Where's a hat for the Deacon, where's a hat for the Deacon's headache? (Searching.) <b>This</b> <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> piggery.

6000|$|... "Aye," [...] Ayesha said, [...] "it {{was such}} a silent night as this and such a meal as this we ate, and Leo, not so greatly changed, save that he was beardless then and younger, was at my side. Where thou sittest, Holly, sat the royal Amenartas, a very fair woman; yes, even more {{beautiful}} than I before I dipped me in the Essence, fore-sighted also, though not so learned as I had grown. From the first we hated each other, and more than ever now, when she guessed how I had learned to look upon thee, her lover, Leo; for her husband thou never wast, who didst flee too fast for marriage. She knew also that the struggle between us which had begun of old and afar was for centuries and generations, and that until the end should declare itself neither of us could harm the other, who both had sinned to win thee, that wast appointed by fate to be the lodestone of our souls. Then Amenartas spoke and said--"'Lo! to my sight, Kallikrates, the wine in thy cup is turned to blood, and that knife in thy hand, O daughter of Yarab'--for so she named me--'drips red blood. Aye, and <b>this</b> <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sepulchre, and thou, O Kallikrates, sleepest here, nor can she, thy murderess, kiss back the breath of life into those cold lips of thine.' ...|$|E
60|$|Since I last {{wrote to}} you I’ve left that nice hotel {{and come to}} live in a French family—which, however, is nice too. <b>This</b> <b>place</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> kind of boarding-house that’s {{at the same time a}} kind of school; only it’s not like an American boarding-house, nor like an American school either. There are four or five people here that have come to learn the language—not to take lessons, but to have an {{opportunity}} for conversation. I was very glad to come to such a place, for I had begun to realise that I wasn’t pressing onward quite as I had dreamed with the French. Wasn’t I going to feel ashamed to have spent two months in Paris and not to have acquired more insight into the language? I had always heard so much of French conversation, and I found I wasn’t having much more opportunity to practise it than if I had remained at Bangor. In fact I used to hear a great deal more at Bangor from those French-Canadians who came down to cut the ice than I saw I should ever hear at that nice hotel where was no struggle—some fond struggle being my real atmosphere. The lady who kept the books seemed to want so much to talk to me in English (for the sake of practice, too, I suppose)—she kind of yearned to struggle too: we don’t yearn only down in Maine—that I couldn’t bear to show her I didn’t like it. The chambermaid was Irish and all the waiters German, so I never heard a word of French spoken. I suppose you might hear a great deal in the shops; but as I don’t buy anything—I prefer to spend my money for purposes of culture—I don’t have that advantage.|$|E
50|$|The Kleh-koot-aht people {{resided around}} Kleh-koot (Sproat Lake) (means {{long stretch of}} level land).

2500|$|Richard Krege {{maintained}} his suggestion of diesel exhaust gas chambers to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> [...] "outright lie," [...] and showed {{a model of}} the Treblinka extermination camp to illustrate this.

He said, [...] "There is no scientific proof to show that <b>this</b> <b>place</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> extermination camp. All that exists are the words of some people." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1511, <b>a</b> hermitage <b>was</b> erected on {{the site}} of the current Plaza de Fray Albino edifice. It was built by order of the conquistador, Alonso Fernández de Lugo.
