It pointed to a voice analysis conducted by the Speech Processing Laboratory at National Taiwan University, which concluded that the voices did not match, and also noted that the hairline and facial proportions appeared to be different. These observations were used to advance the theory that the self-immolators were actors.|$|E

At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as a homosexual and pederast.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Southbury {{was the subject}} of a lawsuit by the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation. The 100-member tribe sought to take the land of roughly 1,200 {{property}} holders in the town.

Socrates never indicates what a man might stand to gain from lying about such matters, but brings the conversation back around to Achilles, and what kind of man Homer intended to portray.|$|E

It was established that Tori was the alter who murdered Victor Lord in 1976. (It would later be revealed that Victor survived and did not die until 2003. However Dorian has planted a seed of doubt regarding that notion, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> re-emerged as Victor in 2003 was a fraud.) Although her declared mission was to force Viki to face the truth, she wreaked much destruction before getting around to that. Tori started undermining The Banner by feeding stories and information to rival newspaper editor Todd Manning, and she torched Llanfair, nearly killing Jessica in the blaze.|$|E

Prasad requested to meet Hills, whose goals for World Union he had heard about from Nehru. Hills considered Prasad the most spiritual of the founders of Independent India, and their meeting was a profound encounter in which Prasad gave his blessing for Hills' global endeavors, but then the president lost consciousness, tightly holding onto Hills' hand. Apparently Prasad never recovered, and at the time, there was a controversy <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who,</b> through satyagraha, had resisted multiple British governments and Viceroys and been jailed by them for so many years, had said his last words to an Englishman.|$|E
25|$|In late 2010 L.A. Park {{began asking}} Konnan {{for a shot}} at the AAA Mega Championship and was promised his shot if he managed to defeat El Mesías at Guerra de Titanes. Park did just that, but instead of putting {{together}} a match between him and the new Mega Champion, his La Sociedad partner El Zorro, the next title shot was awarded to Los Bizarros member Charly Manson to set up a grudge match for the title between him and El Zorro, causing dissension between Park and Konnan. On February 28 Park entered the 2011 Rey de Reyes tournament in order to solidify his spot as the number one contender, defeating Dr. Wagner Jr., Halloween and Nicho el Millonario in his semifinal match. During the match Park was attacked by La Sociedad member Damián 666, who was seemingly trying to prevent him from advancing in the tournament, but instead the interference distracted Wagner Jr. and cost him the match. On March 18 at the Rey de Reyes pay-per-view, Park was eliminated from the finals of the tournament, after brawling with rival El Mesías to a double countout. At the same event Los Perros del Mal, represented by El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, Damián 666, Halloween and Super Crazy, continued their win streak over Los Psycho Circus, by defeating them and Dr. Wagner Jr., the alliance known as Potencia Mundial, in an eight-man tag team match. Meanwhile, El Zorro was successful in his first title defense by defeating Charly Manson. At the following television taping on March 21, Konnan, disappointed with the performance of La Milicia, demoted Decnnis and named Super Fly the sub–group's new leader. Later that same night, Los Maniacos lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Jack Evans and the 2011 Rey de Reyes, Extreme Tiger. Following the loss, Silver King and Último Gladiador began showing signs of dissension, but were brought back together by La Legión Extranjera member Chessman, who joined Los Maniacos to form La Maniarquía. Meanwhile, the AAA Mega Champion El Zorro, having caught wind of L.A. Park's intention of challenging for his title, seemingly started interfering in his matches under his old mask, costing him back–to–back multi–man tag team matches at the April 27 and 30 TV tapings, escalating the dissension within La Sociedad in the process. In early May, Jeff Jarrett, the founder of American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, announced his and TNA's alignment with Dorian Roldán and La Sociedad and their participation in Triplemanía XIX. Konnan, however, was against the idea of his former employer coming to AAA and believed that Roldán had made a mistake. Jarrett and fellow TNA worker Abyss arrived to AAA on May 18 for a confrontation with Konnan and La Sociedad. In the end, Konnan and Jarrett revealed that they were in fact on the same page with each other and turned on El Zorro, along with L.A. Park, with Konnan announcing that Jarrett would be challenging for his AAA Mega Championship at Triplemanía XIX. It was later revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had attacked Park under El Zorro's mask was actually Charly Manson, who had been sent by Cibernético to cause dissension within the ranks of La Sociedad. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly defeated Los Psycho Circus in a tournament final to become the first ever AAA World Trios Champions, while Jeff Jarrett defeated El Zorro to become the new AAA Mega Champion and L.A. Park ended his feud with El Mesías by defeating him in a Mask vs. Hair match.|$|E

Düwel has suggested that the expression is the eastern route equivalent of gjaldi skifti ("divided payment") which appears in the nearby stone Sö 166 that talks of payments to Vikings in England (see also U 194, U 241 and U 344).

Moffat threatened that if they ever did a second series he would write a whole episode in which Bathurst was naked. After being mistaken for a flasher, Mark is punched by his neighbour's brother. When he awakens he is confronted by a man (Kerry Shale) in a red polo neck jumper who claims to be [...] "his very best friend".

500|$|After {{publishing}} two novels, Dead Men Tell No Tales in 1899 and Peccavi in 1900, Hornung {{published a}} second collection of Raffles stories, The Black Mask, in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told {{to apply for}} the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had [...] "aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep". In the final story of the collection, [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; The Spectator declared [...] "this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral", while the reviewer for The Illustrated London News thought that Hornung's [...] "invention has obviously flagged... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to hear these burglars rant about the honour of Old England.

500|$|Bobby {{explains}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> attacked Sam is Jeremy Frost; he {{was unable}} to dream because his father brutally hit him {{in the head with a}} baseball bat. The target's DNA is a required ingredient for the dream-root tea, and Jeremy acquired Bobby's by offering him a beer. Dean realizes that he made the same mistake. Vulnerable to Jeremy, they both stay awake for two days while attempting to track him down. Unable to endure it any longer, Dean goes to sleep to face Jeremy, and Sam uses the dream root to enter his dream. The brothers encounter a dream version of Lisa Braeden (Cindy Sampson)Dean's former love interestoutside on a blanket with a picnic basket. She invites Dean to join her, and tells him that she loves him before disappearing. Though Dean denies ever having that dream before, it is an obvious lie. Sam then sees Jeremy nearby and chases after him, and Dean finds himself in a long hallway. He enters his motel room, and comes face-to-face with a dream version of him; he is his own worst nightmare. The Dream Dean comments on the real Dean's feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing; he also deems Dean to be as [...] "mindless and obedient as an attack dog", noting that his possessions, personality, and motives all stem from his father. When the Dream Dean calls him a [...] "good soldier and nothing else", the real Dean reacts violently and exclaims that he did not deserve the burdens that his father put onto him and that he does not deserve to go to Hell. The real Dean shoots his doppelganger with a shotgun, but he returns to life as a demon. The Dream Dean taunts him that he cannot escape his fate, and reminds him that exposure to Hell will transform him into a demon.|$|E
500|$|Adams is {{generally}} {{less well known}} than many of America's other founding fathers. McCullough argued that [...] "he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him." [...] Todd Leopold of CNN added in 2001 that Adams is [...] "remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature {{seems to have been}} dwarfed by his lanky colleagues." [...] He has always been seen, Ferling says, as [...] "honest and dedicated," [...] but despite his lengthy career in public service, is still overshadowed by the dramatic explanations and strong personalities of his contemporaries. Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as [...] "staunch, honest stubborn and somewhat narrow." [...] In his 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. In 1995, Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams. Ferling says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> emerges is one [...] "perpetually at war with himself," [...] whose desire for fame and recognition leads to changes of vanity. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that [...] "Adams was his own worst enemy." [...] He criticizes Adams for his [...] "pettiness...jealousy, and vanity," [...] and finds fault with him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. However, he praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled John Adams. McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, [...] "plays down or explains away" [...] his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book was very favorably received and, along with other biographies published not long before, contributed to a rapid surge in Adams' reputation.|$|E
