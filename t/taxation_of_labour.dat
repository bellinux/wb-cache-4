In his 1897 travel book Following the Equator, American writer Mark Twain wrote of the Eureka Rebellion: ... I think it may be called the finest thing in Australasian history. It was a revolution—small in size; but great politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for principle, a stand against injustice and oppression. ... It is another instance of a victory won by a lost battle. It adds an honorable page to history; the people know it and are proud of it.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{tax policy}} could {{contribute}} to structural reforms that benefit the Belgium economy. We start by highlighting two facts: Belgian has a low employment rate and a high <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> The main direction for tax reform should be to reduce the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> with a targeting on the segments of the labour market that are the most reactive to such a change. The medium term fiscal policy stance clearly requires that such a reform {{should be at least}} fully compensated. We suggest a tax shifting to consumption and the integration of external costs in the prices of energy and transport. Base broadening could also contribute in a significant way to the financing of such reforms, while having in itself positive effects on the allocation of resources, so that both the reduction in the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and the suggested compensatory measures {{could contribute to}} structural reforms in a positive way. © De Boeck Université...|$|E

40|$|The Mirrlees Review of the UK tax system, {{together}} with its companion volume of research papers, {{can be expected}} to influence future discussions of tax reform. Indeed, this can already be recognised in the Henry Review. As far as income taxation is concerned, the most substantive recommendation of the Mirrlees Review is a move toward a system of consumption or expenditure taxation, by exempting the normal return to saving and taxing only excess returns on the same tax schedule as labour earnings. This paper argues against this direction of reform {{on the grounds that it}} is based on a model of household behaviour over the life cycle that ignores important aspects of reality. We present an alternative model, {{together with}} supporting empirical evidence.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the changing fiscal role of the federal government with respect to providing financial support for low-income households and the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> returns from capital. Specifically, the effects of reducing transfers to low income families by US$ 10 billion and balancing the ensuing federal budget surplus by increasing the preferential tax treatment of capital gains for individual taxpayers are examined. We examine how this combined budget-neutral fiscal policy change affects agricultural production, economy-wide welfare and the consumption of food. Our results indicate reducing the distortion between the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> capital and <b>labour</b> increases economy-wide efficiency leading to increased consumption of food by all income classes. Although economy-wide food expenditures increase, offsetting the revenue shortfall from a reduced capital tax by decreasing transfers to low income families reduces food expenditures for the two lowest income groups by nearly US$ 1 billion. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent debates have {{suggested}} that taxation is very detrimental to labour force participation and employment. However, some countries - notably the Scandinavian - stand out as contradictions to this view since they have managed to sustain high labour force participation despite high tax rates and a generous social safety net. This paper considers the experience of European countries and Scandinavia compared to the US and asks whether Scandinavian countries are outliers. First, {{it is argued that}} the simple "tax argument" does not capture the European experience since labour force participation for some age groups is at the same or a higher level than the US. Second, it is argued that even though the social safety net is generous in Scandinavian countries, it is also very employment conditional. It is shown that these conditionalities can make high labour force participation consistent with a high marginal effective <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> and that it on the margin lowers the marginal costs of public funds. The design of the social safety net is therefore important in accounting for the Scandinavian experience.

40|$|Increased {{integration}} <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> {{and capital}} markets creates significant {{challenges for the}} welfare states <b>of</b> modern Europe. <b>Taxation</b> <b>of</b> capital and <b>labour</b> that finances extensive programmes of cash and in-kind redistribution creates incentives for capital owners and workers to locate in regions where they obtain favourable fiscal treatment. Competition among countries for mobile resources constrains their ability to alter the distribution of income and may lead to reductions in the {{size and scope of}} redistributive policies. Mobility <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and capital is imperfect, however. Recent trends indicate that labour and capital are neither perfectly mobile nor perfectly immobile, but rather adjust gradually to market conditions and economic policies. This paper presents an explicitly dynamic analysis showing that governments can achieve some redistribution when it is costly for factors of production to relocate. As the costs of factor mobility fall, however, the effectiveness of redistributive policies is more limited, and governments have weaker incentives to pursue them. Liberalized immigration policies, EU enlargement, and other steps that promote integration of the factors markets of Western Europe with those of surrounding regions thus present a challenge to policy-makers if they also wish to maintain fiscal systems with extensive redistribution...|$|R

With a perfect credit market, ELIE is successful in reducing inequalities and poverty, but {{it is at the}} expense of lower investment in education and slower growth. In an economy with an imperfect credit market where individuals cannot borrow to educate, the tradeoff between growth and redistribution is not overturned but is less severe.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the current {{financial}} crisis on changes in the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> consumption, <b>labour,</b> and capital in the European Union. The responses reflected in the tax policies pursued in the EU countries to the current crisis will be analysed in three ways: 1. Distribution of total tax burden by economic function, i. e. assessment of the share of taxes on consumption, labour, and capital in relation to GDP and total tax revenues. Therefore, the analysis will cover backward-looking tax burden indicators; 2. Analysis of trends in the implicit tax rate (ITR) on consumption, labour and capital. The ITR is an indicator which expresses the relation of tax burdens levied on different activities to total revenue from this activity.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the problem <b>of</b> optimal <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> top <b>labour</b> incomes. We develop a model where top incomes respond to marginal tax rates through three channels: (1) the standard supply-side channel through reduced economic activity, (2) the tax avoidance channel, (3) the compensation bargaining channel through efforts in influencing own pay setting. We derive the optimal top tax rate formula {{as a function}} of the three elasticities corresponding to those three channels of responses. The first elasticity (supply side) is the sole real factor limiting optimal top tax rates. The optimal tax system should be designed to minimize the second elasticity (avoidance) through tax enforcement and tax neutrality across income forms, in which case the second elasticity becomes irrelevant. The optimal top tax rate increases with the third elasticity (bargaining) as bargaining efforts are zero-sum in aggregate. We then analyze top income and top tax rate data in 18 OECD countries. There is a strong correlation between cuts in top tax rates and increases in top 1 % income shares since 1975, implying that the overall elasticity is large. But top income share increases have not translated into higher economic growth, consistent with the zero-sum bargaining model. This suggests that the first elasticity is modest in size and that the overall effect comes mostly from the third elasticity. Consequently, socially optimal top tax rates might possibly be much higher than what is commonly assumed. optimal income taxation...|$|R
