2500|$|Cabinet {{table saws}} are heavy (using {{large amounts of}} cast iron and steel) to {{minimize}} vibration and increase accuracy. A cabinet saw is characterized by having an enclosed base (cabinet). Cabinet saws usually have induction motors in the 3 to 5 hp (2 to 4kW) range, single-phase, but motors in the 5 to 7 HP (4 to 6kW) range, three-phase, are common in commercial/industrial sites. For home use, this type of motor typically requires that a heavy-duty circuit be installed (in the US, this requires a 240 volt receptacle, or [...] "hard" [...] wiring and a dedicated branch circuit). The motor is enclosed within the cabinet and drives the blade with two to four parallel V-belts, often [...] "A" [...] belts as [...] "A" [...] belts may be ganged without having to be specially selected (otherwise, specially selected sets of light-duty [...] "4L" [...] belts are used). Cabinet saws are heavier and offer <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>advantages</b> over contractor saws: heavier construction for lower vibration and increased durability; a cabinet-mounted trunnion (the mechanism that incorporates the saw blade mount and allows for height and tilt adjustment); improved dust collection due to the totally enclosed cabinet and common incorporation of a dust collection port. Cabinet saws are designed for, and are capable of very high duty-cycles, such as are encountered in commercial/industrial applications. Where some {{of the advantages of}} a cabinet saw are desired in a home shop application, so-called [...] "hybrid" [...] saws have emerged to address this need.|$|E

In this paper, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA), a GA based multi-objective optimization technique, has been applied to a graph drawing (GD) problem. In this paper a measure (force equalization) which contributes to production of nicely drawing is introduced by a GA. We show that using the introduced objective and keeping the Pareto optimal solutions of the GD process in a pool, <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>advantage</b> can be achieved: A single run of the GA process leads to several suboptimal solutions which provide the user with a selection right; to choose the most effective drawing...|$|R
