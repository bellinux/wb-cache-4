Other canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Grand Western Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal.

5|$|The High Virgo missile was a {{single-stage}} weapon, {{powered by}} a solid-fueled Thiokol TX-20 rocket, and was equipped an advanced inertial guidance system derived {{from that of the}} AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile. Four tailfins in a cruciform arrangement provided directional control. The missile was developed by Lockheed, utilising components developed for several existing missiles <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of the project, and also to reduce the development time required. Convair was responsible for development of a pylon for carriage and launching of the missile from the prototype B-58, the pylon replacing the aircraft's normal weapons pod.|$|E
5|$|The {{designation}} WS-199B {{was assigned}} to the project that, under a contract awarded in 1958 to Martin Aircraft, would become the Bold Orion missile. The design of Bold Orion was simple, using parts developed for other missile systems <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> and development time of the project. The initial Bold Orion configuration was a single-stage vehicle, using a Thiokol TX-20 Sergeant solid-fuel rocket. Following initial testing, the Bold Orion configuration was altered to become a two-stage vehicle, an Allegany Ballistics Laboratory Altair upper stage being added to the missile.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It {{has been suggested that}} innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E
5|$|Impressed {{with the}} film's script, V. Srinivas Mohan became the visual effects {{supervisor}} in December2007. He asked Shankar {{to increase the}} filming schedules by six months to include pre-production requirements. Both Mohan and Shankar visited several visual effects companies, including the New Zealand-based Weta Digital and the United States-based Industrial Light & Magic, Cafe FX and Tippett Studio before partnering with Legacy Effects. The original Eros-Ayngaran visual effects budget was 700million, but after Sun Pictures took over production, it was significantly reduced to 200million. As a result, the visual effects team had to omit and alter some sequences, making Chitti wear sunglasses {{for most of the}} film <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> and difficultly of animating his eyes.|$|E
5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, helium {{is extracted}} by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain {{as much as}} 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which {{almost all of the}} remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.|$|E

5|$|The {{money was}} used to {{complete}} the line to Nantwich, and to build a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost,</b> but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated on trying to generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find any, and tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had no money {{and was unable to}} meet interest payments on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he did not respond to their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, but somehow the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs.|$|E
5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. <b>To</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E
