5|$|The {{inclination}} {{distribution of}} Jupiter-family (or ecliptic) comets would become broader {{under the influence}} of Planet Nine. Jupiter-family comets originate primarily from <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> objects, trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes that vary over time due to distant encounters with Neptune. In a model including Planet Nine, <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> objects that reach large semi-major axes dynamically interact with Planet Nine, increasing their inclinations. As a result, the population of <b>the</b> <b>scattering</b> objects, and the population of comets derived from it, is left with a broader inclination distribution. This inclination distribution is broader than is observed, in contrast to a five-planet Nice model without a Planet Nine that can closely match the observed inclination distribution.|$|E

5|$|The intensities of the {{reflections}} observed in X-ray diffraction {{give us the}} magnitudes |F(q)| but not the phases φ(q). To obtain the phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to <b>the</b> <b>scattering,</b> either by modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as mercury.
