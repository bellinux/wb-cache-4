5000|$|In some {{languages}} {{people with}} the name are sometimes named after the cross, not after Christ. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>cross</b> in Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian is kr'st and in Russian is krest, in some cases pronounced krist. In contrast Christ in these Slavic languages is called Hristos, which confuses to which of both nouns the name sounds more similar. The name may have a third meaning in Bulgarian and Macedonian, in which <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kr'sten means baptized and has the same as <b>the</b> <b>word</b> for <b>cross.</b> Though sounding similar, <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>cross</b> and Christian have different roots, Christian derives from <b>the</b> Koine Greek <b>word</b> Christós, possibly ultimately derived from the Egyptian kheru, [...] "word" [...] or [...] "voice", used to replace the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach, [...] "anointed". On the other the hand the Slavic and <b>the</b> English <b>word</b> for <b>cross</b> comes from <b>the</b> Latin <b>word</b> crux (cruci) [...] "stake" [...] which is perhaps of Phoencian or Punic (Phoencio-Carthaginian [...] ) origin.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> <b>cross</b> is {{recorded}} in 10th-century Old English as cros, {{exclusively for the}} instrument of Christ's crucifixion, replacing the native Old English <b>word</b> rood. <b>The</b> <b>word's</b> history is complicated; {{it appears to have}} entered English from Old Irish, possibly via Old Norse, ultimately from the Latin crux (or its accusative crucem and its genitive crucis), [...] "stake, cross". The English verb to cross arises from the noun c. 1200, first in the sense [...] "to make the sign of the cross"; the generic meaning [...] "to intersect" [...] develops in the 15th century.The Latin word was, however, influenced by popular etymology by a native Germanic word reconstructed as *krukjo (English crook, Old English crycce, Old Norse krokr, Old High German krucka). This word, by conflation with Latin crux, gave rise to Old French crocier (modern French crosse), the term for a shepherd's crook, adopted in English as crosier.|$|R
