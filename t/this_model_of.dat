5|$|From <b>this</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> Kantian ethics, O'Neill {{begins to}} develop a theory of justice. She argues that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The {{study found that the}} parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that <b>this</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E

5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, <b>this</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E

Arnold O. Beckman's National Technical Laboratories (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.|$|E

5|$|Classic Maya social {{organization}} {{was based on}} the ritual authority of the ruler, rather than central control of trade and food distribution. <b>This</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by tradition to such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare. This only served to exacerbate systemic problems. By the 9th and 10th centuries, this resulted in collapse of this system of rulership. In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages. In the southern Yucatán and central Petén, kingdoms declined; in western Petén and some other areas, the changes were catastrophic and resulted in the rapid depopulation of cities. Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned. Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years. One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at Toniná in 909. Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces. Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. <b>This</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E
