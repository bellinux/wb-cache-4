5|$|Uranium is a {{naturally}} occurring element {{that can be}} found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern to allow it to move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|In plant cells, vacuoles cover {{anywhere}} from 30% to 90% {{of the total}} cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also {{increase the size of}} the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole {{in order to keep the}} cytosol's pH constant.|$|E

5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column {{you can see the}} driving clock <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> telescope turning westward just as fast as the stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> duct open. Removable plastic stents {{are used in}} {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether the patient has improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E
5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E

5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

25|$|As first {{explained}} by Maximilian Schuler in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital {{period of a}} hypothetical satellite orbiting just above {{the surface of the}} earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called Schuler tuning, is used in inertial guidance systems in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the control system <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> inertial platform containing the gyroscopes stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.|$|E

25|$|As gas {{leaves the}} {{cylinder}} it decreases in {{pressure in the}} first stage, becoming very cold due to adiabatic expansion. Where the ambient water temperature is less than 5Â°C any water {{in contact with the}} regulator may freeze. If this ice jams the diaphragm or piston spring, preventing the valve closing, a free-flow may ensue that can empty a full cylinder within a minute or two, and the free-flow causes further cooling in a positive feedback loop. Generally the water that freezes is in the ambient pressure chamber around a spring <b>that</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> valve open and not moisture in the breathing gas from the cylinder, but that is also possible if the air is not adequately filtered. The modern trend of using plastics to replace metal components in regulators encourages freezing because it insulates the inside of a cold regulator from the warmer surrounding water. Some regulators are provided with heat exchange fins in areas where cooling due to air expansion is a problem, such as around the second stage valve seat on some regulators.|$|E
