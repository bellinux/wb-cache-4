Some American writers said the French had a point, and French writers in turn noted the difficulty of enforcing the Guigou law in an era where technology cannot prevent the images it forbids from being viewed in France when published overseas. Others noted that the incident also showed <b>the</b> <b>pitfalls</b> <b>of</b> the French media's practice of not reporting on the private lives of politicians, noting that rape allegations had been raised earlier about Strauss-Kahn on a French talk show with no media followup.|$|E

500|$|The {{possibility}} of lowering the young Emperor's age of majority, {{instead of waiting}} until he turned 18, had been floated since 1835. His elevation to the throne had led to a troublesome period of endless crises.

Those politicians who had risen to power during the 1830s had by now also become familiar with <b>the</b> <b>pitfalls</b> <b>of</b> rule. According to historian Roderick J. Barman, by 1840 [...] "they had lost all faith {{in their ability to}} rule the country on their own. They accepted PedroII as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival." [...] When asked by politicians if he would like to assume full powers, PedroII shyly accepted. On the following day, 23 July 1840, the General Assembly (the Brazilian Parliament) formally declared the 14-year-old PedroII of age.
