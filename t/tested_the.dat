We use some classical normality <b>tests</b> (<b>the</b> Shapiro-Wilk <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> Lilliefors <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> Anderson-Darling <b>test,</b> <b>the</b> classical Jarque-Bera <b>test</b> and <b>the</b> Jarque-Bera-Urzua <b>test),</b> some robust normality <b>tests</b> (<b>the</b> robust Jarque-Bera <b>test</b> and <b>the</b> Medcouple <b>test)</b> and <b>the</b> modified Jarque-Bera <b>tests,</b> where <b>the</b> median instead of the mean is used in <b>the</b> classical Jarque-Bera <b>test</b> statistic. <b>The</b> results of simulation study show that the Anderson-Darling and <b>the</b> Shapiro-Wilk <b>tests</b> outperform <b>the</b> others, especially in small sample sizes. On the other hand the classical Jarque-Bera, the Jarque-Bera-Urzua and robust Jarque-Bera tests are biased, especially in small sample sizes again.

40|$|This report {{contains}} an initial definition of <b>the</b> field <b>tests</b> proposed for <b>the</b> Yucca Mountain Project repository sealing program. <b>The</b> <b>tests</b> {{are intended to}} resolve various performance and emplacement concerns. Examples of concerns to be addressed include achieving selected hydrologic and structural requirements for seals, removing portions of the shaft liner, excavating keyways, emplacing cementitious and earthen seals, reducing the impact of fines on the hydraulic conductivity of fractures, efficient grouting of fracture zones, sealing of exploratory boreholes, and controlling {{the flow of water}} by using engineered designs. Ten discrete tests are proposed to address these and other concerns. These tests are divided into two groups: Seal component tests and performance confirmation <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> seal component <b>tests</b> are thorough small-scale in situ <b>tests,</b> <b>the</b> intermediate-scale borehole seal <b>tests,</b> <b>the</b> fracture grouting <b>tests,</b> <b>the</b> surface backfill <b>tests,</b> and <b>the</b> grouted rock mass <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> seal system <b>tests</b> are <b>the</b> seepage control <b>tests,</b> <b>the</b> backfill <b>tests,</b> <b>the</b> bulkhead <b>test</b> in <b>the</b> Calico Hills unit, the large-scale shaft seal and shaft fill <b>tests,</b> and <b>the</b> remote borehole sealing <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tests</b> are proposed to be performed in six discrete areas, including welded and non-welded environments, primarily located outside the potential repository area. The final selection of sealing tests will depend {{on the nature of the}} geologic and hydrologic conditions encountered during the development of the Exploratory Studies Facility and detailed numerical analyses.
