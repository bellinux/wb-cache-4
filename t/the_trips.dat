5|$|McCain and Keating {{had become}} {{personal}} friends following their initial contacts in 1981, and McCain {{was the only}} one of the five with close social and personal ties to Keating. Like DeConcini, McCain considered Keating a constituent since Keating lived in Arizona. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in political contributions from Keating and his associates. In addition, McCain's wife Cindy McCain and her father Jim Hensley had invested $359,100 in the Fountain Square Project, a Keating shopping center, in April 1986, a year before McCain met with the regulators. McCain, his family, and their baby-sitter had made nine trips at Keating's expense, sometimes aboard Keating's jet; three of <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> were made during vacations to Keating's Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay. McCain did not pay Keating (in the amount of $13,433) for some of <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> until years after they were taken, when he learned that Keating was in trouble over Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|After the war started, the FBB {{provided}} wider security {{protection for}} Hitler when {{in residence at}} the Berghof, as he travelled by vehicle to front-line command posts and at military headquarters. They would be in heavily armed vehicles at {{the front and back}} of Hitler's convoy. In addition, army motorcycle outriders were positioned at the front and rear of the convoy of vehicles. The FBK would ride with Hitler and the RSD men would ride in a separate car during <b>the</b> <b>trips.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{campaign}} made {{extensive use}} of Randall, as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, New York, and Connecticut, mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that the Democrats {{did not want to}} lower the tariff so much that they would lose their jobs. In a close election, Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent, James G. Blaine. Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election. Although, he claimed <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> to be of a personal nature, they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>trip</b> arm {{is raised}} {{automatically}} whenever a train {{should be brought}} to a halt. When the signalling system determines it is safe for the train to proceed, the motor drives <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> arm down to the lowered position. The spring ensures that <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> arm is raised in all other situations, which is an essential fail-safe provision in case of failure of the electric or pneumatic power supply or of the motor driving <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> arm. If a train attempts to pass the signal with <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> arm in <b>the</b> raised position, <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> arm makes mechanical contact with <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> cock on <b>the</b> train, causing the train's brakes to be automatically applied, thereby bringing the train to a halt.|$|R
50|$|For an item to {{constitute}} taxable income to the taxpayer, {{there must be}} economic gain to the taxpayer, and the economic gain must primarily benefit the taxpayer personally. The Gotchers received an indirect economic gain by receiving a benefit (the value of <b>the</b> <b>trip)</b> without any reduction in their wealth. The court considered the specific details of <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> including <b>the</b> purpose of <b>the</b> <b>trip,</b> time spent in meetings, the location of day <b>trips,</b> and whether <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> was an award for past service. The court conducted this analysis {{for the purpose of}} determining whether the primary benefit of <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> was to <b>the</b> Gotchers or whether the primary benefit of <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> was to Volkswagen and the employers.|$|R

5|$|Orphaned {{at the age}} of seven, Wiśniowiecki {{was raised}} by his uncle, Konstanty Wiśniowiecki, whose branch of the family were Roman Catholics. Jeremi {{attended}} a Jesuit college in Lwów and later, in 1629, he traveled to Italy, where he briefly attended the University of Bologna. He also acquired some military experience in the Netherlands. The upbringing by his uncle and <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> abroad polonized him, and turned him from a provincial Ruthenian princeling into one of the youngest magnates of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} Ornara, and Sobi and Langor {{have agreed to}} provide the Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment. However, Picard announces that as the Prime Directive {{prevents}} him from interfering in the transactions between the two planets, it also prevents him from providing any replacement parts for the aging freighters. T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as {{it means that the}} trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, this will be an opportunity for both races to advance in their own ways.|$|E
5|$|The French {{priest and}} naturalist Armand David {{collected}} a specimen {{of the species}} during one of <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> he took through imperial China in the 1860s and 1870s.

Unaware of Fairmaire's description, a separate description naming the species as Agrilus marcopoli was published in 1930 by Jan Obenberger.|$|E

5|$|The Union force {{suffered}} significant losses. The Union commander, Colonel Toland, was killed. The severely wounded cavalry commander, Colonel William H. Powell, {{was left}} to die and became a prisoner of the Confederates. (Powell was also second {{in command of the}} entire brigade.) Additional officers and enlisted men were killed, wounded, or missing. The Union after action report listed a total of 86 men killed, wounded, missing, or taken prisoner during the entire expedition—although Confederate leadership believed the Union casualties were much higher. (The entire expedition includes <b>the</b> <b>trips</b> to and from Wytheville.) Approximately 300 horses were lost (killed, wounded, or injured) by the brigade during the raid and retreat—including an estimated 80 killed on the streets of Wytheville. Despite significant losses, the Union brigade was eventually able to secure the town. However, the victory was costly, and the northerners retreated less than 24 hours after entering the small community. A group of soldiers and civilians, less than one third the size of the Union force they opposed, prevented a brigade from destroying vital assets of the Confederacy—a railroad line, telegraph line along the railroad, a lead mine, and possibly a salt mine. After the conflict, Union infantry leaders were critical of the Union cavalry's performance, and men from the cavalry were critical of the infantry leadership's tactics.|$|E

25|$|Patents {{have been}} criticized in the {{developing}} world, as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines. Reconciling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of price discrimination.

In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that <b>the</b> <b>TRIPS</b> agreement should be read {{with the goals of}} public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via compulsory licensing or parallel imports, even before patent expiration.|$|E

50|$|Rates and ratios often {{vary with}} time, location, {{particular}} element (or subset) {{of a set}} of objects, etc. Thus they are often mathematical functions. For example, velocity v (distance traveled per unit time) of a transportation vehicle on a certain trip may be represented as a function of x (the distance traveled from the start of <b>the</b> <b>trip)</b> as v(x). Alternatively, one could express velocity as a function of time t from the start of <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> as v(t). Another representation of velocity on a trip is to partition <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> route into N segments and let vi be the constant velocity on segment i (v is a function of index i). Here each segment i, of <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> is a subset of <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> route.|$|R
50|$|When both <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> arm and trip valve were new, {{this did}} not matter; the train did not fill its entire {{clearance}} envelope, and <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> arm would contact <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> valve normally. However, with normal wear of the wheels and rails, and with the train rounding a curve at speed (and therefore riding off-centre) it was another matter. The first wheel {{on the right-hand side}} of the train hit a bolt in the mechanism attached to <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> arm and knocked the arm down. It would then rise again, but too late: with the train moving quickly, <b>the</b> <b>trip</b> valve, just a few feet behind the wheel, would already have gone past, thus making the train stop useless for ensuring signal compliance.|$|R
