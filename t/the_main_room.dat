5|$|Hawley's {{first period}} (945–1030) was {{suggested}} by tree ring dates scattered throughout later parts of Chetro Ketl. Archeologists subsequently discovered that her second period (1030–90) structure was built directly over an earlier (990–1030) one-story-tall, two-room-wide row of rooms. Lekson shortened Hawley's second period to 1030–75, and subdivided it into {{at least eight}} different construction events, including the successive additions of upper stories along <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> block, running {{the length of the}} building. After 1075, construction consisted of minor additions and alternations, {{with the exception of a}} row of three large, Chaco-style second- and third-story round rooms that were added to the plaza-facing center of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> block during 1075–95. Much of the later construction, including the large Chaco-style kivas, was in McElmo style masonry, using shaped blocks of relatively soft tan colored sandstone instead of the previously preferred harder, denser dark brown sandstone, which may have been quarried out in the central canyon after 1075. Chetro Ketl required an estimated 50 million sandstone blocks and more than 500,000 man-hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Brown enters another room {{surrounded}} by people in animal heads, and performs the third dance sequence in the video with his backup dancers. Towards {{the end of the}} chorus, Brown and his dancers appear back inside <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> and continue dancing. At one point, the video is slowed down as Brown and his dancers do flips. In other scenes, he is seen dancing alone with a cane in a rain-filled room, wearing white dress pants, a black tank top and a fedora. Brown then splits into three people, comes back together, takes off his shirt and throws it at the camera, causing its lens to crack.|$|E
5|$|To {{record the}} album, Jackson {{suggested}} a small studio located outside of Washington, D.C. in Silver Spring, Maryland. The sessions {{took place in}} September and October 1973 at Silver Spring's D Sound Studios. According to Scott-Heron, the studio's main room was so small that when the two musicians recorded, Jackson was forced out next to the cooler, playing flute in the studio's hallway while Scott-Heron sang in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room.</b> However, Scott-Heron felt comfortable in the small studio. Jose Williams was enlisted as the recording engineer for the album. Williams assisted Scott-Heron and Jackson, who were credited for production under the title Perpis-Fall Music, Inc., with production, and he engineered the album's recordings entirely himself.|$|E

50|$|These are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> and halls in the {{interior}} layout of Perdana Putra.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} comprises four rooms about {{a center}} hall running through <b>the</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> are on <b>the</b> south side, with smaller {{rooms on the}} north. All of the first floor rooms have wainscoting and fireplaces. The chimney pents serve as closets for <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> center hall is divided by an arch, with a stair to the rear.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located toward the back of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room,</b> were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|Inside, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> is {{a conference}} room {{on the main floor}} that {{includes}} a large projection system {{that can be used for}} remote feeds, such as from the state capitol across the street. A painting by John Fery is displayed over the fireplace, which the fireplace was part of the original structure in the conference room. The remainder of the interior of the building has a modern look with glass-enclosed offices surrounding an open common area. Artwork owned by the university's Hallie Ford Museum of Art is displayed in this area. The main floor of the three-story building is the second floor, which rests atop the look-out basement. A small meeting room is located above a small portion of the main floor.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is T-shaped with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> on <b>the</b> ground floor, {{the first floor}} consisting of nine bedrooms.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> {{house are}} {{furnished}} with period antiques {{and provide a}} suitable atmosphere in which to display the wall painting.|$|R

5|$|While on the trip, he did {{sketch a}} line of walking wounded, and some prisoners making {{their way to the}} rear from an early morning offensive. This became the basis of the {{painting}} The Harvest of Battle which was the largest single work Nevinson painted. It was completed in February 1919 and Nevinson arranged a 'private view' of the painting in his studio on 2 April for numerous critics and journalists. Whilst this produced some favourable reviews, notably in the Daily Express, it also led to articles claiming that the painting was so grim that it was being withheld from the public. When the painting was shown at the huge The Nation's War Paintings and Drawings exhibition organised by the Imperial War Museum in December 1919 at Burlington House Nevinson was furious to find it had not been hung in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> but rather in a side gallery. He began a campaign of vilification against all those he held responsible for this insult. Unreasonable as Nevinsons' outrage was it did have consequences; it destroyed his friendship with Muirhead Bone, who had been on the organising committee for the exhibition, made the Imperial War Museum wary of dealing with him, and blinded Nevinson himself to the high esteem in which his war paintings were held.|$|E
25|$|The {{basement}} of the Nauvoo Temple {{was used as the}} baptistry, containing a large baptismal font in the center of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{room where}} the frieze is {{displayed}} was specially constructed {{to be the same}} size as <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> in the Temple of Apollo. However, in the original placing they would have been seven metres in the air and close to the ceiling. The reconstruction puts the frieze at an easily viewable height.|$|E
50|$|The {{ceilings}} from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> castle were renovated with panelings, {{which were}} recovered, {{for some of}} them, by metal frames installed during {{the restoration of the}} 1930s.|$|R

25|$|The {{building}} is {{constructed in the}} Greek Revival style with exterior walls of sandstone. The interior consists of two rooms, a vestibule and <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room.</b> The structure underwent a series of changes during the 1940s including the enclosure of two alcoves in the vestibule. Plano Stone Church {{was added to the}} U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1990.|$|E
25|$|The {{name of the}} {{settlement}} of Hofstaðir, near Mývatn, and local tradition indicate it {{was the site of}} a hof. The site was excavated by Daniel Bruun in 1908 and again by Olaf Olsen in 1965. Since 1991, the Icelandic Archeological Institute (Fornleifastofnun Íslands - FSI) has re-investigated it; since 2002, in an international investigation under the Landscape of Settlements program. The excavations have uncovered a large longhouse with a small separate room at the north end, 42 meters long overall and 8 meters wide in the main section. It had three small protruding sections, two near the south end and one on the opposite side. There was a fireplace in the center and smaller fireplaces at both ends of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room.</b> Animal bones were found all around the inside of the walls in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room,</b> and a smaller number in the small room. Various associated buildings have also been excavated.|$|E
25|$|Guards {{entered the}} house after there was no word from Zhvania for several hours to find him in an {{armchair}} and Usupov in the kitchen. Details of the incident are still limited, although officials have {{said there was a}} gas-powered heating stove in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> of the house, where a table was set up with a backgammon set lying open upon it.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is organised by a single-loaded corridor to <b>the</b> rear, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> are entered from the organising corridor and subsidiary rooms are accessed from transverse passages. The vertical rises are on axis with <b>the</b> <b>main</b> entrance.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> were redecorated in {{the style}} of French palaces. Queen Maria Luisa of Savoy {{was in charge of the}} work, helped by her lady in waiting, Marie Anne de La Trémoille, princesse des Ursins.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} year, Old Government House in Waterloo Quadrant became {{formally}} {{part of the}} University of Auckland. The interior has been rationalised and altered {{over the years and}} although much original detailing remains in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of a palatial residence is conspicuously absent. All the spaces are fairly institutional in manner although <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> are decorated with a selection from the University's collection of New Zealand art. Various parts of the building are used as the Staff Common Room, Council reception suite, flats for visiting academics, rooms for the Federation of Graduate Women, while the former Ballroom is a lecture theatre.|$|R
25|$|Since the 2004 reopening, Crystal Palace {{has been}} host to {{four of the}} seven rooms used by Luna Park's {{functions}} business. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> stretches across the entire lower floor of Crystal Palace, and is often used for wedding receptions and other large social functions. The Midway-facing exterior of the building is host to numerous sideshow games, such as the Laughing Clowns, Crazy Crooners, and Goin Fishin'.|$|E
25|$|The ancient theatre of the city, {{established}} between 1890 and 1895, {{was replaced by}} a cinema. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> used for the theatre is now the festival hall located at the market. This room, and its natural scenery of arches, is multi-cultural and is the largest in the city in terms of capacity. On the market lies the antirouille, a municipal building for young people and allowing everyone to have access to the internet, this building has a room to organize concerts.|$|E
25|$|The wall on {{the south}} east (Datchet Road) side of the station forms a long curve, {{parallel}} with the platform, containing a series of arches with depressed heads. This wall links the station proper with the former Royal Waiting Room built for Queen Victoria. This is a small building of main room and ante rooms crowned by a turret with spirelet, and has Tudor arched windows. The interior of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> has a ribbed ceiling with a pendant finial.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundations}} are {{a system}} of load bearing bed logs that support floor joists and tongue and groove timber floors. Damage to the foundations has caused {{the western end of}} the house to subside. The wall construction is a timber frame with chamferboards to the external walls. The interior walls and ceilings are constructed from tongue and grooved boards which are finished in a dark stained varnish. Two of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> have masonry fireplaces with brick and stone chimneys. Six sets of French doors open out from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> onto <b>the</b> north side verandah. One of these has been altered to create a window.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> {{residence}} are predominately {{lined with}} vertical tongue-and-groove boards {{on the walls}} and ceilings. There are also simple timber strip cornices and skirtings throughout. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> have polished timber floors with carpet laid over some areas. The walls of the three small rooms at the rear, the last of which is reached via a short flight of timber stairs, are lined with flat sheets. There are linoleum squares on the floor in this area leading into the kitchen, with timber boards likely underneath, except in the former laundry which stands of a small slab that is finished with paint.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} major {{decorative}} touches in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> front parlor has an elaborate ceiling medallion, {{and the library}} features built in bookcases with glass cabinets. A carved balustrade on the winding, spacious central staircase is intact.|$|R
25|$|Andrew Carnegie {{was born}} in Dunfermline, Scotland in 1835, in a typical weaver's cottage with only one main room, {{consisting}} of half the ground floor which was shared with the neighboring weaver's family. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>room</b> served as a living room, dining room and bedroom. He was named after his legal grandfather. In 1836, {{the family moved to}} a larger house in Edgar Street (opposite Reid's Park), following the demand for more heavy damask from which his father, William Carnegie, benefited. He was educated at the Free School in Dunfermline, which had been a gift to the town by the philanthropist Adam Rolland of Gask.|$|E
25|$|The site itself {{suggests}} a building complex of importance, commanding extensive sea views. It was surrounded, {{on at least}} three sides, by an esplanade delimited by a semicircular wall which extended {{from east to west}} and can be followed for a length of about 62metres. Today, only the foundation stones, cut in squared limestone blocks, survive but a plan of the cluster of rectangular rooms grouped round a central courtyard can still be made out. The pavement of small white marble cubes embedded in concrete, and a few diamond-shaped tiles survived in one of the rooms until 1977, but by 1988, these had disappeared. In the centre of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room,</b> there are two well dressed oblong stones, which were thought to form part of an altar.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those which}} stand out are <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>room,</b> the bedroom (site where Simón Bolívar was born) and the cabinet, which occupy the front {{body of the}} building. They are {{decorated}} with murals executed by the painter Tito Salas. These very large paintings by Salas depict Bolívar's heroic battles and scenes during his life. In one painting at the house, Salas depicts Bolívar on a white mountain with a white bearded man with angel wings. There are also paintings of his life scenes by Martín Tovar y Tovar and Arturo Michelena, including his christening, wedding and death. There is also a tree in the backyard of the house, which is famous as {{it is said to}} be the location where Simon was taught by Rodríguez.|$|E
5000|$|The house, {{resembling}} a traditional English cottage, {{sits on a}} lush, open garden and has an interesting internal layout. The design is [...] "asymmetrical" [...] and visitors will have to change directions several times before finding <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} is noteworthy for its very rich display of stucco decorations {{of high quality}} in late baroque-early neoclassicist style. Stucco decorations adorn all <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rooms</b> of <b>the</b> manor. Additionally, there are fine baroque tiled stoves in the manor.|$|R
