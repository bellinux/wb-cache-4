25|$|In Orthodox apologetic literature, {{the proper}} and {{improper}} use of images is extensively discussed.

25|$|At {{the opening}} of the tale, Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking {{directly}} to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart, and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled at the chance to meet Mozart in person, during a salon at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find that Mozart himself lacks <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>and</b> charm of his compositions: When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber.|$|E

According to Symeon, only one who had <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>and</b> direct experience of God was empowered by God to preach and absolve the sins of others. Stephen held the view that only ordained priests had that authority. Symeon's views were colored by his own spiritual father, Symeon the Studite, who was a simple monk, unordained, and yet who preached and gave absolution. In one of his Ethical Discourses Symeon went further and wrote that one should not give absolution without having first received the experience of God's grace: ...|$|E

It's not an easy listen—the vast majority of her music never has been—but if you're a fan and/or prepared for the challenge, this is as potent, heady and uncompromising as she has ever gotten, and with Smith's storied history as a musical maverick, that's saying plenty." [...] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a score of 81, indicating [...] "universal acclaim".|$|E

She later said she had written the song during a difficult phase in her life, and the song's lyrics revolve around the idea that <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>and</b> mercy of God {{can be found in}} the most difficult situations. Through her experience, she became convinced that knowing God is all-important, expressing this concept in the chorus: [...] "Your love alone is sufficient. It needs no company." [...] She stated that she wrote the song [...] "One Name Away" [...] after having watched The Tyra Banks Show.

500|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Grace</b> <b>and</b> Leo storyline was written, NBC {{worried that}} the show's {{characters}} never seemed to move forward or mature.

Greenstein commented that [...] "there was an interchangeability among the episodes from season to season. We wanted to create more continuing story arcs; we wanted to deepen the predicaments the characters are in, get the audience kind of rooting for something from week to week." [...] In November 2002, negotiations were made for Connick to play a series regular on Will & Grace; he originally signed on for only 13 episodes.

His possessions from the fort were transferred to the Château de la Croë in the south of France (where he had named the sitting room [...] "The Belvedere") in the spring of 1938, but many were damaged in transit. Edward was informed in March 1940 that the fort was no longer in his possession as his warrant to occupy <b>the</b> <b>grace</b> <b>and</b> favour residence had expired on the termination of his reign and was not to be renewed by the present sovereign, his brother, now George VI. Edward was greatly upset by this, writing in 1940 that [...] "It is crystal clear that this proposed reserving of the Fort by the use of Crown Lands {{is nothing more than a}} piece of bluff, and the first excuse that the king has been able to find to deprive me of my right to occupy the place should I ever desire to do so..." [...] Edward believed that the incident was an example of his 'brother's failure to keep his word to me' after the fort had apparently been reserved for him if he should reside once more in England.|$|E
