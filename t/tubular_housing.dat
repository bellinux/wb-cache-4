40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of the aircraft onboard cables design made by the authors has shown that it is most expedient to reduce {{the weight of the}} bonding of electrical connectors through replacing a molded housing of the plug connector by a lightweight one, while keeping to the requirements of shielding the cable bonding assembly from radio interference. 0. 15 ÷ 0. 2 mm thick aluminum foil was chosen as a material for the <b>tubular</b> lightweight <b>housing.</b> To obtain lightweight tubular products for space engineering it was suggested to use magnetic impulse welding-forming (MIWF), which applies integrated force and thermal action on the workpiece. We described the physical nature of MIWF process and defined the ranges of energy parameters affecting the quality of welded joints: operating voltage of the battery charge of capacitors, capacity of the equipment storage unit, inductance of the working tool - inductor - characterized by a number of turns. The combination of these parameters determines the energy and the duration of the action to the workpiece. The results of the experimental studies are provided.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of the gas phase {{oxidation}} of alpha-cypermethrin, a common insecticide, elucidating the decomposition pathways and formation of toxic species such as polychlorinated dibenzo-pdioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) and their precursors. Conditions investigated are similar to those encountered in post combustion and cooling-down zones of forest, agricultural and wild fires, as well as in burning of biomass contaminated or treated with pesticides. The experiments were conducted under fuel lean conditions in a <b>tubular</b> reactor <b>housed</b> in a three-zone heating furnace and operated with a dilute stream of alpha-cypermethrin in ultra high purity nitrogen and oxygen. PCDD/F were identified and quantified by high resolution gas chromatography (HRGC) -ion trap mass spectrometry (ITMS).

40|$|This article {{examines}} the thermal decomposition of alpha-cypermethrin, {{one of the most}} common pyrethroid pesticides. The objective was to identify its decomposition pathways and to gain an understanding into the formation of toxic species in the environment, including those that may behave in combustion systems, especially in fires in the environment, as precursors for PCDD/F (polychlorinated dibenzo-. p-dioxins and dibenzofurans). The experiments were conducted under non-oxidative conditions using a <b>tubular</b> reactor <b>housed</b> in a three-zone heating furnace and operated with a dilute stream of alpha-cypermethrin in 99. 999 % nitrogen. The condensable products were identified and quantitated, after being collected in a cold solvent trap and in an activated charcoal cartridge. The study revealed the formation of pollutants including precursors of toxic PCDD/F such as diphenyl ether and phenol. It was also found that the decomposition of alpha-cypermethrin involved parallel pathways of an unusual vinylcyclopropane rearrangement-. cum-aromatisation reaction transforming alpha-cypermethrin and a rupture of the C(O) O. C(C. N) linkage. The former is similar to that occurring in the decomposition of permethrin pesticide, whereas the latter constitutes a newly discovered channel for the formation of pollutants. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations allowed us to attribute the occurrence of the second pathway to the effect of the cyanide group in significantly weakening the O. C bond...|$|R
50|$|The Kk 62 is a gas-operated, belt-fed {{automatic}} weapon. It uses a tilting bolt that locks {{into the}} roof of the receiver, and fires from an open bolt. The overall system of operation is modeled on that found in the Czech vz. 52 machine gun. The Kk 62's receiver is machined from steel, and a <b>tubular</b> metal buttstock <b>houses</b> the recoil spring. The Kk 62 is fed from the right-hand side, from 100-round belts that are carried in pouches that clamp onto the receiver wall. The Kk 62 has no quick-change barrel, which is a serious drawback when sustained firepower is required; the original usage doctrine was based on agile hit-and-run tactics rather than suppressive fire from a strong position. The cleaning rod is attached to right side of the butt and receiver. A side-folding carrying handle is provided in front of the feeding mechanism. The Kk 62 is also equipped with a folding bipod.|$|R
5000|$|All of the D.III series were {{generally}} {{very similar to}} other models, {{with the exception of}} the piston profile, carburetor details and valvetrain details. It appears that upgrades were available for many of the engines, certainly for the III to IIIa, and IIIa to IIIaü. It would seem unlikely that early III's would ever make it to the IIIaü standard, as they would almost certainly have been worn out in service before then. The valvetrain changes concerned the layout of the rocker arms that operated the valves. Early models had square rocker boxes positioned directly over the cylinders with the rocker arms exiting through vertical slots, one cut into each of the opposing sides of the boxes, as shown at left. The earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] rocker arm design had also been used for the Mercedes D.I and D.II engines' valvetrains. In later versions of the D.III engines, the boxes were relocated rearward on the <b>tubular</b> camshaft <b>housing,</b> and the now easily-sealable cylindrical rocker arm shafts protruded forwards through the front surfaces of the boxes, operating the now fully exposed rocker arms with the exposed shaft ends, as shown at right. The newer arrangement was stated as being interchangeable as a set with the complete camshaft, rocker boxes, rocker arms and valve springs, with the D.III's earlier [...] "side-slot" [...] cam drive system design - the later system seems to have influenced both Packard's and Hall-Scott's engine designers to adopt a nearly identical [...] "slotless" [...] valvetrain design feature for the Liberty L-12 Allied V-12 aviation engine.|$|R

40|$|The author {{investigated}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Roberts Durometer, an instrument developed to measure human tissue hardness for a study on breast engorgement. The instrument is a small portable pressure gauge comprising a probe attached to a spring and contained in a <b>tubular</b> <b>housing,</b> connected to a dial gauge. The instrument was first trialed using foam rubber of differing hardness and football bladders of differing hardness. It was then used to measure the hardness of a non-pregnant, non-lactating human breast, followed by trials on postpartum women comparing breast tissue hardness on the day of birth with that of subsequent days. The instrument detected significant differences in hardness of foams, football bladders and human breast tissue. It was therefore considered suitable for measuring, in both research and clinical applications, hardness of breast tissue, which is a major physical feature of breast engorgement. Other clinical applications could include the hardness of abdominal and other skin tissues in conditions such as ascites, peritonitis and cellulitis...|$|E
40|$|Mature euspermatozoan {{ultrastructure}} {{is described}} for seven {{species of the}} rissooidean family Baicaliidae (endemic to Lake Baikal, Russia) -Liobaicalia stiedae, Teratobaikalia ciliata, T. macrostoma, Baicalia carinata, Pseudobaikalia pulla, Maackia bythiniopsis, M. variesculpta, and M. herderiana. For comparison with these species and previously investigated Rissooidea, two species of the Lake Baikal endemic genus Benedictia (B. cf. fragilis and B. baicalensis; Hydrobiidae: Benedictiinae of some authors, Benedictiidae of other authors) in addition to Lithoglyphus naticoides (Hydrobiidae: Lithoglyphinae) and Bythinella austriaca (Hydrobiidae: Bythinellinae) were also investigated. Paraspermatozoa were not observed {{in any of the}} species examined, supporting the view that these cells are probably absent in the Rissooidea. In general, the euspermatozoa of all species examined resemble those of many other caenogastropods (basally invaginated acrosomal vesicle, mid-piece with 7 - 13 helical mitochondria, an annulus, glycogen piece with nine peri-axonemal tracts of granules). However, the presence of a completely flattened acrosomal vesicle and a specialized peri-axonemal membranous sheath (a scroll-like arrangement of 4 - 6 double membranes) at the termination of the mid-piece, clearly indicates a close relationship between the Baicaliidae and other rissooidean families possessing these features (Bithyniidae, Hydrobiidae, Pyrgulidae, and Stenothyridae). Euspermatozoa of Benedictia, Lithoglyphus, Bythinella, and Pyrgula all have a solid nucleus, which exhibits a short, posterior invagination (housing the centriolar complex and proximal portion of the axoneme). Among the Rissooidea, this form of nucleus is known to occur in the Bithyniidae, Hydrobiidae, Truncatellidae, Pyrgulidae, Iravadiidae, Pomatiopsidae, and Stenothyridae. In contrast, the euspermatozoa of the Baicaliidae all have a long, <b>tubular</b> nucleus, <b>housing</b> not only the centriolar derivative, but also {{a substantial portion of the}} axoneme. Among the Rissooidea, a tubular nuclear morphology has previously been seen in the Rissoidae, which could support the view, based on anatomical grounds, that the Baicaliidae may have arisen from a different ancestral source than the Hydrobiidae. However, the two styles of nuclear morphology (short, solid versus long, tubular) occur widely within the Caenogastropoda, and sometimes both within a single family, thereby reducing the phylogenetic importance of nuclear differences within the Rissooidea. More significantly, the occurrence of the highly unusual membranous sheath within the mid-piece region in the Baicaliidae appears to tie this family firmly to the Bithyniidae + Hydrobiidae + Stenothyridae + Pyrgulidae assemblage. Eusperm features of Benedictia spp. strongly resemble those of hydrobiids and bithyniids, and neither support recognition of a distinct family Benedictiidae (at best this is a subfamily of Hydrobiidae) nor any close connection with the hydrobiid subfamily Lithoglyphinae...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Of great benefit, but {{not limited}} to {{seafloor}} mineral exploration, is a technique that fairly rapidly determines the composition of a drilled vibracore (in a time comparable to the time involved in obtaining the core). The rapid assessment is desired to predict whether a given region warrants further exploration by coring. A proposed monitoring system, based on neutron capture gamma ray analysis, consists of a container tank filled with water and <b>tubular</b> extensions that <b>house</b> a Cf- 252 neutron source and a detector positioned within the tank. The core sample is passed through the system in stop and count steps. The net count rates, due to "signature" capture gamma rays from neutron capture in elements in the core sample, are proportional to the amount of the element responsible for emitting the capture gamma ray. The proposed system was modeled and simulated by the Monte Carlo method to predict the relationship between the response of the detector and the elemental concentrations within the sample. Accurate and detailed treatment of neutron transport and gamma ray production and attenuation within the system were employed not only to predict the relationship of the photopeak responses with respect to elemental concentrations, but also to permit investigation of the design parameters and structural material changes in the system. The developed Monte Carlo code utilizes a variety of variance reduction techniques, such as implicit absorption with Russian Roulette and deterministic production of the gamma rays of interest, along with a form of correlated sampling to predict simultaneously the responses over a range of interest of the elemental concentrations. The predicted results were compared with predictions obtained from a well established general purpose Monte Carlo code (MCNP) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} the planar {{deformation}} of a thin elastic wire inside a <b>tubular</b> <b>housing</b> with clearance. The center {{line of the}} tube {{is assumed to be}} {{in the shape of a}} planar circular arc. The wire is under longitudinal compression at the ends. This mechanics problem can be found in the stent deployment procedure commonly adopted in treating patients with coronary artery diseases. The tube and the wire are meant to model the patient’s artery and the thin guidewire used in endovascular surgery, respectively. When the leading end of the guidewire encounters a blockage in the artery, the total length of the guidewire inside the artery varies as the wire undergoes bending deformation through the pushing at the other end. As a consequence, the leading end of the guidewire may not move forward the same distance that it is pushed in by the surgeon from the input end. It is also found that there exists a range of pushing force magnitude, in which one force magnitude may correspond to three different deformation patterns. Therefore, a deformation pattern jump may occur simply by adjusting the direction of the input force while holding the magnitude of the force constant. All these mechanics problems add more challenges to the surgeon’s delicate tasks in performing the surgery effectively...|$|E
