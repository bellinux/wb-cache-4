5|$|Like all French draft breeds, the Norman Cob was {{threatened}} by the advent of mechanization in farming. The only option left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman Cob avoided this, {{through the efforts of}} Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a reorientation of <b>the</b> <b>Cob</b> breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman Cob in appearance.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on <b>the</b> <b>cob.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{feedstock}} chosen has {{the major}} {{advantage of being}} a byproduct of the farming process, in fact a research on the population showed {{that there was not}} a specific use for <b>the</b> <b>cobs.</b> Furthermore, this particular fuel is characterized by low ash content that is a fundamental feature for low maintenance gasification processes [26]. On the other hand, the major disadvantages are the size of <b>the</b> <b>cobs,</b> <b>the</b> high porosity and the low lignin content [14, 15, 27]. These two factors may influence the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>cobs</b> in <b>the</b> gasifier. First of all, <b>the</b> <b>cobs</b> need to be broken into pieces in order to match the requirements of the gasification system [17], furthermore, due to the porous structure, the dust content in the gas can be higher than the usual values for woodchips gasifiers [14, 15].|$|R

25|$|When {{democracy}} was restored in 1982, Lechín {{and the other}} leaders of the FSTMB and COB returned to the political arena. In his restored position as top labor leader in the country, he strongly criticized the economic policies of president Hernán Siles Zuazo (1982–85), coming close to toppling his beleaguered regime with crippling strikes and other non-cooperation measures. Lechín also vigorously opposed the neoliberal administration of Víctor Paz Estenssoro, who served his fourth term from 1985 to 1989. The closure {{of most of the}} country's tin mines by Paz Estenssoro (due to declining production and the collapse of world prices) led to considerable in-fighting in the unions. In 1987, Lechín—now aged 73—retired from the leadership of the FSTMB and was voted out as head of <b>the</b> <b>COB.</b> He was replaced in the FSTMB by Filemón Escobar and by Genaro Flores in <b>the</b> <b>COB.</b>|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{mainland}} practices, corn was not {{ground into}} flour and baked into bread, but was cooked and eaten off <b>the</b> <b>cob.</b> Corn bread becomes moldy faster than cassava {{bread in the}} high humidity of the Caribbean. Corn was also used to make an alcoholic beverage known as chicha. The Taíno grew squash, beans, peppers, peanuts, and pineapples.

40|$|Perceptual {{learning}} is the improved performance that follows {{practice in a}} perceptual task.

25|$|Despite highly popular measures, {{such as the}} {{nationalization}} of the holdings of the Gulf Oil Company, Ovando failed to gain popular support. Popular enthusiasm over the nationalization was short lived. Disagreement over compensation, a boycott of Bolivian crude oil on the international market, and a general downturn in the economy became divisive factors. Even though Ovando legalized <b>the</b> <b>COB</b> and withdrew troops from the mining camps, lasting worker support for the regime was not ensured.

25|$|Popping {{results are}} {{sensitive}} to {{the rate at which the}} kernels are heated. If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high pressures and rupture the hull before the starch in the center of the kernel can fully gelatinize, leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers. Heating too slowly leads to entirely unpopped kernels: the tip of the kernel, where it attached to <b>the</b> <b>cob,</b> is not entirely moisture-proof, and when heated slowly, the steam can leak out of the tip fast enough to keep the pressure from rising sufficiently to break the hull and cause the pop.|$|E

25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of both grain feed and fodder for {{livestock}}. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried kernels are used as feed. They are often kept on <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> for storage in a corn crib, or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the corn stover) can be used later as fodder, bedding (litter), or soil amendment. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually chopped all at once and ensilaged, as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. Before the advent of widespread ensilaging, it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today ensilaging can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.|$|E
