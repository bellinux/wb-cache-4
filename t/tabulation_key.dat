40|$|The {{literature}} survey contains a brief outline {{of how to}} manage the breeding stock in beef cattle {{as well as a}} short summary of beef cattle diseases. The focus is on udder diseases with respect to the frequency of their occurance, how to classify and to diagnose them, and how to treat them. Also examined is the relationship between the cow and its calf and the sucking behavior of the latter. The impirical study looked at udder diseases with cows which had already been used for dairy purposes and which changed over from dairy cows to beef cows. The aim was to investigate the frequency of the various causes for this diseases, any predisposition {{on the part of the}} animals, typical symptoms, and the consequences of this problem. Two breeds were considered, namely, Schwarzbunte and Fleckvieh. The data was collected by examining the udders at 4 fixed intervals per year for two years in a row. In the first year 99 cows were examined, and during the second year 108 animals. It was possible to include 53 cows during both years (longitunal study). In addition to this kind of data the sucking behavior of the calves was also investigated. A special study was devoted to the question wether there is a relationship between the cow`s udder diseases and the sucking behavior of its calves. It turned out that, in general, udder diseases with the animals, which changed over from dairy cows to beef cows were not more frequent than with ?normal? beef cows. During the first year clinical mastiditis was found with 7, 3 % - 20, 2 % of the animals quarters and 24, 2 % - 47 % with al the cows. For the second year the figures were 16, 2 % - 25, 5 % for the quarters and 47, 3 % - 59, 2 % for all the cows. One problem was the high death rate of the cows (4, 7 % during the first year and 1, 7 % during the second year) as well as the frequency of veterinarian treatment. Also, the losses among the calves were relatively high (10 % during the first year, 5, 4 % during the second year). However, after weaning the calves gained weight at satisfactory daily rates. During the first year the average was 1284 g for the calves younger than 150 days, and 1127 g for the calves older than 200 days. The change-over from dairy cows to beef cows to establish a beef herd by cross breeding seems to be possible if one is prepared to accept above average losses.

40|$|Aim: To {{compare and}} {{contrast}} job descriptions for nursing roles in out-of-hours (OOH) services to obtain a general understanding of what is required for a nurse working in this job. Background: OOH services provide nursing services to patients either through telephone or face to face contact in care centres. Many of these services are newly created giving job opportunities to nurses working in this area. It is vital that nurses know what their role entails but also that patients and other professionals know how OOH nurses function in terms of competence and clinical role. Design: Content analysis of OOH job descriptions. Method: Content analysis of {{a convenience sample of}} 16 job descriptions of OOH nurses from 5 OOH care providers across England was undertaken. The findings were narratively synthesised, supported by <b>tabulation.</b> Results: <b>Key</b> role descriptors were examined in terms of: job titles, managerial skills, clinical skills, professional qualifications and previous experience. Content analysis of each OOH job description revealed a lack of consensus in clinical competence and skills required related to job title although there were many similarities in skills across all the roles. Conclusion: This study highlights key differences and some similarities between roles and job titles in OOH nursing but requires a larger study to inform workforce planning. Relevance to clinical practice: OOH nursing is a developing area of practice which requires clarity to ensure patient safety and quality care...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the evidence base on the effectiveness of workforce interventions for improving the outcomes for older people with cancer, as well as analysing key features of the workforce associated with those improvements. Design: Systematic review. Methods: Relevant databases were searched for primary research, published in English, reporting on older people and cancer and the outcomes of interventions to improve workforce knowledge, attitudes or skills; involving a change in workforce composition and/or skill mix; and/or requiring significant workforce reconfiguration or new roles. Studies were also sought on associations between the composition an d characteristics of the cancer care workforce and older people's outcomes. A narrative synthesis was conducted and supported by <b>tabulation</b> of <b>key</b> study data. Results: Studies (n= 24) included 4555 patients aged 60 + from targeted cancer screening to end of life care. Interventions were diverse and two-Thirds of the studies were assessed as low quality. Only two studies directly targeted workforce knowledge and skills and only two studies addressed the nature of workforce features related to improved outcomes. Interventions focused on discrete groups of older people with specific needs offering guidance or psychological support were more effective than those broadly targeting survival outcomes. Advanced Practice Nursing roles, voluntary support roles and the involvement of geriatric teams provided some evidence of effectiveness. Conclusions: An array of workforce interventions focus on improving outcomes for older people with cancer but these are diverse and thinly spread across the cancer journey. Higher quality and larger scale research that focuses on workforce features is now needed to guide developments in this field, and review findings indicate that interventions targeted at specific subgroups of older people with complex needs, and that involve input from advanced practice nurses, geriatric teams and trained volunteers appear most promising...|$|R
40|$|Background: Compassion {{has been}} {{identified}} as an essential element of nursing and is increasingly under public scrutiny in the context of demands for high quality health care. While primary research on effectiveness of interventions to support compassionate nursing care has been reported, no rigorous critical overview exists. Objectives: To systematically identify, describe and analyse research studies that evaluate interventions for compassionate nursing care; assess the descriptions of the interventions for compassionate care, including design and delivery of the intervention and theoretical framework; and to evaluate evidence for the effectiveness of interventions. Review methods: Published international literature written in English up to June 2015 was identified from CINAHL, Medline and Cochrane Library databases. Primary research studies comparing outcomes of interventions to promote compassionate nursing care with a control condition were included. Studies were graded according to relative strength of methods and quality of description of intervention. Narrative description and analysis was undertaken supported by <b>tabulation</b> of <b>key</b> study data including study design, outcomes, intervention type and results. Results: 25 interventions reported in 24 studies were included in the review. Intervention types included staff training (n?=? 10), care model (n?=? 9) and staff support (n?=? 6). Intervention description was generally weak, especially in relation to describing participants and facilitators, and the proposed mechanisms for change were often unclear. Most interventions were associated with improvements in patient-based, nurse-based and/or quality of care outcomes. However, overall methodological quality was low with most studies (n?=? 16) conducted as uncontrolled before and after studies. The few higher quality studies were less likely to report positive results. No interventions were tested more than once. Conclusions: None of the studies reviewed reported intervention description in sufficient detail or presented sufficiently strong evidence of effectiveness to merit routine implementation of any of these interventions into practice. The positive outcomes reported suggest that further investigation of some interventions may be merited, but high caution must be exercised. Preference should be shown for further investigating interventions reported as effective in studies with a stronger design such as randomised controlled trials...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{economic}} relation between China and Nigeria in the area of foreign direct investment (FDI). Design/methodology/approach – The study employed the use of quantitative (descriptive analysis such as ratios, percentages and correlation as well as cross <b>tabulations),</b> qualitative (<b>key</b> informant interviews and surveys) and case studies – for example the railway transport project handled by the Chinese. The use of surveys assisted the study to generate firm-level data that allowed the analysis of China-Nigeria investment relations with respect to concerns such as the employment effects as well as the competitive and/or complementary effects of Chinese firms to local firms. The use of content analysis of relevant documents and reports obtained from various sources was equally involved to corroborate the results obtained from primary data. Findings – The findings reveal that the major characteristic of Chinese investment in Nigeria is its concentration in a few sectors that are of strategic interest to China, especially in the extractive industries which are carried out largely by state-owned enterprises or joint ventures. In addition, the analysis clearly shows that the engagement with China, just like any bilateral relationship, has some advantages and disadvantages and that optimal outcome of the engagement will depend on the policies and institutions that are put in place to maximize the complementary effects and to minimize the competing effects. However, there is need to ensure implementation of laws and regulations in Nigeria and to ensure compliance by the Chinese investors. Originality/value – This is the first study to carry out an empirical analysis of the China-Nigeria relation. The study was able to establish the sectors where the incoming FDI from China is directed and the extent at which Chinese FDI is bundled with inflows of aid. The study was also able to show that the incoming Chinese FDI are in resource seeking, and the output targeted at the external market. The study will be of value to academia and to policy makers who are interested in studying the China-Africa relation.

40|$|BackgroundInappropriate use of non-prescription {{remedies}} {{by persons}} living with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (PLHIV) may result in adverse events or potentiate non-adherence to prescribed medications. This study investigated the use of non-prescription remedies among PLHIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) from four treatment centers in southern Ghana. MethodsA mixed method design using quantitative and qualitative methods was used. This article focuses on the quantitative survey of 540 respondents. Univariate {{analysis was used to}} generate descriptive <b>tabulations</b> of <b>key</b> variables. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression modeling, respectively, produced unadjusted and adjusted associations between background attributes of PLHIV and the use of non-prescription remedies. A p-value of <[*] 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20. 0. ResultsOne out of three respondents reported the use of non-prescription remedies at least once within 3 months of the survey. Most of these were locally made and included “Angel natural bitters, concoctions from the Christian prayer centers, garlic, and mahogany syrups. ” These remedies were used concomitantly with antiretroviral medications (ARVs) — 46 % or administered with ARVs but at different times during the day (43 %). Some of the remedies were reportedly prescribed by health workers, or self-initiated during periods of ARVs shortage. Others took them based on their perception of their efficacy. Bivariate level analysis identified ART clinic site, place of residence, and ARV adherence monitoring to be significantly {{associated with the use of}} non-prescription remedies (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for covariates confirmed the location of ART clinic as the only predictor of the use of non-prescription remedies. Compared to clients at the large urban teaching hospital (Korle-Bu Fevers Unit ART center), those at the district level (Atua ART center) were ninefold more likely to use non-prescription remedies [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) [*]=[*] 8. 84; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 83 – 33. 72]. Those from a district level mission hospital (St. Martin’s ART center) were threefold as likely to use these remedies (AOR[*]=[*] 2. 610; 95 % CI 1. 074 – 9. 120). ConclusionThe use of non-prescription remedies by PLHIV on ART is common in southern Ghana. Usage is mostly self-initiated because of perceived efficacy of remedy, and was more common among clients attending rural ART clinics...|$|R

40|$|Background Around 4 {{million women}} per annum in England have a {{cervical}} screening test. Currently the age-standardised incidence of cervical cancer is around 9. 3 per 100, 000 per annum. The mortality rate in 1997 was 3. 7 per 100, 000 per annum. Liquid-based cytology {{is a new}} method of preparing cervical samples for cytological examination. Unlike the conventional ‘smear’ preparation, it involves making a suspension of cells from the sample and this is used to produce {{a thin layer of}} cells on a slide. The new intervention would thus form {{part of the process of}} population screening to reduce cervical cancer. Methods Data sources Three types of literature search were performed: • clinical effectiveness search • cost-effectiveness search • modelling search. The first two concentrated on liquid-based cytology, while the modelling search addressed the wider topic of modelling studies in respect of cervical screening. The databases searched were: • MEDLINE • EMBASE • Science Citation Index • Cochrane Library • NHS CRD: DARE, NEED and HTA • HealthSTAR • National Research Register. Inclusion and exclusion criteria All health technology assessment and related secondary research studies were included. Primary research studies were included if they attempted to measure an outcome of importance, such as comparison of liquid-based cytology with conventional cervical smears in respect of an assessment of sensitivity and/or specificity, categorisation of specimens, percentage of inadequate or unsatisfactory specimens and specimen interpretation times. All databases were searched up to November 1999. Additional material identified up to February 2000 was also included. Data extraction Data were extracted by one of the authors. <b>Key</b> <b>tabulations</b> and calculations for summary tables were checked by entering the published study data (where available) into a spreadsheet and recalculating the relevant percentages. Only those studies with a clear tabulation of the numerical data were used in the conventional smear versus liquid-cytology assessments. Results Number and quality of studies and direction of evidence There were no randomised trials using invasive cancer or mortality as outcome measures. A few studies attempted to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the existing technique with liquid-based cytology by using a histological examination ‘gold standard’. Most comparisons were split-sample studies comparing cytological results. Effectiveness There is some evidence that liquid-based cytological methods offer the following advantages over traditional smear techniques: • a reduction in the proportion of inadequate specimens • an improvement in sensitivity • a possible reduction in specimen interpretation times. Costs The estimated annual gross cost of consumables and operating equipment associated with the new technique, based on a marginal cost per slide that includes capital equipment costs depreciated over a period of 6 years, is about £ 16 million in England. Cost-effectiveness There are no studies that provide direct evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of liquid-based cytology screening. Analyses based on models of disease natural history, however, give a costeffectiveness of under £ 10, 000 per life-year gained, when screening is undertaken every 5 years, and under £ 20, 000 per life-year gained at a 3 -year interval, except under certain assumptions in respect of marginal costs and discount rates. Sensitivity analyses These results in respect of cost-effectiveness are relatively stable under most conditions. The key uncertainties are the marginal costs associated with liquid-based cytology, assumptions about improvements in sensitivity and specificity, and discounting both in terms of costs, but particularly in terms of benefits. Limitations of the calculations (assumptions made) There is inadequate evidence concerning the underlying natural history of the disease. Similarly, the true sensitivity of the screening tests, both conventional smears and liquidbased cytology, is unobservable without subjecting women to otherwise unnecessary and relatively invasive investigations. These characteristics have thus been estimated by fitting mathematical models of the disease and intervention to observable events such as actual incidence. Conclusions From the evidence available, it is likely that the liquid-based cytology technique will reduce the number of false-negative test results, reduce the number of unsatisfactory specimens and may decrease the time needed for examination of specimens by cytologists. It is not possible to be certain whether this will reduce the incidence of invasive cancer, but modelling studies have suggested that this would occur. In this review, it became clear that increasing the coverage of the programme, and the use of more effective cervical specimen collection devices are also important ways of reducing the burden of the invasive cervical cancer. The use of automated image analysis devices, and of other testing of the specimens (such as for human papillomavirus) have not been covered in this review. Recommendations for research A full cost-effectiveness study of liquid-based cytology based on a trial of its introduction in low-prevalence populations would provide more definitive information than is possible by modelling studies. However, an assessment of the uncertainties about the values and assumptions used in the economic model indicates that the key areas for further research are: • the marginal cost per sample of the new technologies compared with conventional screening methods • the improvement in the rate of inadequate samples and the relative specificity of the liquid-based cytology techniques. Expiry date It is recommended that the conclusions from this report are revisited in July 2001 or earlier if new trials and technologies emerge before then...|$|R
