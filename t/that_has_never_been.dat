5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than they have any other school outside of the state of Michigan <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a member of the Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants so highly ranked.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson was an American {{musician}} and entertainer. He {{is known to}} have written, recorded and filmed material <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> officially released. Many of the pop singer's unreleased songs have been registered—usually by his company Mijac Music—with professional bodies such as the United States Copyright Office, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI), American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency (CMRRA) and EMI Music Publishing. This list, however, only documents the songs explicitly cited as being unreleased and, therefore, does not contain every unreleased Jackson song registered with such bodies.|$|E
5|$|Since 1991, Maribor has {{competed in}} the Slovenian PrvaLiga, {{the highest level of}} {{football}} in the country. The team was one of the league's founding members and is one of only three clubs <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> relegated from the top division. The first major success for the club was during its first season as part of the Slovenian football system when it won the Slovenian Cup, a feat it has repeated nine times to date. The club has won the league championship 14 times in 26 seasons and is the most successful club in the country. In 2009 the club also won the Slovenian Supercup for the first time, the last domestic trophy missing among the club's honours.|$|E

5|$|The Kaluza–Klein {{theory and}} {{subsequent}} attempts by Einstein to develop unified field theory were never completely successful. In part {{this was because}} Kaluza–Klein theory predicted a particle <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> shown to exist, {{and in part because}} it was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron's mass to its charge. In addition, these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics, which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism, as well as new nuclear forces that were being discovered throughout the middle part of the century. Thus it would take almost fifty years for the idea of new dimensions to be taken seriously again.|$|E
5|$|This coup {{was soon}} {{followed}} {{by his first}} world title in 1942. Over the following three decades, Crane won almost two dozen major championships, including the World Crown in 1946, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1972, the Ballantine International Championship in 1965, the International Roundrobin championship in 1968, and the World Series of Billiards in 1978 at age 65. Of these triumphs, his win at the 1966 World Crown is the most celebrated. At that tournament, he ran 150 and out in the finals, never letting his opponent {{back to the table}} after an early safety battle; an accomplishment <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> equaled. Crane also holds the record for the most runner-up finishes for the World Crown with 13.|$|E
5|$|The radio postgame show {{reported}} the Warriors defeating the Knicks 169–150. However, the official scorer's report recorded {{the game as}} 169–147, a discrepancy <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> explained. Chamberlain made 36 of 63 field-goals and 28 of 32 free throws, the latter a far better rate than his roughly 50% career average. In two earlier games at Hershey that season, Chamberlain had made a combined 27of38 free throws, 71percent. The basket rims at the arena were aged, flimsy, and forgiving. Balls would bounce off of typical firm rims, whereas balls near the rim in Hershey were apt {{to get a good}} roll and fall in. Playing all 48minutes of the game, Chamberlain set NBA records for field goals attempted (63) and made (36), free throws made (28), most points in a quarter (31), and half (59). He averaged 73points in four games that week, exceeding 60 in all of them.|$|E

Rehman scored his first goal for his new club in the AFC Cup against Sông Lam Nghệ An of Vietnam. Rehman won his first piece of {{silverware}} of his Hong Kong career by playing {{a leading role in}} Kitchees 2–1 League Cup win over cloes rivals TSW Pegasus at the Mong Kok Stadium on 15 April 2012. Rehman helped Kitchee retain the Hong Kong First Division League title with a 4–1 victory over Biu Chun Rangers in the last league game to clinch the title, it was his second trophy for the club and it put them in pole position to complete the domestic treble in Hong Kong Rehman and Kitchee finished the season in impressive fashion by overcoming Pegasus after penalties to win Hong Kong FA Cup Final at The Hong Kong Stadium. The victory was a historic moment for the club as Kitchee were crowned domestic treble winners, a feat <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> matched by a Hong Kong club. Rehman made it into the Hong Kong BMA First Division League team of the season at The HKFA Annual Awards dinner. Rehman also achieved the feat of becoming the first Pakistani player to play in AFC Cup.|$|E
