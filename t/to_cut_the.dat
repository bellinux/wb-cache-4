5|$|After a {{disastrous}} helicopter crash in 1999 {{resulting in the}} deaths of six Marines and one sailor, the US Navy performed an assessment of their equipment and decided among other things that they needed a new search and rescue knife.

5|$|Cannon Films {{picked up}} an option for a fourth Superman/Reeve film, with Reeve reprising the role due to his {{interest}} in the film's topic regarding nuclear weapons. However, Cannon decided <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> budget of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace from $35 million to $15 million, with poor special effects and heavy re-editing, which contributed to the film's poor reception. Warner Bros. decided to give the series a break following the negative reception of the last two Superman films.|$|E

5|$|A mugging {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> numbers of police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E
5|$|After Resaca de la Palma, Mexican {{forces were}} cleared from the Texan {{side of the}} Rio Grande, but {{additional}} operations were required to force Mexico {{to agree to the}} border. The Mexican commander, General Mariano Arista, withdrew his forces to Linares, with Taylor in pursuit for sixty miles before returning to Fort Brown for reinforcements. He then marched against Monterrey. The heavily fortified city had a 10,000-man garrison under Arista's replacement, General Pedro de Ampudia, but its supply line running south to Saltillo was vulnerable. Lacking the heavy artillery needed for a siege, Taylor planned a double envelopment, with one division executing a turning movement <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> supply line and attack from the west and south, and his other two divisions assaulting {{the north side of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|Arizona {{came into}} the fourth quarter {{trailing}} Nevada by 17 points.

Nevada then took a 48-35 lead on a 25-yard field goal from Hardison, for a 13-point lead with only 1:44 left in regulation time. Arizona, with no timeouts and needing two scores to win the game, was able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>the</b> lead down to 48-42 with only 42 seconds left in regulation on a short touchdown pass from Scott to Hill. After Marquis Flowers successfully recovered the onside kick, Arizona quickly scored with another short Scott touchdown pass, this time to Tyler Slavin, to take tie the game at 48 with only 19 seconds left in regulation. Prior to the extra point attempt, Nevada coach Chris Ault called his final timeout to try to ice kicker John Bonano. The tactic was unsuccessful, as Bonano made the extra point to give Arizona a one-point lead. The final 19 seconds of the game were {{the only time that}} Arizona led. Arizona held on to the lead after Arizona's Flowers intercepted a Fajardo pass with a few seconds remaining in the game.|$|E
