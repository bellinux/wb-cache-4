5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger <b>than</b> <b>his</b> backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive <b>than</b> <b>his</b> opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
5|$|Farrar has {{characterized}} the songwriting process for this album as easier <b>than</b> <b>his</b> typical work composing new lyrics as it {{allowed him to}} be less self-conscious.|$|E
5|$|He was {{generally}} more highly regarded for his batting <b>than</b> <b>his</b> wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism {{for the quality}} of his glovework. Despite this, he was at times considered to be a better wicket-keeper than two of his rivals for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather <b>than</b> <b>his</b> keeping ability. For a couple of matches during 2012, he was used as an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets.|$|E

5|$|A few works relate Trijata to Vibhishana in a {{position}} other <b>than</b> <b>his</b> daughter. The Ananda Ramayana and the Marathi Bhavartha Ramayana of Eknath regard Trijata as the wife and the sister of Vibhishana (thus sister of Ravana) respectively. The Jain version, the Vasudevahindi of Samghadasa Gani, says Trijata is a sister of Ravana, Vibhishana, Kumbhakarna, and Shurpanakha. Jayamangala's commentary on the Bhattikavya also describes Trijata as Ravana's sister.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Best Of – Volume I (1996), Van Halen renegotiated their {{royalties}} with their label Warner Bros. In 2004, Roth discovered {{that the rest of}} the band had renegotiated a royalty rate five times greater <b>than</b> <b>his</b> for releases made during his time as lead singer. This was later rectified.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Harlan {{claimed that}} his script was less antisemitic than the Metzger/Möller script. He even {{claimed that the}} Mendes' script was more antisemitic <b>than</b> <b>his.</b> However, in rebuttal, Haggith and Newman point out that Harlan added an {{important}} sequence in which Süß {{is responsible for the}} execution of a blacksmith, a sequence which served to increase the audience's hatred for Süß.|$|E

5|$|Although Mr. Bean is {{the only}} {{significant}} character in the programme, others appear, usually as foils for his various antics. Other <b>than</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend there are more characters in each episode. However, several notable British actors and comedians appear alongside Atkinson in sketches as various one-off supporting characters, including Owen Brenman, Richard Briers, Angus Deayton, Stephen Frost, Nick Hancock, Christopher Ryan, Paul Bown, Caroline Quentin, Danny La Rue, Roger Lloyd-Pack, David Schneider and Richard Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Ares: A {{large black}} flier (bat) bonded to Henry who chooses to save Gregor rather <b>than</b> <b>his</b> bond {{when the two}} fall off a cliff. He does not know of Henry's treachery until after the fact, and so Gregor decides to bond with him to save him from banishment.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly better <b>than</b> <b>his</b> statistics would suggest. He {{was capable of}} batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E

5|$|As {{a proven}} Test player {{and the senior}} spin bowler, Ring was chosen for his second tour of England in 1953, this time under the {{captaincy}} of Hassett. It proved not much happier <b>than</b> <b>his</b> 1948 experience, though in a less strong side his eventual wicket tally, 68 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 19.89, placed him third among the regular bowlers.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's ODI {{career was}} noticeably less {{productive}} <b>than</b> <b>his</b> Test. He did, however, face the first One Day International ball ever bowled, {{and was the}} first batsman to be dismissed in what was the first ever ODI game. The match, considered a one-off at the time due to ODI cricket being in its infancy, was hastily arranged to cover a washed out 1970-71 Ashes Test.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts <b>than</b> <b>his</b> finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E

5|$|Evidently {{there was}} a burst in {{overlapping}} commitments and commission, both public and ecclesiastical, {{many of which were}} more important <b>than</b> <b>his</b> debut work at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli. Indeed, work in that church stopped around the same time. The sculptor returned to it only for occasional work over the following years {{to the end of the}} century; overall, however, work ceased until the mid-sixteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Flanders's {{voting record}} in the Senate was more {{conservative}} <b>than</b> <b>his</b> senior colleague, George Aiken, and reflected Flanders's business orientation. In his second term, a Republican majority allowed Flanders to obtain seats on the Joint Economic Committee—this committee acted in an investigatory and advisory capacity to both Houses of the Congress—the Finance Committee and the Committee on Armed Services. These assignments reflected his interests as a senator.|$|E
50|$|On February 21, 2013, Harris was traded, {{along with}} Doron Lamb and Beno Udrih, to the Orlando Magic in {{exchange}} for J. J. Redick, Gustavo Ayón and Ish Smith.

5|$|Following a {{deliberate}} break from media scrutiny, Williams released his seventh album Rudebox in October 2006 to great public anticipation. Despite a lukewarm critical reception, it matched the chart success of its predecessors, becoming Williams' seventh album {{in a row}} to reach {{number one in the}} United Kingdom and spawning the UK number-four single of the same name. The album, however, sold far fewer copies in the UK <b>than</b> <b>his</b> record label EMI had predicted.|$|E
5|$|He {{could be}} charming or vulgar, {{ebullient}} or sullen, {{he was given}} to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. But whatever he was, however he came across, he was more human <b>than</b> <b>his</b> predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and {{for much of the}} world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} his two-year-old {{season with a}} record of five wins and a second place from six starts. At the end of the season, some even believed that he was better <b>than</b> <b>his</b> sire Ormonde, the 'horse of the century'. One writer rated him ten pounds superior to the next best two-year-old La Fleche, with her being one pound superior to Flyaway. Some were more cautious, however, suggesting that Orme had not beaten any top horses.|$|E
