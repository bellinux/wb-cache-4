Our training for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights. Human rights training is also {{a very important part of}} our and other international donors' civilian capacity-building efforts in Iraq. And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from the government of Iraq, and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports of violence against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E
2500|$|Some reviewers have criticised the game's control system. Eurogamers review {{stated that}} the jump timing {{sometimes}} feels [...] "off by {{a fraction of a}} fraction of a second" [...] and that this can be a minor annoyance when attempting challenges which require dexterity and timing. In IGNs review, Chris Roper also reported issues with the control system stating that the game's heavily physics-based gameplay [...] "left a few corners on {{what should have been a}} razor-sharp control scheme". He goes on to say that the character acceleration and deceleration [...] "isn't as quick as it could be" [...] but that his biggest complaint is the way the game handles player movement between foreground, middleground and background on the 2.5D plane. He says that [...] "there are instances where it doesn't do what you want it to do, and these points stick out like a sore thumb." [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> has been raised by Media Molecule's co-founder Mark Healey who stated in an interview that [...] "The Z [...] movement is an incredibly hard thing for us to get right. There's times when it annoys me actually." [...] He went on to say they would continue refining it, suggesting improvements via a future update IGN's review commented that the story mode ended [...] "in a somewhat disappointing manner" [...] and the story as a whole doesn't make sense.|$|E

I {{would also like to}} thank Mr. Lampson from Texas as the Chairman of the Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, and Mr. Ose from the State of California, who have devoted much of their time to raising our level of awareness of the growing problem of international child abduction. [...] We are taking action on this measure {{on behalf of}} the parents of our abducted and wrongfully retained children. These left-behind parents have put their faith and trust in an international agreement, The Hague Convention, which is clear and explicit on the obligation of signatory governments to return an abducted or wrongfully retained child to his or her country of habitual residence. Nevertheless, we have found that in a number of nations, for a variety of reasons, this does not occur, and the resultant frustration, heartbreak and outrage has led us to act on the measure before us today. [...] I should also add that we need to have our State Department do more to promote compliance with The Hague Convention. The return of an abducted or illegally retained child should be on the top of the Secretary’s meetings with any official of a country involved in such cases. [...] This is not a problem that should be handled as a routine exchange of diplomatic notes or phone calls by junior U.S. officials to their foreign counterparts. We need to see some concern and some concrete actions by the highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a growing international problem. [...] It is our hope that by adopting this resolution, and sending it to the floor for speedy action, we will send a strong signal that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> we care deeply about. We need to get the attention of the Governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico, and Honduras that they cannot expect The Hague Convention to be a one-way street.|$|E

They are similar in doctrine and practice to the Free Will Baptists, but have evidently never had any connection with them. In addition to baptism and the Lord's supper, they also hold feet washing as an ordinance. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> would separate them from most present-day missionary Baptists in Arkansas, but would have been of little consequence in the mid-19th century.
