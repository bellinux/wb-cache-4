50|$|A cabochon stone, a {{gemstone}} {{that is not}} faceted, usually {{relies on}} the shallow angle cut {{into the side of}} the stone which helps the metal to stay in place. With a clear faceted stone, such as a diamond, a shallow groove is cut into <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> itself. <b>The</b> girdle or widest part of the gem stone is placed in <b>the</b> <b>bezel,</b> which is then pushed down over the girdle. The pressure of <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> over <b>the</b> edge of the diamond keeps it in place.|$|R
50|$|In {{making a}} typical modern <b>bezel</b> setting <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> is shaped into {{the size and}} shape of the gem and then {{soldered}} into place on the metal of the jewelry. The prepared stone is then placed into <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> and <b>the</b> metal is pressed down over the edges of stone, locking it into place.|$|R
5000|$|Analog diving watches {{will often}} feature a {{rotating}} , {{that allows for}} an easier reading of elapsed time of under one hour from a specific point. This is used to compute {{the length of a}} dive. (See Tachymeter.) Upon entering the water, the diver aligns the zero on <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> with <b>the</b> minute (or sometimes second) hand, allowing the elapsed time to be read from <b>the</b> <b>bezel.</b> This saves <b>the</b> diver having to remember the exact water entry moment and having to perform arithmetic that would be necessary if the watch's regular dial was used.On diving watches <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> is [...] "unidirectional", i.e., it contains a ratchet so it can only be turned anti-clockwise to increase the apparent elapsed time, should <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> be unintentionally rotated further during the dive. This is an important [...] "fail safe" [...] feature. If <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> could be turned clockwise, this could suggest to a diver that the elapsed time is shorter than reality, thus indicating a falsely short elapsed time reading, and therefore falsely short saturation period, an assumption that can be highly dangerous.Some diving watch models feature a lockable <b>bezel</b> to minimize <b>the</b> chance of unintentional bezel operation under water.|$|R
50|$|One {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> setting {{as compared to}} the prong setting is that the diamond is better protected from accidental rubbing or blows, and is less likely to allow the diamond to scratch or mar something it comes in contact with. <b>The</b> <b>bezel</b> setting is also more secure, so the diamond is less likely to be dislodged by the wearer's activity.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{types of}} bezels, less used in modern jewelry, are [...] "swivel bezels" [...] where <b>the</b> <b>bezel,</b> perhaps just formed {{of a stone}} with a metal rod through it, can rotate, and [...] "box bezels", where a [...] "box" [...] or cage forms <b>the</b> <b>bezel,</b> often sitting on the main ring hoop, and perhaps open at the top {{where there is a}} stone.|$|R

50|$|The {{indirect}} reading compass has graduations on <b>the</b> <b>bezel.</b> These graduations are clockwise {{round the}} face, and the zero mark {{coincides with the}} notch. To take a bearing the compass must first be aligned with the direction, then <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> must be turned so that the notch aligns with the north point of the card or needle, and the bearing can then be read {{at the far side}} of the compass.|$|R
50|$|Tissot, a Swiss luxury watchmaker, {{makes the}} Silen-T {{wristwatch}} with a touch-sensitive face that vibrates {{to help the}} user to tell time eyes-free. <b>The</b> <b>bezel</b> of <b>the</b> watch features raised bumps at each hour mark; after briefly touching {{the face of the}} watch, the wearer runs a finger around <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> clockwise. When <b>the</b> finger reaches the bump indicating the hour, the watch vibrates continuously, and when the finger reaches the bump indicating the minute, the watch vibrates intermittently.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of this lens. The original lens has a five-blade diaphragm and was manufactured in Japan until 1999. The second version (from 1999-2002) featured an improved 7 blade aperture with metal replacing plastic {{on many of the}} zoom components and [...] "MACRO" [...] instead of a flower marking the side. There was no [...] "II" [...] marking on <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> yet, but [...] "LENS MADE IN JAPAN" [...] was clearly stamped {{on the opposite side of}} <b>the</b> <b>bezel.</b> <b>The</b> Japanese version is considered the most collectable, as it was still manufactured in their primary lens factory in Japan. The third version (from 2003-2010) was manufactured and assembled in Taiwan with a 7 blade aperture, MACRO on the side, a textured case, [...] "II" [...] added to the description on <b>the</b> <b>bezel.</b> [...] "Made in Taiwan" [...] was stamped on the base of the lens. There was a final variation during the last 3 years of production where they replaced all of the gold lettering on the case with all white lettering (to cut costs).|$|R

50|$|A poison ring or pillbox ring {{is a type}} of {{ring with}} a {{container}} under <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> or inside <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> itself {{that could be used to}} hold poison or another substance. They became popular in Europe during the sixteenth century. The poison ring was used either to slip poison into an enemy's food or drink, or to facilitate the suicide of the wearer in order to escape capture or torture. In Italy, pouring to somebody a drink holding the bottle with the back of the hand facing downward, so to let something drop from a ring bezel, is called versare alla traditora (“traitor’s way pouring”) and still considered offensive.|$|R

50|$|The {{classical}} period {{showed a}} {{shift away from}} bronze to wider adoption of silver and gold. The most typical design of the period involved a lozenge bezel mounting an intaglio device. Over time <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> moved towards a more circular form.|$|R
50|$|Frenching a {{headlight}} or taillight {{is done in}} one of two ways: either removing <b>the</b> <b>bezel,</b> mounting <b>the</b> light {{deeper in}} the car's head or taillight nacelle and using the headlight rings from another car (or an aftermarket kit) to mount it deeper into the body. Or it can be done by modifying the light's mountings {{so that they can be}} removed from behind, welding <b>the</b> <b>bezel</b> to <b>the</b> body once the chrome plating is removed and painting it body colour. This gives the effect of visually lengthening the car, as well as smoothing out the body. Many customs have lights from another car transplanted in place of the original factory items, but even these are frenched as well.|$|R
