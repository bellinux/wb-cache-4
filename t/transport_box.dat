40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the presence of Salmonella sp in flocks of white laying hens. In different farms, the <b>transport</b> <b>boxes</b> of twelve flocks were inspected at arrival {{for the presence of}} Salmonella. Four positive (A, B, L and M) and one negative (I) flocks were monitored at each four weeks using bacteriological examination of cecal fresh feces up to 52 weeks. Birds were also evaluated at 52 weeks, when 500 eggs were taken randomly, and at 76 weeks, after forced molt. Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and S. enterica rough strain were isolated from the <b>transport</b> <b>boxes</b> of the four positive flocks (flocks A, B, L and M). Salmonella sp was not isolated from the <b>transport</b> <b>boxes</b> or from the feces after 76 weeks-old in flock I.

We implement object grasping based on the shape primitives in an efficient multi-stage process that successively prunes infeasible grasps in tests of increasing complexity. The final step is to plan collision-free reaching motions to execute the grasps. With our approach, our service robot can grasp object compounds from piles of objects, e. g., in <b>transport</b> <b>boxes.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Documentation of the empiric data, {{measured}} in the heating and cooling chamber to determine the thermal constant for the investigated transport boxes. Background: The transport of veterinary drugs must comply with the general standards for drug storage. Although many vehicles are equipped with active heating and/or cooling devices assuring recommended storage conditions, simple insulated transport boxes are also often used. In this study, measurements for typical transport boxes were performed under laboratory conditions {{by the use of}} a climate chamber for a temperature of - 20 °C and 45 °C to investigate the impact of box size, insulation material, liquid vs. dry filling products, filling degree and other parameters on the thermal performance of insulated boxes. Model calculations and instructions are presented to predict the retention time of recommended drug storage temperatures. Results: The measurements and the model calculations showed that the loading of the transport boxes with additional water bottles to increase the heat capacity is appropriate to prolong the retention time of the recommended temperature range of the drugs. Insulated transport boxes are not suitable to store drugs over a period of more than approximately 12 hours. For practical use, a recipe is presented to measure the thermal properties of a <b>transport</b> <b>box</b> and the related retention time for which the recommended storage temperatures can be assured. Conclusions: The following principles for drug transportation in vehicles are recommended: (1) Before transfer into boxes, drugs should always be thermally preconditioned (2) Increase the filling degree of the boxes with thermally preconditioned water bottles or re-usable thermal packs will increase the heat capacity. Do not deep-freeze the bottles or packs below 0 °C to avoid drug freezing due to contact. (3) Open the lid of the boxes only to uncase drugs that are immediately needed. (4) The bigger the box and the higher the filling degree, the longer the retention time of the <b>transport</b> <b>box.</b> (5) Wherever possible, place the drug box at a cool site inside the vehicle. (6) The monitoring of the inside temperature of the transport boxes is recommended. By the proper use of such transport boxes the recommended temperatures can be maintained over one working day...|$|E
