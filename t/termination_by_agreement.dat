40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis {{is to compare}} the legal {{regulation}} of notice of termination of employment in the legal systems of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The thesis consists of the introduction, conclusion and six chapters, each of which contains a comparison of {{various aspects of the}} two regulations. The introduction sets out the reasons for which I chose this topic and the method of processing my thesis. The first chapter characterises notice in general, its cancellation and requirements, i. e. the written form and the delivery of the notice. The second chapter focuses on the notice given by an employee and on particularities of the Czech regulation of the notice related to the transfer of rights and obligations arising from the employment relationship and the counterpart of such notice in Slovak labour law, which is the <b>termination</b> <b>by</b> <b>agreement.</b> Notice given by the employer is discussed in the third chapter. This chapter consists of three parts. The first part highlights the comparison of individual reasons of the notice, the second focuses on cases in which the notice is prohibited, and the third on the substantive conditions of the notice. The fourth chapter is divided into two parts. The first part discusses the differences in the regulation of redundancy payment accordance to the Labour [...] ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1991, Rudolf {{began work}} on a paper {{entitled}} Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz [...] "gas chambers" [...] {{on behalf of the}} Düsseldorf attorney Hajo Herrmann, a former Luftwaffe pilot. In 1993, this work was reported in the media, and Rudolf was told not to enter the Max Planck Institute again without permission. When he did so, his employment was terminated without notice. In 1994, this dismissal was converted into a <b>termination</b> <b>by</b> mutual <b>agreement.</b> In 1996, the University of Stuttgart asked Rudolf to withdraw his application for a final PhD examination, or it would be denied, rendering his PhD thesis worthless. The legal basis for this is a German law which allows universities to deny or withdraw academic degrees where the candidate has used his academic credentials or knowledge to commit a crime. Rudolf subsequently withdrew his application.|$|R
40|$|The article investigates how rebel interdependencies shape {{civil war}} outcomes. The author argues that alliances between rebel groups will have serious repercussions on the {{management}} of conflict. By examining civil war outcomes between 1946 and 2008, the author shows {{that the presence of}} multiple groups, alliances among rebels, the cumulative capabilities of one’s allies as well as the credibility and the durability of alliances shape war outcomes. Rebels have the means to avoid government defeat and continue conflict when the number of rebel groups the government has to confront simultaneously is high or when these groups cooperate against their common enemy. Findings show that while <b>termination</b> <b>by</b> peace <b>agreement</b> is unlikely for allied rebels, specifically for those that have enduring relationships, rebels with access to high levels of ally cap-abilities along with those who have credible alliance ties are likely to be the victors of war.

5000|$|Because of the {{polarity}} of {{the active}} group on each polymerizing radical, <b>termination</b> <b>by</b> chain combination is not seen in ionic polymerization. Furthermore, because charge propagation can only occur by covalent bond formation with the compatible monomer species, <b>termination</b> <b>by</b> chain transfer or disproportionation is impossible. This means that all polymerizing ions, unlike in radical polymerization, grow and maintain their chain lengths throughout the reaction duration (so-called [...] "living" [...] polymer chains), until <b>termination</b> <b>by</b> {{the addition of a}} terminating molecule such as water. This leads to virtually monodisperse polymer products, which have many applications in material analysis and product design. Furthermore, because the ions do not self-terminate, block copolymers may be formed by the addition of a new monomer species.|$|R
40|$|The ways to {{terminate}} the employment relationship The purpose of my thesis is to analyze the ways {{to terminate}} the employment relationship. The thesis deals with {{the theme of the}} termination of employment relationship in aspect of the legal regulation of the Czech Republic and compares the ways {{to terminate the}} employment relationship with the Slovak legislation. The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis. Chapter Two deals with various ways of termination of employment, such as the termination of employment relationship <b>by</b> <b>agreement,</b> <b>by</b> notice, <b>by</b> immediate <b>termination,</b> <b>by</b> <b>termination</b> within probationary period. The termination of employment relationship <b>by</b> <b>agreement</b> is a bilateral legal act, in which an employee and employer agree on the termination of the employment relationship, the employment relationship shall terminate upon the agreed day. An employment relationship may be terminated by giving notice {{on the part of the}} employer or employee. Notice must be given in writing and delivered to the other party, or otherwise it shall be invalid. The employment relationship terminates upon expiration of the period of notice, is at least two months. An employer and an employee may immediately terminate an employment relationship and [...] ...|$|R

These results support termination models in which external forces imposed on nucleic acids induce concerted rewinding of DNA and unwinding of the DNA/RNA hybrid, possibly accompanied by forward translocation of RNA polymerase, leading to transcription complex dissociation...|$|R
