5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high {{perihelion}} objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU. Their high perihelia keep {{them at a}} sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a distant orbit and a distant encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster <b>that</b> <b>passed</b> near the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Archeological {{findings}} in the fields between West and East Worldham reveal that the area has been visited and inhabited {{since at least the}} Palaeolithic era. An Iron Age hillfort, dated to around 100 BC, lay on the summit of King John's Hill, to the east of East Worldham. The Romans built a road from Chichester to Silchester <b>that</b> <b>passed</b> below the hill over what is now Green Street and Pookles Lane.|$|E

5|$|During its existence, No. 351 Squadron flew 227 combat missions: 119 {{ground attack}} sorties, 87 {{reconnaissance}} missions, 19 maritime interdictions, and two search-and-rescue missions. Of the 23 pilots <b>that</b> <b>passed</b> through the squadron, four {{were killed and}} one captured. The squadron lost nine aircraft, and 38 others suffered damage, mainly from anti-aircraft fire. The squadron was released from RAF control on 16 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{was bombed}} and sunk in a German air raid on Liverpool {{during the night}} of 7/8 May 1941. She {{was struck by a}} bomb <b>that</b> <b>passed</b> through the hull and detonated {{underneath}} her. The explosion blew a large hole in her bottom and flooded her engine room and oil tanks. The ship's structure was badly damaged enough that her stern began to sag downwards and Hurricane was moved to Bidston Dock lest she sink and block traffic in the harbour. No one was killed in the attack, although a few crewmen received minor injuries.|$|E

5|$|Nordberg Station {{was located}} in the steep road named Borgestadveien, <b>that</b> <b>passed</b> the station in a level crossing.

5|$|On December 21, 1865, {{two days}} after the {{announcement}} that the States had ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, Wilson introduced a bill to protect the civil rights of African Americans.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna with its peculiar orbit in 2004 {{led to the}} conclusion that something beyond the known eight planets had perturbed Sedna away from the Kuiper belt. That object could have been an unknown planet on a distant orbit, a random star <b>that</b> <b>passed</b> near the Solar System, or a member of the Sun's birth cluster. The announcement in March 2014 of the {{discovery of}} a second sednoid, , which shared some orbital characteristics with Sedna and other extreme trans-Neptunian objects, further raised the possibility of an unseen super-Earth in a large orbit.|$|E

5|$|The only {{exception}} to this arrangement was Operation Commando Bolt, a real-time, LORAN-based technique which utilized sensor strike zones derived from predicted target locations. These missions were coordinated by Task Force Alpha's Sycamore control center against targets <b>that</b> <b>passed</b> through strike modules (four strings of three to six sensors each). Air controllers at Sycamore then directly delivered the correct course, altitude, and speed necessary for the strike aircraft to deliver their ordnance to the correct coordinates.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} territory, {{which consisted}} of Serbia proper, {{the northern part of}} Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat was occupied by the Germans and placed under the administration of a German military government. This was due to the key rail and riverine transport routes <b>that</b> <b>passed</b> through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen {{joint station}} was congested, {{resulting}} in delayed trains, and the low, open platforms were frequently covered in oily slime {{due to the}} large quantities of fish <b>that</b> <b>passed</b> through. Agreement with the Caledonian Railway over rebuilding the station had been reached in 1899, but the companies fell out over widening the line to the south. Moving the goods station to the east was similarly complex, with conflicts with the harbour commissioners and the town council. In 1908 new platforms {{on the western side}} opened and the adjoining station hotel was bought in 1910. Foundations for the new building were laid in 1913 and the station was largely complete by July 1914, although outbreak of war delayed further progress and the station was finally completed in 1920.|$|E
