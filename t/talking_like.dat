Richardson said that Ste had portrayed the whole [...] "bad thing" [...] and mellowed.

Allan wanted to change that and see him regain some old habits. These changes did not happen because Allan quit her position soon after.|$|E

It is Ruggiero's resolution of the mystery, however, that will keep fans <b>talking.</b> <b>Like</b> the best resolutions, I suppose, it raises more questions than it answers." ...|$|E

500|$|MTV {{said that}} [...] "Miles Away", the third single from the album, {{was the most}} deceptively simple track because {{although}} it appeared straightforward on the surface, {{it had a lot}} of technical tricks underneath it. The song departs from the dance theme of the album and deals with the difficulties of long-distance relationships. [...] "Miles Away" [...] is a melancholy electronic ballad, which, according to Madonna is autobiographical, and is inspired by her then husband Guy Ritchie. The relationship themed lyrics continue in the next track [...] "She's Not Me", which talks about Madonna being emulated by another woman, hence she utters the line [...] "She started dressing like me and <b>talking</b> <b>like</b> me, It freaked me out, She started calling you {{up in the middle of}} the night, What's that about?" ...|$|E

Kemper showed {{particular}} disdain for Mullin, who committed his murders {{at the same time}} in Santa Cruz as Kemper. He described Mullin as [...] "just a cold-blooded killer... killing everybody he saw for no good reason". However, Kemper himself commented on his [...] "self-righteous <b>talking</b> <b>like</b> that , considering what [...] done". Despite this concession, Kemper still manipulated and physically intimidated the diminutive Mullin, who, standing at , was over a foot shorter than Kemper. Kemper stated that [...] " [...] had a habit of singing and bothering people when somebody tried to watch TV, so I threw water on him to shut him up. Then, when he was a good boy, I'd give him peanuts. Herbie liked peanuts. That was effective, because pretty soon he asked permission to sing. That's called behavior modification treatment." ...|$|E

2500|$|In fact he {{had never}} {{abandoned}} it. The 1959 oil Francisco Carretero and A. López García <b>Talking,</b> <b>like</b> many portraits and townscapes of this period, is devoid of surrealistic devices. So are Autumn (1961) and The Sea (196170). Some of his relief sculptures conjure fantastic episodes, such as The Apparition (1963), in which a child hovers mid-air against a wall, gliding toward an open door. There are many affinities with the Tuscan Renaissance in his work in three dimensions. The ethereal Head of Carmencita (196568), for example, might at first glance be taken for a quattrocento Florentine bronze by Desiderio da Settignano.|$|E

He suspected that if any other contributor had written the piece {{it would not have been}} published and questioned her continued employment by the newspaper. Zoe Williams commented in The Guardian: [...] "It is no joke when people start <b>talking</b> <b>like</b> this. We are not 'giving her what she wants' when we make manifest our disgust.

[...] GameSpot included Soul Reaver in a 1999 list of ten computer games with the best voice acting of all time, stating about Bell that [...] "you'd never guess that the same person carried out all those voices", and of the cast [...] "there's not one weak link in the bunch, and together they create one of the best examples of voice acting in a game for PC or consoles." [...] In contrast, Douglass C. Perry of IGN felt Raziel's (and Kain's) dialogue in Soul Reaver 2 was overdone, stating that [...] "overwritten text makes them sound like caffeine-imbued English students verbally jousting in their first semester in college," [...] but liked the advancement and rebalancing of Raziel's personality and aggressiveness, and enjoyed his depiction, stating that he [...] "looks magnificently decripid [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1862, senior {{political}} {{figures in the}} Tokugawa shogunate created the post of Kyoto Shugoshoku (Kyoto Military Commissioner), {{for the purpose of}} recovering public order in the city, which was under the influence of Sonnō Jōi militants. The post of Kyoto Shugoshoku was one that changed much of the dynamic that had theretofore existed in the city. Previously, the holder of the Kyoto shoshidai (...) position had held the highest power there, supervising affairs in the Kyoto-Osaka area as the representative of the Shogun. However, the successive Shoshidai, as well as the city magistrates under their charge, were increasingly unable to secure and maintain the public order, so the post of Shugoshoku was superimposed on the existing structure. Where the Shoshidai and magistrates had been unable to secure through civil law, the Shugoshoku was to achieve through the use of military force. After much deliberation, the choice for the Shugoshoku post came down to two domains: Echizen and Aizu. Of the two, Echizen's Matsudaira Yoshinaga already held high Shogunal office as President of Political Affairs ( [...] ; seiji sōsai-shoku), so all attention was then turned to Matsudaira Katamori. As Katamori was ill, Aizu's senior Edo-based councilor Yokoyama Tsunenori was summoned to Edo Castle instead, and given word of the assignment. Katamori sent a retainer back with a request for being excused: [...] "As this is a shogunal order, we not only {{have no choice but to}} accept. Furthermore, our domain's founder Lord [...] Masayuki laid down a direct command to do so in our house code. However, our lord Katamori is still young, and our men are in the north and unfamiliar with conditions in the Capital. If we were to accept this assignment without question, and a one in ten thousand chance of disaster were to strike, we of the Aizu domain could not possibly do it all alone; the Shogun would have to get involved, as would all of Japan. We would like to consider this carefully." [...] However, the Bakufu would not listen to this refusal. Matsudaira Yoshinaga traveled personally to the Aizu residence, and confronted Katamori with harsh words invoking Aizu's distinguished past as Shogunate functionaries: [...] "If [...] Lord Masayuki were still alive, he would accept without a second thought!" [...] Rumors began to circulate that Katamori refused the assignment out of a desire for self-preservation, to which Katamori is said to have responded, [...] "If people start <b>talking</b> <b>like</b> this, it will shame our domain. There is no way I could explain this to the generations of Aizu lords who have gone before me. I have no choice but to accept." ...|$|E
