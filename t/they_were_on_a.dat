5|$|Milne's form at Bristol City {{was enough}} to {{convince}} Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson {{that he was still}} worth a contract with a top-flight club. In November 1988 he moved to Old Trafford in a £170,000 deal. Ferguson was looking to build a title winning side two years after joining United, but had seen his side finish second in the league the previous season and now <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> winless run in the league that saw them mid-table. He put Milne on the left-wing as Gordon Strachan was already established on the right-wing.|$|E

25|$|The {{first women}} police {{officers}} to receive George Medals for courage were Sergeant Ethel Bush and Kathleen Parrott, who had been separately attacked by a sex offender <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stakeout in pursuit of in 1955. In 1968 Sislin Fay Allen became the Metropolitan Police’s first black female officer. On February 1, 1971, Karpal Kaur Sandhu, born in Zanzibar but of Indian heritage, joined the Metropolitan Police and thus became the Metropolitan Police's (and Britain's) first female Asian police officer. This was before India itself had female police officers (the first female police officer in India was Kiran Bedi in 1972).|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} inquiry {{established that}} in the critical minutes before the collision, Andrea Doria gradually steered to port, attempting a starboard-to-starboard passing, while Stockholm turned about 20° to its starboard, an action intended to widen the passing distance of a port-to-port passing. In fact, they were actually steering towards each other – narrowing, rather than widening, the passing distance. As {{a result of the}} extremely thick fog that enveloped the Doria as the ships approached each other, the ships were quite close by the time visual contact was established. By then, the crews realized that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> collision course, but despite last-minute maneuvers, they could not avoid the collision.|$|E
40|$|Introduction There are now {{a number}} of hints {{indicating}} that functional genes can naturally spread across species boundaries. The existence and mechanism for such transfer are well documented, especially in the prokaryotic world. In bacteria transfer of DNA is facilitated by plasmids, by phages or by direct ingestion. The genes can be established within the cell {{by a variety of}} means. If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plasmid, <b>they</b> can <b>be</b> replicated autonomously, and if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nonreplicating molecule, <b>they</b> can <b>be</b> incorporated into the bacterial chromosome, either by general recombination or through the action of transposable elements. Transposable elements are genes which are capable of moving from one chromosome to another (Kleckner, 1981). If we then consider the fact that the transposable elements have the ability to pick up the normally stable chromosomal genes when they move (Guarente et al., 1980) we can see how it is possible to transfer any gene among many differe...|$|R

25|$|Warwickshire's long batting line-up came to {{surprisingly}} little {{use in the}} Twenty20 Cup, as they lost their first two matches, and their first win came against hapless Glamorgan. After six games, they had only scraped five points, and endured two one-run losses to Worcestershire. They managed {{to get through to}} the quarter-finals, however, thanks to big wins over Somerset and Northamptonshire. They followed that up with two wins in the National League, over Derbyshire and Durham, and also made it to the C Trophy semi-final with a five-wicket victory of Kent. So, going into the Twenty20 game with Surrey, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> five-game win streak, and after the scores were tied under the Duckworth-Lewis method the teams had to face off in a bowl-off. Warwickshire lost 3-4 to bow out of the tournament.|$|E

Kislovodsk was {{captured}} by the White Army and the Bolsheviks fled in late September, allowing the two brothers {{to return to the}} city on 6 October. However, two days later, under the threat of the Red advance, the small group of Romanovs and their entourage were forced to flee. In constant fear for their lives, the local White general advised them to travel to Anapa in the south.

25|$|The next Dutch general {{election}} was originally scheduled for 15 May 2007 as the parliament {{was to be}} dissolved on 2 April 2007. However, {{it was announced that}} elections would be held on 22 November 2006, as Prime Minister, Jan Peter Balkenende, offered the resignation of the cabinet on 30 June 2006 after one of the coalition partners, D66, withdrew their support from the cabinet the day before over Rita Verdonk's treatment of the Ayaan Hirsi Ali case. A new cabinet continued for five months as a care taker cabinet until the elections. The opposition had pressed for speedy elections because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> winning streak. The late date for the elections probably worked to the advantage of the CDA because in those five months the economy improved and in the past the biggest coalition partner had always come out as the biggest party if the economy blooms. A major issue in the campaigns was whether this improving economy was because of or in spite of the right-wing government.|$|E
25|$|On January 25, 2011, U.S. District Judge Lewis A.

The attacks were one of the deadliest non-wartime incidents of international terrorism to affect the United States; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> scale not surpassed until the September 11 attacks three years later. Ghailani, who had said he was never involved and did not intend to kill anyone, had been portrayed as cooperating with investigators - yielding information wanted by investigators- and as remorseful by his defense counsel, but that argument of relative non-involvement or remorse was not accepted. He is the fifth person to be sentenced. Four others were sentenced to life in prison in a 2001 trial in Manhattan federal court. Osama bin Laden was also named in the indictment.|$|E
