5|$|The PL.8 also {{incorporated}} several {{safety features}} {{in case of}} ditching at sea. Apart from small floats attached directly to the undersides of the lower wing, the main units of the fixed, <b>tailskid</b> undercarriage could be jettisoned on takeoff, {{in order to reduce}} the aircraft's weight. The underside of the fuselage was given a boat-like shape and made watertight for a water landing. Nungesser and Coli's plan was to make a water landing in New York, in front of the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
25|$|A trainer with {{considerable}} wing dihedral looped cane <b>tailskid,</b> tip elevators and other modifications.|$|E
25|$|The de Marçay 4 had a {{conventional}} fixed <b>tailskid</b> undercarriage, with mainwheels {{on a single}} axle mounted {{on a pair of}} V-form struts from the lower fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Late {{production}} models were fitted with modified <b>tailskids,</b> and had large pointed spinners on their propellers.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} had an oval {{section of}} wooden semi-monocoque construction, tapering to the rear. On the production SL the fuselage line over the wings merged into a forward-sliding canopy, which was {{longer than that}} of the prototype. The Mg 23 SL had a fixed monowheel undercarriage, and both integral nose- and <b>tailskids.</b>|$|R
50|$|A tailstrike is {{physically}} possible only on an aircraft with tricycle landing gear; with a taildragger configuration, the tail {{is already on}} the ground. Some aircraft which require a high angle of attack on takeoff are fitted with small tailwheels (Concorde and the Saab Draken) or <b>tailskids</b> (Diamond DA20) {{to mitigate the effect}} of tailstrikes.|$|R
25|$|The Rafale had a fixed wide track, <b>tailskid</b> undercarriage. Its wheels were on vertical, slender {{aerofoil}} section {{legs from}} {{the wings and}} were largely enclosed within magnesium alloy fairings.|$|E
25|$|The Schwalbe had fixed, {{conventional}} landing gear, {{with its}} mainwheels on a split axle sprung by rubber cords to V-struts {{from the lower}} fuselage and stabilized centrally by a transverse V-strut. There was a short, steel <b>tailskid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The N.1 was a two-bay biplane of {{conventional}} design, with staggered wings, two open cockpits in tandem, and fixed, <b>tailskid</b> undercarriage. At least eight aircraft were built {{during the war}} and converted to P.I standard after the Armistice.|$|E
50|$|The Chengdu X-7 is a two-seat basic {{training}} glider of glass-fibre construction, which first flew in October 1966. It is a high-winged monoplane with the wing braced to the pod-and-boom fuselage by single struts. The crew of two sit in tandem open cockpits, while the undercarriage is a non-retractable monowheel, with nose- and <b>tailskids.</b> 130 {{had been built}} by 1980.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to various}} long {{distance}} trips {{undertaken by the}} aircraft to participate in airshows and events, the engines are more modern {{than those in the}} original aircraft types. The original wooden <b>tailskids</b> have been replaced with tailwheels in order to operate from paved runways, and the main wheels have been equipped with modern disc brakes. In addition, modern radio equipment and flight instruments have been installed in each aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The Ca.61a had a conventional, fixed {{undercarriage}} with double-tyred mainwheels {{under the}} outer engines. Each wheel was hinged on a V-strut from the fuselage {{side and a}} narrow V drag strut from the aft spar to the stub axle ends. A vertical, shock absorbing strut joined the axle to the forward spar. There were <b>tailskids</b> {{at the ends of}} the booms and a large nosewheel, half buried in the fuselage below the gunner, in case of nose-overs.|$|R
25|$|The Type O had an all-steel <b>tailskid</b> undercarriage, {{with a pair}} of spoked mainwheels on split axles hinged {{from the}} centre of a {{transverse}} rod mounted on four longitudinal V-struts, arranged as an inverted W from the inner, under-fuselage interplane struts. Rubber springs damped the movement of the outer ends and wheels on landing.|$|E
25|$|The Rumpler D.I (factory {{designation}} 8D1) was a fighter-reconnaissance aircraft {{produced in}} Germany {{at the end}} of World War I. It was a conventional single-bay biplane with wings of unequal span braced by I-struts. It featured an open cockpit and a fixed, <b>tailskid</b> undercarriage. The upper wing was fitted with aerodynamically balanced ailerons and fuselage had an oval cross-section.|$|E
25|$|The Kolibri's tail was conventional, with a {{trapezoidal}} plan tailplane and elevators {{mounted on}} top of the fuselage and with a quadrantal fin and a rounded rudder that reached down to the keel. It had a very simple, fixed, <b>tailskid</b> undercarriage with the mainwheels on a short single axle held just below the fuselage underside, making the track narrow.|$|E
5000|$|The {{monoplane}} horizontal stabiliser carried servo assisted elevators {{and a pair}} of fins with horn balanced rudders. These {{were also}} servo assisted, with the servo surfaces mounted well behind the rudders' trailing edges on outriggers. [...] The main undercarriage was unusual in that on either side pairs of wheels were fitted on a long axle so that the inner one was close to the fuselage and the outer one beyond the engine and inner bay. The P.32 was initially fitted with a pair of <b>tailskids,</b> soon replaced with a tailwheel with a little faired leg.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was an equal span pusher biplane with a monoplane tailplane and an elevator mounted on booms {{forward of the}} wings, the elevator being extended outboard of the supporting booms. Single-acting ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings. The Green engined aircraft had a single rudder mounted underneath the tailplane, while Grace's E.N.V. engined example had an additional rudder mounted above it. The undercarriage was simpler than Farman's design, and consisted {{of a pair of}} wheels mounted on an axle attached to the skids: supplementary <b>tailskids</b> were attached {{to the ends of the}} tail booms.|$|R
25|$|Construction {{was entirely}} of wood with fabric {{covering}} {{on the wings}} aft of the mainspar. The pilot and instructor sat in tandem, with the student forward of the wings and the instructor immediately aft of the mainspar in the wing centre-section. The seating arrangement allowed the aircraft to be flown {{with one or two}} pilots without the need for ballast to adjust the centre of gravity. A single mainwheel with nose and <b>tailskids</b> comprised the undercarriage, with the aircraft sitting nose down on the nose skid with the front cockpit occupied. Large DFS style airbrakes extended from upper and lower wing surfaces aft of the mainspars.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent {{versions}} introduced forward sweep to the wings, a more aerodynamic canopy, airbrakes, and a tailwheel {{in place}} of the <b>tailskid.</b> By 1982, Scheibe had built over 300 of these aircraft, and Stark Ibérica built a number of the Bergfalke III version under license in Spain. Scheibe also developed a motorglider version as the Bergfalke IVM but this did not enter production.|$|E
25|$|The Victoria was a twin-engined biplane {{transport}} with {{a conventional}} landing gear with a <b>tailskid.</b> The design mated a similar fuselage of the earlier Vernon transport with the wing of the Virginia bomber, which was developed in parallel. It was also powered by two Napier Lion engines. The enclosed cabin had room for 24 troops on collapsible canvas seats arranged {{along the sides of}} the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} of the 28VD had {{retractable}} mainwheels, mounted on shock absorbing forward-raked, parallel legs from the wing. These were hinged {{to the lower}} fuselage on opened U-shaped frames. Retraction was vacuum-powered; to raise the wheels {{the tops of the}} legs were translated outward, swinging frames and wheels upwards. The <b>tailskid</b> was fixed to a small ventral extension of the fuselage under the fin.|$|E
50|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} that the British production lines of the S.VII had lower quality standards than their French counterparts, resulting in aircraft with degraded performances and handling. Poor fabric sewing, fragile <b>tailskids</b> and radiators of insufficient effectiveness plagued the British SPADs. Photographic evidence shows that a number of British SPADs had the cylinder banks fairings, or even the entire upper engine cowling, cut out to compensate for the ill-functioning radiators. Most British S.VIIs were used for training purposes, front line units being equipped with French-built models. After some 220 aircraft had been produced, British production of the S.VII was halted in favour of better British types that were becoming available.|$|R
2500|$|Before {{aircraft}} {{commonly used}} tailwheels, many aircraft (like {{a number of}} First World War Sopwith aircraft, such as the Camel fighter) were equipped with steerable <b>tailskids,</b> which operate similar to a tailwheel. When the pilot pressed the right rudder pedal — or the right footrest of a [...] "rudder bar" [...] in World War I — the skid pivoted to the right, creating more drag {{on that side of}} the plane and causing it to turn to the right. While less effective than a steerable wheel, it gave the pilot some control of the direction the craft was moving while taxiing or beginning the takeoff run, before there was enough airflow over the rudder for it to become effective.|$|R
50|$|The outer wings were mounted {{high on the}} {{fuselage}} sides, carried 3° of dihedral and were of parallel chord with rounded tips. Each was supported from below {{by a pair of}} struts mounted on the lower fuselage longeron. The fuselages were simple rectangular cross section structures, built around four longerons and tapering rearwards. They carried the horizontal tail surfaces, both between them and extending outwards. The angle of incidence of this 'fixed' tail could be adjusted in flight for trimming. It carried three linked and balanced elevators. Two rectangular fins carried balanced rudders. The DB-70 had a fixed conventional undercarriage with double mainwheels on V-shaped shock absorbing legs mounted on the lower longerons, with bracing struts to the centre of the centre section. This arrangement produced a wide undercarriage track of 6.65 m (21 ft 10 in). Sprung <b>tailskids</b> were placed the extreme ends of each fuselage.|$|R
25|$|As {{completed}} the Dyott Bomber was a four-bay tractor biplane with equal-span wings. It was powered by two Beardmore 120 hp water-cooled six-cylinder engines which were mounted, without cowlings, between the wings. The aircraft had a fixed nosewheel undercarriage, with the nosewheel balanced {{by a large}} <b>tailskid.</b> It carried a crew of three, with a pilot and two gunners, in nose and dorsal positions.|$|E
25|$|In February 1918, the Admiralty {{issued a}} {{production}} order to Blackburn Aircraft, an experienced aircraft manufacturer. Blackburn delivered its first T.1 in May 1918. The aircraft immediately experienced undercarriage and <b>tailskid</b> failures, requiring redesign of those components. The T.1 also required an enlarged rudder and offset vertical stabilizer to combat its tendency to swing to the right. Fairfield and Pegler finally began production in August and October, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In early {{aircraft}}, a <b>tailskid</b> made {{of metal}} or wood {{was used to}} support the tail on the ground. In most modern aircraft with conventional landing gear, a small articulated wheel assembly {{is attached to the}} rearmost part of the airframe in place of the skid. This wheel may be steered by the pilot through a connection to the rudder pedals, allowing the rudder and tailwheel to move together.|$|E
25|$|The SB-5 is a {{cantilever}} shoulder-wing monoplane with a plywood monocoque fuselage {{which has}} an outer fibre glass skin, a single spar wooden wing with plywood skinning, and a V-tail. Its wing, with a constant chord centre section and tapered outer panels, has 2.50° of dihedral and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes at 50% chord. The pilot has an enclosed cockpit with a Plexiglass canopy and the landing gear is a non-retractable, unsprung monowheel with a <b>tailskid.</b>|$|E
25|$|The M.23 was a small, {{conventional}} low-wing cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage, the mainwheels {{mounted on}} a cranked axle, plus a <b>tailskid.</b> The fin and rudder assembly were broader and shorter {{than that of the}} M.19, though the shape varied with sub-type. A wide variety of engines were fitted, with power ranging from the 28kW (38hp) ABC Scorpion two-cylinder motor to the 112kW (150hp) of the seven-cylinder Siemens Sh 14a radial.|$|E
25|$|Professor Junkers {{originally}} {{requested the}} G 31 have landing gear that would retract into the wings. After extensive wind tunnel experiments Ernst Zindel, {{the leader of}} the design team, persuaded Professor Junkers that the gain in speed provided by reduced air resistance, would not outweigh the increased weight, cost and complexity of either retractable landing gear or simple wheel fairings. The <b>tailskid</b> incorporated a roller, to avoid damage to grass airfields(Wagner p.262–263).|$|E
25|$|The wheeled {{undercarriage}} was {{a simple}} single-axle arrangement, with oleo legs forward to the engine bulkhead and rearward bracing struts {{to the root of}} the rear wing spar. There was a rather long <b>tailskid</b> to protect the downward-extended fin. The seaplane version used a pair of floats, their low drag profile refined via Schneider Trophy experience, cross braced with a pair of horizontal transverse struts. They were mounted with N-shaped struts which sloped strongly outwards from the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} flew on 5 August 1951 as the Akaflieg München Mü13E Bergfalke I {{and by the}} end of the year, Scheibe {{had established}} his own works at the Munich-Riem Airport to produce the type as the Bergfalke II. It was a mid-wing sailplane of conventional design with a non-retractable monowheel undercarriage and a <b>tailskid.</b> The fuselage was a welded steel structure covered in fabric and enclosed two seats in tandem. The wings had a single wooden spar and were covered in plywood.|$|E
25|$|The Airco DH.3 was a British bomber {{aircraft}} of the First World War. The DH.3 {{was designed}} in 1916 as a long-range day bomber by Geoffrey de Havilland, chief designer at the Aircraft Manufacturing Company. It {{was a large}} biplane with wide-span three-bay wings, slender fuselage, and a curved rudder. It was powered by two 120hp (89kW) Beardmore engines, mounted as pushers between the wings. In addition to <b>tailskid</b> landing gear, two wheels were placed beneath the nose to prevent bumping.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before {{ordering}} the XF11C-1, the Navy {{had bought a}} company-owned Model 64A demonstrator. This had a Wright R-1820-78 Cyclone engine, slightly longer main landing-gear legs carrying wheels with low-pressure tires, a tailwheel {{in place of the}} <b>tailskid,</b> fabric-covered control surfaces on the tail, and external provision for underwing racks for light bombs as well as an under-fuselage hardpoint for either a 50gal (189l) fuel tank or the crutch that would swing a bomb clear of the propeller disc before release in a dive-bombing attack.|$|E
25|$|The Potez X was a three-engined biplane with a fixed {{nosewheel}} {{landing gear}} supplemented with a <b>tailskid.</b> The first variant was the Potez X A which was powered by three 140hp (104kW) Hispano-Suiza 8Aa piston engines, two strut-mounted between {{the upper and}} lower wings and one nose-mounted. It had an enclosed cabin for 10 passengers with the pilot in an open cockpit behind the cabin. Later the engines were changed to more powerful Hispano-Suiza 8Ab versions. Two other variants were built with 280hp (209kW) Hispano-Suiza 8Bec engines, the X B was a military variant and the X C a commercial variant.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} version had two cabane struts of long chord length supporting the upper wing. Four similar type interplane struts were used between the upper three wings, {{all of which}} had ailerons. The bottom wing had a shorter span with pairs of struts and cut outs for the landing gear wheels. Because the axle was the same height as the lower wing, the <b>tailskid</b> was very tall to prevent that wings trailing edge from contacting the ground. When tested in mid 1916 the aircraft had difficulty taking off due to shallow wing incidence and displayed dangerous tendencies {{because of a lack}} of yaw control and a major redesign was required.|$|E
