5|$|Claiming that {{corporations}} and government {{are planning to}} track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step toward a 1984-like surveillance state, consumer privacy advocates, such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems, now {{make it possible to}} require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases. <b>They</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} that Japanese robotics engineers recorded was also possible {{due to the}} friendly image that Japanese people have towards the robots. In the Western countries, people seem to picture robots as evil and dangerous creatures and <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> their jobs could be taken by robots.|$|E
25|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} common among {{children}} from, low-income, African American and Hispanic communities. This is mainly because minority children {{spend less time}} playing outside the house and staying active. Some contributors to childhood obesity is that parents would rather have their children stay inside the home because <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> gang, drug violence, and other dangers might harm them.|$|E
5000|$|People were {{suspicious}} {{of the idea of}} a large police force, possibly armed. <b>They</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> it could be used to suppress protest or support unpopular rule.|$|R
50|$|Cancer care: Sims {{argued for}} the {{admission}} of cancer patients to the Woman's Hospital, {{at a time when}} people opposed him, as <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> cancer was contagious.|$|R
50|$|Twentieth Century - a title which Columbia {{considered}} changing because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> many westerners {{would not}} {{be familiar with the}} name of the train - was in production February 22-March 24, 1934.|$|R
25|$|The Kids {{frequently}} {{appeared as}} themselves {{rather than as}} characters, and some sketches dealt directly {{with the fact that}} they were a comedy troupe producing a TV show. For example, Kevin McDonald announces that if the next sketch (which he has written) is not successful, the others are considering kicking him out of the group. In another episode, Thompson declares that he isn't gay anymore, which throws the other Kids into a panic, as <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the news will alienate the troupe's considerable gay fanbase. In yet another sketch (in which an employee, Foley, asks his boss, McDonald, for a raise) McDonald complains the setup is cliché and his character one-dimensional.|$|E
25|$|Another {{concern is}} whether {{countries}} {{which do not}} manufacture vaccines themselves, including those where a pandemic strain is likely to originate, {{will be able to}} purchase vaccine to protect their population. Cost considerations aside, <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances that it will have access to vaccines produced with those samples. So far, it has not received those assurances. However, in September 2009, The United States and France agreed to make 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization.|$|E
500|$|Lisa joins Mensa {{alongside}} Comic Book Guy, Dr. Hibbert, Principal Skinner, Professor Frink, and Lindsay Naegle. After the pleasantries, Lisa {{finds herself}} at home alongside the Mensa members, whose {{sense of humor}} is so esoteric that {{it is said to}} be enjoyed by the [...] "Dennis Miller ratio" [...] of Americans. After being bullied out of their reserved gazebo at a park by drunks and Chief Wiggum, <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Springfield's quality is poor because of the city's stupidest residents having power over their civic institutions. The Mensa group goes to confront Mayor Quimby about the gazebo incident, until he escapes from the city when he mistakenly thinks the group has evidence about his corruption. The town's constitution states that {{in the absence of the}} mayor, the town is to be governed by the smartest by geniocracy. Now in control of Springfield, the group hopes that things will become much better.|$|E
60|$|The group now {{drew closer}} together, and {{speaking}} in still lower tones, as if <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> the very bushes might overhear and betray them, they secretly plotted {{the murder of}} the mutineers.|$|R
2500|$|Some <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> Home Rule {{would become}} [...] "Rome Rule" [...] under an oppressive and {{socially}} dominant Roman Catholic Church. <b>They</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would experience discrimination, including legal disabilities analogous to those imposed on Catholics and dissenting Protestants {{under the old}} Penal Laws.|$|R
50|$|Cumbria Police {{closed the}} main bridge on Thursday night around 7 p.m. to all on foot and in cars, <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> the damage {{could have been}} caused to the bridge but a later {{examination}} showed that it was undamaged.|$|R
500|$|In what Soap Opera Digest {{named the}} year's Dumbest Male Axing in 1999, Nader {{was fired from}} the role of Dimitri and the {{character}} was killed off. The firing [...] "set off a firestorm of protest from devoted fans." [...] Those fans came {{together to form a}} group called the Loyalists and campaigned for the actor's return. They [...] "bombarded" [...] All My Children with letters centering on three major complaints concerning Nader's dismissal, as summarized in Soap Opera Digest: [...] "1) They have waited two years for a Dimitri/Erica reunion, which they won't get now that he's leaving. 2) They adore Nader's chemistry with on-screen brother John Callahan (Edmund) and don't want to lose it. 3) <b>They</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Nader has been sacrificed to make room in the budget for new- and younger- cast members." [...] In response to the last complaint, an All My Children spokesperson pointed out the storylines planned for characters over thirty years old such as Tad, Dixie, Erica, David, Edmund, and Alex.|$|E
2500|$|Some Palestinians do not {{consider}} the Bedouin to be Palestinian, and many Bedouin do {{not consider}} themselves Palestinian. Already in a tenuous situation, <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> identifying themselves with Palestinians will injure their status in Israeli society and their potential to gain respect for their rights as citizens [...] Some scholars regard these developments as an illustration of a strategy of 'Divide to Rule'.|$|E
2500|$|While some {{supporters}} of {{changes to the}} market claim that the revitalized shuk has actually helped to revitalize the whole city, others are less enthusiastic about the changes, noting that real estate prices have quadrupled since the 2000s, forcing out many older shops (like vegetable and fish shops) that were staples of the market. <b>They</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the arrival of chain stores is [...] "part of a global phenomenon that may erase local culture".|$|E
50|$|Other {{examples}} {{included the}} destruction caused by public works {{to the historic}} city center of the state capital. Some intellectuals called the destruction so appalling <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> UNESCO would retire the city's declaration as a World Heritage Site.|$|R
5000|$|B. Jungmann remarks (in Herder, K.L., I, 1567) {{that the}} Jansenist rigorism of Caulet and his clergy was partly {{responsible}} for their stubborn defiance of Louis XIV; <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> the nominees of the king would not belong to their faction.|$|R
50|$|A {{night air}} attack was {{attempted}} by the Japanese because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> the British {{would find the}} convoy, but bad weather prevented them from finding the ships and they returned to their airfields at Thủ Dầu Một and Saigon about midnight.|$|R
2500|$|Elsewhere {{in their}} proceedings, panel members have {{expressed}} {{reservations about the}} political effectiveness of using the concept of [...] "planetary boundaries" [...] : [...] "Planetary boundaries are still an evolving concept that should be used with caution [...] The planetary boundaries question can be divisive {{as it can be}} perceived as a tool of the “North” to tell the “South” not to follow the resource intensive and environmentally destructive development pathway that rich countries took themselves… This language is unacceptable to most of the developing countries as <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> an emphasis on boundaries would place unacceptable brakes on poor countries." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Mary's problems, {{the family is}} worried about Edmund's coughing; <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> he might have tuberculosis, and are anxiously awaiting a doctor's diagnosis. Edmund is {{more concerned about the}} effect a positive diagnosis might have on his mother than on himself. The constant possibility that she might relapse worries him still further. Once again, he indirectly speaks to his mother about her addiction. He asks her to [...] "promise not to worry yourself sick and to take care of yourself." [...] "Of course I promise you," [...] she protests, but then adds ('with a sad bitterness'), [...] "But I suppose you're remembering I've promised before on my word of honor." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 {{the body}} of a young woman was found in a barrel in an area of rural Iowa where Robinson {{reportedly}} had a business partner. The identity of the victim—whose remains, forensics experts say, could have been in the barrel for 20 years or more—and Robinson's possible involvement, remain open questions. [...] Kansas and Missouri police note that long stretches of Robinson's time remain unaccounted for, and <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> there are additional undiscovered victims. [...] "He's maintained the secrets about what he's done with the women, he won't ever tell, it's the last control that he's got," [...] said one investigator. [...] "There are [...] other barrels waiting to be opened, other bodies waiting to be found." ...|$|E
60|$|That they resented his presence, {{since it}} was not due to motives of piety, they very plainly signified. <b>They</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> the {{intrusion}} {{at such a time}} of a personality so worldly must raise fresh difficulties against the performance of the expected miracle.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, a National Museum of Natural History exhibit, Subhankar Banerjee's Seasons of Life and Land, {{featuring}} {{photographs of}} the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, was censored {{and moved to the}} basement by Smithsonian officials because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> its subject matter was too politically controversial.|$|R
50|$|When U.S. forces {{arrived in}} the village of Atel Mohammed, {{residents}} hid their Qur'ans and other religious items. <b>They</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> U.S. soldiers would kill them if they discovered they were Muslim. U.S. soldiers explained to the villagers that this was not the case.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{websites}} {{identify the}} beast as referring to an indistinct modern-day cartel of banking organizations, {{sometimes referred to}} as the [...] "New World Order". The theory extends to the digitization of money and the possible use of RFID chips in humans as being the mark of the beast without which none may buy or sell. [...] An example of this is consumer privacy advocates, Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems, now make it possible to require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases. <b>They</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the number of the beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation.|$|E
2500|$|Set around 155 F.E., The Merchant Princes {{takes place}} against the {{backdrop}} of a powerful Foundation, which has subjugated the neighboring Four Kingdoms and expanded its commercial and technological empire throughout numerous stellar systems. However, it continues to meet resistance, and three Foundation vessels have vanished near the planets of the Republic of Korell, a nation suspected of independent technological development. Master Trader Hober Mallow is assigned to deal with Korell and also to investigate their technological developments and find the missing ships. Those who have assigned this mission to Mallow, Foreign Secretary Publis Manlio and Mayoral Secretary Jorane Sutt, believe that a [...] "Seldon Crisis" [...] is underway; <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> domestic tensions caused by the great autonomy given to Traders and shaky foreign relations may give rise to a nuclear conflict involving the Foundation.|$|E
2500|$|Art {{professionals}} have criticized László Baán's capacity to lead an endeavor to unite two such massive museums {{because he is}} not an art historian nor a museologist, but rather an economist by training. <b>They</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> a merge would potentially damage Hungarian cultural heritage, both literally and figuratively. Additionally, leading Hungarian art historians worry that the physical move of such a large and valuable collection as that of the National Gallery is unprofessional and irresponsible. Between December 17, 2011 and the deadline for the merge on February 29, 2012 an online petition entitled [...] "Protest Against the Merger of the Hungarian National Gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts" [...] that was created by these individuals had received 2,945 signatures. On October 25, 2011 the Hungarian Section of the International Association of Art Critics (AICA) published their similar standpoint regarding the issue and also supported the on–line petition.|$|E
60|$|During {{the greater}} {{portion of that}} day the store was filled with such a crowd of newsboys and boot-blacks as was never seen in that {{vicinity}} before, and the other merchants looked out in alarm, as if <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> a riot was in progress.|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the time}} the Mississippi State Penitentiary (MSP) opened, Sunflower County {{residents}} objected to having executions performed at the prison. <b>They</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> the county would be stigmatized as a [...] "death county." [...] Mississippi originally performed executions of condemned criminals in their counties of conviction.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the conservative Russian newspaper Molodaya Gvardiya in 1991, he claims that the only reason he lost was because [...] "younger Party leaders, such as Yegor Ligachev, supported Gorbachev because <b>they</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> if I had become Party boss, they would lose their posts." ...|$|R
2500|$|... “Some men, probably, {{abstain from}} murder because <b>they</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that,</b> if they {{committed}} murder, {{they would be}} hung. Hundreds of thousands abstain from it because they regard it with horror. One great reason why they regard it with horror is, that murderers are hung with the hearty approbation of all reasonable men.”On torture:"It is far pleasanter to sit comfortably in the shade rubbing red pepper in some poor devil's eyes, than to go about in the sun hunting up evidence."Source: The University of Chicago Law Review, Vol. 46, No. 1 (Autumn, 1978), pp. 3-22 40 1 J.F.

2500|$|The Pact {{has been}} criticised {{by some as}} being insufficiently {{flexible}} and needing to be applied over the economic cycle rather than in any one year. <b>They</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> by limiting governments' abilities to spend during economic slumps it may hamper growth. In contrast, other critics think that the Pact is too flexible; economist Antonio Martino writes: [...] "The fiscal constraints introduced with the new currency must be criticized {{not because they are}} undesirable—in my view they are a necessary component of a liberal order—but because they are ineffective. This is amply evidenced by the “creative accounting” gimmickry used by many countries to achieve the required deficit to GDP ratio of 3 percent, and by the immediate abandonment of fiscal prudence by some countries {{as soon as they were}} included in the euro club. Also, the Stability Pact has been watered down at the request of Germany and France." ...|$|E
2500|$|Physicians have {{expressed}} both positive interest {{and worry about}} the sudden explosion {{of interest in the}} legalization of medical marijuana and its research, admitting legalization is both [...] "a scientist's dream or a doctor's nightmare." [...] <b>They</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> some parents are too open to trying anything before proper research has been conducted, and that they may be disappointed. They are [...] "alarmed by parallels to past miracle-cure manias later proved false..." [...] and [...] "...wary of the heightened placebo effect in treatments involving children, when reports of progress depend on the view of parents." [...] There is also danger that [...] "the [...] movement also opens the way for bad medicine...through treatments at best giving hope to the hysterical and at worst delivering damaging side effects." [...] According to Alan Shackelford, Charlotte Figi's physician: [...] "We really don't know how it works... The cannabidiol seems to act as a neuro-stabilizer, but how?

50|$|The United States {{began to}} change its {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} world hunger from about the mid 1950s.
