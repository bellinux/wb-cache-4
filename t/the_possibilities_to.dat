25|$|The {{problem can}} be quite {{computationally}} expensive, as there are 4,426,165,368 (i.e., 64C8) possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8×8 board, but only 92 solutions. It is possible to use shortcuts that reduce computational requirements or rules of thumb that avoids brute-force computational techniques. For example, by applying a simple rule that constrains each queen to a single column (or row), though still considered brute force, {{it is possible to}} reduce the number of possibilities to 16,777,216 (that is, 88) possible combinations. Generating permutations further reduces <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> just 40,320 (that is, 8!), which are then checked for diagonal attacks.|$|E

25|$|A {{first case}} in which {{seemingly}} unrelated mathematical questions were studied {{with the help of}} permutations occurred around 1770, when Joseph Louis Lagrange, in the study of polynomial equations, observed that properties of the permutations of the roots of an equation are related to <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> solve it. This line of work ultimately resulted, through the work of Évariste Galois, in Galois theory, which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible with respect to solving polynomial equations (in one unknown) by radicals. In modern mathematics there are many similar situations in which understanding a problem requires studying certain permutations related to it.|$|E
25|$|Seven people {{survived the}} impact, {{although}} they were all injured and in shock. One of the survivors assisted two others away from the wreck, which was burning, and they all rallied a distance away from the wreck. They stated to the press afterwards {{that they were all}} apathetic and in shock, and that none of them thought about <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> search for help. Also, none of them knew where they were. They heard the search being carried out by helicopter and were therefore aware that they were being searched for. Two of the initial survivors later died, bringing the death toll to forty.|$|E
25|$|Polyploidy was induced in fish by Har Swarup (1956) using a cold-shock {{treatment}} of the eggs close {{to the time of}} fertilization, which produced triploid embryos that successfully matured. Cold or heat shock has also been shown to result in unreduced amphibian gametes, though this occurs more commonly in eggs than in sperm. John Gurdon (1958) transplanted intact nuclei from somatic cells to produce diploid eggs in the frog, Xenopus (an extension of the work of Briggs and King in 1952) that were able to develop to the tadpole stage. The British Scientist, J. B. S. Haldane hailed the work for its potential medical applications and, in describing the results, {{became one of the first}} to use the word “clone” in reference to animals. Later work by Shinya Yamanaka showed how mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent, extending <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> non-stem cells. Gurdon and Yamanaka were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 2012 for this work.|$|E

25|$|In 1956 {{a second}} reactor, R2, was bought from the United States under {{bilateral}} safeguards. A third reactor, {{better known as}} Ågesta, {{was designed as a}} dual-use facility to produce electricity and a small amount of plutonium in a crisis. In 1957, FOA suggested using Ågesta to produce a small number of weapons quickly. A fourth power reactor, Marviken, was set to produce larger quantities of nuclear fuel for an arsenal of 100 weapons. In May 1957, the Supreme Commander gave FOA the task of carrying out a new study of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> produce nuclear weapons focused on the plutonium option. Marviken was located approximately 150km away from Stockholm. Initially it was designed as 100 MW pressurized heavy water reactor that had a secondary circuit, where steam is produced from plain water. In the meantime, parallel to the pressurized reactor, a larger and more complicated design of reactor was under way. The alternative construction included superheating mechanism, internal reshuffling machine, and a complex process of boiling water, which ultimately complicated design and raised serious concerns.|$|E
25|$|In {{particular}} {{during the}} 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the USA. According to the American sociologist David G. Bromley this was partially {{due to the}} repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the USA. According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren, the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things 'Eastern': the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values. According to the professor in sociology Stephen A. Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg (1974), {{one of the reasons why}} in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get high without drugs. According to Kent, another reason why this happened so often in the USA then, was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> change society through political means, and as an alternative turned to religious means. Some gurus and the groups they lead attracted opposition. One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement (ISKCON) founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966, many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demandingly ascetic lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis, in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time.|$|E

2500|$|This led Mørefly to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> start scheduled services. The airline applied the Ministry of Transport and Communications for {{a concession to}} operate from Ålesund to Aberdeen Airport in the United Kingdom. The first application was rejected, but the second was approved. The route commenced on 14 April 1986. This was the first international route a Norwegian airline was allowed to fly against the recommendation of Scandinavian Airlines System, who held a judicial monopoly on such routes. Mørefly flew the route three times per week, but only had two or three passengers per trip. This led to a major loss on the operation. [...] Instead Mørefly applied to fly a domestic coastal route from Ålesund via Molde Airport, Årø; Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget; and Ørland Airport to Trondheim Airport, Værnes {{in the hopes that}} these could feed the Ålesund route, but no such permission was granted. The route was therefore terminated on 28 March 1987.|$|E

Guggenheim Museum, in New York City, testifies not only to Wright's architectural genius, {{but also to the}} adventurous spirit that characterized its founders. [...] The critic Paul Goldberger later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, [...] "there were only two common models for museum design: Beaux-arts Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion." [...] Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change, making it [...] "socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum.

2500|$|Though a setback, these {{protectionist}} {{measures were}} not as devastating to the Dutch trade system as the English had intended. The English market in itself was not {{very important to the}} Dutch, compared to the French, Iberian, and American markets. The Commonwealth' writ did not yet run in the latter, so these markets were not immediately lost. The fact that England was able to continue this protectionist policy after the First Anglo-Dutch War [...] had ended, was therefore not a severe blow to the Dutch. The damage from the war itself was severe for a while, but English commercial interests were damaged at least at much, if not more. The Dutch trade primacy was therefore not permanently damaged by the war, and neither did the English manage to regain their prewar position with force of arms. The only major consequence of the English policy was, that it gave ideas to first the Scandinavians, and later the French about <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> use military and protectionist means, that later caused great difficulties to the Republic.|$|E
60|$|I {{look back}} along the chain of events which runs through my narrative, and I ask myself, Where are <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> be found (in my case, {{or in the case}} of any other man) of {{identifying}} the child who was Mary Dermody with the woman who was Mrs. Van Brandt? Was there anything left in our faces, when we met again by the Scotch river, to remind us of our younger selves? We had developed, in the interval, from boy and girl to man and woman: no outward traces were discernible in us of the George and Mary of other days. Disguised from each other by our faces, we were also disguised by our names. Her mock-marriage had changed her surname. My step-father's will had changed mine. Her Christian name was the commonest of all names of women; and mine was almost as far from being remarkable among the names of men. Turning next to the various occasions on which we had met, had we seen enough of each other to drift into recognition on either side, in the ordinary course of talk? We had met but four times in all; once on the bridge, once again in Edinburgh, twice more in London. On each of these occasions, the absorbing anxieties and interests of the passing moment had filled her mind and mine, had inspired her words and mine. When had the events which had brought us together left us with leisure enough and tranquillity enough to look back idly through our lives, and calmly to compare the recollections of our youth? Never! From first to last, the course of events had borne us further and further away from any results that could have led even to a suspicion of the truth. She could only believe when she wrote to me on leaving England--and I could only believe when I read her letter--that we had first met at the river, and that our divergent destinies had ended in parting us forever.|$|E
6000|$|Hetty's little {{brain was}} busy with this {{combination}} as she hung on Adam's arm and said [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] to some slight observations of his about the many hawthorn-berries there {{would be for the}} birds this next winter, and the low-hanging clouds that would hardly hold up till morning. And when they rejoined her aunt and uncle, she could pursue her thoughts without interruption, for Mr. Poyser held that though a young man might like to have the woman he was courting on his arm, he would nevertheless be glad of a little reasonable talk about business the while; and, for his own part, he was curious to hear the most recent news about the Chase Farm. So, {{through the rest of the}} walk, he claimed Adam's conversation for himself, and Hetty laid her small plots and imagined her little scenes of cunning blandishment, as she walked along by the hedgerows on honest Adam's arm, quite as well as if she had been an elegantly clad coquette alone in her boudoir. For if a country beauty in clumsy shoes be only shallow-hearted enough, it is astonishing how closely her mental processes may resemble those of a lady in society and crinoline, who applies her refined intellect to the problem of committing indiscretions without compromising herself. Perhaps the resemblance was not much the less because Hetty felt very unhappy all the while. The parting with Arthur was a double pain to her--mingling with the tumult of passion and vanity there was a dim undefined fear that the future might shape itself in some way quite unlike her dream. She clung to the comforting hopeful words Arthur had uttered in their last meeting--"I shall come again at Christmas, and then we will see what can be done." [...] She clung to the belief that he was so fond of her, he would never be happy without her; and she still hugged her secret--that a great gentleman loved her--with gratified pride, as a superiority over all the girls she knew. But the uncertainty of the future, <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>to</b> which she could give no shape, began to press upon her like the invisible weight of air; she was alone on her little island of dreams, and all around her was the dark unknown water where Arthur was gone. She could gather no elation of spirits now by looking forward, but only by looking backward to build confidence on past words and caresses. But occasionally, since Thursday evening, her dim anxieties had been almost lost behind the more definite fear that Adam might betray what he knew to her uncle and aunt, and his sudden proposition to talk with her alone had set her thoughts to work in a new way. She was eager not to lose this evening's opportunity; and after tea, when the boys were going into the garden and Totty begged to go with them, Hetty said, with an alacrity that surprised Mrs. Poyser, [...] "I'll go with her, Aunt." ...|$|E
