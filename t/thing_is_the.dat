5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

25|$|The Best Damn <b>Thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> third studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne. It was {{released}} on 17 April 2007 by RCA Records. The album represents a musical departure from her earlier studio album Under My Skin (2004) which incorporates more elements of post-grunge music. The Best Damn Thing is seen by critics as Lavigne's most commercial effort. The album was noted as her first effort to feature {{a wide range of}} producers for the studio album, including Matt Beckley, Rob Cavallo, Dr. Luke and Lavigne herself who was referenced as the executive producer.|$|E

While a mediation, statistically speaking, clarifies the mechanism underlying the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, Wolley agreed {{in an interview with the}} Harvard Business Review that these findings are saying that groups of women are smarter than groups of men. However, she relativizes this stating that the actual important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> high social sensitivity of group members.|$|E

Their opening match was a 3–1 win against Second Division Blackpool, where Grimandi, Adams and Overmars got themselves on the scoresheet. In the fourth round, Arsenal faced Leicester City at Highbury. The match ended goalless, meaning a replay was staged at Filbert Street. With neither side able to score in the 90 minutes and extra time, the game was settled on penalties. Leicester goalkeeper Pegguy Arphexad blocked Dixon and Grimandi's spot-kicks to help his side win.

500|$|After House of Music was released, Tony! Toni!

[...] "There's a quiet stress between us that no one really talks about", Saadiq told Vibe in 1997. [...] "And what's sad about the whole <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fact that our friendship is disintegrating. Who knows, House of Music could be the last Tony Toni Toné album." [...] The band remained committed to promoting the record into 1997, including a February 28 taped performance at VH1's Hard Rock Live special. According to Mercury vice president Marty Maidenberg, an international tour for the album had been planned by October 1996, with concert dates in Japan and the United Kingdom, but it never materialized. In November 1997, Saadiq told the Philadelphia Daily News [...] "there should have been like four singles from that album. You'll have to call Mercury on that. It went Platinum with no promotional tour. We did our job and they made their money." [...] The group disbanded shortly afterwards, and each member went on to pursue an individual music career.|$|E
500|$|By 2009, {{there had}} been four {{versions}} of the album released: a rare London Records promotional disc, a bootleg with cover art by Arik Roper, the Rise Above/Music Cartel Records album, and a release by Tee Pee Records. The Rise Above/Music Cartel release was an unauthorized edited version, released in 1999 under the title Jerusalem. Jerusalem runs at 52 minutes and is a single composition split into six identically named tracks. The version of the album titled Dopesmoker was released on April 22, 2003, by Tee Pee Records on compact disc and vinyl with a 63-minute running time. Cisneros spoke most positively about the 2003 Dopesmoker release, saying [...] "I don't think the Dopesmoker <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> exact version that we submitted, but that's the closest one that's {{come out of the}} four. If I had to pick a favorite, that would be it." [...] Parts of the song were used in the film Broken Flowers by Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch stated that he was a fan of Sleep and listed them along with Earth and Sunn O))) as an influence for creating the film: [...] "I love these kind of visual landscapes they make, and they really inspired things for me for my film The Limits of Control".|$|E

500|$|Following {{widespread}} criticism {{over the}} [...] "elimination" [...] qualifying format used in Australia, the teams voted {{to abandon the}} format and revert to the system used between [...] and [...] However, in the week after the race, the sport's Strategy Working Group met to formally vote on the matter, and chose to keep the [...] "elimination" [...] format {{in place for the}} Bahrain Grand Prix and subject to a more thorough review ahead of the next round in China. It was subsequently reported that the teams had only been given the option of retaining the elimination format or adopting a hybrid of the elimination and pre-2016 formats, and that an outright reversion to the 2006-2015 format was never discussed. Mercedes' motorsport director Toto Wolff remained adamant that the format needed to be reverted, saying that he did not expect qualifying to be more entertaining than it had been two weeks before. Drivers were equally critical of the retention of the changed format: Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel told the press that he was [...] "as disappointed as probably anyone I know", while Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton called the decision [...] "strange , particularly because the most important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fans were unhappy". Another meeting was scheduled for race day to discuss the format, with both Jean Todt, president of the FIA, and Bernie Ecclestone, Formula One's commercial rights holder, in attendance.|$|E

On the game's puzzles, Honeywell stated that [...] "some of the puzzles are pretty simple, while others are difficult in the extreme. One nice <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> almost complete absence of red herring items. Everything you find can be put to use somewhere". As with other reviews, Allgame praised the audio work, noting that [...] "the music is decent throughout the game, and the voice talent is stellar", closing with the comment that the game takes point-and-click adventures to [...] "insane new heights {{in terms of both}} fun and comedy". GamersHell praised the graphics of the game as [...] "superb" [...] but noted that [...] "it's not so friendly that it can only be played by kiddies". Although describing sound setup as [...] "a bit tricky", the reviewer praised the voice acting as [...] "very good" [...] and the music as [...] "top quality". However, although the review noted that the game had [...] "easy to use" [...] interfaces and menus, it was critical of the fact that [...] "at times it can be the frustrating 'hunt for the correct pixel' syndrome".|$|E
500|$|Along with Knocked Up and Waitress, {{two other}} 2007 films about women facing {{unplanned}} pregnancies, Juno was interpreted by some critics {{as having a}} pro-life theme. Ann Hulbert of Slate magazine believed that Juno [...] " [...] both pro-life and pro-choice purism." [...] Jeff Dawson of The Sunday Times believed that the film was inevitably placed in the [...] "unwanted pregnancy subgenre" [...] with Knocked Up and Waitress due to its subject matter but thought that its interpretation as a pro-life film only [...] "muddied the waters". Hadley Freeman of The Guardian criticized Juno for [...] "complet a hat-trick of American comedies in the past 12 months that present abortion as unreasonable, or even unthinkable—a telling social sign", though she noted, [...] "I don't believe any of these films is consciously designed to be anti-abortion propaganda." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, agreed that Juno has [...] "an underlying theme, a message that is not anti-abortion but rather pro-adulthood." [...] Ellen Page commented, [...] "What I get most frustrated at is when people call it a pro-life movie, which is just absurd... The most important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> choice is there, and the film completely demonstrates that." [...] Cody and Page have openly stated that they are pro-choice; Reitman {{thought that it was}} [...] "fantastic" [...] that pro-life and pro-choice groups were embracing the film. He said that [...] "Juno seems to be a mirror, and people [...] see themselves in it." ...|$|E

Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months."
