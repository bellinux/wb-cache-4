The Weir Dyke {{takes its name from}} a weir in the bank of the Bourne Eau at Tongue End, which was constructed by the Black Sluice Commissioners, to allow water from the Bourne Eau to overflow the bank when excess water could not flow into the River Glen in times of flood. The overfall weir became redundant when the Tongue End pumping station was constructed in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In 1135, Stratford Langthorne Abbey was founded. The Abbey {{continued}} {{the process of}} draining Stratford marsh begun in the Middle Ages and creating artificial channels to drive water and tide mills. A small river port developed at Stratford, mentioned in the 15th century, to {{serve the needs of}} Stratford Abbey and the mills at Stratford, and there is similar evidence in later centuries. The Abbey took on responsibility to maintain the marsh walls around Bow Creek, to keep the <b>tidal</b> <b>waters</b> out. The river was being used for the transport of goods and passengers by 1571, when an Act of Parliament empowered the Lord Mayor of London to make improvements to the river to ensure that supplies of grain continued to reach the capital. These works included a new cut near the Thames, probably the section of river between Bow Tidal Gates and Old Ford, on which no tolls were to be charged, and a pound lock was constructed at Waltham Abbey, only the second to be built in England.|$|E
25|$|Oil Pollution Act of 1924 {{prohibited}} the intentional discharge of fuel oil into <b>tidal</b> <b>waters</b> and provided authorization for USACE to apprehend violators.

60|$|The Loch Leven {{referred}} to is a sea-loch in Argyllshire, {{into which the}} <b>tidal</b> <b>water</b> flows with some force from Loch Linnhe at Ballachulish.|$|R
25|$|The lake is {{connected}} to the sea via three tunnels that lie near the surface. The tunnels channel <b>tidal</b> <b>water</b> {{in and out of the}} lake. Tide levels in the lake are damped to about a third of the lagoon tidal levels. The tidal peaks are delayed from the lagoon tidal peaks by about 1 hour and forty minutes. Biologist William Hamner estimated that about 2.5% of the lake's volume is exchanged during a tidal flow. However, because the <b>tidal</b> <b>water</b> enters at the surface, the lower anoxic layer is largely unaffected by tidal flows.|$|R
25|$|Many small creeks {{are found}} {{all along the}} western coast, in which <b>tidal</b> <b>waters</b> flood {{upstream}} and fill up much low ground. In many cases human interference has helped in converting them into mud flats. The bigger creeks are Bhiwandi, Chinchani, and Dahanu Creeks. The Thane Creek is not a creek in the true sense, but a depression engulfed by the sea.|$|E
25|$|The James River {{forms in}} the Appalachian Mountains, near Iron Gate {{on the border between}} Alleghany and Botetourt counties, from the {{confluence}} of the Cowpasture and Jackson rivers, and flows into the Chesapeake Bay at Hampton Roads. <b>Tidal</b> <b>waters</b> extend west to Richmond, the capital of Virginia, at the river's fall line (the head of navigation). Larger tributaries draining to the tidal portion include the Appomattox River, Chickahominy River, Warwick River, Pagan River, and the Nansemond River.|$|E
25|$|Chelmsford has two rivers, the River Can and the River Chelmer. Although often {{confused}} to be {{the same}} river in the city centre, they are quite separate until they join together towards the east of the city to form the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation which heads out towards Maldon before flowing into <b>tidal</b> <b>waters</b> at the Blackwater Estuary. In the other direction, the Chelmer comes from the north from its source near Thaxted while the Can comes from the West from Writtle where it separates from the River Wid.|$|E

25|$|Cambridge {{had been}} an inland port due to its {{location}} on the River Cam prior to the draining of the Fens. As the university colleges rose in importance, {{the course of the}} river through the town, known as the Backs, was moved further to the east to accommodate their new buildings. A report conducted in 1618 by Richard Atkyns highlighted the problems caused by sandbanks above Clayhithe and watermills obstructing navigation. An order made by the parliamentary Committee of the Association in 1643 regulated use of the river for trade, but the biggest change was the construction of Denver Sluice on the River Great Ouse, which reduced river levels on the lower river as <b>tidal</b> <b>waters</b> were excluded from the Ouse. Both the university and the Corporation of Cambridge complained to parliament in 1697 that the trade route to the town from King's Lynn had been severely impaired.|$|E
500|$|Geographically, Faversham {{sits at a}} {{boundary}} between marshland {{to the north and}} a mixture of brick earth, gravel and chalk to the south which leads into the North Downs. Faversham Creek connects the town to the Swale that separates mainland Kent from the Isle of Sheppey. The surrounding area is part of the South Swale Nature Reserve, popular with wildfowl and wading birds. The coastline around Faversham is a by-product of the changes to sea level around Britain {{since the end of the}} last ice age. During Roman Britain and into the first millennium, the Faversham coast was a large estuary with Oare and Graveney being peninsulas. Land reclamation during the Middle Ages, which closed the River Wantsum and connected the Isle of Thanet to mainland Kent, resulted in less <b>tidal</b> <b>waters</b> reaching Faversham. This led to the gradual silting up of estuaries; Faversham Creek and its tributaries have been reduced from [...] to [...] To stop the creek silting up completely and making navigation impossible, a number of sluices have been installed since the 16th century.|$|E
2500|$|The fajã is an {{irregular}} form, with four small islets, and is {{heavily influenced by}} <b>tidal</b> <b>waters,</b> due to the diffusion of salt water into the lagoon. In comparison with the lagoon of the Fajã da Caldeira de Santo Cristo, there is no canal to the sea, which affects the dynamic of this ecosystem. Morton (1998) identified two areas: one along the west, where the <b>tidal</b> <b>waters</b> rise between [...] (and which the salinity is elevated between 10-26%) and the eastern section, where salinity levels are between 0-6%. This milder salinity even allows the survival of a small population of frog (Rana esculenta).|$|E

[...] Below Cromwell lock, the Trent is tidal, and therefore only navigable by experienced, well-equipped boaters. [...] Navigation lights and a proper anchor and cable are compulsory. [...] Associated British Ports, the navigation authority for the river from Gainsborough to Trent Falls, insist that anyone in charge of a boat must be experienced at navigating in <b>tidal</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Hudson River is a [...] {{river that}} flows {{from north to}} south {{primarily}} through eastern New York in the United States. The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York, flows through the Hudson Valley, and eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean, between New York City and Jersey City. The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York, and further north between New York counties. The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary occupying the Hudson Fjord, an inlet which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation, estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago. <b>Tidal</b> <b>waters</b> influence the Hudson's flow from as far north as Troy.|$|E
2500|$|The Severn Estuary {{presented}} a barrier between the Bristol area and South Wales. The estuary has a maximum tidal range of 14.5 metres, {{the second highest}} in the world, and during a rising or falling tide there are strong currents of up to 8knots (4m/s). Much of the estuary is mud flats that are exposed at low tide; these have been designated a Special Protection Area. The {{central part of the}} estuary is a navigable channel which, {{at the site of the}} bridge, is known as [...] "The Shoots". The bridge is upstream from Avonmouth and the Port of Bristol, but downstream from the Port of Sharpness. The Gloucester Harbour Trustees have responsibility for controlling navigation in the estuary's <b>tidal</b> <b>waters</b> upstream from the bridge.|$|E
