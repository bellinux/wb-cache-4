5|$|The {{flight was}} {{under the command of}} an {{experienced}} cockpit crew, consisting of Captain Henrique Stefanini Di Sacco (53) and First Officer Kleyber Aguiar Lima (54). Both pilots had been flying for over 30 years. <b>The</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>had</b> accrued nearly 13,700 flight hours throughout his career and the First Officer had almost 14,800 hours of flying experience.|$|E
5|$|On 12 August 1978, Vulcan B.2 XL390 of No. 617 Squadron crashed {{during an}} air display at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois in the United States. The crew had been {{authorised}} {{to carry out}} a display at Chicago Lakeside airport, <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> elected {{to carry out a}}n unauthorised display at Glenview beforehand. After a low-level run, probably below , the aircraft pulled up for an improperly executed wingover, resulting in a low-level stall and crash, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|The 42-year-old captain, Michael Kling, held {{an airline}} {{transport}} pilot certificate and type ratings for the Boeing 707, Boeing 737, and Learjet 35. He also had Air Force experience flying the KC-135 and Boeing E-3 Sentry. Kling was also an instructor pilot on the KC-135E in the Maine Air National Guard. According to Sunjet Aviation records, <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> accumulated a total of 4,280 hours of flight time (military and commercial) and had flown a total of 60 hours with Sunjet, 38 as a Learjet pilot-in-command and 22 as a Learjet second-in-command.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the crew lived on the single gun deck of the Warrior; these crewmen slept in hammocks slung from the sides and deck beams, with up to 18 men between each pair of guns. The officers berthed {{in the rear of}} the ship in small individual cabins; the wardroom was also the officers' mess. <b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> two spacious, well-furnished cabins.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> {{to record}} his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} at Fornebu was a Lufthansa Junkers Ju 52 in September 1938. It {{had flown}} a scheduled route to Kjeller, and <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> continued to Fornebu {{to try the}} new airport. On 16 April 1939, the seaplane section came into regular use. The first seaplane was a Ju 52 operated by DNL to Copenhagen. The official opening was on 1 June 1939. The first aircraft to land after the official opening was a Douglas DC-2 operated by KLM from Amsterdam. The first departure was on the Danish airline Det Danske Luftfartsselskab, when a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 took off to Copenhagen. The captain made a mistake, and took off from the parking space instead of the runway. In addition to these two routes, Luft Hansa started flights to Germany and DNL flew to Amsterdam. During the fall, DNL also flew from Perth, Scotland, via Oslo to Stockholm, but this route was soon canceled.|$|E

5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> {{undergone}} {{an upgrade}} on 2 February 2011; he subsequently flew 7 sectors under supervision and completed two line checks. His first flight {{in command of}} the aircraft took place on 6 February 2011, four days prior to the accident. <b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> flown into Cork 61 times; his logbooks had never shown any diversions.|$|E
25|$|Neither pilot {{had much}} {{experience}} flying in snowy, cold weather. <b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> made only eight takeoffs and landings in snowy {{conditions on the}} 737, and the first officer had flown in snow only twice.|$|E
6000|$|But when <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> <b>had</b> {{heard this}} weak and feeble offer {{of the town}} of Mansoul, and their high and bold demands, they made to them again, by their noble <b>captain,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> Boanerges, this speech following: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe you!" [...] {{burst out}} Tom. [...] "Pop's a first-rate fellow, and <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>has</b> {{got to have}} more proof against him before I'll believe him guilty." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{question}} was not uncalled for, <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>having</b> made a plunge {{like that of}} his son, but unlike his son, having {{found it difficult to}} extricate himself quickly.|$|R
25|$|The flight had an {{experienced}} flight crew; <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> about 21,000 total fight hours, including 2,602 flight {{hours in the}} MD-10 and MD-11 series of aircraft, while the first officer had about 15,000 total fight hours, including 1,918 hours in the MD-10/MD-11.|$|E
25|$|In January 1898, the Advance was {{involved}} in the rescue of the Captain of the Minora from a 24-hour lost-at-sea ordeal, where <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>had</b> seen his crew perish around him while vessels came close but failed to lend assistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the nukalpiaq was not, however, {{comparable to that of}} the umialik (whaling captain) of the northern and northwestern Alaska Iñupiaq Eskimo. <b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> the power to collect the surplus of the village, and much of the basic production of individual family members, and later redistribute it.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaders of}} teams are called <b>captains.</b> <b>The</b> {{rest of the}} team {{supports}} and helps <b>the</b> <b>captain,</b> however anyone on the team may be allowed to try to win. <b>The</b> <b>captains</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> most media exposure and best chance of winning.|$|R
50|$|Two {{women and}} eight men are shipwrecked on a South Pacific island. There is a murderer amongst them. Only the murderer and <b>the</b> ship's <b>captain</b> knows his {{identity}} but <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>has</b> lost his memory.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the rules}} do not specify any other {{distinction}} between <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> and his teammates, <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>has</b> numerous responsibilities to the team, particularly in North American professional hockey. <b>The</b> <b>captain</b> is a dressing room leader, and also represents the players' concerns to management.|$|R
25|$|A Cessna 206 crashed at Solund on 3 May 1982, {{killing all}} three people on board. The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} the aircraft hitting a power line. The investigation concluded that it was caused by pilot error, as <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> failed to notice the power line despite sufficient visibility and it being marked on the map.|$|E
25|$|Kootenay's crew in 1897 {{consisted}} of master W.E. Nesbitt, purser A.W. Shiels, chief engineer J.E. Jeffcott, pilot P. Wilson, first officer E.C. Bridgeman, second engineer J. Johnston, freight clerk Fred B. Wright, steward William Dyson, express messenger J.G. Millard, and bar manager J.S. Byron. By 1913, <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> become G.

25|$|Post this intimation, I was {{informed}} {{for the first}} time yesterday by the BCCI that <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>had</b> reservations with my 'style' and about my continuing as the Head Coach. I was surprised since I have always respected the role boundaries between Captain and Coach. Though the BCCI attempted to resolve the misunderstandings between the Captain and me, it was apparent that the partnership was untenable, and I therefore believe it is best for me to move on.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} of the reforms of Henry VIII, the master was a warrant officer, {{appointed}} by the Council of the Marine (later the Navy Board) who also built and provisioned the Navy's ships. The master was tasked with sailing the ship as directed by the captain, who fought the ship when an enemy was engaged. <b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> a commission from (and was responsible to) the Admiralty, who were in charge of the Navy's strategy and tactics.|$|E
25|$|He died at {{the mission}} on 3 September 1870. While in Warrnambool in 1867, Dick-a-Dick was {{introduced}} to Christianity by Lawrence and appeared strongly affected by the life of Jesus. He was not worried about the trip to England as he knew <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>had</b> prayed for a safe arrival. Just before his death, he confessed his faith in Christianity and was baptised on 30 July 1870. Minutes before his death, Dick-a-Dick claimed to have seen the face of Jesus.|$|E
