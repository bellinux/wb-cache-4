25|$|Mainly {{known for}} his writings, Vitruvius was himself an architect. In Roman times {{architecture}} was a broader subject than at present including the modern fields of architecture, construction management, construction engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, materials engineering, mechanical engineering, military engineering and urban planning; architectural engineers consider him the first of their discipline, a specialization previously known as <b>technical</b> <b>architecture.</b> Frontinus mentions him {{in connection with the}} standard sizes of pipes. He is often credited as father of architectural acoustics for describing the technique of echeas placement in theaters. The only building, however, that we know Vitruvius to have worked on is one he tells us about, a basilica completed in 19 BC. It was built at Fanum Fortunae, now the modern town of Fano. The Basilica di Fano (to give the building its Italian name) has disappeared so completely that its very site is a matter of conjecture, although various {{attempts have been made to}} visualise it. The early Christian practice of converting Roman basilicae (public buildings) into cathedrals implies the basilica may be incorporated into the cathedral located in Fano.|$|E

40|$|In Parables for the Virtual Massumi {{describes}} 'The Autonomy of Affect' in our {{ecology of}} thought (Massumi 2002 : 35). The object of Stiegler's Technics and Time is 'technics apprehended as {{the horizon of}} all possibility to come and all possibility of a future' (Stiegler 1998 : ix). The ecological dynamic described by the recursion between this 'affective autonomy' and a 'technical horizon of possibility' describes a metamodel {{of the relation between}} body and world, between perception and expression. I argue that this metamodel allows for the <b>technical</b> <b>architectures</b> that enshrine media processes and models as both the manifestation and modulation of the 'industry' or vitality of mind.

40|$|AbstractEnd users {{urgently}} request using mobile devices {{at their}} workplace. They know these devices from their private life and appreciate functionality and usability, {{and want to}} benefit from these advantages at work as well. Limitations and restrictions would not be accepted by them. On the contrary, companies are obliged to employ substantial organizational and technical measures to ensure data security and compliance when allowing to use mobile devices at the workplace. So far, only individual arrangements have been presented addressing single issues in ensuring data security and compliance. However, companies need to follow a comprehensive set of measures addressing all relevant aspects of data security and compliance in order to play it safe. Thus, in this paper at first <b>technical</b> <b>architectures</b> for using mobile devices in enterprise IT are reviewed. Thereafter a set of compliance rules is presented and, as major contribution, technical measures are explained that enable a company to integrate mobile devices into enterprise IT while still complying with these rules comprehensively. Depending on the company context, {{one or more of}} the <b>technical</b> <b>architectures</b> have to be chosen impacting the specific technical measures for compliance as elaborated in this paper. Altogether this paper, for the first time, correlates <b>technical</b> <b>architectures</b> for using mobile devices at the workplace with technical measures to assure data security and compliance according to a comprehensive set of rules...|$|R
