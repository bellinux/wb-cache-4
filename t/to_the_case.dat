5|$|Although lynchings and racially {{motivated}} murders {{had occurred}} throughout the South for decades, {{the circumstances surrounding}} Emmett Till's murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social caste system. Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, {{the activities of the}} NAACP and the White Citizens' Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were played out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.|$|E

5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} taken up by MPs George Galloway and Andrew Hunter and journalists Bob Woffinden and Eric Allison of The Guardian. Allison {{became one of the}} campaign's patrons. Woffinden argued between 2007 and 2011 that Sheila had shot her family, then watched as police {{gathered}} outside the house before shooting herself. He changed his mind in 2011 and said he believed Bamber was guilty. In 2015 the human-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell appealed to the Chief Constable of Essex Police to disclose all evidence related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> in the interests of transparency.|$|E
5|$|By October 11, {{investigators}} had conducted 124 interviews and had found 174 {{pieces of evidence}} related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> They were also investigating the West Nickel Mines School shooting in Pennsylvania, which had occurred {{five days after the}} shooting in Bailey. As a result of the September 27 incident, Platte Canyon High School increased its security, leaving only one school entrance unlocked. It plans to install more security cameras. Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener proposed having a guard there during the school day, but he stated that that particular suggestion was outside the current budget.|$|E
5|$|Ferens also intervened {{on behalf}} of his {{constituency}} and its inhabitants.

On 10 August 1916, after a fatal raid by a Zeppelin in the early of the previous morning, against which the city had been able to muster only a single searchlight and one gun, he asked that adequate defences be provided and brought to action where necessary.|$|E

5|$|The High Court {{rendered}} its {{judgment on}} 9 January 1998. It accepted the appellant's assertion that Article 73(a) was an empowering provision.
