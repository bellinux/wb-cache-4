50|$|The <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Didunculus strigirostris), {{also known}} as the manumea, is a large pigeon found only in Samoa. It is the only living species of genus Didunculus. A related extinct species, the Tongan <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Didunculus placopedetes), is only known from subfossil remains in several archeological sites in Tonga. The <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> is the {{national}} bird of Samoa and featured on the 20 tālā bills and the 50 sene pieces of the 2008/2011 series.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{confined}} to undisturbed forests of Samoa in the Pacific. Natural habitats for the <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> in Samoa include the Central Savai'i Rainforest, Tafua Preserve, Fagaloa Bay - Uafato Tiavea Conservation Zone on Upolu Island, and Nu'ulua island. Little {{is known about the}} ecology and biology of the species but it is believed to feeds on the fruits of Dysoxylum, a tree in the mahogany family. Manuscripts from the 1800s suggest chicks are confined to the forest floor. However the location of nests (in a tree or on the ground) is still unconfirmed.|$|E
50|$|Nu'ulua has a {{land area}} of 25 {{hectares}} {{and is a}} habitat for locally and regionally endemic birds including the endangered <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon,</b> (Didunculus strigirostris), also known as Samoan pigeon, and an endemic bat (Pteropus samoensis).|$|E
50|$|The <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Didunculus strigirostris) feeds {{mainly on}} {{the fruits of the}} Dysoxylum trees growing in its native Samoa. Foliage of D. mollissimum {{provides}} food for caterpillars of the Hercules moth (Coscinocera hercules). Among the better-known pathogens affecting this genus is Pseudomonas syringae pv. dysoxylis which often initiates frost damage in Kohekohe.|$|E
50|$|These {{include the}} rare and unusual <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Didinculus strigirostris) {{known locally as}} manumea, the {{national}} bird of Samoa and other birds such as the maomao honeyeater (Gymnomyza samoensis). The Samoan white-eye (Zosterops samoensis) and Samoan moorhen (Gallinula pacifica) are both endemic to Savai'i. The Samoan moorhen was last recorded in 1873 with possible sightings in 1984 at the upland forests and at Mount Silisili in 2003.|$|E

50|$|C. nicobarica is a quite {{singular}} columbiform (though less autapomorphic {{than the}} flightless Raphinae), as are {{for example the}} <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Didunculus strigirostris) and the crowned pigeons (Goura), which are typically considered distinct subfamilies. Hence, the Nicobar pigeon may well constitute another now-monotypic subfamily. And while any of the semi-terrestrial pigeons of Southeast Asia and the Wallacea cannot be excluded as possible closest living relative of the Raphinae, the Nicobar pigeon makes a more plausible candidate than for example the group of imperial-pigeons and fruit-doves, {{which seems to be}} part of the same radiation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> is a medium-sized, {{approximately}} 31 cm long, dark pigeon with reddish {{feet and}} red bare skin around the eye. The underparts, {{head and neck}} are greyish with a slight blue-green iridescence, and the tail, wings-coverts and tertials are rufous chestnut, while the remaining remiges are blackish. It has a large, curved, and hooked bright red bill with tooth-like projections on the lower mandible. Both sexes are similar, but the juvenile is duller with a browner head, with a black bill with only the base a pale orange.|$|E
50|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the crowned pigeons is {{not well}} resolved. Several molecular analyses have been conducted (e.g. Johnson &, 2000), with one (Shapiro et al., 2002) suggesting that along with the Nicobar pigeon and the <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> of Samoa, the three Goura pigeons belong {{to a group of}} which the unfortunate dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire are an offshoot lineage, but depending on which genetic sequence is analyzed, the placement of the crowned pigeons differs. They might belong to the fruit-dove subfamily Treroninae, but usually they are treated as a subfamily of their own, the Gourinae.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} a large pigeon, {{comparable}} in size to large species of Columba or Ducula, and larger than the other three species of pigeon it coexisted with on the island. It had relatively small wings for its body size, suggesting {{that it was a}} weak flier, though not flightless. It was described from 18 bones from four archaeological sites on Henderson Island, mainly from early Polynesian middens. The affinities of the new genus are uncertain, but comparisons with other taxa suggest that, among living species, it is most closely related to the Nicobar pigeon or the <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Tafua Rainforest Preserve was {{established}} in 1990 as a covenant between the village chiefs (matai) and funds from Seacology, model Christie Brinkley and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency to protect native rainforests. The preserve includes walking tracks in the rainforest and a path to the Tafua volcanic crater where there are rare Samoa flying-fox bats.The forest {{is also one of}} the few habitats for the endemic and endangered <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Didunculus strigirostris), called Manumea, the national bird of Samoa.

50|$|The {{conservation}} area is ancestral land {{owned by the}} families of Uafato. The conservation zone includes the village and Fagaloa Bay and approximately 1,300 hectares of forestlands. Fauna includes two varieties of bat and 22 bird species including the endangered <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Didunculus strigirostris), also known as Samoan pigeon which are confined to undisturbed forests. It is the national bird of Samoa and is called the Manumea. The initiative for a {{conservation area}} came from the chiefs and the village following cyclones in 1991 which destroyed much of the village. The council of chiefs approached a private environmental group, O Le Siosiomaga Society, for assistance. A year later, the Uafato Conservation Area was established with funding from the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (formerly SPREP).|$|E
50|$|Animal species include fruit bats {{such as the}} Samoa flying-fox (Pteropus samoensis), {{land and}} seabirds, skinks and geckos. The birdlife of Samoa {{includes}} a total of 82 species, of which 11 are endemic, found only in Samoa. Endemic birdlife found only on Savai'i include species such as the Samoan white-eye (Zosterops samoensis) which is only found in the high cloud forests and alpine scrub around Mt Silisili, and Samoan moorhen (Gallinula pacifica), which was last recorded in 1873 near Aopo with possible sightings in 1984 and 2003. The <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon,</b> (Didunculus strigirostris), {{also known as the}} manumea is also endemic and now increasingly rear leading to the current proposition to upgrade it to critically endangered. It is the national bird of Samoa and is found on some of the local currency. It is likely that the extensive loss of lowland forest, hunting and invasive species are responsible for the decline of this stunning species.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of ongoing}} habitat loss, limited range, small {{population}} size, hunting and occasional cyclones {{as well as}} the likely impact of introduced species such as pigs, dogs, rats and cats, the <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> is evaluated as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Surveys suggest numbers are critical and that 70 to 380 individuals survive in the wild, and there is currently no captive population. No juveniles had been sighted during any recent surveys until the 2013 sighting of a single juvenile in the lowlands of Savaii during a survey of the Samoan Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. It is highly likely that chick mortality is high and the observed population are an aged population of adult birds. Actions to save this species will likely require conservation education to reduce hunting risk, and knowledge of the biology of the population and the reasons behind the current decline. Population control for rats and cats is likely to be critical, as is continuing deforestation and disappearance of old-growth forests.|$|E

40|$|Harvesting, {{consumption}} and trade of forest meat are key causes of biodiversity loss. Successful mitigation programs are proving difficult to design, {{in part because}} anthropogenic pressures are treated as internationally uniform. Despite illegal hunting being a key conservation issue in the Pacific Islands, there is a paucity of research. Here, we examine the dynamics of hunting of birds and determine how these contribute to biodiversity loss on the islands of Samoa. We focus on {{the interactive effects of}} hunting on two key seed dispersing bird species: the Pacific pigeon (Ducula pacifica) and the critically endangered Manumea or <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Didunculus strigiristris). We interviewed hunters, vendors and consumers and analyzed household consumption. Results suggest that over 22, 000 pigeons were consumed per year and this is by primarily the richest people across the country. Indeed, the wealthiest 10 % of households consumed 43 % of all wild pigeon meat, and the wealthiest 40 % of households consumed 80 % of all pigeons. The Manumea was shot by 33 % (n = 30) of the surveyed hunters while pursuing the Pacific pigeon. Results raise serious conservation concerns, as pigeon hunting {{is likely to be a}} key factor contributing to the decline of the Manumea and critical forest seed dispersers in general. Our results show that wild meat consumption can lead to non-targeted pressure on bycatch species. Wild meat harvesting and consumption is a key issue leading to species declines and extinctions in the tropics. It is critical that this issue receives the appropriate attention and is addressed in the Pacific if species and forests are to be maintained...|$|E

The avifauna of the Teouma archaeological site on Efate in Vanuatu is described. It derives from the Lapita levels (3, 000 â€“ 2, 800 ybp) and immedi-ately overlying middens extending to âˆ¼ 2, 500 ybp. A total of 30 bird species is represented in the 1, 714 identiï¬ ed specimens. Twelve species are new records for the island, which, added to previous records, indicates that minimally 39 land birds exclusive of passerines were in the original avifauna. Three-fourths of the 12 newly recorded species appear to have become extinct {{by the end of}} Lapita times, 2, 800 ybp. The avifauna is dominated by eight species of columbids (47. 5 % Minimum Number Individuals [MNI]) including a large extinct <b>tooth-billed</b> <b>pigeon,</b> Didunculus placopedetes from Tonga, and a giant Ducula sp. cf. D. goliath from New Caledonia. Seabirds are rare despite the coastal location of the site. Fowl are important contributors to the Teouma avifauna, with the human-introduced Red Junglefowl Gallus gallus accounting for 15 % MNI and present in all sampled layers. There are two species of megapodes (âˆ¼ 10 % of MNI), with the extant Vanuatu Megapode Megapodius layardi most abundant and represented at all levels in the deposits. A substantially larger extinct megapode, Mwalau walter-linii, n. gen., n. sp., is present only in the Lapita midden area, where it is rela-tively rare. This extinct species was larger than all extant megapodes but smaller than the extinct Progura gallinacea from Australia, with proportions most similar to those of Alectura, and was a volant bird. The remaining signiï¬ cant faunal component is rails, with four species present, of which Porphyrio melanotus was the most abundant. Rare but notable records include an undescribed large rail; a parrot, Eclectus sp. cf. E. infectus; a hornbill, Rhyticeros sp. cf. R. plicatus; and a coucal, Centropus sp. indet., all conservatively considered likely to be conspeciï¬ c with known taxa elsewhere in Melanesia...|$|E
