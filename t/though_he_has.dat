But Arthur {{would have}} known what was wanting to its completeness, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{never heard of the}} words Little mother; <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never seen the fondling of the small spare hand; <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had no sight for the tears now {{standing}} in the colourless eyes; <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> had no hearing for the sob that checked the clumsy laugh. The dirty gateway with the wind and rain whistling through it, and the basket of muddy potatoes waiting to be spilt again or taken up, never seemed the common hole it really was, when he looked back to it by these lights. Never, never! ...|$|R

"if anyone slays a human being, {{unless it}} be {{punishment}} for murder or spreading corruption on earth, {{it shall be}} as <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> slain all mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> saved {{the lives of all}} mankind."(Qur’an 5:32) ...|$|R

During his stint as a sailor, he goes pearl diving with the natives of Cristobal {{and is able to}} dive deeper and stay under longer because of his density.|$|E

5|$|Terry Brooks {{has said}} that Tolkien's works were a major {{influence}} in his writing, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> also said that Tolkien was not his only influence. Other influences included his editor Lester del Rey, {{as well as the}} many different books which he had read over his life. Also, mythology and ancient civilizations that he had learned about in school gave him a wealth of knowledge from which he drew. Many of these influences are reflected in Brooks' works.|$|E

They immediately suspect CoreFire's nemesis, Dr. Impossible, was involved, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been incarcerated in a maximum security prison since his defeat by Damsel during his twelfth world domination attempt. An interrogation by two novice heroes about CoreFire's disappearance gives Dr. Impossible the chance to escape and initiate a new attempt at world domination. The New Champions search for Impossible, convinced {{he is responsible for}} CoreFire's demise, while he gathers the materials needed to advance his plan. This is intercut with flashbacks to earlier times and his origin, as well as reflections on other paths he could have taken in life.|$|E
5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude.

He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company.

5|$|Charlie {{has barely}} made it into his new flat in London when his father dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy.

Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E
5|$|Impa {{says that}} the mark on Link's hand means {{that he is the}} hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest {{containing}} six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> never seen the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganon’s ashes will bring Ganon back to life.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{borrowed}} {{the character of}} Banquo from Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587. In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth {{in the murder of}} the king, rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth. Shakespeare may have changed this aspect of his character to please King James, who was thought at the time to be a descendant of the real Banquo. Critics often interpret Banquo's role in the play as being a foil to Macbeth, resisting evil where Macbeth embraces it. Sometimes, however, his motives are unclear, and some critics question his purity. He does nothing to accuse Macbeth of murdering the king, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> reason to believe Macbeth is responsible.|$|E

5|$|The Maldives {{received}} universality slots from IAAF to send two athletes (one {{male and}} one female) to the Olympics.

This marked Saaid's debut in the Olympics, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> represented his country at the 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games, {{as well as the}} 2010 and 2014 Asian Games. The Games were Ismail's second time in the Olympics because of her participation in the 2012 London Olympics. Ismail finished 8th in her heat with a time of 24.96 seconds, attaining a national record but failing to qualify for the semifinals. Saaid achieved a time of 10.43 seconds in his heat, ranking first place and advancing to the quarterfinals. However, Saaid failed to qualify for the semifinals due to coming eighth with a time of 10.47 seconds in the quarterfinals. He could not beat his national record of 10.33 seconds.|$|E
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} set in Persia during the 9th century AD, and begins with the Prince narrating to an unseen {{listener}} about his adventures. The Prince and the army of his father Shahraman are passing through India to visit the Sultan of Azad. The Vizier of a local Maharaja, wanting to prevent his death using a substance known as the Sands of Time, entices them into attacking the Maharaja's palace, where the Sands are stored. During the fight, the Prince loots an artefact called the Dagger of Time, and the Maharaja's daughter Farah is taken {{as a gift for}} the Sultan of Azad. Visiting Azad, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, turning everyone but the Prince, the Vizier and Farah (protected by the Dagger, a staff and an amulet respectively) into sand creatures.
