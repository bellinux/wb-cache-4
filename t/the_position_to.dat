5|$|Following Mangini's departure, New York {{hoped to}} lure former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher out of retirement, {{suggesting}} that Cowher might be given control of football operations {{in addition to}} serving as coach. However, Cowher decided to remain retired for the season. On January 20, 2009, the Jets offered <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan, who accepted. Tannenbaum engineered a draft-day trade with Cleveland, which enabled New York to move up and select highly regarded USC quarterback Mark Sanchez.|$|E

5|$|In 498, as the Empire's nominal vice-regent in Italy, Theoderic {{had been}} granted the right to {{nominate}} the Western candidate for each year's consular pair.

To get around the restriction imposed on his nominations, and as a favour to Theoderic, Justin himself nominated Eutharic.|$|E

5|$|The Senate convened on 18 September, to {{validate}} Tiberius's position as Princeps and, {{as it had}} done with Augustus before, extend the powers of <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> him. These proceedings are fully accounted by Tacitus.

5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the birth of}} five babies {{in the town of}} Martinsburg, West Virginia, who were born with tails. The mother of the most recent baby, Amanda Nelligan, tells the agents that the father of her baby is Luke Skywalker. By researching the baby's chromosomes it is discovered that all five share the same father. The parents of the children blame the local fertility doctor, who had used insemination to impregnate all of the mothers but Nelligan. Mulder spots a janitor nearby with signs that he formerly had a tail. When he runs Mulder chases him and catches him. The janitor, Eddie Van Blundht, is discovered to be the father of all of the children. Scully believes Eddie used a date rape drug although Mulder questions how he could be in <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> give it to the women.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{reinforcing}} Luso-Rhodesian relations, the Lisbon {{appointment was}} designed to secure the African nation a diplomatic foothold in Europe outside of Britain's reach and to help Salisbury find new trading partners and diplomatic allies on the continent. Among other things, the Rhodesians intended {{to make up the}} shortfalls in military equipment caused by the undeclared Anglo-American arms embargo. Reedman, the former minister for immigration and tourism, was also a retired officer of the British Royal Air Force (where he had been involved in bomber research), and an experienced engineer and businessman: all the right ingredients, the government thought, for someone in <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> source European aircraft, weapons and other equipment, while also representing Rhodesian interests in mainland Europe.|$|E

Collier left <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> join the U.S. Navy in 1943 during World War II. At a naval base outside of Chicago he met Paul Brown, who was coaching a service football team there. After the war, Brown hired Collier as an assistant coach for the Browns, a team under formation in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). After seven years as Brown's top aide, a span over which the Cleveland team won five league championships, Collier took a job as head football coach at Kentucky in 1954. His Kentucky Wildcats teams amassed a 41–36–3 win-loss-tie record over eight seasons.|$|E
5|$|Eddard Stark awakens in his {{chambers}} with Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister watching him. Cersei accuses Eddard {{of kidnapping}} her brother, Tyrion, and claims Eddard was drunk and attacked Jaime first, {{but she is}} silenced by a slap from Robert. After she leaves, Robert tells Eddard that he cannot rule the kingdoms if the Lannisters and Starks are at war and insists that Eddard remain the Hand of the King, or else Robert will give <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> Jaime. Robert also informs Eddard {{that he will be}} regent while Robert is away on a hunting trip.|$|E
5|$|Gil de Ferran won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his lead throughout the race's first half.

Herbert spun while battling for 13th position with Villeneuve. Diniz retired from the race when his engine failed on lap 63. Herbert came under pressure from Verstappen on lap 67 and suffered his second spin, losing <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> Verstappen. Herbert retired on lap 69 {{as the result of}} gearbox problems. Mazzacane pulled off the track on lap 70 and retired because of an engine failure.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought A.I. {{would be}} closer to Steven Spielberg's {{sensibilities}} as director. Kubrick handed <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> Spielberg in 1995, but Spielberg chose to direct other projects, and convinced Kubrick to remain as director. The film was put on hold due to Kubrick's commitment to Eyes Wide Shut (1999). After the filmmaker's death in March 1999, Harlan and Christiane Kubrick approached Spielberg {{to take over the}} director's position. By November 1999, Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson's 90-page story treatment. It was his first solo screenplay credit since Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Spielberg remained close to Watson's treatment, but removed various sex scenes with Gigolo Joe. Pre-production was briefly halted during February 2000, because Spielberg pondered directing other projects, which were Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Minority Report and Memoirs of a Geisha. The following month Spielberg announced that A.I. would be his next project, with Minority Report as a follow-up. When he decided to fast track A.I., Spielberg brought Chris Baker back as concept artist.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1868, Khrimian {{was ordained}} as a bishop in Etchmiadzin. On 4 September 1869 {{he was elected}} as the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, who was the de facto leader of the Armenian {{community}} of the Ottoman Empire in both religious and secular matters. According to Ali Tekkoyun, a Turkish scholar of religion, his election indicated that the Amira (wealthiest) class and the imperial authorities lost power over the Armenians as went against their interests. He cleared the patriarchate's debt and sought to increase the provincial representation in the Armenian National Assembly. As the de facto political leader of the Christian Armenian millet {{in the eyes of}} the Sublime Porte, he prepared a detailed report documenting instances of oppression, persecution, and miscarriage of justice in the Armenian provinces and presented the document to the Sublime Porte. Khrimian used <b>the</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> advance the interests and conditions of the poor and oppressed provincial Armenians.|$|E
