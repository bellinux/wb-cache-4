5|$|About a {{month after}} Typhoon Kaemi {{affected}} the region, Saomai caused additional flooding in <b>the</b> <b>inland</b> province of Jiangxi. There, the storm wrecked six reservoirs, resulting in ¥348million (RMB, $45million USD) in damage. About 35,000people were forced to evacuate in Jiangxi due to the storm. One person was washed away in floodwaters while inspecting damage, while another person was killed when a damaged building collapsed. In neighboring Anhui province, flooding forced residents to evacuate homes.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in <b>the</b> <b>Inland</b> Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in <b>the</b> <b>Inland</b> Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20thcentury, the {{difficulty}} of navigating the Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of <b>the</b> <b>Inland</b> Empire region east of the Cascades.

50|$|Historically, <b>the</b> Seto <b>Inland</b> Sea as {{transport}} line served four coastal areas: Kansai, Chūgoku, Shikoku, and eastern Kyūshū. <b>The</b> Seto <b>Inland</b> Sea provided {{each of these}} regions with local transportation and connected each region to the others and far areas, including the coastal area of the Sea of Japan, Korea, and China. After Kobe port was founded in 1868 to serve foreign ships, <b>the</b> Seto <b>Inland</b> Sea became a major international waterway with connection to the Pacific.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, {{the lake}} began being {{filled with water}} {{provided}} by <b>the</b> <b>Inland</b> Feeder after nearly two years without a source.

5|$|Nakano {{organised}} {{the withdrawal}} of his force. He chose two routes, one following the coast and the other running along the ridge lines of {{the foothills of the}} Finisterres. Initially, the 20th Division was to take the coastal route while the 51st and some naval units took <b>the</b> <b>inland</b> one, but this was changed at the last minute and both divisions took <b>the</b> <b>inland</b> route. Additional rations and supplies were to be delivered by submarine. However, the 51st Division elected to move out rather than wait for the submarines and risk exhausting its rations through waiting. The 51st Division had experience crossing the mountains before, and Nakano was confident of its ability to negotiate them. In the event, one submarine was discovered by Allied aircraft and failed to reach its objective, while a second was discovered and sunk. A third got through but it was a small type that was only able to carry five tons of supplies, which were distributed among units of the 20th Division.|$|E
5|$|Partly in {{response}} to Nakaguma's attacks, on 24 October the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines under Lieutenant Colonel Herman H. Hanneken deployed to the Matanikau. After Oka's forces were sighted approaching the Marine Matanikau positions from the south, Hanneken's battalion was placed on a ridge facing south which formed a continuous extension of <b>the</b> <b>inland</b> flank of the Marine's horseshoe-shaped Matanikau defenses. A gap, however, still remained between Hanneken's left (east) flank and the main perimeter.|$|E

It was also a main transport line between Japan and other countries, including Korea and China. Even after the creation of major highways such as the Nankaidō and San'yōdō, <b>the</b> Seto <b>Inland</b> Sea remained a major transport route.

5|$|Spokane {{became an}} {{important}} rail and shipping center because of its location between mining and farming areas.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Inland</b> Empire Highway was {{originally}} {{a collection of}} gravel county roads that have existed since 1898 in the Spokane area and 1905 in the Pullman area.

The Second Division of the Eastern Route of <b>the</b> <b>Inland</b> Empire Highway was also established in 1913, traveling northwest from Sampson Trail Y at the IdahoWashington state line to Pullman. The Idaho portion of US195 became part of the North and South Highway in 1916 and was not numbered under Idaho's state highway system in 1953. The gap in the Second Division between Pullman and Colfax was named by Whitman County as a highway of importance the following year and was not built until 1925 as part of State Road3.|$|E

5|$|The {{first section}} of US195 {{designated}} as part of Washington's state highway system was codified in 1913 from Colfax to Spokane as <b>the</b> <b>Inland</b> Empire Highway and from the Idaho state line to Pullman as the Second Division of the Eastern Route of <b>the</b> <b>Inland</b> Empire Highway. The two highways were included as part of State Road3 in 1923 and US195 during {{the creation of the}} US Highway System on November 11, 1926. Originally, the northern terminus of the highway was at US95 in Sandpoint, but was truncated to Spokane after US2 was extended west from Bonners Ferry in 1946. US195 was cosigned with Primary State Highway3 (PSH3) from US95 to Spokane and PSH6 from Spokane to Newport from the creation of the primary and secondary state highways in 1937 until the 1964 highway renumbering. US195 was extended south into Idaho after the relocation of US95, designated as the North and South Highway in 1916, onto its present freeway in 1975. Bypasses of Pullman, Rosalia, and Plaza were completed during the early 1970s, converting portions of US195 into a divided highway.|$|E
