40|$|A basic {{element in}} the {{decision}} making process on {{the adequacy of the}} support system was a monitoring and analysis process. We consider geomonitoring as continuous monitoring of objects (e. g. of mines, <b>tunnels,</b> <b>machinery,</b> buildings and a lot of constructions) during the construction or operating phase using geodetic, geotechnical and geophysical methods. Geomonitoring is gaining increasing significance as a result of new safety aspects, {{from the point of view}} of immission controlas well as in connection with early warning and alarm systems. Specific areas covered include geological and geotechnical explorationsrequired, construction of tunnels and shafts, design considerations, geomechanical analysis, design of linings, and instrumentationand monitoring. Consequently, monitoring of many of the instrument arrays have to continue for several years after construction.

50|$|The Belle Chasse Tunnel {{was built}} {{starting}} in March 1954 {{to accommodate the}} new branch of the Intracoastal Canal. After nearly two years of construction, the $2,436,000 structure opened in February 1956 with the Canal beginning operations later that year. The politicians in Plaquemines Parish chose to construct a tunnel {{as opposed to a}} drawbridge as to enable continuous flow of traffic. According to engineers and various 1956 issues of the Plaquemines Gazette, the tunnel is the first fully automatic underwater tunnel in the world as it did not require any operating personnel. The <b>tunnel</b> has ventilation <b>machinery</b> that automatically change the tunnel's air every two minutes with automatic generators taking over if the machinery fails.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{refers to}} the methods adopted for {{building}} a high-speed railway tunnel system between Bologna and Firenze (Italy), focusing attention on the Bologna node which represents {{the heart of the}} system, connecting the high speed network’s main lines. The project includes 9 tunnels, accounting for 73 km of the 78 km route crossing below the Apennines. The paper pays attention to the main aspects to be taken into consideration for correctly choosing the <b>tunnel</b> boring <b>machinery</b> (TBM) to be used in urban areas. The fundamental point in analysing technical aspects regarding an earth pressure balance (EPB) machine concerned storing the main excavation parameter values; having collected and organised such data, statistical methods were used for processing it, the instantaneous velocities attained were empirically estimated and idle times were evaluated. The evaluation was made by calculating excavation specific energies (during different excavation phases) to find a satisfactory correlation with the type of ground crossed. Interesting results have been found by comparison with other excavation parameters; in particular, a better understanding of an earth pressure balance shield’s working phases has been reached thanks to an experimental study conducted during the construction of tunnels for a high-speed railway system in Italy. The paper contains details collected regarding the operation of two different EPB machines. RESUME...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe TolC {{structure}} has unveiled a common {{mechanism for the}} movement of molecules, large and small, from the bacterial cell cytosol, across two membranes and the intervening periplasm, into the environment. Trimeric TolC is a remarkable cell exit duct that differs radically from other membrane proteins, comprising a 100 -Å long α-barrel that projects across the periplasmic space, anchored by a 40 -Å long β-barrel spanning the outer membrane. The periplasmic entrance of TolC is closed until recruitment by substrate-specific translocases in the inner membrane triggers its transition to the open state, achieved by an iris-like ‘untwisting’ of the <b>tunnel</b> α-helices. TolC-dependent <b>machineries</b> present ubiquitous exit routes for virulence proteins and antibacterial drugs, and their conserved structure, specifically the electronegative TolC entrance constriction, may present a target for inhibitors of multidrug-resistant pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Great {{consumption}} of coal {{has transformed the}} underground coal mining industry with new features. The first is the increasing depth of cover of coal mining operations due to shallow resources being exhausted. Some operations overseas have been operated at an overburden of more than 1300 meters. The second feature is the intensified production concentration associated with the greatly improved advancing rate of longwall faces； a single face output has reached more than 10 million tonnes per annum. Deep operations are exposed to a high ground stress regime, high gas content, and coal and gas outburst risk. These issues cause changes in mine design, including {{but not limited to}} high demand for stone roadways， which are more stable than coal ones under high ground stress conditions. Stone gate roads are needed to accommodate cross measure drilling to protect coal gate drivage from the risk of high gas emissions and outburst hazards. Increasing longwall face advancing rate shortens the lifespan of panels. Further, it necessitates short longwall development time to achieve smooth panel succession. Improved coal gate development and stone gate development are essential to fulfil this requirement. A Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a kind of <b>tunnel</b> construction <b>machinery</b> which integrates the functions of excavation, ground support, mucking, lining， and surveying. It can achieve much higher heading rates than conventional drill and blast and roadheader methods, consequently, it has been proposed to be employed in underground coal mines to accommodate the requirement of high development rate...|$|R
25|$|In 1859, the {{railways}} arrived at Tavistock, {{in the form}} of the South Devon and Tavistock Railway. In order to remain competitive, £300 was spent on renewing the equipment on the inclined plane, and thought was given to buying a tug. However, Mr T. Knight proposed a system of ropes powered by waterwheels to pull the boats through the <b>tunnel,</b> and the <b>machinery</b> was installed. After less than a year it was acknowledged that the system was a failure, but the committee failed to find a way to dispose of the rope, although they tried for many years. Traffic and profits continued to fall, despite reductions in the tolls. The company petitioned the Duke in 1866 to reduce tolls for the use of Morwellham Quay, but he did not respond. In 1870, they offered all of the shares to the Duke, at a price of £10 each, but again the Duke did not show interest. Two years later, the Duke made an offer of £8 per share, providing that the company paid half of the cost of an Act of Parliament to authorise transfer of ownership to him. This was accepted, and the Tavistock Canal Act was obtained in May 1873, after which the Duke paid £3,200 to the shareholders. Although he had no responsibility to keep the canal open, it was listed as being open in official returns for 1883, but not in 1898.|$|R
