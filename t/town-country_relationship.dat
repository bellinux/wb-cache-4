More precisely, we suggest a simplified pattern based on the labour factor and more particularly on the labour demand. We attempt to periodize the long-term changing of industrial locations, since the « pre-industrial period ». This is not an overview of the main stages of urban and rural development, as in Bairoch or Hoehenberg & Lees. The history of change may contribute to clarify the following question, in relation with Fujita & Thisse « fundamental question »: « why don’t all economic activities tend to agglomerate in a small number of places –typically cities? ». After presenting the spatial dimension of the labour demand, we propose 3 main periods to account the spatial dynamics of industry over the last two centuries on the basis of changes in the labour demand...|$|E
40|$|There {{has arisen}} {{a great variety}} {{in the way we}} think about the {{relationship}} between town and country and in how those ideas are put into practical policy. The old certainties of the isolated town in a country setting have disappeared. By applying a discourse perspective we can understand and explain this variety better: different discourses can be identified within which people think about and act upon the relationship between town and country. An analysis in terms of discourses has certain advantages, apart from being a useful interpretive framework. For example, it admits the creative potential of ideas better than does an analysis in terms of power and interests, and it links theory and policy practice better than does an analysis in terms of paradigms. Finally, an analysis in terms of discourses suggests a way of generating new ideas for the theory about and the policy practice for the <b>town–country</b> <b>relationship.</b> Innovative ideas are likely to be found where two or more discourses meet and challenge each other. This is illustrated by reference to a large-scale programme which has been prepared for fundamental research into the relationship between town and country and new ideas for strategic policy...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} an event: an {{abortive}} royalist insurrection {{in the city of}} Nîmes in June 1790 and its aftermath - a series of royalist revolts centred upon the commune of Berrias in the department of the Ardèche in 1790, 1791 and 1792. The thesis is divided into four parts, each designed to contribute to an explanation of what made these events possible. Part I is a discussion of the composition and ideological assumptions of royalism in the South-East of France. Part II consists of an examination of the social and economic structure of Nimes in the eighteenth century. Part III {{is a study}} of the relationship between Nimes and its hinterland as it was organised through the production of silk. Part IV deals with {{the manner in which the}} form of this <b>town-country</b> <b>relationship</b> intersected with tensions and conflicts within the city itself in the later eighteenth century. It is argued from this analysis that it is impossible to explain royalism in unilateral terms. Royalism was the product of a developing social process; it cannot therefore be deduced from the divisions which it contributed to produce after 1790. Royalists became royalists because of the particular form of their relationship to those who became "patriots" in the decades preceeding 1790. Secondly, royalism cannot be explained exclusively in terms of local and regional tensions. Royalists occupied a particular place within the hierarchy of functions which articulated the relationship between Nimes and its hinterland. Rather, therefore, than deducing royalism from tensions at one particular level - whether of the village, small town, region or city - this study has sought to explain royalism in terms of the relationship between these different levels, and of the manner in which contemporaries sought to understand this relationship. The argument pursued throughout this study is that royalism in the South-East can be seen as one possible "solution" to the "problem" of social mobility in eighteenth century France...|$|E
