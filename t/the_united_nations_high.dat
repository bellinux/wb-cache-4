The fighting drove more than 800,000 Tamils from their homes to other places within Sri Lanka as internally displaced persons and also overseas, prompting <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>High</b> Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to identify them in 2004 as the largest asylum-seeking group.|$|E
