5|$|The main backfield {{positions}} are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB). The quarterback {{is the leader}} of <b>the</b> <b>offense.</b> Either he or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>offense</b> {{is given}} a series of four plays, known as downs. If <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> {{advances}} ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded {{a new set of}} four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> reaches their fourth down they will punt the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in field goal range, they might also attempt to score a field goal. A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements. On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E

5|$|On May 18, 1979, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats traded Allemang and a {{draft pick}} to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for linebacker Harry Walters and {{defensive}} end Jim Heighton. The retirement of the Buddy Brown left the Blue Bombers {{looking for an}} offensive guard, and they transitioned Allemang into this role {{on the right side}} of the offensive line. Allemang played in all 16 regular season games during the 1979 season, primarily on <b>the</b> <b>offense.</b> He returned to the defensive line in 1980 and alternated between <b>the</b> <b>offense</b> and defense for the remainder of his time with the Blue Bombers. In 1981, Allemang saw a reduced role, playing in only four games. After playing 36 total regular season games with the Blue Bombers, Allemang was cut in October 1981.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> wheel <b>offense</b> {{can also}} {{integrate}} other offensive plays. Pinholster's Oglethorpe team would often run some concealment plays {{before they start}} <b>the</b> wheel <b>offense.</b> This made <b>the</b> wheel <b>offense</b> very hard to detect, and they could catch the defense off guard. During the play, when <b>the</b> wheel <b>offense</b> is in <b>the</b> 1-3-1 formation, it can also switch to other plays {{based on the same}} formation. This greatly increases the variation of <b>the</b> wheel <b>offense,</b> making it very hard to defend.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> wheel <b>offense</b> is very {{advantageous}} to use. First {{it is very}} flexible and easy to set up.

The mens rea elements differ in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. <b>The</b> <b>offenses</b> also differ in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. <b>The</b> <b>offenses</b> also differ in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>offenses</b> differ in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|R
