5|$|Although the {{settlement}} of the Americas occurred some 20,000 years ago, when the first Asians crossed the Bering Strait into Alaska, the earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area dates to around 3,000 B.C. along the shores of <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> with evidence pointing to even earlier settlement in Point Reyes in Marin County. The Miwokan and Costanoan Ohlone people, who were living in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area {{at the time of}} first European contact, were possibly descended from Siberian tribes who arrived at around 1,000 BC by sailing over the Arctic Ocean and following the salmon migration. The Ohlone lived in about forty or so tribes spread throughout the lands adjacent to the San Francisco Bay and as far south as Point Sur in near Monterey Bay.|$|E

5000|$|A {{result of}} exploitation, however, {{has been the}} {{degradation}} of {{a significant portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>bay's</b> natural resources; <b>the</b> area is also susceptible to seismic activity.

5|$|Another serious effect {{created by}} the oil-related {{industries}} has been the pollution around the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay. By the 1970s, these waterways {{were among the most}} polluted waters in the United States. Though industrial sources were major sources of pollution, urbanization around <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> also contributed significantly to pollution levels. In recent decades, most of the pollution in <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> is the result of storm run-off from various smaller commercial, agricultural, and residential sources, as opposed to the major industrial complexes. Conservation efforts in the mid to late 20th century by area industries and municipalities have helped to dramatically improve water quality in <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> reversing {{at least some of the}} earlier damage to the ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|By 17:10, Thetis and Blonde {{began to}} {{withdraw}} from <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> as the fire {{took hold of the}} first frigate. The rest of the British squadron, despite heavy cannon fire from a fort on shore, successfully landed their troops and stormed and captured the defences. There were heavy casualties in the storming parties, including Hugh Cameron, captain of Hazard, who was killed by grapeshot. At 17:20, the fire reached the magazines of the burning flûte, and the ensuing explosion hurled burning wreckage across <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> The British ships were largely untouched, but the second French flûte was struck by a large piece of flaming timber, which ignited her mainmast and destroyed her as well. The operations successfully completed, the British ships embarked their landing parties, who had demolished the fortifications around <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> and returned to open water.|$|E

5|$|Copano Bay is a northwestern {{extension}} of Aransas Bay, west of Rockport, Texas in Refugio and Aransas counties. It is supplied with seawater from the Gulf of Mexico via Aransas Bay, and fed freshwater from the Aransas River, Mission River and Copano Creek. As an estuary, <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> {{is home to}} a diverse ecosystem consisting of various birds including the endangered whooping crane, and numerous finfish including the redfish as well as shellfish such as oysters. It is classified as a nursery for shrimp, which prohibits production from <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> Copano Bay is also a historic location for human usage and settlement that dates back to the 18th century, beginning with the historic port of El Copano and the 19th century settlements of St. Mary's of Aransas and Copano. The present-day towns of Bayside, Copano Village and Holiday Beach were all founded in the 20th century. Oil and natural gas are pumped from below the bay's surface, and contribute to the livelihood of the local economies. Recently, areas around <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> were affected by Hurricane Harvey which crossed over <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E
50|$|Dumping sewage in to <b>the</b> <b>bays</b> of Sag Harbor {{was a major}} problem.

5|$|During the 19th century salt {{evaporation}} ponds were dug in tidal marshes around <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> producing salt for condiments {{and to be}} used as a preservative for meats. Today, due to the bay's location, east of Goose Island State Park {{and west}} of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, very little industry can be found. No industrial plants are located on the bay's shore, but a few gas and oil wells are present. The Continental Oil Company is allowed to obtain oil and gas from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge as part of the purchase of St. Charles Ranch. Goose Island offers a few piers and campgrounds facing <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> which encourage tourism. The privately owned St. Charles Bay Hunting Club is also found in this area, and allows hunting, boating and fishing on <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> while striving to protect the ecosystem. The lack of coastal winds also attracts tourists interested in kayaking and wadefishing, however, boating is hindered by the general shallowness of <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> and the abundance of oyster reefs. Shellfish production is approved throughout <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> but shrimping is prohibited due to the classification of St. Charles Bay as a nursery bay.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, {{many of the}} {{communities}} and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area Houston Economic Partnership, and <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. Though most of the communities {{in the region have}} been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, and the development of summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area today.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of Mexican control, <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> was put off limits to {{settlement}} by the authorities. An empresario granted in 1828 allowed Irish and Mexican immigration. In 1832, the settlement of Aransas City on <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> was founded by James Power. After {{the development of the}} nearby port Lamar in 1840, Aransas City was deserted by 1846. But Lamar soon met a similar fate, after being burnt to the ground during the American Civil War. The city of Aransas, which was founded on San Jose Island around the same time as Lamar, was also destroyed in the fighting. During the war, <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> was a strategically significant waterway for the transfer of freight, due to its protection from Gulf seas by barrier islands.|$|E

5|$|Even as {{the growth}} of the {{technology}} sector transformed the region's economy, progressive politics continued to guide the region's political environment. By the turn of the millennium, Non-Hispanic whites, the largest ethnic group in the United States, were only half of the population in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area as immigration among minority groups accelerated. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area {{was the center of the}} LGBT rights movement: in 2004, San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, a first in the United States, and four years later, a majority of voters in <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area rejected California Proposition 8, which sought to constitutionally restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples but ultimately passed statewide. <b>The</b> <b>Bay</b> Area was also the center of contentious protests concerning racial and economic inequality. In 2009, an African American man named Oscar Grant was fatally shot by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officers, precipitating widespread protests across the region and even riots in Oakland, and whose name was symbolically tied to the Occupy Oakland protests two years later that sought to fight against social and economic inequality. Following the Inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2017, <b>the</b> <b>Bay</b> Area became a center of resistance to his administration, beginning with widespread protests in concert with the nationwide Women's March a day later, followed by frequent public feuds between Trump and various Bay Area political, cultural, and business figures over issues of race and immigration, among others.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{location}} of Aransas bay, shipping {{has always been a}} major industry. Following the Civil War, the meatpacking industry became a major source of income for ports on <b>the</b> <b>bay,</b> especially Rockport and Fulton, where numerous slaughterhouses were constructed. In the early years of meatpacking, cattle were slaughtered strictly for their hide since {{there was no way to}} refrigerate the meat. As a result, most of the left over cow parts not used as pig feed, were disposed in <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> This changed in 1871, when an ice machine was installed in a packing plant. By this time, the meatpacking industry near Aransas Bay reached its prime. Prior to the decline of the industry in the area, in 1880, 93% of the beef from Texas slaughterhouses were processed in Rockport-Fulton. Along with fishing, oyster farming and most notably shrimping became major industries on <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> in the early 20th century. Shipbuilding also developed and reached its prime following the first World War. During World War II, the United States Navy took over several shipyards. In 1936, oil was discovered on <b>the</b> <b>bay.</b> By 1946, 13 wells were in operation. In 1990, 498,703 barrels were produced, part of the 77 million barrels produced between 1936 and 1990. Today, tourism is a prosperous industry. Numerous hotels are set up along <b>the</b> <b>bay</b> for individuals wanting to fish, bird or sight-see. A large concentration of hotels are located in Rockport, where the bay's only beach (Rockport Beach) is located.|$|E
