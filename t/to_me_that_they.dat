25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

He informed Maryland athletic director Deborah Yow of the infractions and initially suggested sending all of the curfew violators back to Maryland by bus. Yow dissented, and they agreed to suspend the players {{for part of the}} game. Describing the incident, Friedgen said that [...] "Five percent of [...] guys thought they didn't need to listen <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could get bed checked and sneak out."

Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised.

I know my representation is most serious, but if we are to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; [...] "dig yourselves right in and stick it out... dig, dig, dig until you are safe".

500|$|The Moon Shaped Pool tour drew {{criticism}} for its {{inclusion of a}} date in Tel Aviv on 19 July, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. Radiohead were subject to protests at some concerts, where sections of the audience unfurled Palestinian flags. On 23 April, more than 50 prominent figures, including musician Roger Waters, whose 2017 album Is This the Life We Really Want? was produced by Godrich, signed a petition urging Radiohead to cancel the show. Yorke told Rolling Stone he found the criticism [...] "extremely upsetting ... choose to, rather than engage with us personally, throw shit at us in public. It's deeply disrespectful to assume that we're either being misinformed or that we're so retarded we can't make these decisions ourselves. I thought it was patronising in the extreme." [...] He felt the criticisms created [...] "divisive energy" [...] rather than [...] "bring people together". Godrich added {{that he did not}} [...] "believe in cultural boycotts ... I don't think they're positive, ever ... The people you'd be denying [...] are the people who would agree with you and don't necessarily agree with their government." [...] Waters responded in a public statement saying he had written to Yorke months earlier, but that Yorke had replied angrily and not replied to further correspondence. On 11 July, filmmaker Ken Loach wrote in the Independent that [...] " [...] stubborn refusal to engage with the many critics of their ill-advised concert in Tel Aviv suggests <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> only want to hear one side – the one that supports apartheid... Radiohead need to decide if they stand with the oppressed or with the oppressor." [...] Yorke responded in a statement: [...] "Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression." [...] The show went ahead as planned, with Yorke telling the audience: [...] "A lot was said about this, but in the end we played some music." ...|$|E

Meredith accused Lee Cheuk-yan for ignoring such facts, saying that Lee's [...] "Cultural Revolution-style" [...] banners targeted tycoon Li Ka-shing and even Hutchison businesses, stating making politicised and exaggerated gestures do not help.

[...] "My aim is not to shake my {{listener}} up, but just {{to tell a story}} and then hope that this story helps a person to evoke something intimate and important in their own memory", she said in another interview. According to the singer, one is not supposed to sing romance seriously, though: irony here is essential. [...] "Not sarcasm, but irony.

[...] Malaria attacks could easily become worse if the patient was reinfected by a trip to Panama. [...] Even in the 1860s, malaria was easily distinguishable from yellow fever. [...] Yellow fever is not a chronic disease. [...] The victim has a single acute episode, with liver complications (hence the yellow skin color). [...] If you survive the attack, you are immune to later episodes. Decompression sickness is acute, very painful, but would not show the fever or liver symptoms associated with malaria or yellow fever.

[...] In June 2006 the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I was sold to Ronald Lauder for $135million, at the time a record price for a painting. Eileen Kinsella, the editor of ARTnews, considered the high price was due to several factors, particularly the painting's provenance, the increasing demand for Austrian Expressionism, rising prices in the art world and [...] "Lauder's passion for and pursuit of this particular work". Lauder placed the work in the Neue Galerie, the New York-based gallery he co-founded. The painting has been on display at the location since.|$|E

2500|$|Anish Kapoor {{became known}} in the 1980s for his {{geometric}} or biomorphic sculptures made using simple materials such as granite, limestone, marble, pigment, and plaster. These early sculptures are frequently simple, curved forms, usually monochromatic and brightly coloured, using powder pigment to define and permeate the form. [...] "While making the pigment pieces, it occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> all form themselves out of each other. So I decided {{to give them a}} generic title, A Thousand Names, implying infinity, a thousand being a symbolic number. The powder works sat on the floor or projected from the wall. The powder on the floor defines the surface of the floor and the objects appear to be partially submerged, like icebergs. That seems to fit inside the idea of something being partially there." [...] Such use of pigment characterised his first high-profile exhibit as part of the New Sculpture exhibition at the Hayward Gallery London in 1978.|$|E

2500|$|I want to {{make this}} {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone.

So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this.

2500|$|In 1995, Howarth {{left the}} {{role for the}} first time. Significantly brought on by Todd's {{redemption}} storyline, {{he said he had}} no desire to portray a redeemed Todd. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos that he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were taking the character on a different path [...] they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord.
