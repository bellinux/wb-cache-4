25|$|While {{serving in}} the House of Representatives, Schumer, along with California senator Dianne Feinstein, {{authored}} the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban which expired in 2004. The National Rifle Association and other gun groups (see gun politics) have criticized him for allegedly not knowing much about guns, alluding to various errors regarding the subject. Supporters of gun control legislation, however, give him {{much of the credit}} for passage of both <b>the</b> <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> Ban and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. <b>The</b> <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> Ban, which banned semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with certain features, expired in September 2004 despite attempts by Schumer to extend it. He was one of 16 senators to vote against the Vitter Amendment, which prohibited the confiscation of legally owned firearms during a disaster.|$|E

25|$|The story hinges {{upon the}} {{enactment}} and subsequent unintended consequences of several important pieces of U.S. gun control legislation and regulation: the National Firearms Act of 1934, the Gun Control Act of 1968, the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, <b>the</b> <b>Assault</b> <b>Weapons</b> Importation Ban enacted by Presidential executive order in 1989 and the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.|$|E

The act was then revived in 2005, and, despite Feinstein's best efforts, was passed without an extension of <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> ban. In response to the Sandy Hook School massacre, Sen. Feinstein has reintroduced legislation to reinstate the ban on assault weapons, as well as many more restrictions.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the Virginia Tech Massacre in 2007, Moran told a local radio station that the Federal Assault Weapons Ban should be {{reinstated}} {{despite the fact that}} the shooting had been carried out by a pistol legal under <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>weapons</b> ban, thus would have had no effect upon the shooting, and blamed the National Rifle Association, which he accused of getting a [...] "free ride", and President George W.
