5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E
5|$|In 1032, Barbolano {{himself was}} deposed {{by those who}} wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge lay dying in Constantinople {{and was unable to}} return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, {{attempted}} to seize the throne without waiting for <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of an election, but as soon as he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne simply because {{he was the son of}} Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely checked, and Domenico Flabanico, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election of a son of a Doge.|$|E

5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully secret trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E

25|$|Henry III also {{installed}} the three successors to Pope Leo IX (1049–1054), all Germans, without <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of election. However, {{the death of}} Henry III {{and the rise of}} child emperor Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor allowed Pope Nicholas II (1059–1061) to promulgate In Nomine Domini in 1059, ensuring that all future elections (and, eventually, conclaves) would conform to a basic process that has remained largely unchanged for almost a millennium.|$|E
25|$|During the {{recuperation}} period, Mandrell {{was unable}} to work, so needed to collect on her insurance to pay for medical bills and to keep her band paid. On the Ralph Emery on the Record show, Mandrell explained that the problem was that, under Tennessee law, {{she had to go}} through <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of filing a lawsuit against survivors of the dead driver who had caused the accident, 19-year-old college student Mark White, to collect from her own insurance company.|$|E
25|$|In {{parody of}} the college’s Oxbridge traditions, the first year {{students}} will occasionally disrupt <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of the meal by hurling buns at their fellow undergraduates.

This is generally done with much struggle, however with little injury to any of the parties concerned. As the artillery is traditionally limited to simple bread rolls, no significant damage results from these incidents.|$|E

Since everyone knows {{that it would be}} impolite to comment on the quality of a handshake, regardless of how strange it may be, the subject is obliged to embark on an inner search (known as a transderivational search, a universal and compelling type of trance) to identify the meaning or purpose of the subverted pattern.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusion}} of Caravaggio also {{marked the beginning}} of a temporary abandonment of traditional narrative in Jarman's films. Frustrated by <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of 35mm film production, and by the dependence on institutions and the resultant prolonged inactivity associated with it (which had already cost him seven years with Caravaggio, as well as derailing several long-term projects), Jarman returned to and expanded the super 8mm-based form he had previously worked in on Imagining October and The Angelic Conversation. Caravaggio was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement.|$|E

25|$|Suit jackets in all styles {{typically}} {{have three or}} four buttons on each cuff, which are often purely decorative (the sleeve is usually sewn closed and cannot be unbuttoned to open). Five buttons are unusual and are a modern fashion innovation. The number of buttons is primarily a function of <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of the suit; a very casual summer sports jacket might traditionally (1930s) have had only one button, while tweed suits {{typically have}} three and city suits four. In the 1970s, two buttons were seen on some city suits. Today, four buttons are common on most business suits and even casual suits.|$|E
25|$|In a line {{of cases}} {{beginning}} with Crawford v. Washington, decided in 2004, Thomas has joined with Justice Scalia and several liberals on the court in reasserting {{the importance of the}} Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, by declaring testimonial statements inadmissible at trial unless the witness is unavailable and there has been ample opportunity for cross-examination; however, his decisions in these cases had not always aligned with Scalia's. In his concurring opinion in the 2011 case Michigan v. Bryant, for example, Thomas explains that in deciding whether a statement is testimonial, one must consider <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of the circumstances in which it was given.|$|E
25|$|An {{agreement}} was indeed reached; it stated that Edward would voluntarily relinquish his continental lands to Philip {{as a sign}} of submission in his capacity as the duke of Aquitaine. In return, Philip would forgive Edward and restore his land after a grace period. In the matter of the marriage, Philip drove a hard bargain based partially on the difference in age between Edward and Blanche; it was agreed that the province of Gascony would be retained by Philip in return for agreeing to the marriage. The date of the wedding was also put off until <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of sequestering and re-granting the French lands back to Edward was completed.|$|E

25|$|The Apex Group had steady {{regional}} work at {{clubs and}} military bases, but Hunter bristled at <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of the band, who wore matching stage jackets and were moving increasingly toward an R stage revue. In 1963, while still a group member, Hunter formed a band in direct competition to them: Hurricane Henry and the Shriekers, with Tony Marriott on drums and Julian Coulter on guitar. They worked steadily in Northampton, and {{attracted the attention}} of pianist Freddie 'Fingers' Lee. Lee took over as frontman in March 1964, and Hunter moved to bass. Frank Short eventually learned of Hunter's duplicity, and Hunter was kicked out of The Apex Group.|$|E
25|$|Whitmore's son, also William, {{added the}} old family name of Wolryche to his own. A man of {{enormous}} energy, {{he not only}} had an active career as a reforming M.P., but also greatly modified the house and grounds. In the hall his improvements include a fine Regency staircase, new windows, and a large new dining room – now the modern art gallery. He also completely reshaped the landscape to the west, which forms the main view from the hall. The Big Pool was formed by combining three small lakes and terraces constructed, with small flights of steps and walls. To the south he broke <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> with the American Border, an area that was then planted mainly with rhododendrons but today contains {{a wide range of}} Asian and American plants.|$|E
25|$|The dogs {{join the}} people, their {{inclusion}} with the servants in the portrait invites commentary on Graham's circle. Trump's officious pose and lolling tongue, while wearing Graham's wig and brandishing the scroll of paper, makes light of <b>the</b> <b>formality</b> of Graham's position. Trump represents Hogarth in the painting, while his pose with the scroll, as used by musical conductors of the time, {{suggest that he}} may be the humorous conductor for the music and singing taking place. The steward stands at the left of the painting under a hanging crown compass, and carelessly drips gravy down the chaplain's neck, adding a final element of farce to the setting. In the relaxed and informal setting of the cabin, adding touches of humour and foolishness, Hogarth provides a contrast with the dangers of the pitched battle that the painting commemorates.|$|E
