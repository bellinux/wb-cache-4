5|$|The {{majority}} of the equatorial region of Vesta is sculpted {{by a series of}} concentric <b>troughs.</b> The largest is named Divalia Fossa (10–20km wide, 465km long). Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia Fossa dwarfs the Grand Canyon. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. The largest of the northern <b>troughs</b> is named Saturnalia Fossa (≈ 40km wide, > 370km long). These <b>troughs</b> are thought to be large-scale graben resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the longest chasms in the Solar System, nearly as long as Ithaca Chasma on Tethys. The <b>troughs</b> may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process that can happen only in a body that, like Vesta, is differentiated. Vesta's differentiation {{is one of the reasons}} why scientists consider it a protoplanet.|$|E
5|$|Diverging {{winds aloft}} ahead of these <b>troughs</b> cause {{atmospheric}} lift within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts {{the force of}} gravity.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the <b>troughs</b> that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see <b>Troughs</b> section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
40|$|An {{objective}} {{method was}} developed to analyze longwave and shortwave <b>trough</b> lines in wind field data using different methods, given that these <b>trough</b> lines were researched in different ways. Longwave <b>trough</b> lines were analyzed by locating the cyclonic center and filtering candidate <b>trough</b> points simultaneously; the candidate longwave <b>trough</b> points were then traced based on distance and angle conditions. Next, candidate shortwave <b>trough</b> points were determined based on angular deflection and vorticity data, which were clustered and fitted to a curve for extraction. This method was applied to wind field data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to analyze <b>trough</b> lines in East Asia and South Asia. The experimental results show that our method can effectively identify <b>trough</b> lines by comparing them with manual analysis results. The statistical {{results indicate that the}} method more precisely identifies longwave <b>trough</b> lines than shortwave <b>trough</b> lines, and that <b>trough</b> lines during the fall and winter are more accurately and effectively identified than those during the spring and summer...|$|R
30|$|The ionospheric {{mid-latitude}} <b>trough</b> is a {{depleted region}} of ionospheric plasma density in the nightside F region and lies just equatorward of the auroral equatorward boundary. Throughout the paper, <b>trough</b> will refer {{specifically to the}} mid-latitude <b>trough.</b> The <b>trough</b> generally consists of three parts: an equatorward wall, a <b>trough</b> minimum, and a poleward wall. Because the large electron density gradient {{on either side of}} the <b>trough</b> affects radio wave propagation, the precise position of the <b>trough</b> is very important for many practical activities, such as trans-ionospheric communication and navigation.|$|R
30|$|The diurnal {{variation}} in the IRI-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position {{is similar to that}} of the GPS-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position. The GPS-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position changes little with F 107, whereas the IRI-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position shows a strong F 107 dependence.|$|R
5|$|If enough {{moisture}} exists, thunderstorms {{can form}} along sea breeze fronts that then can send out outflow boundaries. This causes chaotic wind/pressure regimes if the steering flow is weak. Like all other surface features, sea breeze fronts lie inside <b>troughs</b> of low pressure.|$|E
5|$|Storms that {{approach}} the southwestern United States, {{and by extension}} Arizona, generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve northwards {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. These <b>troughs</b> tend to extend farther to the south during {{the latter part of the}} Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. These pronounced <b>troughs</b> thus produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the southwestern United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{observed}} {{surface of}} Ariel {{can be divided}} into three terrain types: cratered terrain, ridged terrain, and plains. The main surface features are impact craters, canyons, fault scarps, ridges, and <b>troughs.</b>|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the <b>trough</b> structure averaged longitudinally {{over the course of}} a day. The longitudinal average of the <b>trough</b> structure depends not only on the longitude effect of the <b>trough</b> occurrence rate (He et al. 2011) but also on the longitude effect of the <b>trough</b> structure (Karpachev 2003). The occurrence rate of the <b>trough</b> shows significant variations depending on the season, solar activity, and MLT (Ishida et al. 2014). The longitude effect of the <b>trough</b> minimum position primarily depends on the Kp (Karpachev et al. 1996). These factors can lead to the large scatter of the data and make the interpretation of the data in terms of physical processes more difficult. Although these limitations exist, our results are consistent with those found in many earlier studies. During disturbed conditions, the temperature associated with the disturbed electric field increases in the <b>trough</b> region, and the plasma density at a <b>trough</b> minimum decreases. However, in this study, the TEC at the <b>trough</b> minimum remained constant with increasing Kp. Pryse et al. (2006) investigated the TEC <b>trough</b> in the United Kingdom and found the same feature. Therefore, the relationship between the TEC value at the <b>trough</b> minimum and the temperature at the <b>trough</b> minimum is needed to study at different geomagnetic activities, which can help us understand the physical mechanism of <b>trough</b> formation. In addition, a quantitative test of the wind effect in the <b>trough</b> is also needed in the future.|$|R
30|$|Step 3. <b>Trough</b> detection: Recalling {{the list}} of {{identified}} R peaks, another algorithm searches for the <b>trough</b> preceding the peak. The algorithm takes relative slope information backwards from the R peak; {{from right to left}} of the signal, this would consist of first a negative slope (R to Q), followed by a positive slope (Q to <b>trough),</b> then a zero or negative slope (<b>trough).</b> If a <b>trough</b> is not detected, then a nearby data point from the identified Q point is used as an estimate of the <b>trough.</b>|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} numerical {{simulations of}} the Australian West Coast <b>Trough</b> were conducted using a mesoscale model. These simulations represent {{the process of}} formation, development and disappearance of the <b>trough</b> and highlight the role of surface features in <b>trough</b> behaviour. Strong land surface heating strengthens the <b>trough</b> whereas topography and sea surface temperatures are of marginal importance. Diurnal variations in surface heating between the land and ocean lead to the <b>trough</b> line oscillating around the coast whereas its more general eastward movement is synoptically controlled. The sea breeze circulation influences local <b>trough</b> orientation through maritime cooling...|$|R
5|$|The second main terrain type—ridged terrain—comprises {{bands of}} ridges and <b>troughs</b> {{hundreds}} of kilometers in extent. It bounds the cratered terrain and cuts it into polygons. Within each band, {{which can be}} up to 25 to 70km wide, are individual ridges and <b>troughs</b> up to 200km long and between 10 and 35km apart. The bands of ridged terrain often form continuations of canyons, suggesting {{that they may be}} a modified form of the graben or the result of a different reaction of the crust to the same extensional stresses, such as brittle failure.|$|E
5|$|They {{drink at}} various places, from stock <b>troughs</b> to puddles, {{and do so}} in the early morning or late in the afternoon. Insect larvae and Fabaceae seeds are among food {{reported}} to have been fed to young.|$|E
5|$|When {{the general}} flow pattern buckles from a zonal pattern to the meridional pattern, a slower {{movement}} in a north or southward direction is more likely. Meridional flow patterns feature strong, amplified <b>troughs</b> and ridges, generally with more northerly and southerly flow.|$|E
30|$|This study {{statistically}} {{investigated the}} seasonal variation, magnetic local time (MLT) variation, geomagnetic activity dependence, and solar activity {{dependence of the}} mid-latitude <b>trough</b> using GPS total electron content (TEC) data from 2000 to 2014. The daily median Kp index was used to characterize the daily geomagnetic activity level. The {{results showed that the}} <b>trough</b> minimum position depended primarily on the geomagnetic activity, MLT, and the season. The <b>trough</b> depth depended primarily on the solar flux index (F 107) and, to a lesser degree, on MLT. The <b>trough</b> depth increased as F 107 increased and as the incidence angle of solar flux decreased. The <b>trough</b> equatorward half-width decreased as the geomagnetic activity increased. These variations in the GPS-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position were compared with the variations in the TEC <b>trough</b> derived from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI)- 2007 model. The GPS-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position changed little with respect to F 107, whereas the IRI-TEC <b>trough</b> minimum position showed a strong F 107 dependence.|$|R
50|$|It {{is formed}} by a wooden beam {{suspended}} {{so that the}} part that supports the pestle {{is larger than the}} other, which ends with a <b>trough.</b> A spout fills the <b>trough</b> with the water, thus raising the pestle. When the <b>trough</b> is full, it lowers the <b>trough,</b> and when the <b>trough</b> spills the water, the beam falls, causing the pestle to hit the mortar. As such, the monjolo is an important tool for agricultural facilitation.|$|R
40|$|Class of 2008 AbstractObjectives: A novel {{method of}} {{predicting}} vancomycin <b>trough</b> levels at steady state was studied {{to determine whether}} it could effectively predict vancomycin <b>trough</b> levels compared to an established predictor method (Matzke). Methods: Adult patients who received at least two consecutive doses of vancomycin and had at least one reported vancomycin <b>trough</b> at steady state were considered. Data extracted and analyzed included patient gender, age, weight, height, and serum creatinine as well as vancomycin dose and interval, number of consecutive doses prior to the <b>trough,</b> time between <b>trough</b> and preceding dose, and measured vancomycin <b>trough</b> level. This data was applied to each of the prediction methods to determine how accurately they predicted actual measured vancomycin <b>trough</b> levels at steady state. Results: Data from 103 patients was analyzed. Vancomycin <b>trough</b> predictions using the Bergstrom method averaged 12. 2 mg/dl, {{with a standard deviation of}} 3. 4. The average actual <b>trough</b> concentration was 10. 7 mg/dl with a standard deviation of 3. 9, while the Matzke method predicted an average <b>trough</b> concentration of 19. 2 mg/dl with a standard deviation of 8. 6. Predictions made using the Bergstrom Method were not significantly different than the actual <b>trough</b> concentrations (p = 0. 91). The Bergstrom method predicted concentrations within 25...|$|R
5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and <b>troughs</b> relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} often {{transform into}} extratropical cyclones {{at the end}} of their tropical existence, usually between 30° and 40° latitude, where there is sufficient forcing from upper-level <b>troughs</b> or shortwaves riding the Westerlies for the process of extratropical transition to begin. During this process, a cyclone in extratropical transition (known across the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans as the post-tropical stage), will invariably form or connect with nearby fronts and/or <b>troughs</b> consistent with a baroclinic system. Due to this, the size of the system will usually appear to increase, while the core weakens. However, after transition is complete, the storm may re-strengthen due to baroclinic energy, depending on the environmental conditions surrounding the system. The cyclone will also distort in shape, becoming less symmetric with time.|$|E
5|$|Warm fronts are at {{the leading}} edge of a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, which is located on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader <b>troughs</b> of low pressure than cold fronts. A warm front moves more slowly than the cold front which usually follows because cold air is denser and harder to remove from the Earth's surface.|$|E

50|$|Transverse waves {{cause the}} medium to vibrate at {{a right angle}} to the {{direction}} of the wave or energy being carried by the medium. Transverse waves have two parts - the crest and the <b>trough.</b> The crest is the highest point of the wave and the <b>trough</b> is the lowest. The distance between a crest and a <b>trough</b> is half of wavelength. The wavelength is the distance from crest to crest or from <b>trough</b> to <b>trough.</b>|$|R

5|$|By June29, a trough, {{moving through}} the westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) from the center. Convection became displaced {{from the center of}} circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving <b>troughs</b> to the north.|$|E
5|$|Idiophones were {{extremely}} important in Chinese music, hence {{the majority of}} early instruments were idiophones. Poetry of the Shang dynasty mentions bells, chimes, drums, and globular flutes carved from bone, the latter {{of which has been}} excavated and preserved by archaeologists. The Zhou dynasty saw percussion instruments such as clappers, <b>troughs,</b> wooden fish, and yǔ (wooden tiger). Wind instruments such as flute, pan-pipes, pitch-pipes, and mouth organs also appeared in this time period. The xiao (an end-blown flute) and various other instruments that spread through many cultures, came into use in China during and after the Han dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not {{propagate}} {{at a speed}} equal to c; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and <b>troughs</b> of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate what influence, if any, the size of the feeding <b>trough</b> has on the feeding patterns of weaner pigs fed a liquid diet. The work comprised of a pilot study; followed by a larger main trial consisting of four <b>trough</b> treatments; two <b>trough</b> spaces, four <b>trough</b> spaces, six <b>trough</b> spaces and eight <b>trough</b> spaces. Each treatment was tried four times on four batches of 25 pigs so that in total 400 pigs were involved in the experiment. Growth performance and feed intake was measured. Behaviour at the <b>trough</b> was observed and recorded on four of the batches of 25 pigs, one from each of the treatments. The results showed that no treatment made any significant difference to growth performance or feed intake. A noticeable effect was found upon diurnal bimodal feeding patterns and a direct relationship between <b>trough</b> size and queuing behaviour was measured...|$|R

Then, Zamloch would tip over the <b>trough</b> and reveal it to be empty and dry. Zamloch later recalled that the enchanted <b>trough</b> was a big hit in Chicago, Omaha, and Kansas City.|$|R
5|$|Mimas is the {{smallest}} and least massive of the inner round moons, although its mass is sufficient to alter the orbit of Methone. It is noticeably ovoid-shaped, having been made shorter at the poles and longer at the equator (by about 20km) by the effects of Saturn's gravity. Mimas has a large impact crater one-third its diameter, Herschel, situated on its leading hemisphere. Mimas has no known past or present geologic activity, and its surface is dominated by impact craters. The only tectonic features known are a few arcuate and linear <b>troughs,</b> which probably formed when Mimas was shattered by the Herschel impact.|$|E

5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel <b>troughs</b> were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the <b>troughs,</b> there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on Track 1.|$|E
5000|$|Increases in the {{relative}} vorticity, or spin, with the monsoon <b>trough</b> are normally a product of increased wind convergence within the convergence zone of the monsoon <b>trough.</b> Wind surges can lead to this increase in convergence. A strengthening or equatorward movement in the subtropical ridge can cause a strengthening of a monsoon <b>trough</b> as a wind surge moves towards {{the location of the}} monsoon <b>trough.</b> As fronts move through the subtropics and tropics of one hemisphere during their winter, normally as shear lines when their temperature gradient becomes minimal, wind surges can cross the equator in oceanic regions and enhance a monsoon <b>trough</b> in the other hemisphere's summer. [...] A key way of detecting whether a wind surge has reached a monsoon <b>trough</b> is the formation of a burst of thunderstorms within the monsoon <b>trough.</b>|$|R
