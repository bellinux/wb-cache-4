5|$|<b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> is {{that under}} certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E

25|$|Let our graph {{have two}} {{partitions}} U, V. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> {{is to add}} two dummy vertices {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make sure that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we make sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E
500|$|If {{the edges}} are sorted by their weights, then a {{modified}} version of Dijkstra's algorithm can compute the bottlenecks between a designated start vertex and every other vertex in the graph, in linear time. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> behind the speedup over a conventional version of Dijkstra's algorithm is that the sequence of bottleneck distances to each vertex, in the order that the vertices are considered by this algorithm, is a monotonic subsequence of the sorted sequence of edge weights; therefore, the priority queue of Dijkstra's algorithm can be implemented as a bucket queue: an array indexed by the numbers from 1 to [...] (the number of edges in the graph), where array cell [...] contains the vertices whose bottleneck distance is the weight of the edge with position [...] in the sorted order. This method allows the widest path problem to be solved as quickly as sorting; for instance, if the edge weights are represented as integers, then the time bounds for integer sorting a list of [...] integers would apply also to this problem.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to absolute oneness, al-Kindi also described God as the Creator. This means that He acts {{as both a}} final and efficient cause. Unlike later Muslim Neo-Platonic philosophers (who asserted that the universe existed {{as a result of}} God's existence [...] "overflowing", which is a passive act), al-Kindi conceived of God as an active agent. In fact, of God as the agent, because all other intermediary agencies are contingent upon Him. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> here is that God [...] "acts" [...] through created intermediaries, which in turn [...] "act" [...] on one another – through a chain of cause and effect – to produce the desired result. In reality, these intermediary agents do not [...] "act" [...] at all, they are merely a conduit for God's own action.

2500|$|Fritz Perls, {{who helped}} to develop Gestalt therapy, was {{influenced}} by Reich, Jung and Freud. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> of gestalt therapy is that Freud overlooked the structure of awareness, [...] "an active process that moves toward the construction of organized meaningful wholes... between an organism and its environment." [...] These wholes, called gestalts, are [...] "patterns involving all the layers of organismic function – thought, feeling, and activity." [...] Neurosis is seen as splitting {{in the formation of}} gestalts, and anxiety as the organism sensing [...] "the struggle towards its creative unification." [...] Gestalt therapy attempts to cure patients through placing them in contact with [...] "immediate organismic needs." [...] Perls rejected the verbal approach of classical psychoanalysis; talking in gestalt therapy serves the purpose of self-expression rather than gaining self-knowledge. Gestalt therapy usually takes place in groups, and in concentrated [...] "workshops" [...] rather than being spread out {{over a long period of}} time; it has been extended into new forms of communal living.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{if we use}} {{very large}} blocks, then the {{estimate}} of per-character entropy rate may become artificially low. This is because in reality, the probability distribution of the sequence is not knowable exactly; it is only an estimate. For example, suppose one considers the text of every book ever published as a sequence, with each symbol being the text of a complete book. If there are [...] published books, and each book is only published once, the estimate of the probability of each book is , and the entropy (in bits) is [...] As a practical code, this corresponds to assigning each book a unique identifier and using it {{in place of the}} text of the book whenever one wants to refer to the book. This is enormously useful for talking about books, but it is not so useful for characterizing the information content of an individual book, or of language in general: {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct the book from its identifier without knowing the probability distribution, that is, the complete text of all the books. <b>The</b> <b>key</b> <b>idea</b> is that the complexity of the probabilistic model must be considered. Kolmogorov complexity is a theoretical generalization of this idea that allows the consideration of the information content of a sequence independent of any particular probability model; it considers the shortest program for a universal computer that outputs the sequence. A code that achieves the entropy rate of a sequence for a given model, plus the codebook (i.e. the probabilistic model), is one such program, but it may not be the shortest.|$|E
