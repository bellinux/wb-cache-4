5|$|After this {{successful}} {{series of}} patrols, Davis {{was ordered to}} conduct only one patrol a day {{in order to minimize}} the risk to him. The order had previously been sent on December 1, but Davis had apparently ignored it. Both <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> Davis' family had growing concerns that Chinese and Soviet pilots would be gunning for Davis, given his success and fame. By this point, Davis had 12 victories, and the second-highest scoring aces each had 6 victories. Davis was averaging one victory for three missions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1982, Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci sent a {{memorandum}} to <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> Navy, encouraging them to seek out potential foreign customers to procure FX aircraft. However, four months later Carlucci sent a classified memo to the same services to abandon the FX, and green-lighting the exporting of front-line fighters overseas. In December, after prompting from the White House, Carlucci reversed his position again, and directed the Air Force to fund {{a small number of}} F-20s in the fiscal year 1984 budget.|$|E
5|$|The USAF F-111A and Navy F-111B {{variants}} {{used the}} same airframe structural components and TF30-P-1 turbofan engines. They featured side-by-side crew seating in an escape capsule, {{as required by the}} Navy. Because of conflict between <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> Navy over whose requirements had precedence, McNamara intervened in 1961, declaring that the Air Force desires would override suggestions by the Navy. The F-111A variant first flew on 21 December 1964 from Carswell AFB, Texas. It was followed by the F-111B, which first flew on 18 May 1965.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the North Caucasus Military District commander and <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>force</b> <b>and</b> their roles in commanding were unclear. Colonel-General Aleksandr Zelin, commander-in-chief of the Air Force did not {{set foot in the}} command post, instead running Air-force operations on a mobile phone from his office without any help from his air-defence assistants. The air force was accused of rendering no assistance to land campaign.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{encouraged}} the local aircraft {{industry as a}} means to further the self-sufficiency of <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> Australian aviation in general. He played a personal part {{in the creation of the}} Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in November 1936, headed up by former Squadron Leader Lawrence Wackett, late of the RAAF's Experimental Section. Williams made the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he accompanied Squadron Leader Allan Walters and two aircrew aboard a Tugan Gannet to Singapore in February 1938.|$|E
5|$|After a posting to Amberley, Queensland, Cresswell {{served on}} the {{directing}} staff {{of the first two}} courses held at the newly formed RAAF Staff College, Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, as <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>force</b> <b>and</b> its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following demobilisation. On 10July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.|$|E

To be with her in New York City, Rothenberg journeyed to Canada, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia; traveling from there to Toronto, he lived for a while at Wycliffe College, where he worked briefly as a construction laborer. On 19 November 1948, he crossed the international border into the United States at Buffalo, with $12.00 in his pocket. In 1951, he volunteered for the United States Army, transferred to <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force,</b> <b>and</b> served in the Korean War until 1955.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the war, No.11 Group {{was formed}} on Morotai in the Dutch East Indies, using {{elements}} of Northern Command and the First Tactical Air Force; this freed the latter from garrison duties following the liberation of Borneo. In recommending the Morotai garrison's establishment, Bostock explained that while it shared the static characteristic of an area command, it differed in that the area commands were part of the permanent structure of <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> situated within the borders of Australia's mainland and overseas territories, whereas the new formation was a temporary wartime measure, headquartered on foreign territory.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 2005, the Pentagon {{formally}} approved full-rate {{production for}} the V-22, with planned rate increase from 11 {{a year to}} between 24 and 48 a year by 2012. Of the 458 total planned, 360 are for the U.S. Marine Corps, 50 for <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force,</b> <b>and</b> 48 for the Navy at an average cost of $110 million per aircraft, including development costs. The V-22 had an incremental flyaway cost of $67 million per aircraft in 2008, The U.S. Navy had hoped to shave about $10 million off that cost after a five-year production contract in 2013. The cost for each CV-22 was $73 million in the FY 2014 budget.|$|E

It began with three MiGs: two MiG-17Fs and a MiG-21 loaned by Israel, who had captured them from <b>the</b> Syrian <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> Iraqi <b>Air</b> <b>Force.</b> Later, it added MiG-21s from <b>the</b> Indonesian <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> other sources.|$|R
25|$|Since late 2010 the Ground Forces {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>and</b> Navy are {{distributed}} among four military districts: Western Military District, Southern Military District, Central Military District, and the Eastern Military District which also constitute four Joint Strategic Commands— West, South, Central, and East. Previously from 1992 to 2010, the Ground Forces were divided into six military districts: Moscow, Leningrad, North Caucausian, Privolzhsk-Ural, Siberian and Far Eastern and Russia's four fleets and one flotilla were organizations on par with the Ground Forces' Military Districts. These six MDs were merged into the four new MDs, which now also incorporate <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> naval <b>forces.</b> There is one remaining Russian military base, the 102nd Military Base, in Armenia left of the former Transcaucasus Group of Forces.

5|$|The A-10A single-seat variant was {{the only}} version produced, though one {{pre-production}} airframe was modified into the YA-10B twin-seat prototype to test an all-weather night capable version. In 2005, a program was started to upgrade remaining A-10A aircraft to the A-10C configuration, with modern avionics for use with precision weaponry. The U.S. Air Force had stated the F-35 would replace the A-10 as it entered service, but this remains highly contentious within <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> in political circles. With a variety of upgrades and wing replacements, the A-10's service life may be extended to 2040; the Air Force has no planned retirement date as of June 2017.|$|E

5|$|Studying {{the outcome}} of the events in Rolling Thunder, <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Force</b> <b>and</b> Navy came to very {{different}} conclusions on how to adapt. The Air Force noted that most of their air-to-air losses were due to unseen attacks from the rear, and thus the problem could be addressed through additional technology that would provide early warning of such attacks. They began modifying their aircraft with built-in M61 Vulcans for close-in use, adopted the Sidewinder and began upgrading them to improve their performance, and introduced new ground and air-based radars to provide an overall watch over the battlefield. The Navy concluded that the primary problem was that their pilots had not been given proper air combat maneuvering training, and were forced to rely on missiles that were not performing as expected. In 1968 they introduced the TOPGUN program, a move that was welcomed by the F-8 pilots who had been campaigning for this all along.|$|E
