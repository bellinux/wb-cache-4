40|$|Rainfall {{attenuation}} has {{a severe}} effect on signal strength and impairs communication links for future mobile and personal satellite communications using Ka-band and millimeter wave frequencies. As rain attenuation compensation techniques, several {{methods such as}} uplink power control, site diversity, and adaptive control of data rate or forward error correction have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a TDMA system that can compensate rain attenuation by adaptive control of transmission rates. To evaluate the performance of this <b>TDMA</b> <b>terminal,</b> we carried out three types of experiments: experiments using a Japanese CS- 3 satellite with Ka-band transponders, in house IF loop-back experiments, and computer simulations. Experimental results show that this TDMA system has advantages over the conventional constant-rate TDMA systems, as resource sharing technique, in both bit error rate and total TDMA burst lengths required for transmitting given information...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} {{in demand for}} channel capacity and the limitations in satellite power and frequency spectrum is leading to requirements for advanced multiple beam antenna systems with frequency reuse. The concept of the Olympus satellite evolved {{from the fact that}} new technologies and methods are to be explored for future satellites. The role of Olympus can be seen in both the development of earth station networks {{and at the same time}} the satellite requirements for the future satellites. It is a step between advanced transparent repeaters and the future intelligent satellite with on-board processing. A review of commercial and experimental satellites employed in the European region is given in the thesis. The services offered by these satellites and the access methods used are discussed with particular emphasis on business services. The new research work reported was done on the experiments related to the Olympus SS-TDMA payload. First a survey of commercial TDMA systems was performed and their capabilities discussed in detail for the SS-TDMA experimental application. The Olympus payload description and link budget analysis was performed in order to identify the size of the earth station required for these networks. The performance of the satellite link was simulated using BOSS software package together with some earlier simulation using the TOPSIM software package. The methods of BER estimation used are investigated and various results compared. These simulations covered most aspects of the RF (degradation due to TWTA non-linearity, fading, carrier spacing, co-channel interference) and some aspects of the baseband circuits. These simulation results have been compared with the experimental results and were found to be in close agreement. Thus giving confidence in the simulation methods used. In SS-TDMA the problem of acquisition and synchronisation is very important. In this respect the design of the acquisition and synchronisation unit (ASU) is discussed in detail. The resulting ASU was interfaced with the reference station of the commercial TDMA system for the first phase of the SS-TDMA experiments. Finally we present results of various network control methods for the SS-TDMA network, including the buffer requirement for the on-board clock control with the sidereal day clock correction. The ASU design, its interface to the reference <b>TDMA</b> <b>terminal</b> and successful operation with the reference station in acquiring and synchronising with the satellite switch provided the real time operation of the SS-TDMA scheme. The operation was conducted experimentally using the BTRL (British Telecom Research Labs) experimental earth station at Martlesham both in the "reference station loopback" and "reference station and traffic station" configuration via the the SS-TDMA switch. Full details of the experiments and comparison with systems simulations are presented in the thesis...|$|E
40|$|Burst-compression and -expansion {{technique}} enables interconnection {{of users}} transmitting and receiving data at rates asynchronous {{with respect to}} clocks within ground terminals of satellite-switched, time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) communication network. Matrix switch aboard satellite routes bursts of data from source users received on uplink antennas to downlink antennas illuminating ground areas containing destination users. <b>TDMA</b> ground <b>terminal</b> compresses streams of data from source users into rapid bursts for transmission and reexpands bursts of received data into slower streams of data for delivery to destination users. Greater flexibility in interconnecting widely dispersed users achieved by use of hopping beams...|$|R
40|$|Packet {{reservation}} {{multiple access}} (PRMA) {{can be considered}} as a merge of slotted ALOHA protocol and time division multiple access (<b>TDMA)</b> protocol. Independent <b>terminals</b> transmit packets to base station by contending to access an available time slots. A terminal that succeeds in reserving a certain time slot keeps on this reservation for transmitting its subsequent packets. Speech activity detection is used in PRMA to improve system capacity. In this work we propose a simpler contention mechanism that does not depend on a predetermined permission probability as in the original PRMA. In the new method, terminals select the contention slot uniformly from the pool of remaining free slots in the current frame. We evaluate the performance of the new contention mechanism in terms of various metrics including maximum number of carried voice calls and packet delays for a given acceptable drop rate of voice packets. We show that the new mechanism is superior to that of the original PRMA for loaded systems and is expected to be insensitive for traffic source burstiness...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend in}} {{satellite}} communications is toward completely digital, time {{division multiple access}} (TDMA) systems with uplink and downlink data rates dictated {{by the type of}} service offered. Trunking terminals will operate in the 550 MBPS (megabit per second) region uplink and downlink, whereas customer premise service (CPS) terminals will operate in the 25 to 10 MBPS region uplink and in the 200 MBPS region downlink. Additional criteria for the ground terminals will be to maintain clock sychronization with the system and burst time integrity to within a matter of nanoseconds, to process required order-fire information, to provide adaptive data scrambing, and to compensate for variations in the user input output data rates, and for changes in range in the satellite communications links resulting from satellite perturbations in orbit. To achieve the required adaptability of a ground terminal to the above mentioned variables, programmable building blocks can be developed that will meet all of these requirements. To maintain system synchronization, i. e., all bursted data arriving at the satellite within assigned <b>TDMA</b> windows, ground <b>terminal</b> transmit data rates and burst timing must be maintained within tight tolerances. With a programmable synchronizer as the heart of the terminal timing generation, variable data rates and burst timing tolerances are achievable. In essence, the unit inputs microprocessor generated timing words and outputs discrete timing pulses...|$|R
