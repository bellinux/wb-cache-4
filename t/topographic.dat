5|$|The Table Rocks {{offer an}} example of {{inverted}} relief, in which previous <b>topographic</b> lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new <b>topographic</b> highs after {{the erosion of the}} surrounding region. Each plateau is shaped roughly like a horseshoe because the lava followed the meanders of the Ancestral Rogue River.|$|E

5|$|The policy {{commenced}} {{during the}} final years of the Ottoman Empire and continued into the Turkish Republic. Under the Kemalist oriented government, specialized governmental commissions were created for the purpose of changing names. Approximately 28,000 <b>topographic</b> names were changed, which included 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other <b>topographic</b> names. Most name changes occurred in the eastern regions of the country where minority ethnicities form a large part or a majority of the population. Policies at times included banning the use of foreign names that were considered divisive and inappropriate.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} <b>topographic</b> {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a <b>topographic</b> high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{started his}} {{study in the}} anatomy {{of the human body}} under the {{apprenticeship}} of Andrea del Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject. As an artist, he quickly became master of <b>topographic</b> anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features.|$|E
5|$|The Hurricane Fault {{marks the}} west {{edge of the}} Markagunt Plateau and is the <b>topographic</b> {{boundary}} between the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateaus provinces. Cedar Breaks National Monument, which shares almost the same exposed geology and erosional features as Bryce Canyon National Park, sits on the west edge of the Markagunt.|$|E
5|$|The Special Commission for Name Change (Ad Değiştirme İhtisas Komisyonu) {{was created}} under the {{supervision}} of the Ministry of the Interior. It brought together professors, politicians, generals, linguists, and academicians throughout Turkey to take up the task of official name changing. Among the commission's participants were members of the Office of the General Staff, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Education, and history and geography professors from Ankara University. The initiative proved successful, as approximately 28,000 <b>topographic</b> names were changed, including 12,211 village and town names and 4,000 mountain, river, and other <b>topographic</b> names. This figure also included names of streets, monuments, quarters, neighborhoods, and other components that make up certain municipalities.|$|E
5|$|A <b>topographic</b> {{map shows}} that the {{majority}} of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Canada–US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E
5|$|As the {{organization}} of the Army changed following Vietnam, the 20th Engineer Brigade was again reactivated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina as an airborne brigade on 21 June 1974. Assigned as a subordinate command of the XVIII Airborne Corps, which comprised one airborne combat engineer battalion, a heavy construction battalion and four separate companies. Additionally, the 283rd Engineer Detachment (Terrain Analysis) provided terrain intelligence needs of the brigade's mission. Since that time the brigade and its subordinate units supported the XVIII Airborne Corps, fulfilling critical combat engineer, construction, <b>topographic,</b> and bridging missions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1881 and the fall of 1882, {{geologist}} Israel Russell studied the area as a side-trip during his field research of Lake Lahontan, a now dry lake that covered much of nearby Nevada during the last glacial period. His Quaternary History of the Mono Valley (1889), which included a <b>topographic</b> survey by Willard D. Johnson, was the first thorough scientific description of Mono Lake and its volcanic features.|$|E
5|$|Otto's early reign {{was also}} notable for his moving {{the capital of}} Greece from Nafplion to Athens. His first task as king {{was to make a}} {{detailed}} archaeological and <b>topographic</b> survey of Athens. He assigned Gustav Eduard Schaubert and Stamatios Kleanthis to complete this task. At that time, Athens had a population of roughly 4,000–5,000 people, located mainly in what today covers the district of Plaka in Athens.|$|E

5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park. The divide is a <b>topographic</b> feature that {{separates}} Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean water drainages. About {{one third of the}} park lies {{on the west side of}} the divide. The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on opposite sides of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{andesite}} lava of Ember Ridge comprises 55% brownish-green {{volcanic glass}} with a trachytic matrix of plagioclase. About 35% of Ember Ridge andesite contains phenocrysts of hornblende, augite, plagioclase and orthopyroxene and exist as isolated crystals and clots. A feature south of Ember Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite and olivine. Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty's Bump andesite {{as much as}} 20%. The relationship of Betty's Bump with Ember Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its <b>topographic</b> isolation.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 2 {{found several}} types of tectonic {{features}} on Enceladus, including troughs, scarps, and belts of grooves and ridges. Results from Cassini suggest that tectonics is the dominant mode of deformation on Enceladus, including rifts, {{one of the more}} dramatic types of tectonic features that were noted. These canyons can be up to 200km long, 5–10km wide, and 1km deep. Such features are geologically young, because they cut across other tectonic features and have sharp <b>topographic</b> relief with prominent outcrops along the cliff faces.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1960s, the carrier {{provided}} some initial aviation support to the Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission in its operation to acquire <b>topographic</b> maps of Ethiopia. The firm changed from a corporation to a share company in 1965, and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines. By 1966, the contractual relationship with TWA was adjusted to reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an Ethiopian deputy general manager. Two Boeing 720s were in operation and a Boeing 707-320C was due to be phased in by , when the carrier ordered a second -320C.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other <b>topographic</b> features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
5|$|Focused only several {{kilometres}} {{below the}} surface, the earthquake resulted in significant shaking {{over a large}} portion of central-eastern South Island. Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong shaking (MM VI) was felt in adjacent populated areas such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified shaking due to the effects of its <b>topographic</b> setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far afield as Dunedin. The earthquake was felt as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was {{merged into}} the Chessie System, which planned to close and abandon the South Branch line. The Romney spur through Depot Valley {{remained}} in service and was {{illustrated by the}} United States Geological Survey on its 1973 Romney Quadrangle <b>topographic</b> map. On October 11, 1978, the Chessie System transferred ownership of the South Branch line to the South Branch Valley Railroad, which in turn was {{owned and operated by}} the West Virginia State Rail Authority. During this transition, the Romney spur of the South Branch Valley Railroad was abandoned, after which all rail and commercial activity at Valley ceased.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Galileo {{spacecraft}} entered {{orbit around}} Jupiter and between 1996 and 2000 made six close flybys to explore Ganymede. These flybys are G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29. During the closest flyby—G2—Galileo passed just 264km {{from the surface}} of Ganymede. During a G1 flyby in 1996, the Ganymedian magnetic field was discovered, while the discovery of the ocean was announced in 2001. Galileo transmitted a large number of spectral images and discovered several non-ice compounds on the surface of Ganymede. The most recent close observations of Ganymede were made by New Horizons, which recorded <b>topographic</b> and compositional mapping data of Europa and Ganymede during its flyby of Jupiter in 2007 en route to Pluto.|$|E
5|$|On 21 October 1977 the 18th Engineer Brigade was {{reactivated}} at Karlsruhe, Germany. For 15 years, the Brigade {{served as}} the principal construction brigade for the United States Army, Europe and 7th Army. During this period, the Brigade performed numerous construction, rehabilitation and renovation missions in military communities and training areas of the 7th Army. These included an extensive range upgrade of the Grafenwohr Major Training Area in the early 1980s {{and the construction of}} the Range 23 complex at the Wildflecken Major Training Area in 1989 and 1990. Additionally, the Brigade was responsible for providing <b>topographic</b> support to the European Theater.|$|E
5|$|The 130th was {{headquartered}} at Logistical Support Area Anaconda for {{the majority}} of the deployment. Throughout Operation Iraqi Freedom, the headquarters commanded up to 15,000 engineers at one time, conducting missions including bridging, humanitarian assistance, <b>topographic</b> missions, dive missions, firefighting, base construction, river patrols, mine detection, missile removal and many more. Brigade units redeployed to Hanau in late 2003 and early 2004. Most of the brigade's soldiers returned to Hanau on 5 February 2004 after numerous logistical delays. Most of the 130th Engineer Brigade's subordinate units would receive Meritorious Unit Commendation for their roles in the invasion of Iraq, though the Brigade's headquarters did not.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{participated in}} the {{recovery}} efforts following the Great Lakes Blizzard of 1977. Over 300 members of the unit were dispatched to New York State to help with recovery efforts. As requirements and the engineer force structure changed, the brigade inactivated the combat heavy battalion in 1987 and activated another combat airborne battalion. In 1989, the 30th Engineer Battalion (<b>Topographic)</b> {{was added to the}} brigade. Over the years, the brigade has provided engineer support to XVIII Airborne Corps and other Army commands. In addition to training, it has deployed in support of operations across the entire spectrum of conflict from disaster relief to combat operations.|$|E
5|$|Water vapor {{generated}} through {{surface evaporation}} is transported by circulatory {{patterns in the}} atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, <b>topographic</b> features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.|$|E
