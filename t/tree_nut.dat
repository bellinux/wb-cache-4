25|$|Peanut and <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergies {{are less}} likely to be outgrown, {{although}} evidence now shows that about 20% of those with peanut allergies and 9% of those with <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergies will outgrow them.|$|E
25|$|Those with <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergies may be {{allergic}} {{to one or}} to many tree nuts, including pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, and walnuts. Also seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, contain oils in which protein is present, which may elicit an allergic reaction.|$|E
25|$|When {{properly}} sized gastropod shells are not available, {{hermit crabs}} {{have been known}} to resort to wearing other objects such as <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> hulls or pieces of beach litter rather than go unprotected. This has become very common in some areas, due not only to the increased prevalence of marine debris, but also due to depletion of seashells from beaches due to humans collecting them.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} food allergens {{account for about}} 90% of all {{allergic}} reactions; in adults they include shellfish, peanuts, <b>tree</b> <b>nuts,</b> fish, and egg. In children, they include milk, eggs, peanuts, and <b>tree</b> <b>nuts.</b> Six to 8% of {{children under the age}} of three have food allergies and nearly 4% of adults have food allergies.|$|R

2500|$|... "Pink peppercorns" [...] are {{the fruits}} of a plant from a {{different}} family, the Peruvian pepper tree, Schinus molle, or its relative the Brazilian pepper tree, Schinus terebinthifolius. As they {{are members of the}} cashew family, they may cause allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, for persons with a <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergy.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Mendocino" [...] {{comes from}} the family name of Mendoza {{in honor of the}} 16th century Spanish {{explorer}} Lorenzo Suárez de Mendoza, 4th conde de la Coruña who explored the Mendocino coast line and his cousin, Antonio de Mendoza the first viceroy of New Spain. The first vineyards in Mendocino were established in the 1850s in the Redwood Valley by returning farmers who failed to find their wealth and prosperity during the California Gold Rush. Most of these winery operations stayed small and were completely eradicated by the enactment of Prohibition in the United States in the early 20th century. With the commercial production of wine banned, vineyards were ripped out and replaced with <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> and fruit orchards.|$|E

50|$|For some 5% of people, cashews {{can lead}} to {{complications}} or allergic reactions which may be life-threatening. These allergies are triggered by the proteins found in <b>tree</b> <b>nuts,</b> and cooking often does not remove or change these proteins. Reactions to cashew and <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> can also occur {{as a consequence of}} hidden nut ingredients or traces of nuts that may inadvertently be introduced during food processing, handling, or manufacturing, particularly in Europe.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The 11 S {{globulin}} Sin a 2 is {{a marker}} to predict severity of symptoms in mustard allergic patients. The potential implication of Sin a 2 in cross-reactivity with <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> and peanut {{has not been}} investigated so far. In this work, we studied at the IgG and IgE level {{the involvement of the}} 11 S globulin Sin a 2 in cross-reactivity among mustard, <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> and peanut. Methods Eleven well-characterized mustard-allergic patients sensitized to Sin a 2 were included in the study. A specific anti-Sin a 2 serum was obtained in rabbit. Skin prick tests (SPT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblotting and IgG or IgE-inhibition immunoblotting experiments using purified Sin a 2, Sin a 1, Sin a 3, mustard, almond, hazelnut, pistachio, walnut or peanut extracts were performed. Results The rabbit anti-Sin a 2 serum showed high affinity and specificity to Sin a 2, which allowed us to demonstrate that Sin a 2 shares IgG epitopes with allergenic 11 S globulins from <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> (almond, hazelnut, pistachio and walnut) but not from peanut. All the patients included in the study had positive skin prick test to <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> and/or peanut and we subdivided them into two different groups according to their clinical symptoms after ingestion of such allergenic sources. We showed that 11 S globulins contain conserved IgE epitopes involved in cross-reactivity among mustard, <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> and peanut as well as species-specific IgE epitopes. Conclusions The allergenic 11 S globulin Sin a 2 from mustard is involved in cross-reactivity at the IgE level with <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> and peanut. Although the clinical relevance of the cross-reactive IgE epitopes present in 11 S globulins needs to be investigated in further detail, our results contribute to improve the diagnosis and management of mustard allergic patients sensitized to Sin a 2. </p...|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{the federal}} Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) {{requires}} that any packaged food product that contains tree nuts as an ingredient must list the specific <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> on the label. [...] Foods that almost always contain tree nuts include pesto, marzipan, Nutella, baklava, pralines, nougat, gianduja, and turrón. Other common foods that may contain tree nuts include cereals, crackers, cookies, baked goods, candy, chocolates, energy/granola bars, flavored coffee, frozen desserts, marinades, barbecue sauces, and some cold cuts, such as mortadella. <b>Tree</b> <b>nut</b> oils (especially shea nut) are also sometimes used in lotions and soaps. Asian and African restaurants, ice cream parlors, and bakeries are considered high-risk {{for people with}} <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergy due to the common use of nuts {{and the possibility of}} cross contamination.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{many people}} with <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergies also have peanut allergies, and peanut butter is a popular {{derivative}} of peanuts and widely used product, especially in the United States, many schools offer peanut-free menu options or implement entirely nut-free policies. For instance, sunflower seed butter can provide an alternative in schools where peanut butter and peanuts have been banned. However, {{a small number of}} people with <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> and/or peanut allergies may also be allergic to sunflower seed butter. According to one study a person with a known peanut allergy suffered an acute reaction to a [...] "nut-free" [...] butter containing sunflower seeds.|$|E

50|$|People with <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergy {{are seldom}} {{allergic}} {{to just one}} type of nut, and are therefore usually advised to avoid all tree nuts, even though an individual may not be allergic to the nuts of all species of trees.|$|E

50|$|Almonds {{may cause}} allergy or intolerance. Cross-reactivity is common with peach allergens (lipid {{transfer}} proteins) and <b>tree</b> <b>nut</b> allergens.

40|$|The {{people of}} the South Pacific have used {{indigenous}} rainforest nuts for centuries. However, though these nuts have been consumed for generations by {{the peoples of the}} South Pacific, little is known about their agronomic and post harvest properties.

The results of this research has expanded the knowledge and importance of indigenous nut species in the South Pacific. Market development for selected South Pacific indigenous <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> is a manual which looks at the species of nuts and their potential for commercialization as well as aspects of finding and setting up markets, quality assurance and product development.

40|$|Allergic {{reactions}} to <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> can be serious and life threatening. Considerable {{research has been}} conducted in recent years in an attempt to characterize those allergens that are most responsible for allergy sensitization and triggering. Both native and recombinant nut allergens have been identified and characterized and, for some, the IgE-reactive epitopes described. Some allergens, such as lipid transfer proteins, profilins, and members of the Bet v 1 -related family, represent minor constituents in <b>tree</b> <b>nuts.</b> These allergens are frequently cross-reactive with other food and pollen homologues, and are considered panallergens. Others, such as legumins, vicilins, and 2 S albumins, represent major seed storage protein constituents of the <b>nuts.</b> The allergenic <b>tree</b> <b>nuts</b> discussed in this review include those most commonly responsible for allergic reactions such as hazelnut, walnut, cashew, and almond as well as those less frequently associated with allergies including pecan, chestnut, Brazil nut, pine nut, macadamia nut, pistachio, coconut, Nangai nut, and acorn.
