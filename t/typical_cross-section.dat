The lots were approximately 40 ft by 100 ft and were arranged around an irregular grid of streets. The lots {{in the northern}} part of the subdivision, which eventually would become North Brentwood, were smaller and were subject to flooding from a mill race. These lots were less expensive, and Bartlett encouraged their purchase by African-American families with whom he was indirectly associated from his command of U.S. Colored Troops in the Civil War. The more expensive lots to the south were purchased by white working-class families, many of whom were employed as federal government clerks. Seven additional houses were built by 1896. In 1899 Bartlett purchased the Fenwick family farm which was located to the west of the Holladay Company's Addition to Highland. With two new partners, J. Baker and Dr. Sigmund A. Czarra, Bartlett began the Brentwood Company. The 95 acre area was surveyed and platted in 1899.

When sandwiched between ferromagnetic electrodes, the CNT behaves like a spacer in conventional spin-valves, leading quite often to a considerable giant magneto-resistance effect (GMR). This paper is devoted to reviewing some topics related to electron correlations in CNT. The main attention however is directed to the following effects essential for electron transport through nanotubes: (i) nanotube/electrode coupling and (ii) inter-tube interactions.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that {{adequate}} assessment of spacecraft requirements and concomitant estimates of astronaut radiation exposures from galactic cosmic radiation requires accurate, quantitative methods for characterizing these radiation fields as they pass through thick absorbers. The main nuclear interaction processes involved are nuclear elastic an inelastic collisions, and nuclear breakup (fragmentation) and electromagnetic dissociation (EMD).

40|$|Force-deformation {{modelling}} of cracked {{reinforced concrete}} {{is essential for}} a displacement-based seismic assessment of structures and {{can be achieved by}} fibre-element analysis of the cross-section of the major lateral resisting elements. The non-linear moment curvature relationship obtained from fibre-element analysis takes into account the significant effects of axial pre-compression and contributions by the longitudinal reinforcement. Whilst some specialised analysis packages possess the capability of incorporating fibre-elements into the modelling (e. g., RESPONSE 2000), implementation of the analysis on EXCEL is illustrated in this paper. The outcome of the analysis is the moment-curvature relationship of the wall cross-section, curvature at yield and at damage control limit states specified by the user.

Typical flexible structures exposed to the action of wind are shading devices, normally slats or louvers. A <b>typical</b> <b>cross-section</b> for such elements is a Z-shaped profile, made out of a central web and two-side wings. Galloping instabilities are often determined in practice using the Glauert-Den Hartog criterion. This criterion relies on accurate predictions of the dependence of the aerodynamic force coefficients with the angle of attack. The results of a parametric analysis based on a numerical analysis and performed on different Z-shaped louvers to determine translational galloping instability regions are presented in this paper. These numerical analysis results have been validated with a parametric analysis of Z-shaped profiles based on static wind tunnel tests. In order to perform this validation, the DLR TAU Code, which is a standard code within the European aeronautical industry, has been used. This study highlights the focus on the numerical prediction of the effect of galloping, which is shown in a visible way, through stability maps.

40|$|Abstract The {{case history}} of a failure of a RE wall has been presented. The wall failed {{immediately}} upon completion due to the overestimation of {{the strengths of the}} foundation clay layers and due to the underes-timation of the self weight of the fill materials. A <b>typical</b> <b>cross-section</b> of the wall along with the stabilizing embankment and the foundation are mod-eled numerically by the limit equilibrium method and by a finite element method. The strengths of the foundation soils are determined by field tests done after the failure of the wall. Both the analyses predicted failure of the wall. The deformations predicted by the finite element method are found to be comparable to the observed field data. The numer-ical analyses further indicate that by consolidating a foundation clay layer to a minimum undrained strength of 45 kPa, the required factor of safety for the wall along with the road embankment can be achieved theoretically. Accordingly, prefabricated vertical drains are used to expedite the drainage and consolidation of the foundation clay layers. After the field tests confirm that the required minimum undrained strength is achieved, the RE wall and the embankment have been rebuilt successfully and now in full operation...|$|E
30|$|For spherical {{pressure}} vessels, {{failure modes}} include steel yielding (possibly leading to plastic collapse) and buckling (elastic or elasto-plastic). Different failure modes exist (e.g., low-cycle fatigue), but yielding and buckling are preeminent. The {{analysis of the}} two failure modes is usually done by performing a stress analysis (for yielding) and a stability analysis (for buckling). This paper focuses only on yielding, and shortly deals with buckling. Anyway, for sake of completeness, {{it should be pointed}} out that, differently from cylindrical vessels for which different types of buckling can occur under seismic action, directly involving the cylinder (e.g., diamond or elephant foot buckling), in the case of spherical tanks, if provided with a braced lateral load-resisting system, buckling mainly arises in the form of failure of the columns of the supporting system until the vessel becomes unstable (Djermane et al. 2014; Moschonas et al. 2014). With reference to this latter case, Eurocode 3 (2005) classifies cylindrical column sections (which represent the <b>typical</b> <b>cross-section</b> adopted for the supporting system of spherical pressure vessels) in three classes, in relation to the diameter-to-thickness situation ratio. According to this classification, the buckling failure of a column is expected to be caused by local buckling of critical sections for class 2 and 3 sections and by global buckling of the column for class 1 sections.|$|E

The {{objective of this}} paper is to construct a two-dimensional (semi 3 -D) landscape-scale ecohydrological map based on vegetation distribution maps and detailed spatial, multi-year, floodplain inundation water quality data. The dataset comes from the near-natural Biebrza floodplain mire in Poland encompassing 658 inundation water quality analyses over the period 2002 - 2012, covering 17 different vegetation communities of freshwater marshes and rich-fens. The data represent the main hydrological gradients from valley edge to river encompassing groundwater seepage, local stagnant precipitation influences and river flooding and drainage. We used chi square Haberman residuals analysis to correlate communities to inundation water quality types, resembling river water and three different types of groundwater. Out of 17 communities, 6 showed a preference for river water, 3 showed a preference for clean groundwater, 4 for diluted groundwater, and 1 for polluted groudwater. For 3 communities no significant preference was found. Spatial patterns in vegetation and attributed water quality preference can be linked to three dominant hydrological processes at the landscape-scale, i. e. discharge of clean and polluted groundwater near the valley edges, dilution of exfiltrated groundwater with local snowmelt and precipitation water, and flooding with river water along the river.
