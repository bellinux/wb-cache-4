5|$|Between 1932 and 1933, Burnet took {{leave of}} absence to {{undertake}} a fellowship at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Institute</b> for Medical Research in London.

The National Institute's Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet—whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist—better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne.
