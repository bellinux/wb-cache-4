5|$|As {{the film}} was budgeted for two weeks of {{post-production}} photography, late 1976 saw three separate shoots for the final segment, but only some of this material was used. The narration that ends the film, featuring the joke about 'we all need the eggs', was conceived and recorded only <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> a test screening.|$|E
5|$|Later {{analysis}} showed that Jose became more organized <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> making landfall and was forming an eye, but its winds remained under hurricane strength. The final report suggested that the winds made it up to 60mph (95km/h) and made landfall as such, but was still rapidly intensifying before running out of water.|$|E
5|$|The flyby {{spacecraft}} performed {{one of two}} divert maneuvers {{to avoid}} damage. A 14-minute burn was executed which slowed down the spacecraft. It was also reported that the communication link between the flyby and the impactor was functioning as expected. The impactor spacecraft executed three correction maneuvers in the final <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> impact.|$|E

5|$|During the retreat, Crawford and {{an unknown}} number of his men were captured. The Indians {{executed}} many of these captives in retaliation for the Gnadenhutten massacre that occurred earlier in the year, in which about 100 peaceful Indians were murdered by Pennsylvanian militiamen. Crawford's execution was particularly brutal: he was tortured for at least <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> being burned at the stake. His execution was widely publicized in the United States, worsening the already-strained relationship between Native Americans and European Americans.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E
5|$|On November 31, Smyth tried again, {{ordering}} his men {{to embark}} <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> dawn {{in order to avoid}} enemy fire. This time, the embarkation was so slow that, two hours after daylight, only 1,500 men were on board. Rather than attempt an amphibious landing in broad daylight, Smyth once again postponed the invasion. By this time, morale in Smyth’s command had plummeted: “all discipline had dissolved; the camp was a bedlam”. This, and widespread illness among the troops, persuaded a second council of war called by Smyth to suspend all offensive operations until the army was reinforced.|$|E

5|$|The 1985 European Cup Final was Liverpool's fifth such final. Before {{the match}} at the Heysel Stadium began, Liverpool fans {{breached}} a fence separating opposing fans. As Juventus fans fled to safety, {{the accumulation of}} people against a perimeter wall caused it to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. The wall collapse was followed by Juventus fans rioting at the stadium's other end. The match was delayed <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> starting with fear abandonment would cause further violence. Michel Platini's penalty won the final 1–0 for the Italians.|$|E
5|$|The Mae Shi drummer Brad Breeck commented in an {{interview}} that the band decided to make a song about the incident late in the evening of February 2, 2009. Breeck noted that they listened to the audio of the Bale diatribe and put together their tribute piece within a span of <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> putting it online. Jacob Cooper, another drummer in the band, commented to The Arizona Daily Star that he was surprised how popular their piece became when they had devoted relatively little time to composing and recording it.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} warning for Trinidad, Tobago, and the Grenadines south of Saint Vincent in the cyclone's first advisory on Hurricane Flora. Gale warnings were later issued for islands off northern Venezuela and from Saint Vincent northward to Martinique. Advisories on Flora emphasized {{the danger of}} the hurricane and advised preparations to be rushed to completion. The advisories also recommended small craft throughout the Windward Islands to remain at harbor and for shipping {{in the path of the}} hurricane to advise extreme caution. People in low-lying areas and near beaches were advised to evacuate to higher grounds, as well. Lead time was short, especially in Tobago which received news of the approaching hurricane just <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> it struck.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} force left Bremerhaven {{early on}} 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they arrived, a heavy fog obscured the city, making {{the passage of}} the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they had to wait until the following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odderøya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted for about <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> heavy fog again covered the port, forcing both sides to cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed their soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{produced}} during the 2010 NRL season (corresponding to {{winter in the}} Southern Hemisphere). In New South Wales and Queensland, (in which NRL is the dominant football code), The Matty Johns Show was broadcast on Thursdays at 7.30pm, <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> The Footy Show. In all other states (in which the Australian Football League predominates), The Matty Johns Show may have been broadcast Thursdays at 7.30pm, or broadcast around midnight, after The AFL Footy Show. When broadcast at 7.30pm, the show followed long-running soap opera Home and Away.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{opens to}} ticket holders <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> kick-off. The main club shop, named 'The Armoury', and ticket offices are {{located near the}} West Stand, with other an {{additional}} store {{at the base of}} the North Bank Bridge, named 'All Arsenal' and the 'Arsenal Store' next to Finsbury Park station. Arsenal operates an electronic ticketing system where members of 'The Arsenal' (the club's fan membership scheme) use their membership cards to enter the stadium, thus removing the need for turnstile operators. Non-members are issued with one-off paper tickets embedded with an RFID tag allowing them to enter the stadium.|$|E

After several months of {{investigation}} all of the kidnappers were arrested apart from one {{who was killed in}} a firefight during his arrest. Over the course of the investigation 24,000 vehicles were stopped and 12,000 homes were visited. The kidnapping lasted 63 days.|$|R
5|$|<b>Two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> {{the premiere}} of Aladdin—on Christmas Eve 1960—Formby {{received}} a phone call from Beryl's doctor, saying that she was in a coma and was not expected to survive the night; Formby went through with the performance, and was told early the next morning that Beryl had died. Her cremation took place on 27 December, and an hour after the service Formby returned to Bristol to appear in that day's matinee performance of Aladdin. He continued in the show until 14 January when a cold forced him to rest, on doctors' advice. He returned to Lytham St Annes and communicated with Pat Howson; she contacted his doctor and Formby was instructed to go to hospital, where he remained for the next two weeks.|$|E
5|$|While Gloria was off {{the east}} coast of Florida, the NHC issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Edisto Beach, South Carolina to Cape Henry, Virginia, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1000 UTC on September 26, or 19.5 hours before landfall. By later that day, a hurricane watch was issued {{for the rest of the}} eastern United States to Eastport, Maine. By <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> Gloria's landfall on Long Island, a hurricane warning was in effect for the same area, after warnings were gradually extended further north. Officials anticipated higher winds and storm surge than what occurred, due to the hurricane weakening as it approached landfall.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, Prison Break was {{broadcast}} on Global one hour before it aired on Fox, {{except in the}} Maritimes where it aired <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> Fox's airing. Prison Break was the only new television series to be positioned in the top twenty television shows of 2005–2006 in Canada, achieving an average of 876,000 viewers in the key demographic of 18–49 and 1.4 million viewers nationally for its first season. Prison Break premiered on Australian television network Seven on February 1, 2006, to an average audience of 1.94 million. The first season attracted an overall average of 1.353 million viewers. After decreasing ratings throughout the second season, Seven decided to fast-track the airing of the third-season episodes. The fifth season revival moved to Network Ten and will debut on May 15, 2017.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Union {{had been}} {{competing}} with the US in landing {{a man on the}} Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V. Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally planned}} to film the teaser sequence at a Catholic hospital, but {{the hospital was}} reluctant to affix a faux gargoyle to the building. Thus, the shot was relocated to Heritage Hall, a noted filming location and former post office in Vancouver. Some last minute scrambling was required when city workmen tore up the sidewalk on the very spot where the producers planned to film the scene. The construction crew reassured the show that the construction would be finished in time for filming. Indeed, the work was finished <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> shooting of the episode started. Additional exterior shots were filmed at an alley near Bonanza Meat Market. The walls were painted to match those of Heritage Hall, although after filming was completed, they were returned to their original state.|$|E
5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
