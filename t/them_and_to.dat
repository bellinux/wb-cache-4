5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means to each of <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated {{with the death of}} a close family member.|$|E
5|$|Between 9 and 10 pm on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E

5|$|Ermanaric's great-nephew, Vinitharius, who disliked {{being under}} Hun rule, withdrew his forces and marched against the Antes {{in order to}} defeat <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> show his courage. This {{took place in the}} last quarter of the 4th century, {{possibly}} around 380. Boz, the king of the Antes (rex Antorum), had organized an alliance to defend the Antes, and managed to defeat Vinitharius in their first encounters, however, Vinitharius fought valiantly and managed to capture and crucify Boz, together with his sons and 70 of his chiefs (primates). Vinitharius left their bodies hanging to induce fear in those who had surrendered. These conflicts constitute the only pre-6th century contacts between Germanics and Slavs documented in written sources.|$|E
5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about {{the seriousness of the}} situation on Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement {{of the rest of the}} 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{artillery}} during September 7 shelled batteries of the 9th and 99th Field Artillery Battalions, forcing {{displacement of}} two batteries during the day. US air strikes and artillery kept both Hills 902 and 570 under heavy attack. Even though the 1st Cavalry Division fell back nearly everywhere that day, Walker ordered {{it and the}} ROK II Corps to attack and seize Hill 902 and Ka-san. He directed the ROK 1st Division and the US 1st Cavalry Division to select a boundary between <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> maintain physical contact during the attack.|$|E

5|$|On July 12, Dean {{ordered the}} division's three regiments—the US 19th, 21st and 34th Infantry Regiments—to cross the Kum River, {{destroying}} all bridges behind <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> establish defensive positions around Taejon. Dean formed a {{line with the}} 34th Infantry and 19th Infantry facing east, and held the heavily battered 21st Infantry in reserve to the southeast. Taejon stood as a major transportation hub between Seoul and Taegu, giving it great strategic value for both sides. The division was attempting to make a stand at Taejon, the last place it could conduct a delaying action before the North Korean forces could converge on the unfinished Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

5|$|The first Home Army {{structure}} designed {{primarily to}} deal with the Soviet threat had been NIE, formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how {{to deal with}} the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 NIE ("NO") was disbanded and transformed into an Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

5|$|His reward, however, {{was to be}} the university's first Keeper of the Archives, {{appointed}} on 11 August 1634. The new statute {{governing the}} position noted the losses that Oxford had suffered because of the careless keeping of its archives, and the need for an experienced person to take charge of <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> advise the university's officers in defending its interests. He was to be paid not less than £40 annually, with a levy of one shilling from each graduate and undergraduate. Thereafter, he sought to obtain royal confirmation of Oxford's rights and privileges, to keep the city of Oxford subordinate to the university, and to match the position of Cambridge. A new royal charter was obtained in 1636 to confirm the revised statutes. Under Twyne and his successor as Keeper (Gerard Langbaine), the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden presses that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> call the fire department.|$|E
5|$|The Khurasani {{tax system}} had been {{established}} {{at the time of}} the Muslim conquest and remained unchanged since. It relied on the collection of a fixed tribute by the local non-Muslim (mostly Zoroastrian) gentry, the dihqans, who often discriminated against the Muslim settlers and the native converts. This contributed to the latter's increasing resentment of Umayyad rule, and the demand for a tax reform had fuelled past revolts like that of Ibn Surayj. Consequently, Nasr streamlined the tax system in 739, implementing a blanket imposition (the kharaj) on all owners of agricultural land and forcing the non-Muslims to pay an additional poll tax (the jizyah). In this way, the chroniclers report, 30,000 Muslims were absolved of the jizyah, and 80,000 non-Muslims were forced to pay it instead. Attention was also paid to the accurate collection of the kharaj in accordance with treaties with the local rulers, as a result of which the tax burden was generally eased. This reform is traditionally held to have assisted in regaining the loyalty of the local populations and their princes, who returned quickly to the Arab fold; other modern scholars however consider the effect of this belated reform on the prevailing anti-Umayyad climate as minimal. Upon his appointment, Nasr also moved the provincial capital back to Merv from Balkh, where Asad had established it. Additionally, for the first time in the province's history he appointed sub-governors. They were drawn from among his allies and supporters in order to reward <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> improve his own control of the province.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|The quatrains, {{published}} in a book titled Les Propheties (The Prophecies), received a mixed reaction when they were published.

After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> draw up horoscopes for her children. At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded, but by {{the time of his death}} in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King Charles IX of France.|$|E
