Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised.

In a statement about the series, Spears stated: [...] "From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel <b>that</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> the tabloids ran my life, and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories, which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past.
