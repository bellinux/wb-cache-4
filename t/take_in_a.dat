The specially marked mountain biking tracks are bi-directional; care should be taken when traversing these trails. A fee of $12.00 applies when taking a car into the Park.|$|E
25|$|C-call {{chirping}} {{is believed}} to be an honest signal for communicating food preference, and a cotton-top tamarin more often and more rapidly vocalizes with these chirps when approaching a highly favored food source. Functionally, this behavior may inform other tamarins of the actions the caller will <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> feeding context and whether a preferable food source is available. Despite this research indicating that food calls may be informative to fellow group mates, other observations of cotton-tops show that quantity and distribution of food and audience do not significantly alter a caller's food-centered vocalizations.|$|E

25|$|Ulrike Meinhof {{was born}} in 1934 in Oldenburg, Germany. In 1936, her family moved to Jena when her father, art {{historian}} Dr. Werner Meinhof, became director of the city's museum.

In 1946, the family moved back to Oldenburg because Jena fell under Soviet rule {{as a result of the}} Yalta agreement. Ulrike's mother, Dr. Ingeborg Meinhof, worked as a teacher after World War II and died 8 years later from cancer. Renate Riemeck took on the role of guardian for Ulrike and her elder sister.|$|E
25|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{ruling in}} Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Louisville's public schools were still {{essentially}} segregated, especially as regional residential segregation {{had become more}} pronounced due to other economic changes. In 1971 and 1972 the Kentucky Civil Liberties Union, Legal Aid Society, and NAACP filed suit in federal court to desegregate the Louisville and Jefferson County school systems. The Kentucky Commission on Human Rights also filed suit asking that desegregation be achieved through merger of the Louisville, Jefferson County and Anchorage school systems, to overcome residential segregation and {{the inability of the}} city to expand by annexation and <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more diverse area. By February 28, 1975, the state Board of Education ordered the merger of the Louisville and Jefferson County schools systems effective April 1, 1975.|$|E
25|$|The Alexanders' {{relatively}} informal lifestyle at Rideau Hall {{was demonstrated}} when, during the Canadian tour of Princess Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Viscount and Viscountess hosted a square {{dance in the}} palace's ballroom. Alexander painted (creating a personal studio in the former dairy at Rideau Hall and mounting classes in art at the National Gallery of Canada), partook {{in a number of}} sports (including golf, ice hockey, and rugby), and enjoyed the outdoors, particularly during Ontario and Quebec's maple syrup harvest, himself overseeing the process on Rideau Hall's grounds. The Viscount was known to escape from official duties to partake in his most favourite pastime of fishing, once departing from the 1951 royal tour of Princess Elizabeth to <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> day's fishing at Griffin Island, in Georgian Bay, and granting a day off for students in the town of Drayton, Ontario, where his train briefly stopped.|$|E

500|$|Although baleen {{whales are}} widespread, most species prefer the colder waters around the Northern and Southern poles. [...] Gray whales are {{specialized}} for feeding on bottom-dwelling crustaceans. Rorquals are specialized at lunge-feeding, {{and have a}} streamlined body to reduce drag while accelerating. Right whales skim-feed, meaning they use their enlarged head to effectively <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large amount of water and sieve the slow-moving prey. Males typically mate {{with more than one}} female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. Male strategies for reproductive success vary between performing ritual displays (whale song) or lek mating. Calves are typically born in the winter and spring months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers fast for a relatively long period of time over the period of migration, which varies between species. Baleen whales produce a number of vocalizations, notably the songs of the humpback whale.|$|E

Angel Batista converses with a witness entirely in Spanish, David Zayas did not feel confident to memorize all of his Spanish lines. Instead, he learned his lines in English and translated the dialogue mentally during each <b>take.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> scene between Dexter and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee), Masuka pauses after examining a corpse and says, [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Michael C. Hall said that [...] "C.S. [...] ad libs are different every time.

500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was written}} by U2 and No Line on the Horizon producers/co-writers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois during a two-week {{recording}} session in Fez, Morocco between May and June 2007. The song was developed within a few hours, and then recorded in a single <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> riad of the hotel Riad El Yacout. Eno began by creating a percussion loop of a [...] "rolling hand drum" [...] so that the band would have something to improvise along with when they joined him for songwriting and recording. However, Eno had not arranged the loop properly {{and the result was}} a strange, uneven beat that he compared to [...] "a wheeled carriage that had one of the wheels a bit cracked" [...] or [...] "the way a camel moves". Although Eno was trying to fix the loop, drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. began playing along to it. Eno then asked guitarist the Edge to play some chords. After a quick discussion about the chord changes and the meter (in which they decided to have a [...] "funny layout" [...] that was not based on [...] "eighths or sixteenths"), the six of them improvised the entirety of the piece.|$|E

Van Lerberghe hadn't had, and would never have, an impressive career, and all the cyclists laughed as he pulled away immediately– never to be caught. Just prior to entering the velodrome for the finish, van Lerberghe stopped off at a pub to <b>take</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few beers. His manager, worrying that he would miss a chance at victory, had to track him down and get him back on the bike. After he had crossed the line and done his lap of honour, van Lerberghe stood in front of the crowd and, in all seriousness, told them 'to go home; I'm half a day ahead of the field.'" ...|$|E
