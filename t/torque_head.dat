Analysis of forces acting around the head and neck joints resulted in a new balancing strategy for head supports.

25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the <b>torqued</b> bolt <b>head</b> or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the <b>torqued</b> bolt <b>head</b> or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|R

40|$|Video {{records were}} made of the blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala L. mainly during {{tethered}} flight in a wind-tunnel, to study its movements about the longitudinal body axis (roll). During undisturbed flight, flies hold their head on average aligned with the body but may turn it about all three body axes. Pitch and yaw turns of the head are comparatively small (20 degrees), whereas roll turns can be large (90 degrees), and fast (1200 degrees s^- 1). When passively rolled, flies produce compensatory head movements during walking or flight; at rest this reflex is turned off. Flies perceive a static misalignment relative to the vertical, as well as roll motion up to 10 000 degrees s^- 1. Within this range flies counteract an imposed roll with maximal gain at about 1000 degrees s^- 1. Compensatory head movements are made with very low latency (down to Δ t ≈ 5 ms), and with considerable speed (up to ω = 1000 degrees s^- 1). Flies may `disregard an apparent deviation from their correct orientation, and may superimpose spontaneous head movements on those elicited by a stimulus. Compensatory head movements generally undercompensate the imposed misalignment. Simultaneously, however, flies modify their wing pitch and wingbeat amplitude to produce a compensatory roll <b>torque.</b> Since <b>head</b> and body roll act simultaneously {{and in the same}} direction, the overall speed and degree of head realignment, relative to external coordinates, increase considerably. This is certainly an advantage for flight in turbulent air. In still air, without need to correct an imposed misalignment, flies nevertheless produce spontaneous fluctuations of their flight <b>torque,</b> and <b>head</b> roll movements in the opposite direction. This is to be expected if flies intend to keep their eyes aligned with the coordinates of the environment while spontaneously performing banked turns. The limits of fly vision and the advantages of compensatory head movements for different visually guided behaviour are discussed. Compensatory head roll movements give flies greater manoeuvrability when cruising than the visual system would allow, without such a stabilizing reflex...|$|R

There are some factors that can affect initial torque loss, including tightening torque value, implant system, abutment screw material, errors in casting of metallic alloys, repeated tightening/loosening cycles of the screw, and improper insertion torque.

2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a torque to either the bolt head or the nut. The applied torque causes the bolt to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt.

The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|R

The system is computer controlled and screw insertion is performed in incremental steps of insertion torque.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the challenges faced during micro-tunnelling process in Emirates of Dubai. In permeable grounds, {{the loss of}} slurry increases the cutter <b>head</b> <b>torque</b> and reduces penetration rates. Overcut is formed to provide space for converging ground and enables the evenly circulation of lubricant flow on the pipe line, as such buoyancy effects of fluid lubrication act on the pipe to lessen the drag during jacking. Micro-tunnelling techniques are used to reduce penetration resistance within the pipe string by providing sufficient uniform overcut and continuously injecting polymer lubricants. It is also observed that as the Urban area in Dubai is surrounded by built structures and numerous underground services, a special consideration is required to protect these services especially DEWA ED Cables. Also, the high ground water table, fractures within the rock and proximity of creek makes things very difficult to reduce the water table level in launching / receiving Pit and have difficulties in breaking the hard ground within the Pit.

40|$|Abstract Background Since cut-out {{still remains}} one of the major {{clinical}} challenges in the field of osteoporotic proximal femur fractures, remarkable developments have been made in improving treatment concepts. However, the mechanics of these complications have not been fully understood. We hypothesize using the experimental data and a theoretical model that a previous rotation of the femoral head due to de-central implant positioning can initiate a cut-out. Methods In this investigation we analysed our experimental data using two common screws (DHS/Gamma 3) and helical blades (PFN A/TFN) for the fixation of femur fractures in a simple theoretical model applying typical gait pattern on de-central positioned implants. In previous tests during a forced implant rotation by a biomechanical testing machine in a human femoral head the two screws showed failure symptoms (2 - 6 Nm) at the same magnitude as torques acting in the hip during daily activities with de-central implant positioning, while the helical blades showed a better stability (10 - 20 Nm). To calculate the <b>torque</b> of the <b>head</b> around the implant only the force and the leverarm is needed (N [Nm] = F [N] * &# 215; [m]). The force F {{is a product of the}} mass M [kg] multiplied by the acceleration g [m/s 2]. The leverarm is the distance between the center of the head of femur and the implant center on a horizontal line. Results Using 50 % of 75 kg body weight a torque of 0. 37 Nm for the 1 mm decentralized position and 1. 1 Nm for the 3 mm decentralized position of the implant was calculated. At 250 % BW, appropriate to a normal step, torques of 1. 8 Nm (1 mm) and 5. 5 Nm (3 mm) have been calculated. Comparing of the experimental and theoretical results shows that both screws fail in the same magnitude as torques occur in a more than 3 mm de-central positioned implant. Conclusion We conclude the center-center position in the head of femur of any kind of lag screw or blade is to be achieved to minimize rotation of the femoral head and to prevent further mechanical complications...|$|R
40|$|Precise {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to study the optomotor responses of insects in correlation with microprobing and histology. These include stimulus patterns whose noise power is controlled to one part per million and a directly-connected digital computer system that permits the accurate reduction and analysis of responses. A range of flight and <b>head</b> <b>torque</b> reactions was studied for Musca domestica. Patterns producing gross temporal changes or sudden transients were found to elicit more complex reactions than hitherto reported. However, the steady flight torque responses to precision cylindrical patterns of various wavelengths, rotating at precisely constant velocity, provided detailed information on the optical properties of the ommatidia and the motion-detection capabilities of the eye. These studies indicate that the photoreceptors can be characterized by visual fields whose full width to 50 % of effective light flux sensitivity is about 5 degrees in the dark-adapted state. It is, however, about 40 % less in the light-adapted case. Histological investigations show that this is caused by a shielding pigment migration. Correlated temporal changes in acuity can be detected in the optomotor responses with an adaptation period of about 10 min. Detection of constant velocity motion was found to involve the interaction of only a few adjacent ommatidia with total responses given by a simple saturable summation of these unit interactions. This process of parallel summation from many unit areas of the total field provides a very high signal to noise ratio for the nervous system, enabling the insect to detect patterns of quite low intensity and contrast when the wavelength is greater than 15 or 20 degrees. Thresholds for such patterns are about three orders of magnitude below those of light response signals normally detectable by microprobing in the retinular cells. However, the relatively high ratio of ommatidia field to interommatidial spacing results in a rapid increase of threshold with reduced wavelength. The optomotor response threshold for a 3 degrees pattern exceeds that of a 15 degrees pattern by a factor of more than 1000. This is the minimum wavelength detectable with the precision patterns that were used. Many of the apparent reactions reported in other investigations can be attributed to inaccuracies in the stimulus patterns...|$|R
