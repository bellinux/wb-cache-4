To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be frustrating for the shy individual.

500|$|Kobayashi {{aimed to}} avoid {{conventions}} established in Resident Evil, {{such as that}} series' dark, masculine world. With P.N.03, Kobayashi wanted to portray a [...] "white" [...] world with [...] "feminine, delicate lines". To that end, the staff applied a minimalist approach to the visuals, used [...] "fine drawn lines", and emphasized [...] "visibility and creativity" [...] in the game world. To maintain the game's [...] "delicate image", the developers {{tried to make the}} visuals easy to view and understand. The team crafted the gameplay to avoid [...] "button mashing"; instead, players were meant to observe enemy attack patterns and <b>think</b> <b>before</b> acting. Mechanical designer Shou Sakai tried to craft [...] "things that would stick in [...] mind". Because of the tight development schedule, 3D models had to be created immediately after their designs were completed. Sakai described the lack of time as the [...] "toughest part" [...] of the process.|$|E

500|$|In Little Busters!, Riki meets {{five other}} girls {{attending}} {{his high school}} who later become members of the Little Busters, in addition to three more girls in Ecstasy; all eight are heroines in the game. The first is Komari Kamikita, a childish girl who takes great interest in fairy-tales, picture books, candy, and clothing with many layers of frills. She is very clumsy, though athletic, and will often not <b>think</b> <b>before</b> she acts. Haruka Saigusa is a schoolmate of Riki's from a different class, but always finds time to hang around in Riki's classroom. She incites uproars for her own personal enjoyment, which causes her twin sister, the public morals chairman Kanata Futaki, to chase after her. Kanata generally acts cold towards her sister, though gets annoyed when Riki gets close to Haruka. Kudryavka Noumi, known as [...] for short, is a girl who is one quarter Japanese, and three-quarters Russian. Despite having a poor handle on the English language, {{she was able to}} skip a year in school due to credits obtained through studying abroad, making her the youngest member of the Little Busters.

500|$|The game is {{markedly}} {{more difficult}} than its predecessor. Amiga Format called this [...] "good/bad news", whereas The One directed its [...] "major criticism" [...] at the difficulty level, saying [...] "some of the levels are quite simply horrendous", and that the game is [...] "close to being intensely frustrating at times." [...] Amiga Computing also felt the high difficulty to be the [...] "biggest problem": [...] "I like a game to get progressively harder rather than getting virtually impossible after just four missions." [...] Amiga Format also criticised the difficulty and felt [...] "some of the levels are {{a bit of a}} drag." [...] Amiga Power was annoyed at the early tutorial missions, finding them redundant, but otherwise noted the increased challenge as a positive, and said: [...] "The original game went in pulses of fiendishly hard and stupidly simple levels, but in CF2 the difficulty curve's, well, more of a curve." [...] The reviewer praised the clever level design, explaining: [...] "The levels penalise you for taking the obvious route and reward you for trying an obscure approach [...] loads of levels make you <b>think</b> <b>before</b> you move, injecting puzzle elements into the killing", citing the example of traps with empty vehicles as bait. The reviewer praised the smaller, tighter levels with a difficulty curve within those levels: [...] "gung-ho" [...] sections building to tactical play against tougher enemies. He compared this favourably with the first game: [...] "The level design is consistently better", in particular the [...] "Beirut, Mediaevil and Chicago levels look and play wonderfully." [...] He nevertheless felt the thematic shifts lacked coherence and atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|The {{second book}} {{to use the}} name Unearthed Arcana was written by Andy Collins, Jesse Decker, David Noonan, and Rich Redman, and {{published}} in February 2004 by Wizards of the Coast, for use with the Dungeons & Dragons third edition rules. Cover art was by Matt Cavotta, with interior art by Steven Belledin, Ed Cox, Wayne England, Emily Fiegenschuh, David Hudnut, Jeremy Jarvis, Doug Kovacs, John and Laura Lakey, David Martin, Dennis Crabapple McClain, Mark Nelson, James Pavelec, Steve Prescott, David Roach, Richard Sardinha, Ron Spencer, Stephen Tappin, Joel Thomas, and Ben Thompson. The designers aimed the book at experienced players and DMs looking for something new, encouraging them to customize the game's rules. The designers {{did not want the}} third edition book to be like the original Unearthed Arcana mechanically, because according to Andy Collins: [...] "Every book on the market looks like the original Unearthed Arcana. New classes, new spells, new magic items - that's the default [...] "recipe" [...] for a d20 product these days. We saw no need to do that with this book." [...] Where the original Unearthed Arcana had simply expanded the rules and options of the core game, this 224-page supplement was aimed at providing an extensive list of variant rules and options to change the standard game itself. The volume of options added was intentionally excessive; according to the designers, a Dungeon Master who reads the book must be prepared to [...] "Drink from the fire hose" [...] and to <b>think</b> <b>before</b> using options that may radically imbalance the game. [...] The book ends with a checklist of the included variants, preceded by a short chapter discussing ways of transitioning among multiple games using different rulesets (one of which explicitly emulates the [...] "Eternal Champion" [...] stories of Michael Moorcock).|$|E

500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of parents who have not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I <b>think,</b> <b>before</b> we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E

[...] In the words of Cleveland himself: [...] “They [...] will have wealth enough to purchase all that money can buy, but all their wealth cannot purchase a lost opportunity, or restore natural features of grandeur and beauty, which would then possess priceless value…” [...] In this way, Cleveland inspired future generations of landscape architects to <b>think</b> <b>before</b> tearing down the natural landscape.|$|E

2500|$|The end {{looked to}} be even more abrupt than people could <b>think</b> <b>before</b> the third day had started. However, a no-ball-aided {{recovery}} and some fine batting from wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud, who surpassed Aftab Ahmed's score, sent the match into a slow-death period. Anwar Hossain and Khaled Mashud did, however, manage to put on 58 together for the ninth wicket, Bangladesh's best partnership of the match. Simon Jones eventually broke through the defences, though, as Anwar Hossain Monir got a standard thick edge to first slip Trescothick, and thus the ninth wicket fell – 156 for 9. An over later, Khaled Mashud was finally out, giving an awkward edge off Andrew Flintoff's bowling to Graham Thorpe at short leg and ending the innings on 159 all out – giving England an innings and 261 run win just before noon, half an hour before lunch, on the third day. Interestingly, Gareth Batty – England's spin-bowler, who came in to replace the injured Ashley Giles – was only mentioned on the official scorecard once, as he did not bat, did not bowl, and did not hold a catch. Trescothick was named man of the match for his 194.|$|E

2500|$|The {{voice of}} Peter is {{provided}} by MacFarlane, who also provides the voice for Brian, Stewie and Quagmire. MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time only characters, most prominently those of news anchor Tom Tucker, Carter Pewterschmidt (Lois' father), and Dr. Hartman. MacFarlane {{has been part of}} the main voice cast from the beginning of the series including the pilot, as well he has been voicing Peter from the start. MacFarlane chose to voice Peter and the rest of characters' voices himself, believing it would be easier to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane's speaking voice is not very close to Peter's; he uses his normal voice as the voice of Brian. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from the security guards he overheard talking while he was attending the Rhode Island School of Design; according to him, [...] "I knew a thousand Peter Griffins growing up in New England. Guys who would not <b>think</b> <b>before</b> they spoke, like [...] there was no self-editing mechanism. [...] Everything in here, [...] it's coming out here". MacFarlane also voices many of Peter's ancestors who share the same type of voice. He noted in an interview that he voices Peter and the rest of the characters partly because they initially had a small budget, but also that he prefers to have the freedom to do it himself. In another interview, he mentioned that Peter's voice is one of the most difficult to do.|$|E
