5|$|Although {{not officially}} {{considered}} a Sergeant Major of <b>the</b> <b>Marine</b> Corps, when Archibald Sommers {{was appointed to}} the grade of Sergeant Major January 1, 1801, it was a solitary post, similar to the modern billet of Sergeant Major of <b>the</b> <b>Marine</b> Corps. In 1833, an act of legislation made the rank of sergeant major permanent for <b>the</b> <b>Marine</b> Corps and by 1899 five Marines held the rank of sergeant major. This continued until 1946, when the rank was abolished, only to be re-introduced in 1954 as part of <b>the</b> <b>Marine</b> Corps rank structure.|$|E
5|$|However, when <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> {{catches up}} with Campbell in the central {{computer}} processing sector of the base, Campbell is mortally wounded and only has enough strength to say that Kelly has taken Campbell's BFG 9000 weapon before expiring. Kelly then begins to taunt <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> in a demonic voice. <b>The</b> <b>marine</b> eventually faces off with Kelly in the central computer core, revealing Kelly as a cybernetic human grafted onto a tank-like base. <b>The</b> <b>marine</b> is able to kill Kelly and takes the BFG 9000 before proceeding deeper under the Martian surface to Site 3, the archaeological dig site where the Soul Cube was unearthed. At the primary excavation site, <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> discovers the Hellmouth, defended by Hell's mightiest warrior, the Cyberdemon. Using the Soul Cube, <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> defeats the Cyberdemon in combat, and the Soul Cube then seals the Hellmouth. The ending cut scene shows the reinforcements from Earth arriving at the base to discover the carnage. They find <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> alive, but discover that Swann has died. They are, however, unable to locate Betruger, who in the final scene is shown in Hell, reincarnated as a dragon-like demon.|$|E

50|$|After {{arriving}} at the alien planet, <b>the</b> colonial <b>marine</b> ship is ambushed by Massey and the combat synthetics, assisted by the leader of <b>the</b> colonial <b>marine</b> force, who turns traitor for money. After seizing control of <b>the</b> <b>marine's</b> vessel, Massey kills <b>the</b> traitorous <b>marine,</b> leaving Wilks {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>marines</b> captive. <b>The</b> mercenary reveals his plan is to send <b>the</b> <b>marines</b> down to <b>the</b> planet, as 'bait' for the aliens, and then use the combat synthetics to collect <b>the</b> implanted <b>marines.</b> All of <b>the</b> <b>marines</b> except for Wilkes are sent down to the planet, unarmed, with the mercenary combat synthetics keeping a close watch.|$|R

5|$|Now {{forced to}} fend off attacks from zombified base {{personnel}} and the demons from Hell, <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> returns to Mars City, where Kelly remotely gives <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> orders to link up with another squad of marines (Bravo Team) and get a transmission card containing a distress call to the main communications facility to call for reinforcements. As <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> progresses through the base, he learns that Swann and Campbell have survived, and are also {{en route to the}} communications facility to prevent any messages being sent in hope of containing the situation on Mars. <b>The</b> <b>marine</b> squad is ambushed by demons and slaughtered in the EnPro Plant, and although <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> recovers the transmission card, he is too late to prevent the bulk of equipment at the communications facility being destroyed by Campbell. Kelly, however, directs <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> to a backup system, where <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> is given the choice of whether to obey Kelly's orders to send for reinforcements, or accept Swann's argument to keep Mars isolated until the exact nature of the invasion is understood, so as not to endanger Earth. <b>The</b> <b>marine</b> is told to go to the Delta Labs by Kelly or Swann, depending on whether the transmission is sent or not.|$|E

5|$|The portal takes <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> {{directly}} into Hell, where he proceeds to fight {{his way through}} the large number of demons to the Soul Cube, defeating its demonic guardian. <b>The</b> <b>marine</b> is then able to reinitialize the teleportation equipment left by research expeditions into Hell and return to the Delta Labs. Betruger, however, tells <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. Further in the Delta Labs, <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and has been transformed by the demons. Telling <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives <b>the</b> <b>marine</b> his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and assures him that he will try to make {{his way out of the}} base alone.|$|E

On the way one boat is destroyed by a Japanese sub before it is sunk by onshore <b>Marine</b> artillery. <b>The</b> <b>Marines</b> walk into a trap, and only Private Soose Alvarez survives to make it back to American lines. <b>The</b> <b>Marines</b> then march on Matanikau in force and on the way, Private “Chicken’ Anderson is wounded by a Japanese soldier who only pretended to be dead. <b>The</b> <b>Marines</b> enjoy mail call, but suffer through Japanese air force bombing raids. Army troops land to support <b>the</b> <b>Marines.</b> They launch a campaign to root Japanese troops out of a series of caves. They try to listen to the results of Game Two of the 1942 World Series, but static unfortunately prevents them from hearing the final score. <b>The</b> <b>Marines</b> are both shelled by the Japanese navy and bombed by their air force. A force of Marine fighter planes land on the island. All <b>the</b> <b>marines</b> write letters home. They launch an attack on the Japanese, during which Pvt.
