5|$|Ongoing {{problems}} with avionics systems were addressed in <b>the</b> <b>Jolly</b> Well program, completed in 1964, which improved {{components of the}} AN/ASQ-38 bombing navigational computer and the terrain computer. The MADREC (Malfunction Detection and Recording) upgrade fitted to most aircraft by 1965 could detect failures in avionics and weapons computer systems, and was essential in monitoring the Hound Dog missiles. The electronic countermeasures capability of the B-52 was expanded with Rivet Rambler (1971) and Rivet Ace (1973).|$|E
5|$|Peterson spent {{ten years}} working at <b>the</b> <b>Jolly</b> Green Giant Co., rising to eastern {{regional}} manager {{in charge of}} 17 food processing plants in the United States and Canada. However, the western regional manager {{was the son of}} the company's president, so in 1963 Peterson obtained a franchise from Muntz television, sold his home for US$10,000, which he put into the business, and moved with Gloria to Portland on the advice of friends.|$|E

5|$|Hergé also {{introduced}} a new character, Peggy Alcazar, whom he had based upon the American secretary to a Ku Klux Klan spokesman whom Hergé observed in a television documentary. In his preparatory notes for the story, Hergé had considered introducing Peggy {{as the daughter of}} arms dealer Basil Bazaroff– the satirical depiction of the old times real-life arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, who had appeared in The Broken Ear. He {{also introduced}} <b>the</b> <b>Jolly</b> Follies into the story, a group who were based on three separate touring party groups that Hergé had encountered. He had initially considered a number of alternative names for the troupe, including the Turlupins, Turlurans, and Boutentrins.|$|E
5|$|In June, Reenie accompanies Joan to a {{pregnancy}} testing clinic, while {{the boys are}} on <b>the</b> <b>Jolly</b> Boys Outing to Margate (providing Freddie and Jelly the opportunity to burgle a jewellers). On their journey home, Reenie tells Joan about Freddie's time in prison and she realises he burgled the cinema. After Freddie tells Kelly he thinks he's in love with Joan, Reg announces her pregnancy in the pub. While Joan is completing a housing request form, Freddie goes to see her and she fails to acknowledge the baby is his.|$|E
5|$|After sending Meg out on {{an errand}} {{to pick up her}} grandfather, Lois {{continues}} to seduce Anthony, having been interested in him since Peter had begun insulting her about her advancing age. Quickly returning after forgetting the car keys, Meg discovers her mother making out with her new boyfriend on the couch. The bass jingle used extensively in the long-running NBC sitcom Seinfeld is then heard, with the scene pausing, before transitioning to <b>the</b> <b>Jolly</b> Farm studio. In a surprise visit to the Griffin family home, Julie unexpectedly appears when Stewie opens the front door. Expecting Julie to recognize him, he forgets that he is not dressed as Karina, causing him to hurriedly change clothing, while pretending to have an argument with his fabricated persona. A similar scene is featured in the 1993 film Mrs. Doubtfire, starring actor Robin Williams. Stewie and Jolly Farm make a reference to Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747–100 destroyed by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 occupants. Large portions of the plane fell onto Lockerbie, which killed 11 people, escalating the death toll to 270. A song features on Jolly Farm that explicitly describes debris from the newly disintegrated plane falling into Lockerbie, sung in the fashion of that of a nursery rhyme.|$|E
