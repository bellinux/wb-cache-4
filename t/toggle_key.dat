500|$|Reviewers {{highlighted}} {{technical issues}} in the game. The eight door maze room {{was thought to be}} a bug, a software error, by two people at ZX Computing magazine. Because the game contains no reset feature they reloaded the game from cassette in order to continue playing. The player character's movements were criticised for being jerky and prone to stopping at infrequent intervals. One of Crash magazine's staff stated that the boy scout's movement to the left was quick; [...] "as if there's a force ten gale blowing to the left." [...] They added [...] "When any attempt is made to move right, all the moving characters on the screen slow right down." [...] In-game objects are removed from view when either the player character or one of the mansion staff move in front of them. When the player redefines the game's keyboard controls, allowing them to choose which keys move the boy scout during play, the pause key and music <b>toggle</b> <b>key</b> are not included. As a result it is possible to double-up movement controls with these two functions, effectively causing the game to pause and unpause or for the music to toggle constantly as the player moves in that direction.|$|E
50|$|Some {{features}} include Narrator, Magnifier, High Contrast, On Screen Keyboard, Sticky <b>Keys,</b> <b>Toggle</b> <b>Keys,</b> Filter Keys, and Mouse Keys.|$|R
5000|$|Brightness and zoom can be {{adjusted}} using the menu <b>toggle</b> <b>keys</b> ...|$|R
50|$|F3, F4 and F5 {{keys are}} used to switch to playback, capture and all view mode, respectively. Tab <b>key</b> <b>toggles</b> the current view mode circularly.|$|R
5000|$|In Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Konqueror for KDE, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer for Windows, the {{function}} <b>key</b> F11 <b>key</b> <b>toggles</b> full screen viewing mode. In macOS, F11 hides all open windows.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] key {{was meant}} to lock all {{scrolling}} techniques, and is a remnant from the original IBM PC keyboard. In the original design, [...] was intended to modify {{the behavior of the}} arrow keys. When the [...] mode was on, the arrow keys would scroll the contents of a text window instead of moving the cursor. In this usage, [...] is a <b>toggling</b> lock <b>key</b> like Num Lock or Caps Lock, which have a state that persists after the key is released.|$|R
5000|$|Katakana,hiragana,rōmaji ({{katakana}},hiragana,rōmaji) used {{to switch}} between hiragana or katakana characters. It {{can also be}} found for switching between hiragana, katakana and rōmaji as shown below. [...] or [...] (this feature is printed as Rōmaji (ローマ字) on the same <b>key)</b> <b>toggles</b> between rōmaji input and direct kana input in some IMEs (e.g. Microsoft IME).|$|R
50|$|The stockyards {{are mostly}} {{constructed}} of local Cooktown Ironwood posts keyed for five rail panels. Many of the keyed rails {{have over the}} years been damaged or removed and replaced with rails that are hitched to the posts with fencing wire. A number of different configurations are evident with the use and re-use of timber fence rails. An early and significant section of panels {{is located at the}} northern end of the large tailing, or cooling, yard alongside the present access track where several heavy ironwood posts still stand. The posts are <b>toggled</b> and <b>keyed</b> for quick removal and replacement of rails. The unchecked actions of termites and the introduction of fire management practices in recent years have made it more difficult to understand the chronology of the changes that have occurred in the stockyards.|$|R
5000|$|The {{calculator}} may be set {{to automatically}} display values as mixed fractions by <b>toggling</b> the [...] <b>key.</b> The maximum denominator may be specified using the [...] function. Numbered flags may {{be set to}} specify which of three denominator systems is to be used: most precise denominator, factors of the maximum (for example 2, 4, 8, 16, when the maximum is 16), or a fixed denominator. Two small arrow symbols on the display indicate if the actual value is slightly above or below that displayed. There are no functions to directly extract {{the parts of the}} displayed fraction.|$|R
50|$|The {{fretboard}} is continuously scanned {{and sends}} signals to synthesizers which produce the sound. The left set determine the pitch played, through {{contact with the}} frets on the neck and by sensing the side-to-side bending of the string. The right set of strings are velocity sensitive; these strings can be plucked, strummed or damped {{in the same manner}} as a guitar. A keyboard made up of nine keys can also be used to trigger notes instead of the strings. Design of the <b>key</b> <b>toggles</b> was done by the late David Fowler, at the time trading under BJ Hopkins Injection and toolmaking, in Littleworth, Oxford.|$|R
50|$|The 32-bit A {{register}} is {{the main}} accumulator register. There is a 32-bit B register too, which is most commonly used together with the A register as a 64-bit BA register for double precision floating point operations. A 16-bit X register is used mainly for array indexing, and two 16-bit Y and Z registers are used as 16-bit pointers. A 16-bit L register points to function local data, and a G register always contains zero {{which can be used}} as a 16-bit global pointer, and also an 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit zero value. The 16-bit S (sequence) register points to the next instruction to be obeyed. The 8 bit EC register contains condition codes bits. (Some of this is illustrated in the much simpler instruction set of the GEC 2050.) A read-only keys register allows programs to read the value set on the front panel <b>toggle</b> switches (<b>keys)</b> by the operations staff. No 32-bit PAS pointer register exists—32-bit PAS pointers always reside in memory in the 16-bit CST address space, and are accessed by using a 16-bit pointer. There is no instruction set support for a stack. There are a number of registers inaccessible to programs which are used by Nucleus, such as the hardware segment registers which point to the running process's 4 CSTs and master segment and PAS segments, and the system tables.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{designed}} in 1981 {{by a team}} of educators at the Bank Street College of Education in New York City, software developer Franklin E. Smith, and programmers at Intentional Educations in Watertown, MA. Because of its wide adoption in elementary schools in the following years, a period coincident with the growth of personal computer use, it was generally thought at the time to have changed the way students learned to write by allowing them to concentrate on the creative parts of writing, and making the process of editing easier than with pencil, paper and eraser. The interface featured menus listing the operations the word processor could perform, such as [...] "cut" [...] and [...] "paste," [...] and brief directions for how to perform each function. The design addressed the need for a word processor that would enable elementary school children to use a computer to write stories and essays. Bank Street Writer was a modal editor - pressing the Esc <b>key</b> <b>toggled</b> between editing mode and menu mode.|$|R
