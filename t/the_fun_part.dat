The {{production}} was well received by critics.

2500|$|Promotion on {{the album}} ended soon after its December release and Norwood {{subsequently}} started work on a second album with Epic Records. Amongst those to record with her were songwriting and production partners Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Human collaborator Brian Kennedy. Expressing her dissatisfaction with Humans commercial performance, Norwood told Blues & Soul magazine she was [...] "a little disappointed about that" [...] but also felt [...] "pleased that Sony has given me another chance to do another project that I feel they're totally behind. In hindsight I do feel the last album was a little political. So a lotta changes have been made since Human – and hopefully they're changes for the better! Because, having got all the deep stuff off my chest, I'm now able to really tap into <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> of music again [...] it's exactly the type of album that I need to be makiing right now!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Evan Lucy of Alternative Press {{praised the}} album for its return-to-roots musical style and wrote, [...] "Good Charlotte might be multi-platinum superstars, but [...] "Cardiology" [...] might be their best effort yet." [...] Amy Bangs, writing in Rock Sound, was also positive, saying: [...] "Musically, they've ditched their early material's urban (ish) influences, while {{maintaining}} <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>parts</b> of pop-punk. So we're {{left with the}} Good Charlotte that brought us the brilliantly catchy 'Seasons' or 'Festival Song', without the awkward rapping interludes. And for that we thank them." ...|$|R
2500|$|Nozomi {{continued}} to enjoy sex {{both within and}} outside of the AV setting, and stated that she did not mind having it every day. Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid." [...] She continued, [...] "Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. There are times when I think it's hard and tiring, but <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> is a lot greater!" [...] A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.|$|E

5000|$|Despite his {{criticism}} of the AI, GameSpot's Craig Beers scored the game 8.4 out of 10, writing [...] "It manages to take all <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>parts</b> from its predecessor and greatly expands them to create an engaging, new action game in its own right." [...] IGN's Steve Butts scored the game 8.8 out of 10, giving it an [...] "Editor's Choice Award" [...] and writing [...] "If you like Star Wars and think flipping around chopping up Stormtroopers and flinging Dark Jedi off of conveniently placed precipices is fun, then this game is definitely for you." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was less impressed, scoring the game 7 out of 10, writing [...] "The harsh reality is, for all the plentiful additions, there's much {{work to be done}} before LucasArts can boast it has created the ultimate Star Wars FPS. Sure, it's the best one yet, but with some often laughable AI and creaking tech underpinning it, the flaws are there for all to see." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{area where}} the cinemas now are was {{originally}} used as a fun park called 'Tops'. It was closed down and demolished in 2000, with <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> park <b>parts</b> sold off. <b>The</b> <b>fun</b> park comprised various small shops, an amusement centre, a swing ship, a dragon train, and a Ferris wheel. When the theme park was operating, screams of excitement and terror could be heard from the patrons of both the swing ship and the dragon train. Prior to 2000, the cinemas were originally situated in the area now occupied by Target on one level only, and operated by Hoyts.|$|R
5000|$|Sean Reynolds {{explained}} {{where the}} idea came from, {{to make it possible}} to play a dead PC as a ghost: [...] "I think {{it was just a matter}} of Monte and me understanding that one of <b>the</b> least <b>fun</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> game is when a character dies. Not only is there a feeling of loss regarding the character, but also the player doesn't have anything to do until a new character can be brought in. We thought a campaign where a character's death wouldn't be the end of play for that character or player would be a neat twist on standard D&D." ...|$|R

5000|$|By 1996-97, {{there was}} {{a steady flow of}} UK based hard house that threw away <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> & {{uplifting}} <b>parts</b> to incorporate the [...] "Hoover" [...] & other gritty, menacing sounding elements at a slightly higher tempo than the conventional hard house and thus, the style effectively became known as [...] "Nu-NRG" [...] when Blu Peter coined the phrase in a magazine interview.|$|R
5000|$|... 1UP.com {{gave the}} console version a [...] "D" [...] rating, criticizing the drum {{controllers}} [...] "intimidating" [...] layout of small pads, its graphics for having [...] "lifeless" [...] character animations and re-using {{exactly the same}} crowd in every venue, and its career mode for being boring and lacking any form of narrative. The recording studio mode was considered <b>the</b> only <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> game, primarily for having more functionality than {{any other part of}} the game. However, it still considered the similar functionality in Guitar Hero World Tour to be superior, due to its ability to play and share creations in-game (which Rock Revolution could not).|$|R

Furthermore, in reflecting the song, Yui also talked about <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> about being a musician, such as receiving goodwill messages or meeting a variety of people.|$|E
5000|$|Colin Covert of the Star Tribune {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} four stars, saying [...] "A well-oiled machine of visuals, and yet a {{wobbling}} rattletrap of storytelling, the sci-fi fantasy Tomorrowland is an unwieldy clunker driven into the ditch at full speed." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, saying [...] "For a while, it doesn't matter that the plot meanders. The story seems like a jigsaw puzzle inviting us to solve it. That's <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>part.</b> However, when the resolution is presented, it underwhelms." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Kreisberg, {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer on both series, said, [...] "It's {{really going to be}} an adventure with the Arrow and Flash on both episodes. Watching the two teams come together and fight alongside each other, it's one of <b>the</b> most <b>fun</b> <b>parts,</b> ... we just don’t believe in waiting. We really believe in accelerated storytelling." [...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas." [...] Greg Berlanti, creator {{and executive producer}} on both series, explained that [...] "crossovers are part of [...] DNA, ... and if we waited ..., then we would be depriving the audience of something we all wanted to see".|$|R
5000|$|This {{project was}} <b>the</b> most <b>fun</b> I’ve had in years. It has really {{hammered}} home (to me) {{the importance of}} animation in animation. I think it’s possible to bring animation back to this country and make the core of it fun again, not be a mere tertiary addition to some high concept or executive’s “vision.” The pure act of animating is <b>the</b> most <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> of animation. I am so grateful to Matt for letting me have some real fun this summer. — John Kricfalusi He showed Groening and Jean his Adult Swim shorts and Groening responded by giving him free hands to do the 35-second-long segment. [...] Groening told him to break all The Simpsons rules, but Kricfalusi explains that he [...] "tried not to break any rules in the characters’ personalities, just in {{the execution of the}} visuals. I didn’t follow any models—not even my own". The more rules he broke, the more pleased Groening and Jean were with the result. Contrary to Banksy, who lives a life in secrecy, Kricfalusi was involved in every detail and even oversaw the dubbing of the final soundtrack. While Kricfalusi animated the 2D parts, he had John Kedzie to help him with the computer graphics and Sarah Harkey and Tommy Tanner to do the assistant animation.|$|R
500|$|During an {{interview}} with British radio station XFM, Björk explained its recording process, saying work on [...] "Oceania" [...] was kept being delayed {{because she wanted to}} do it especially for the Olympics. During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed [...] "sirenes", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was <b>the</b> most <b>fun</b> <b>part,</b> in <b>the</b> end. Sometimes it's good for you to work with a gun against your head and just go for it, because you can sometimes sit too long with ideas. Sometimes adrenaline is a good thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Henry was {{the leading}} scorer for Gorge for many years being {{in the right place}} at the right time and being a good finisher.

[...] "No matter what, I gave 100% all of the time. <b>The</b> <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> of rugby was that we always had 15 guys to hang out with, to play with, and go out afterwards.

5000|$|The episode {{received}} a mixed to negative reaction from critics. IGN gave the episode a 6.5/10 rating, stating [...] "this episode {{could really be}} summed up in three words: not very good." [...] TV Fanatic, while praising the ability of the show to stay with current events, awarded the episode a mixed review of 3.5 out of 5, noting [...] "it wasn't the strongest episode of the show's history." [...] The A.V. Club agreed, giving the episode a tepid C+, noting that [...] "'Funnybot' was a bit too 'NON-SEQUITUR' for me, sticking to easy jokes about easy targets and then—like Funnybot himself—padding out its kernel of an idea with random nonsense that left the whole thing feeling a little slight." [...] While praising the episode's central concept, Assignment X nevertheless concluded that Funnybot had [...] "a good idea that strangely doesn't deliver on the funny." [...] Positive reviews focused mainly on the show's ability to quickly incorporate current events into its episodes. Entertainment Weekly noted [...] "One of <b>the</b> most <b>fun</b> <b>parts</b> about watching South Park is slowly piecing together its seemingly inane and ridiculous plot points and realizing that its creators are actually delivering a well-thought-out and relevant statement." [...] The Wall Street Journal echoed this sentiment, claiming the episode was [...] "an impressive example of speedily manufactured humor." ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{think the}} fear when writing a song always that {{the outside world}} won’t think it’s as awesome as you do. That’s the scary part about {{progressing}} through releasing the song, and also <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> in sharing it with other people. Sharing that experience {{with all of these}} people, it goes from being something that’s very much for me and for the other writers who wrote with me, into being something that’s for everybody else. That’s what performing is. You’re giving it to everyone else. I think that that’s really cool, it’s also super trippy, because you’d never think this thing that you created in a small room with four other people would be something you’d get to share with so many people". — Mendler about the writing process.|$|E

40|$|Several {{chapters}} {{in this book}} present various aspects of Michel Henon's scientific acheivements that spread over a large range of subjects, and yet managed to make deep contributions to most of them. The authors of these chapters make {{a much better job}} at demonstrating the big advancements that Michel Henon allowed in these fields than I could ever do. Here I rather present some facets of his personnality that most appealed to me. Michel Henon was a reserved person, almost shy, so it was not obvious for a young student to grasp the profoundness of his insight and what a marvelous advisor he could be. The two most prominent aspects of his mind, in my view, were his ability to simplify any scientific question to its core complexity, and to find <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> and amusing <b>part</b> in his everyday work, even in the tiniest details of his scientific investigations.
