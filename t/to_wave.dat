5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. When they do not pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Erin {{produced}} moderate winds across Newfoundland, {{including a}} maximum sustained wind report of 53mph (85km/h) with {{a gust of}} 67mph (108km/h) at Cape Race. The storm also produced moderate amounts of precipitation, peaking at 5.1inches (131mm) at Sagona Island. Along the coast, {{the passage of the}} storm led <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> heights of up to 30feet (9.3m), while offshore a buoy recorded a wave height of 47feet (14.2m). No damage was reported in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Hardee County saw {{property}} damage estimated at $750million, along with six injuries, but no deaths were reported.

A radio tower near Sebring was toppled, along with numerous trees and power poles along {{the north and east}} side of Highlands County. Additionally, there were several reports of severely damaged homes in Polk County near Babson Park and Avon Park. In Lake Wales, Florida, a sand mine lake encroached into State Road 60 due <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> action and swallowed a car. Additionally, Lake Wales saw 23,000buildings damaged, as well as the destruction of 739structures. Seven deaths were reported in the county, one of them determined to be direct.|$|E

5|$|In the 1907 season, McGinnity {{finished}} with an 18–18 {{record with a}} 3.16 ERA, allowing more than a hit per inning {{for the first time}} since the 1901 season. He missed the beginning of the 1908 season with a severe fever. In June 1908, Brush put McGinnity on waivers, hoping another owner would relieve him of McGinnity's $5,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms). He tried <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> McGinnity again in August, but both times McGinnity went unclaimed. Despite this, McGinnity reverted to his old form: from August 22 through the end of the season, McGinnity had an 11–7 record, five shutouts, a 2.27 ERA, and an NL-leading five saves. The Giants released McGinnity on February 27, 1909, when McGinnity decided to pay for his own release.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the battle}} at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and a Native American confederacy had collapsed. No parties aided him and his followers. The British Band started to weaken with hunger, and Black Hawk soon {{realized}} that the only option was to return across the Mississippi River. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce. They were told <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> a white flag at the militia.|$|E

5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle. Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out. Dan Ramsay (Syd Conabere) spots a mouse and tries to pick it up, but hits Mrs. Mangel's foot. She accuses Dan of groping her and as he protests his innocence, an argument breaks out among the guests. Scott and Charlene go to his bedroom and Gail brings them a gift from her father. Jane comes to tell Charlene {{that it is time to}} get changed for the honeymoon, while Paul takes their bags out to the car. Lucy tells Scott that she will miss him and he gives her his skateboard. Everyone gathers in the street <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> the couple off. Mrs. Mangel catches Charlene's bouquet, as the couple drive out of Ramsay Street.|$|E
5|$|Captain Thomas Thompson on Leander {{initially}} {{tried to}} escape the much larger French ship, but it rapidly became clear that Généreux was faster than his vessel. At 09:00 the ships exchanged broadsides, the engagement continuing until 10:30, when Captain Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille made an unsuccessful attempt to board Leander, suffering heavy casualties in the attempt. For another five hours the battle continued, Thompson successfully raking Généreux at one stage but ultimately being outfought and outmanoeuvered by the larger warship. Eventually the wounded Thompson surrendered his dismasted ship by ordering his men <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> a French tricolour on a pike. As French sailors took possession of the British ship, Lejoille encouraged systematic looting of the sailors' personal possessions, even confiscating the surgeon's tools {{in the middle of}} an operation. Against the established conventions of warfare, he forced the captured crew to assist in bringing Leander safely into Corfu, and denied them food and medical treatment unless they co-operated with their captors.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Erin {{developed}} from a tropical wave on September 1, and strengthened to a 60mph (95km/h) tropical storm {{as it moved}} to the west-northwest. After weakening due to wind shear, the remnants re-organized into a tropical depression the next day, and Erin strengthened into a hurricane on September 9 while moving northwestward. The hurricane quickly intensified and reached peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) later on September 9. A trough turned Erin to the northeast, and after passing just east of Cape Race, Newfoundland it became extratropical on September 15. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward and lost its identity near Greenland on September 17. Hurricane Erin brushed Newfoundland, producing a sustained wind of 53mph (85km/h) with a gust of 67mph (108km/h) at Cape Race. Along the coast, {{the passage of the}} storm led <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> heights of up to 30ft (9.3m).|$|E

The pressure results suggest that momentum transfer <b>to</b> <b>waves</b> can be specified by a certain relation, which is given. The wind-velocity results suggest that the wave-induced airflow is much smaller than the mean wind speed.

5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was mortally wounded on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći. The dying zduhać disclosed the way in which he could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birač, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhać could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhać. Most zduhaći would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaći. As thought in Herzegovina, a man {{who did not want to}} be a zduhać anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing in a dark room, dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing a flowing maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a pleated red organza dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic arrangements are intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue {{down on the floor and}} leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the camera pans out. She proceeds <b>to</b> <b>wave</b> to a distant person and then plucks the petals out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E
