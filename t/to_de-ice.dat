5|$|Agaricus bernardii is a {{saprobic}} species. Its mushrooms fruit singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} on the ground. They grow in sandy soils, lawns, and in habitats with a high salt concentration, like along ocean coasts and salt marshes. Once primarily a maritime species, the fungus has spread inland to roadside verges where salt has been applied <b>to</b> <b>de-ice</b> the roads. Fruit bodies sometimes form underground. Mushrooms can also grow in fairy rings, especially when in grasslands or pastures. A Czech study determined that the mushrooms will strongly bioaccumulate silver from contaminated soil. Although the average concentration of silver in the soil is typically less than 1 milligram per kilogram of soil, it can be significantly elevated near industrial sites such as mines and smelters. The concentration of silver in the caps—which reached levels of up to 544mg per kg of mushroom tissue (dry weight)—was about twice that of the stems.|$|E

25|$|Built between 1929 and 1951, {{the highway}} had narrow confines—which could not {{accommodate}} trucks—and sharp S exit ramps {{that made it}} obsolete almost immediately.

When chunks of its facade began to fall off due to lack of maintenance, and a truck and car fell through it at 14th Street in 1973, the highway was shut down, and a debate began whether to renovate it or dismantle it. Attitudes to urban planning had changed in the intervening decades, and the decision was made not to repair the decaying structure.|$|E

25|$|Some of the PCC cars {{once owned}} by Twin City Rapid Transit are just {{beginning}} their lives as museum pieces. The Newark City Subway finished operation of their 24 remaining cars on August 24, 2001, replacing the cars with new light-rail trainsets. Fifteen have been sold to the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), for their collection of classic streetcars on the Market Street Railway. In addition, 12 PCCs that ran on the Shaker Heights line are now owned by the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association. Many of these cars owe their longevity {{to the fact that}} the Twin Cities area makes heavy use of salt <b>to</b> <b>de-ice</b> roadways in the winter.

It was a twin-engined low-wing cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, the first all-metal aircraft {{to be built}} in Poland following the end of the Second World War. The oval section fuselage accommodated seats for ten passengers in two rows of five, with the two pilots sitting in an enclosed flight deck forward of the passenger cabin, while a cloakroom and baggage compartment aft of the cabin. The aircraft's wings featured a mixture of smooth and corrugated duralumin skinning, with the corrugated sections covered in fabric to reduce drag. Full-span hydraulically operated trailing-edge flaps were fitted, while engine exhaust gas was used <b>to</b> <b>de-ice</b> the wings' leading edge.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chloride induced {{corrosion}} {{of steel}} reinforcement in concrete {{is the main}} cause of damage to concrete structures in marine, or structures exposed <b>to</b> <b>de-icing</b> salt environments. The need for early detection of corrosion in reinforced concrete structures is widely acknowledged in corrosion health monitoring for strategic civil engineering projects. This paper summarizes results from a laboratory experiment, using Acoustic Emission (AE) technique, regarding early detection of corrosion in reinforced concrete slabs that are exposed to chloride. The Results showed that while AE was able to determine the initiation of corrosion in reinforced concrete slab, Half-cell potential (HCP) was not able to detect it at the early stage of corrosion...|$|R

Attention was focused on the selection of proper values of concrete resistivity and of the parameters suitable to describe the electrochemical behaviour of steel in the different conditions of exposure. The results allowed to quantify the effects of the galvanic coupling between active and passive areas on the corrosion rate of steel...|$|R

The main batch of eighteen tube-gauge locomotives were built between 1938 and 1941 from motor cars originally built in 1903. They were refurbished in the 1960s using equipment removed from redundant T-stock vehicles, and were joined by a pair of surface-gauge locomotives in 1961. In addition <b>to</b> <b>de-icing</b> duties, some of them were also used for experiments in clearing leaves from the running rails. They had all ceased to operate by 1985.

40|$|Most {{delays in}} the air {{transport}} occur at the airport. A particular reason is the complexity of managing {{the large number of}} supporting flows in airport logistics.

The objective is to minimise the delay of flights due <b>to</b> <b>de-icing,</b> and the travel distance of the de-icing vehicles. We study the complexity of the problem, and develop a solution algorithm using greedy randomised adaptive search. A case study of real-life data from Stockholm Arlanda Airport shows that optimised schedule leads to significantly better performance in comparison to intuitive and simple scheduling strategies. The benefit of optimisation in reducing the waiting time for de-icing is further demonstrated via dynamic simulations...|$|R
