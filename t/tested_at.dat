5|$|Arizona was {{commissioned}} into the Navy on 17 October 1916 with John D. McDonald as captain. She departed New York on 10 November 1916 after {{the crew had}} cleaned the ship and the propulsion system had been <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> the dock. After declinating the ship's magnetic compasses, the ship sailed south for her shakedown cruise. Outside Guantanamo Bay, a stripped turbine on 7 December forced the navy to order Arizona back to New York for repairs, although {{she was able to}} enter Chesapeake Bay to test her main and secondary gun batteries on 19–20 December. The turbine could not be repaired inside the ship, so the yard workers had to cut holes in the upper decks to lift the damaged casing out. It was reinstalled after almost four months of repairs at the naval yard.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, {{mindful of}} the federal government's {{disallowance}} of the Social Credit Board's earlier legislation, reserved royal assent of the act and its companions until their legality could be <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> the Supreme Court of Canada. This was the first use {{of the power of}} reservation in Alberta history, and in the summer of 1938 Aberhart's government announced the elimination of Bowen's official residence, his government car, and his secretarial staff. Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller and Ernest Manning biographer Brian Brennan attribute this move to revenge for Bowen's reservation of assent.|$|E

Among the German {{casualties}} {{that day was}} Rolf Heitsch and his flame throwing Dornier; the device had not been <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> high altitude and when used, squirted black oil over Holmes' windshield and {{attracted the attention of}} British fighters.
