40|$|A saline {{tracer test}} has been {{performed}} at an industrial site, {{located in the}} Po River delta region (North-Eastern Italy). This tracer test was aimed at identifying possible hydraulic connections between a shallow unconfined aquifer and a deeper confined aquifer. Hydraulic head {{difference between the two}} aquifers is maintained via an active hydraulic barrier (pumping wells) screened in the deeper formation. The movement of the tracer in the subsurface has been monitored via electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) from the surface, using a network of twelve 48 -electrode lines, for a total time period of about 45 days. This non-invasive geophysical method offers several advantages over direct water sampling from monitoring boreholes: (a) a wide area is investigated in a relatively short time; (b) a 2 D picture of the subsurface is produced, in this case to a depth of about 15 - 20 in; (c) because of the above, it is possible to follow the tracer motion even if the tracer does not reach the few boreholes where water can be sampled. The latter is a major advantage over traditional methods, where {{it is not uncommon to}} miss the tracer plume altogether, or sample it only partially. The site is characterized by fairly saline groundwater, and the presence of diffuse silt and clay, that make the system rather conductive. Under such unfavourable conditions, careful inversion of resistance ratios was needed to identify changes in resistivity of as much as 50 % with respect to background. The migration of the tracer was successfully monitored and confirmed by direct sampling of water from few boreholes. The results of the <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>survey</b> confirm that the system is very heterogeneous, and that some downward migration of the tracer through the confining layer can take place over relatively short time periods, maybe through some manmade connections.

40|$|Geophysical imaging in the vadose zone poses unique issues. Groundwater {{contamination}} at DOE's Hanford, Washington site needs optimal imaging because {{extremely high}} drilling costs make direct characterization quite expensive. We conducted seismic and radar crosswell experiments to help answer basic questions about high resolution geophysical characterization. We acquired <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>surveys</b> during controlled injections of river water and saline solution. Radar imaging of dielectric changes delineated geological layers and moisture movement with 0. 25 m resolution.

40|$|Time-lapse seismic {{technology}} {{is proven to}} be a powerful tool for monitoring of reservoir depletion or fluid (such as gas, water or steam) injection into subsurface formations. While being almost standard technique for offshore reservoirs, <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>surveys</b> are still relatively rare used onshore due to poor repeatability of land seismic data. Borehole time-lapse seismic surveys could be a good alternative because of very stable receiver, and, in certain cases, source conditions, acquisition and processing of zero-offset and offset VSP is reasonably fast. In this paper we analyse repeated zero-offset and offset VSP acquired in within CO 2 CRC Otway pilot project scientific program in year 2007 (pre-injection) and year 2010 (postinjection). We address repeatability of the data and possibility to use simple VSP techniques for monitoring purposes...|$|R
40|$|Migration of CO 2 through storage {{reservoirs}} can {{be monitored}} using <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> seismic reﬂection <b>surveys.</b> At the Sleipner Field, injected CO 2 is distributed throughout nine layers within the reservoir. These layers {{are too thin to}} be seismically resolvable by direct {{measurement of the}} separation between reﬂections from {{the top and bottom of}} each layer. Here we develop and apply an inverse method for measuring thick ness changes of the shallowest layer. Our approach combines diﬀerences in traveltime down to a speciﬁc reﬂection together with amplitude measurements to determine layer thicknesses from <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>surveys.</b> A series of synthetic forward models were used to test the robustness of our inverse approach and to quantify uncertainties. In the absence of ambient noise, this approach can unambiguously resolve layer thickness. If a realistic ambient noise distribution is included, layer thicknesses of 1 – 6 m are accurately retrieved with an uncertainty of ± 0. 5 m. We used this approach to generate a thickness map of the shallowest layer. The ﬁdelity of this result was tested using measurements of layer thickness determined from the 2010 broadband seismic survey. The calculated volume of CO 2 within the shallowest layer increases at a rate that is quadratic in time, despite an approximately constant injection rate into the base of the reser voir. This result is consistent with a diminished growth rate of the areal extent of underlying layers. Finally, the relationship between caprock topography and layer thickness is explored and potential migration pathways that charge this layer are identiﬁed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of {{depleted}} gas {{fields for}} CO 2 storage {{as well as}} CO 2 -based enhanced gas recovery are of global importance. Thus, the CO 2 CRC Otway Basin Pilot Project provides important experience in establishing whether such scenarios can be monitored by geophysical techniques, in particular seismic time-lapse methodology. Injection of CO 2 into a depleted gas reservoir (with residual gas in the Otway case) does not present favourable conditions {{for the application of}} geophysical monitoring techniques. Simulation of the CO 2 injection process at Otway shows that changes in elasticity of the reservoir rock will be quite small and difficult to monitor even with the most powerful time-lapse (TL) seismic methodologies. Consequently, the design and implementation of the monitoring program had to address these issues. To increase the sensitivity of TL seismic we combined 3 D VSP with 3 D surface seismic. For land seismic case, we achieved excellent repeatability with 3 D <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>surveys,</b> which at the reservoir level produced normalised RMS difference values of about 20 % for surface seismic and 10 % for 3 D VSP, respectively. Still due to very small <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> signal, the primary use of 3 D surface seismic was for assurance monitoring. Borehole seismic measurements confirmed that time-lapse is too small to be reliably estimated and analysed from repeated seismic measurements. Finally, post-injection reservoir simulation and accompanying seismic modelling suggest that a prolonged CO 2 /CH 4 injection should produce only negligible change of the elastic properties of the Naylor reservoir...|$|R

Interpretation of depth averaged current vectors show a large eddy to be initiated and subsequently advected away from the headland as the tide ebbs. Grab samples show that the sediment of the sand bank is composed of moderately well sorted, landward fining, medium sand with a very poorly sorted, strongly coarse skewed, coarse sand proximal facies indicative of winnowing by flood dominated currents. Analysis of bottom currents reveals that there is no evidence for opposing residual bottom currents either side of the sand bank. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>lapse</b> seismic <b>surveys</b> {{covering}} the CO 2 injection plume at Sleipner {{are used to}} test novel techniques which estimate the thickness of a spreading CO 2 layer. Utilising the spectral content of the data, the methods extend the limited vertical resolution encountered with time domain data. Spectral decomposition using the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution extracts monochromatic reflection amplitudes from the topmost CO 2 layer and is {{used to assess the}} lateral variation in peak tuning frequency. This provides a direct proxy for temporal thickness which show consistency with true layer thicknesses derived from structural analysis. A spectral inversion method is also applied to a subset of the upper layer, with limited success. It is noted that high signal-to-noise ratios and the absence of overlying and underlying reflections are required to utilize the technique fully. ...|$|R
40|$|On the 27 * March 2004, {{the retired}} Royal Navy Frigate, HMS Scylla was scuttled off Whitsand Bay {{creating}} Britain's first artificial reef {{to serve as}} a diving attraction. To provide a reference for future studies of seabed change, a sidescan and single-beam bathymetric survey was performed two days before the Scylla was scuttled. This data has been compared with a similar survey performed in November 2004 and two multibeam surveys performed by the Royal Navy in December 2003 and July 2004 with a Simrad EM 3000 multibeam echo sounder to attempt to gauge any early indications of seabed change in the immediate area since the Scylla's placement on the seabed. The Scylla sits orientated across the depth contours, listing slightly to its starboard side on a relatively featureless area of sandy seabed bounded by large rocky outcrops in the wider area to the North, West and South. It is in just over 20 m water depth around 560 m metres from the wreck of the James Egan Layne. No evidence of seabed change has been found at this early stage, instead comparison and analysis of multibeam data have detected only changes in the data caused by differences in survey procedure or incorrect calibration, highlighting the importance of continuity between surveys and careful calibration of equipment when trying to observe slight changes in the seabed by comparison of <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>surveys.</b> Potential reasons for the differences observed are discussed along with the limitations of the commonly used survey techniques employed in the study.

40|$|The marine {{controlled}} source electromagnetic (CSEM) {{technique has}} been adopted by the hydrocarbon industry to characterize the resistivity of targets identified from seismic data prior to drilling. Over the years, marine controlled source electromagnetic has matured {{to the point that}} four-dimensional or <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>surveys</b> and monitoring could be applied to hydrocarbon reservoirs in production, or to monitor the sequestration of carbon dioxide. Marine controlled source electromagnetic surveys have also been used to target shallow resistors such as gas hydrates. These novel uses of the technique require very well constrained transmitter and receiver geometry in order to make meaningful and accurate geologic interpretations of the data. Current navigation in marine controlled source electromagnetic surveys utilize a long base line, or a short base line, acoustic navigation system to locate the transmitter and seafloor receivers. If these systems fail, then rudimentary navigation is possible by assuming the transmitter follows in the ship's track. However, these navigational assumptions are insufficient to capture the detailed orientation and position of the transmitter required for both shallow targets and repeat surveys. In circumstances when acoustic navigation systems fail we propose the use of an inversion algorithm that solves for transmitter geometry. This algorithm utilizes the transmitter's electromagnetic dipole radiation pattern as recorded by stationary, close range (< 1000 m), receivers in order to model the geometry of the transmitter. We test the code with a synthetic model and validate it with data from a well navigated controlled source electromagnetic survey over the Scarborough gas field in Australia...|$|R
40|$|High seismic {{repeatability}} {{is critical}} to the monitoring program of the Naylor Field because of the small time-lapse effect related to CO 2 injection into a depleted gas reservoir (Naylor). To understand the effect of changing ground conditions on repeatability, we conducted so-called “micro-array” investigation of the near-surface layers at this site. A feature of the injection test site area is the near-surface karst topography. In such geological terrain, a change in water table level can influence the seismic response and cause changes in the seismic wave scattering pattern. Hence the aim of micro-array measurements was to determine the properties of the near surface layers during the wet and dry seasons. This could help us understand and ultimately predict the seismic response and hence survey repeatability at a given site. Measurements of seismic response due to near surface property changes (seasonal) could help optimise the design of <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>surveys</b> which ultimately yields improved survey differencing. Measured elastic properties of the near surface are used to produce seismic response and predict repeatability {{as a function of the}} variable soil conditions. Comparison of numerical and field data is finally used to verify the validity of this approach. In this study we investigated the variation of elastic properties of both top soil and the deeper rugose clay-limestone interface as a function of water depth level. Such tests in fact simulate the measurements conducted in dry and wet seasons and help evaluate the effect of these seasonal variations on the seismic signature, which is then analysed in terms of non-repeatability. In this study, we use both micro-borehole (micro VSP) and micro-refraction arrays to analyse directional properties of the near-surface. Finally, numerical tests were performed with calibrated soil parameters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{temporal}} {{imagery of}} water circulation {{in a landslide}} by Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was conducted to identify spatially and temporally the coupling between rainfalls, consecutive water inflows in a sliding mass, and induced resistivity variations. This work {{is based on a}} multi-scale experimental approach applied on the “Vence” landslide (South-eastern France) which is characterised by a sandy-clay sliding mass on a marly limestone substratum mostly controlled by high rainfall events. At the landslide scale, historical, geological and geotechnical data combined with field investigations and the interpretation of three ERT allowed the definition of a geometrical model of the landslide and the calibration of the resistivity values. On the basis of these results, a permanent <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> ERT <b>survey</b> was designed on a specific part of the landslide, coupled with water level acquisition (piezometric levels) and rain fall events. Results covering a three-month period are showed. The statistical analyses of all the physical parameters measured during the three months of investigation show that the matrix of correlations highlighted strong correlations between the rainfall, piezometric elevation and the resistivity. These first results show an accurate answer resistivity/piezometric elevation that can be associated as a precursor of the reactivation of the landslide...|$|R
40|$|Injection {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) into saline {{aquifers}} has been proposed {{as a means to}} reduce greenhouse gas emissions (geological carbon sequestration). Large-scale injection of CO{sub 2 } will induce a variety of coupled physical and chemical processes, including multiphase fluid flow, fluid pressurization and changes in effective stress, solute transport, and chemical reactions between fluids and formation minerals. This work addresses some of these issues with special emphasis given to the physics of fluid flow in brine formations. An investigation of the thermophysical properties of pure carbon dioxide, water and aqueous solutions of CO{sub 2 } and NaCl has been conducted. As a result, accurate representations and models for predicting the overall thermophysical behavior of the system CO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O-NaCl are proposed and incorporated into the numerical simulator TOUGH 2 /ECO{sub 2 }. The basic problem of CO{sub 2 } injection into a radially symmetric brine aquifer is used to validate the results of TOUGH 2 /ECO 2. The numerical simulator has been applied to more complex flow problem including the CO{sub 2 } injection project at the Sleipner Vest Field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the evaluation of fluid flow dynamics effects of CO{sub 2 } injection into aquifers. Numerical simulation results show that the transport at Sleipner is dominated by buoyancy effects and that shale layers control vertical migration of CO{sub 2 }. These results are in good qualitative agreement with <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>surveys</b> performed at the site. High-resolution numerical simulation experiments have been conducted to study the onset of instabilities (viscous fingering) during injection of CO{sub 2 } into saline aquifers. The injection process can be classified as immiscible displacement of an aqueous phase by a less dense and less viscous gas phase. Under disposal conditions (supercritical CO{sub 2 }) the viscosity {{of carbon dioxide}} can be less than the viscosity of the aqueous phase by a factor of 15. Because of the lower viscosity, the CO{sub 2 } displacement front will have a tendency towards instability. Preliminary simulation results show good agreement between classical instability solutions and numerical predictions of finger growth and spacing obtained using different gas/liquid viscosity ratios, relative permeability and capillary pressure models. Further studies are recommended to validate these results over a broader range of conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of reliable data sets representative of hydrological regimes and their variations {{is a critical}} concern for water resource assessment. For the subsurface, traditional approaches based on probe measurements, core analysis, and well data can be laborious, expensive, and highly intrusive, while only yielding sparse data sets. For this study, an innovative field survey, merging relative microgravimetry, magnetic resonance soundings, and hydrological measurements, was conducted to evaluate both surface and subsurface water storage variations in a semiarid Sahelian area. The instrumental setup was implemented in {{the lower part of}} a typical hillslope feeding to a temporary pond. Weekly measurements were carried out using relative spring gravimeters during 3 months of the rainy season in 2009 over a 350 × 500 m 2 network of 12 microgravity stations. Gravity variations of small to medium amplitude (≤ 220 nm s− 2) were measured with accuracies better than 50 nm s− 2, revealing significant variations of the water storage at small time (from 1 week up to 3 months) and space (from a couple of meters up to a few hundred meters) scales. Consistent spatial organization of the water storage variations were detected, suggesting high infiltration at the outlet of a small gully. The comparison with hydrological measurements and magnetic resonance soundings involved that most of the microgravity variations came from the heterogeneity in the vadose zone. The results highlight the potential of <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> microgravity <b>surveys</b> for detecting intraseasonal water storage variations and providing rich space-time data sets for process investigation or hydrological model calibration/evaluatio...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: Specific {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis C {{is effective in}} 50 % of patients, improving the]liver`s fibrosis, necroinflammatory changes and steatosis. However, in patients still viremic after treatment the extension of these benefits remains doubtful. The evolution of the disease in this group {{and its relationship to}} demographic data, biometric indices and <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies was evaluated. Methodology: In 141 patients, paired biopsies were classified and compared according to fibrosis grading. Necroinflammation, steatosis, demographic data (age and gender), body mass index (BMI) and <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies were compared with fibrosis grading. Results: The grade of fibrosis of the patients, after approximately 3. 5 years <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies, could be classified into 4 groups; Improved: 29 (20. 0 %), Unaltered: 64 (45. 0 %), Worsened: 48 (34 %) and Cirrhotic: 14 (9. 93 %). For necroinflammation, the Improved/Unaltered groups were statistically similar but different from the Worsened and Cirrhotic. The mean age, BMI and <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> between biopsies were statistically similar in all groups. Steatosis occurred in 35 (24. 82 %) between biopsies and its incidence was reduced in the Worsened and Cirrhotic groups.
