25|$|Whilst the law {{remains in}} the balance, many {{consumers}} have made claims against <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> providers for the charges that they have incurred, plus interest {{that they would have}} earned had the money not been deducted from their account.

25|$|In {{relative}} numbers {{the values}} lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 {{dollars worth of}} transactions (7 basis points). In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over £500 million. When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund {{some or all of}} the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants will lose the money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> bill.|$|E
25|$|Low {{introductory}} {{credit card}} rates {{are limited to}} a fixed term, usually between 6 and 12 months, after which a higher rate is charged. As all credit cards charge fees and interest, some customers become so indebted to <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> provider that they are driven to bankruptcy. Some credit cards often levy a rate of 20 to 30 percent after a payment is missed. In other cases, a fixed charge is levied without change to the interest rate. In some cases universal default may apply: the high default rate is applied to a card in good standing by missing a payment on an unrelated account from the same provider. This {{can lead to a}} snowball effect in which the consumer is drowned by unexpectedly high interest rates. Further, most card holder agreements enable the issuer to arbitrarily raise the interest rate for any reason they see fit. First Premier Bank at one point offered a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate; however, they discontinued this card in February 2011 because of persistent defaults.|$|E

In a field study, we elicit individual time preferences with incentivized choice experiments, and match resulting time preference measures to individual credit reports and annual tax returns. The {{results indicate that}} present-biased individuals {{are more likely to}} have <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, and to have significantly higher amounts of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, controlling for disposable income, other socio-demographics, and credit constraints.

2500|$|... "Cake and Sodomy" [...] is {{the second}} track on the album. In 1990, Manson met a woman at a McDonald's {{restaurant}} in Fort Lauderdale who invited him to spend a weekend with her in New York City. Upon discovering that the girl was using her sister's ID because she {{was too young to}} work, Manson abandoned her, shortly after which he ran into two clubbers from South Florida. Manson spent the remainder of his stay in New York at the clubbers' hotel room, where he stumbled on public-access television cable television channels, which were [...] "a completely new phenomenon" [...] to him. Manson [...] "spent hours flipping through the station, watching Pat Robertson preach about society's evils and then ask people to call him with <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> number," [...] while [...] "on the other channel, a guy was greasing up his cock with Vaseline and asking people to call and give him <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> number." [...] This inspired Manson to grab the hotel notepad and begin penning the song's lyrics. Manson explains in his autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell that [...] "I had written other songs I thought were good, but [...] "Cake and Sodomy" [...] {{was more than just a}} good song. As an anthem for the hypocritical America slobbering on the tit of Christianity, it was a blueprint for our future message." ...|$|E
2500|$|Interest charges {{vary widely}} from card issuer to card issuer. Often, there are [...] "teaser" [...] rates {{in effect for}} initial periods of time (as low as zero percent for, say, six months), whereas regular rates can {{be as high as}} 40 percent. In the U.S. there is no federal limit on the {{interest}} or late fees credit card issuers can charge; the interest rates are set by the states, with some states such as South Dakota, having no ceiling on interest rates and fees, inviting some banks to establish <b>their</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> operations there. Other states, for example Delaware, have very weak usury laws. The teaser rate no longer applies if the customer does not pay their bills on time, and is replaced by a penalty interest rate (for example, 23.99%) that applies retroactively.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{allegations}} is that during the 2011 election campaign, Cameron Slater and Jason Ede took advantage of a badly-configured website to enter the database of the Labour Party website.
