60|$|And {{in their}} just acclamations at the happy {{accession}} of his present majesty to the throne, I cannot but advise {{them to look}} back and call to mind who it was that first guided them to the family of Hanover, and to pass by all the popish branches of Orleans and Savoy; recognising the just authority of parliament in the undoubted right of limiting the succession, and establishing that glorious maxim of our settlement, viz., that it is inconsistent with the constitution of this protestant kingdom to be governed by a popish prince. I say, let them call to mind who it was that guided their thoughts first to the protestant race of our own kings in the house of Hanover; and that it is to king William, next to Heaven itself, to whom we owe the enjoying a protestant king at this time. I need not go back to the particulars of his majesty's conduct in that affair; his journey in person to the country of Hanover and the court of Zell; his particular management of the affair afterwards at home, perfecting the design by naming the illustrious family to the nation, and bringing about a parliamentary settlement to effect it; entailing the crown thereby in so effectual a manner as we see has been sufficient to prevent the worst designs of our Jacobite people in behalf of the pretender; a settlement, together with <b>the</b> <b>subsequent</b> <b>acts</b> which followed it, and the Union with Scotland, which made it unalterable, that gave a complete satisfaction to those who knew and understood it, and removed those terrible apprehensions of the pretender (which some entertained) from the minds of others, who were yet as zealous against him as it was possible for any to be. Upon this settlement, as I shall show presently, I grounded my opinion, which I often expressed, viz., that I did not see it possible the Jacobites could ever set up their idol here, and I think my opinion abundantly justified in the consequences; of which by and by.|$|E

The dissents by Curtis and McLean also attacked the Court's overturning of the Missouri Compromise on its merits, noting both that it was not necessary to decide the question, and also that none {{of the authors of the}} Constitution had ever objected on constitutional grounds to the United States Congress' adoption of the antislavery provisions of the Northwest Ordinance passed by the Continental Congress, or <b>the</b> <b>subsequent</b> <b>acts</b> that barred slavery north of 36°30' N.|$|E

He obtained copies of the 1:10,000 Ordnance Survey maps and organised his teams to mark up, in colour, the rights of way onto hundreds of maps, and he ensured that they were constantly kept up to date as new footpaths were registered. His maps and his files, one for each of over 200 parishes in Gloucestershire, were transferred to Gloucestershire County Council Archives, according to his wishes, just one week before he died.|$|E

In the different acts there is some variation in the purposes for which the grants were made. The early acts usually made the appropriation for roads and canals; acts after 1836 made the proceeds available for roads and internal improvements; and the act for Nevada (1864) applied it to roads and irrigation ditches. Beginning with the four States admitted in 1889, the proceeds of this 5 per cent grant have been granted as a permanent fund for the support of common schools. [...] Between 1802 and 1860, inclusive, this method of revenue sharing returned $5.4 million to the states; by 1887 the amounts accruing to the various States for the proceeds of the cash sales of public lands aggregated $7,123,550.|$|E
