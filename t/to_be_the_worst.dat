5|$|The 1976 NFL Draft was {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> draft class in many years, with only eight high-quality prospects, {{as compared to}} the normal 27 or 28. The popularity of the wishbone offense among college teams left the draft devoid of quarterback prospects. A drawing held the previous December gave the Buccaneers the rights to the first overall selection.|$|E
5|$|Figures from WRAP {{revealed}} {{the most efficient}} method of collecting food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis. A mixed fortnightly collection was shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste. A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E

5|$|In June2011, {{a federal}} {{document}} detailing the actions made by province officials was released to be public and incited further outcry from residents {{affected by the}} storm. The main complaint raised {{was related to the}} delay in accepting federal aid despite the severity of the damage. In an email sent on September21, 2010, Denys Doiron, the nation's Emergency Preparedness and Response Officer, relayed that local emergency services reported Igor <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> disaster they have had to deal with. Doiron also stated that no requests for federal aid were made.|$|E
5|$|In Mananjary {{where the}} cyclone moved ashore, Alibera {{produced}} gusts of 250km/h (150mph). There, nearly every building was damaged or destroyed, including hospitals, government offices, and schools. About 80% of houses were destroyed. The cyclone {{shut down the}} city's water system, disrupted access to the ocean, cut communications, and blocked or damaged most roads. There were 15deaths in Mananjary alone. The storm damage in Mananjary prevented ships from delivering supplies. Residents in the region considered the storm <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> since 1925.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1957–58 season, Craig was made captain for Australia's Test tour to South Africa, making him the {{youngest}} captain in Test history at the age of 22years and 194days, with Harvey as his deputy. The appointment came despite his mixed batting form during the New Zealand tour. The selectors further demonstrated their view to the future when they dropped veteran Ray Lindwall altogether. The average age of Craig's team was {{two and a half years}} younger than the Australian squad sent to England in 1956, and they had only one player over the age of 30, whereas the 1956 team had five members over the age of 30. As a result of the team's relative inexperience, they were judged by critics <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> to have left Australian shores. Craig joined his team in Johannesburg after flying in from London, where he had been working for six months as a pharmacist, with the approval of the Australian board.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two months after he had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, {{destroying}} Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a fire had burned {{in the city of}} Rome for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> the city had ever endured. To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Amy caused {{at least}} an {{estimated}} $30million in damage throughout the central Philippines. However, {{the total number of}} fatalities directly associated with the effects of the typhoon remain disputed, and may range anywhere from 569 to 991, making Amy one of the deadliest typhoons to strike the island nation in recorded history. An additional 50,000people were rendered homeless by the storm. The typhoon was characterized by the Philippine weather bureau <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> typhoon to strike the Philippines in at least 70years. In the aftermath of Amy, then-president of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino declared a state of public calamity for eleven central Philippine provinces including the island of Camiguin, which was heavily affected by both the typhoon and Mount Hibok-Hibok. On December24, the American Red Cross granted $25,000to the Philippine Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} severe hurricane in Georgia since 1752, causing over 500deaths and at least $1.6million (1804USD) in damage throughout the Southeastern United States. Originating near Antigua on 3September, it initially drifted west-northwestward, soon nearing Puerto Rico. Throughout its existence in the Caribbean Sea, the hurricane damaged, destroyed, and capsized numerous ships, and at Saint Kitts, it was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> since 1772. By 4September, the storm arrived at the Bahamas and turned northward before approaching the coast of northern Florida on 6September. The hurricane eventually came ashore along the coastline of Georgia and South Carolina while producing mostly southeasterly winds. A severe gale was noted in New England later that month, on 11and 12September, although it was likely not the same system as that which had passed through the Caribbean and southeastern United States earlier that month.|$|E

5|$|The {{value of}} all {{consumer}} goods manufactured in 1972 in retail prices was about 118 billion rubles ($530 billion). The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, is considered by several economists <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> financial crisis in the Soviet Union. It was triggered by the Nixon Shock, over-centralisation and a conservative state bureaucracy. As the economy grew, the volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. As a result, labour productivity decreased nationwide. The cumbersome procedures of bureaucratic administration did not allow for the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level to deal with worker alienation, innovation, customers and suppliers. The late Brezhnev Era also saw an increase in political corruption. Data falsification became common practice among bureaucrats to report satisfied targets and quotas to the government, and this further aggravated the crisis in planning.|$|E
5|$|While the {{hurricane}} {{was over the}} open ocean, it produced large swells that caused the deaths of three people two in the Caribbean {{and one in the}} United States. As it passed west of Bermuda as a minimal hurricane, damage was limited primarily to trees and power lines, with roughly 27,500residences losing electricity. Total losses in the territory were less than US$500,000. However, in Newfoundland, Igor wrought extreme damage, claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> ever seen in some areas. Large stretches of roadways were completely washed out by flooding, including a portion of the Trans-Canada Highway, isolating approximately 150communities. Throughout the region, one person was killed and damage costs amounted to a record C$200million. In the storm's wake, military personnel were deployed to assist in recovery efforts and aid distribution.|$|E
5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 is said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, {{there is a strong}} chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one can convert a hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits on a pair of eights, he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E

5|$|In Charleston, South Carolina, the {{hurricane}} washed aground several ships and uprooted numerous trees, though {{damage to the}} city harbor was minimal. The lighthouse on North Island flanking Winyah Bay collapsed under high winds, and in Georgetown proper, {{the hurricane}} was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> since the 1804 Antigua–Charleston hurricane, despite its storm surge being of a lesser size. A cotton field covering 94acres was ruined nearby. At Smithville, North Carolina, numerous ships experienced damage, while considerable destruction to structures was observed, with many wharves wrecked. Meanwhile, at Wilmington, the hurricane inflicted widespread damage, with many wharves severely damaged, and significant losses sustained by salt, sugar, rice, and lumber industries. The gable sections of three masonry houses were destroyed by wind or water, and wooden houses suffered especially badly, with many obliterated and those under construction flattened. One individual died after a wall collapsed and several slaves were killed, one by drowning, at local plantations. At Bald Head Island, the United States Revenue Cutter Service vessel Governor Williams was stripped of its foremast and subsequently ran ashore before being repaired and continuing on its journey. A second boat owned by the agency, the Diligence, was tethered at port in Wilmington and endured no damage; similarly, little impact occurred at New Bern. Throughout the storm, several vessels and supplies of stranded sailors were driven aground along the North Carolinan coast. On the Bogue Banks, {{the remains of the}} Adolphus and Atlantic were discovered, and at the Core Banks, a dead body was washed ashore, partially eaten by fish.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, Prinz Adalbert {{served as}} a gunnery {{training}} ship, a role she held {{for the majority of}} her career. She trained with the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet), later renamed the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet), throughout the early 1900s, and she made several visits to foreign countries. After the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, she was assigned to the reconnaissance forces in the Baltic and was tasked with protecting the German coast from Russian attacks. After her sister ship was sunk in November 1914, she became the flagship of the cruiser squadron in the Baltic. She conducted operations against Russian forces, including bombarding the port of Libau in support of the German Army. She was torpedoed by a British submarine in July 1915, but was able to return to port and was repaired. She was torpedoed a second time on 23 October 1915; the torpedo detonated her ammunition magazines and destroyed the ship. She sank quickly with heavy loss of life; only three men were rescued from a crew of 675. This proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> German naval disaster in the Baltic during the war.|$|E
5|$|Spawned by {{a weather}} system that had {{originated}} in Kansas, an EF-4 tornado slammed into Harrisburg {{early on the}} morning of February 29, 2012. The tornado touched down just north of Carrier Mills at 4:51a.m., destroyed a church and damaged houses along Town Park Road, and then traveled ENE through the Harrisburg Coal Field just north of Ledford, and then went through Liberty, where it damaged Harrisburg Middle School. The tornado then reached the south-western edge of the city at 4:56a.m., specifically Dorrisville, which suffered significant property damage, and then churned eastward to Gaskins City which was nearly leveled; 7 people were confirmed dead in that area, most killed in an apartment complex that was crushed by another residence, and 110 were injured overall. On June 3, another victim died in the hospital from their injuries, raising the death toll to 8. Harrisburg Medical Center was also significantly damaged in Gaskins City. Peak winds were estimated to have been about 180mph, and the width of the tornado path was 275 yards, traveling 26.5 miles. In Harrisburg, more than 200 houses, and about 25 businesses were destroyed or damaged heavily. At least 10 houses and other buildings were leveled completely, and several structures were displaced from their foundations. Early estimates indicated nearly 40% of the city was damaged or destroyed. The following night, a mandatory curfew was enforced in the effected areas, from 6 p.m. through 6 a.m. Counting the damage and death toll, it was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> storm since the Joplin, Missouri tornado. Harrisburg Unit 3 schools were closed until March 5, 2012, and later they offered trauma counseling to students after reopening.|$|E
