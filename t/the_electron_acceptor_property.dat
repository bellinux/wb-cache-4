40|$|Cobalt is an {{essential}} trace element with {{a broad range of}} physiological and biochemical functions. However, biochemical speciation of cobalt and structural investigations of cobalt-containing complexes with biomacromolecules are challenging, as the participation of cobalt in physiological processes is limited by its very low concentrations. Emission Mössbauer spectroscopy (EMS), with the radioactive 57 Co isotope as the most widely used nuclide, is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than its 57 Fe absorption variant which has had a rich history of applications in bioscience. Nevertheless, owing to specific difficulties related to the necessity of using radioactive 57 Co in samples under study, applications of EMS in biological fields have so far been sparse. In this communication, the EMS applicability to studying biological objects as well as some specific aspects of the EMS methodology are considered in order {{to draw attention to the}} unique structural information which can be obtained non-destructively in situ. Chemical consequences (after-effects) of the nuclear transition (57 Co / 57 Fe), which provide additional information on <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> <b>properties</b> of <b>the</b> proximate chemical microenvironment of the metal ions, are also considered.

40|$|Two sets of [6 - 6]-closed and [6 - 5]-open isomers, namely, {{those of}} a methano- and iminofullerene series, are probed {{in light of their}} excited state and <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> <b>properties.</b> Steady-state emission, fluorescence, and {{phosphorescence}} indicate that the excited-state energy levels of the [6 - 5]-open (2) and [6 - 6]-closed (1) iminofullerene isomers follow a seemingly surprising, reverse trend relative to the [6 - 5]-open (4) and [6 - 6]-closed (3) methanofullerene isomers. Specifically, the [6 - 5]-open iminofullerene (2) reveals almost identical characteristics to that of the [6 - 6]-closed methanofullerene (3). On the other hand the [6 - 6]-closed iminofullerene (1) is observed to resemble the [6 - 5]-open methanofullerene (4). Transient absorption spectra, i. e., singlet-singlet, triplet-triplet, and pi-radical anion absorption are in accord with the emission studies. These effects have been rationalized in terms of an efficient engagement between <b>the</b> nitrogen <b>electron</b> pair and <b>the</b> fullerene ct-system. The [6 - 5]-open methanofullerene (4) is, therefore, considered to be a true isoelectronic analogue of pristine C- 60 (60 pi-electrons). Although the [6 - 6]-closed iminofullerene (1), constitutes a quasi 60 ct-electron system, it appears to bear only a weak resemblance with the former two.

We have synthesized a series of chlorophosphines utilizing homo- and heteroleptic (dianionic) guanidinates and have completed a comprehensive study of their reactivity. Most notable is the reluctancy of these four-membered rings to form the corresponding N-heterocyclic phosphenium cations, the tendency to chemically and thermally eliminate carbodiimide, and the scarcely observed ring expansion by insertion of a chloro(imino) phosphine into a P–N bond of the P–N–C–N framework.

40|$|The DNA-binding {{mechanism}} of small organic molecules, such as DNA-targeted drugs and fluorescent nuclear dyes, {{is key to}} their performance. Therefore, understanding the DNA-binding mechanism is critical for the design and development of molecules targeted at DNA. The purpose of this present research is to investigate the DNA-binding interactions of small organic molecules by employing ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopy. While basic design principles are proposed, the DNA-binding modes of many small organic molecules cannot be unambiguously assigned based either on their structure, or {{through the use of}} many well-established spectroscopic techniques. A new methodology utilizing two-photon spectroscopy was developed to determine the DNA-binding modes of small organic molecules definitively, contrarily to other well-established spectroscopic techniques. The impact of this work is imbedded with the ultrafast nonlinear spectroscopic studies of the DNA-binding interactions of small organic molecules. The newly developed methodology demonstrated superior sensitivity at both low drug and DNA concentrations by more than order of magnitude in comparison to circular dichroism (CD). This indicates that our approach can be used to probe DNA-drug interactions at biologically relevant conditions, which is critical in drug research and development. The impact of this work also investigated the DNA-binding interactions of newly synthesized fluorescent nuclear dyes. This study has led to the emergence of structure-property relationships of DNA-binding molecules that adopt a crescent or V-shaped scaffold. The findings reveal that the structure of these fluorophores can be designed to either intercalate or groove bind with DNA by structurally modifying <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> <b>properties</b> of <b>the</b> central heterocyclic core. This is important because it allows the performance, specificity, and localization of a DNA-binding molecule to be controlled.

40|$|Starting {{with the}} triboelectrical charge of one-component plastics, the {{relation}} between the charge behavior and surface properties is investigated. The charge behavior of a two-component and a multi-component mixture is calculated. Furthermore the influence of water on the movability of charge carriers, charge kinetics, influence of the air humidity on the charge process are investigated. All these investigations are carried out at polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(1 -butene), poly(4 -methyl- 1 -pentene), polyamide 12 (PA), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyoxymethylene (POM) and poly(methyl metacrylate) (PMMA). These plastics are charged in a fluidized bed at specific conditions and separated in an electrostatic freefall separator. The surface of these polymers is characterized concerning the chemical composition, adsorption of steam, behavior of charges on the surface, lewis acid/base properties and specific surface resistance. The chemical composition of the plastics surfaces corresponds to the structure formula except for PVC. In PVC, a tin stabilizer and oxygen are established. PA, POM and PMMA adsorb more water than the other polymers. The formation of an aqueous swelling layer is observed. PS shows a precipitous rise of the thickness layer of adsorbed water according to the formation of droplets of the water film. The surface of PS shows transitory stabile, positive and negative charged domains of carriers whose distribution does not depend from the topography. The surface of <b>the</b> polymers shows <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> <b>properties</b> and <b>electron</b> donator properties. <b>The</b> surface resistance of the plastics are greater than the literature values. Unpolar polymers do not charge up, while polar polymers are distinguished by a characteristic bipolar charge due to the existence of positively and negatively charged domains lying {{side by side on the}} polymer surface. The charge rate of the polymers correspond to the parameters of the lewis acid/base polarity. Polymers with a high <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> or <b>electron</b> donator performance show a faster charge process. With increasing air humidity, the surface charge density decreases to those polymers which adsorb a great amount of water due to the aqueous swelling layers. One exception is POM which shows no dependance of the surface charge density from the relative air humidity. Due to the significant correlation between the specific surface resistance and surface charge density at low relative air humidity, the polymers with low surface resistance triboelectrically charge up in a stronger matter. There is no dependence between the charge height of the polymers and the contacting metals. With increasing air humidity, a decrease of the charge height of the polymers are observed with respect to the polymer/metal contact. The charge behaviour of the polymers in mixtures contain a polar polymer which determines the polarity of the residual compounds.
