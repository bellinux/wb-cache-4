40|$|Reduction {{in total}} lung {{capacity}} (TLC) in obese men is associated with restricted expansion of the thoracic cavity at full inflation. We hypothesized that thoracic expansion was reduced by the load imposed by increased total <b>trunk</b> fat <b>volume</b> or its distribution. Using MRI, we measured internal and subcutaneous trunk fat and total abdominal and thoracic volumes at full inflation in 14 obese men [mean age: 52. 4 yr, body mass index (BMI) : 38. 8 (range: 36 – 44) kg/m 2] and 7 control men [mean age: 50. 1 yr, BMI: 25. 0 (range: 22 – 27. 5) kg/m 2]. TLC was measured by multibreath helium dilution and was restricted (< 80 % of the predicted value) in six obese men (the OR subgroup). All measurements were made with subjects in the supine position. Mean total <b>trunk</b> fat <b>volume</b> was 16. 65 (range: 12. 6 – 21. 8) liters in obese men and 6. 98 (range: 3. 0 – 10. 8) liters in control men. Anthropometry and mean total <b>trunk</b> fat <b>volumes</b> were similar in OR men and obese men without restriction (the ON subgroup). Mean total intraabdominal volume was 9. 41 liters in OR men and 11. 15 liters in ON men. In obese men, reduced thoracic expansion at full inflation and restriction of TLC were not inversely related to a large volume of 1) intra-abdominal or total abdominal fat, 2) subcutaneous fat volume around the thorax, or 3) total <b>trunk</b> fat <b>volume.</b> In addition, <b>trunk</b> fat <b>volumes</b> in obese men were not inversely related to gas volume or estimated intrathoracic volume at supine functional residual capacity.

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of vegetation structure {{are important for}} {{a large number of}} applications including ecological modeling and carbon budgets. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measures the three-dimensional structure of vegetation using laser beams. Most LiDAR applications today rely on airborne platforms for data acquisitions, which typically record between 1 and 5 “discrete” returns for each outgoing laser pulse. Although airborne LiDAR allows sampling of canopy characteristics at stand and landscape level scales, this method is largely insensitive to below canopy biomass, such as understorey and <b>trunk</b> <b>volumes,</b> as these elements are often occluded by the upper parts of the crown, especially in denser canopies. As a supplement to airborne laser scanning (ALS), a number of recent studies used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for the biomass estimation in spatially confined areas. One such instrument is the Echidna® Validation Instrument (EVI), which is configured to fully digitize the returned energy of an emitted laser pulse to establish a complete profile of the observed vegetation elements. In this study we assess and compare a number of canopy metrics derived from airborne and TLS. Three different experiments were conducted using discrete return ALS data and discrete and full waveform observations derived from the EVI. Although considerable differences were found in the return distribution of both systems, ALS and TLS were both able to accurately determine canopy height (? height r 2 > 0. 90, p < 0. 01). When using more spatially explicit approaches for modeling the biomass and volume throughout the stands, the differences between ALS and TLS observations were more distinct; however, predictable patterns exist based on sensor position and configuration...|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Forest, Watershed & Wildland Sciences, 2015 While tree-level {{productivity}} is largely determined by crown size and aboveground vigor (i. e., independent dimensions of tree structure), light availability ultimately controls growth rate. Competition indices are typically used in modeling instead of actual measurements of light. Our goals were {{to determine which}} measure of light best predicts trunk growth of Sequoia sempervirens, quantify the amount of growth variation explained by light after accounting for effects of tree structure, and to compare model fitness of competition indices. Twenty-four trees spanning {{a wide range of}} light environments were randomly selected from stands of different ages, including trees 24 ??? 71 m tall and 20 ??? 560 years old. Tree structure and growth were quantified via intensive measurements of each tree???s main trunk and appendages. Light availability was quantified via hemispherical photographs taken throughout the crown of each tree. Competition indices were computed by measuring the size and distribution of neighboring trees. After accounting for effects of tree structure, light explained an additional 10 % of variation in <b>trunk</b> wood <b>volume</b> increment. Light alone explained 49 % of the variation in <b>trunk</b> wood <b>volume</b> increment, while size alone explained 41 %. The growth model with average mid-crown openness as a measure of light was 19 times more likely than the model without a light variable. The best competition index was 1200 times more likely than the next best competition index.

He accurately estimated forest productivity responses to increasing soil nitrogen using a large amount of data, studied structural, species composition, and density changes that occur in young mixed stands after tending felling, revealed stand productivity dependence on stand density, and showed how structure and dynamics of forest generations are manifested through vegetation succession. Along with studies of natural ecosystems, Alexey I. Buzykin did large-scale experiments on managing forest ecosystems by different types of sanitary cutting, application of fertilizers to soil, regulation of cold soil thermal regime, and by establishment of Scots pine, spruce and larch plantations covering a range of stand densities. To achieve his forest management objectives, he developed original forest research methods, among them methodologies to assess seedling and sapling amounts, to estimate forest response to fertilizer application, and to classify young forest stands by formation type. He also developed tables of small-sized young tree <b>trunk</b> <b>volumes.</b> During his last years, Alexey I.

He suggested that mathematical tools should be used for interpreting different kinds of events and changes occurring in forest ecosystems including the use of phenomenological models of stand establishment processes, stand growth models, forest succession models, and other models.
