5|$|A second {{attempt to}} revive the plan arose from <b>talks</b> <b>between</b> Kinkel and French foreign {{minister}} Hervé de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing zones of separation to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees {{for the safety of}} Croatian Serbs and implementating confidence-building measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E

In November, Wałęsa debated on national TV Alfred Miodowicz, chief of the official trade unions. The encounter enhanced Wałęsa's image.|$|E

5|$|Dutton was {{the subject}} of trade <b>talks</b> <b>between</b> the Maroons and the Chicago Black Hawks {{following}} the 1928–29 NHL season. The teams had been negotiating to send Cyclone Wentworth to Montreal in exchange for Dutton and Babe Siebert before the Black Hawks purchased the contract of Taffy Abel, which ended the Hawks pursuit of Dutton. The Maroons continued to make him available, with the Toronto Maple Leafs showing interest following the 1929–30 season. Finally, he was sold to the New York Americans along with Mike Neville, Hap Emms and Frank Carson for $35,000.|$|E

5|$|One final attempt, {{organised}} by Babić, {{was made}} to revive the Z-4 Plan on 16 August. This initiative called for negotiating each point of the plan and extending the autonomous areas to eastern Slavonia.

When they consulted Šarinić about the initiative, he dismissed any possibility of negotiation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Talks</b> <b>between</b> Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs over renewal {{terms for}} the highly lucrative Pixar-Disney {{distribution}} deal {{broke down in}} January 2004.

To that end, Disney announced the launching of Circle 7 Animation, a division of Feature Animation which would have produced sequels to the Pixar films, while Pixar began shopping for a new distribution deal.|$|E

5|$|At the election, Labour lost 91 {{seats in}} the House of Commons, but the Conservatives failed to achieve an overall majority, {{resulting}} in the first hung parliament since 1974. Under the constitution governing {{what happens in the}} event of a hung parliament, Brown remained temporarily as Prime Minister, while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives entered into talks aimed at forming a coalition government. <b>Talks</b> <b>between</b> the Liberal Democrats and Labour also took place. On 10 May, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the Labour Party and instructed the party to initiate the election of a new leader. Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen an obstacle to the negotiation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. By 11 May, the possibility of a deal was becoming less likely as <b>talks</b> <b>between</b> the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued. After a telephone conversation with his predecessor Tony Blair where Blair informed Brown that the election had shown that the British voters had lost faith in both him and the Labour Party and that the United Kingdom would not accept him continuing as Prime Minister. With this he concluded that he would not be able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister. He also resigned as leader of the Labour Party with immediate effect. Brown was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, while Harriet Harman became acting leader of the Labour Party.|$|E

Genyo Takeda was dispatched to Japan to advise then-president of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi on securing a deal with Rare. Following <b>talks</b> <b>between</b> Yamauchi and Rare staff, Nintendo acquired 49% of the company, which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI technology and the addition of Rare as a second-party developer. The Stampers expressed interest in making a game based on Donkey Kong and were given Nintendo's permission.|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil War, in which the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite <b>talks</b> <b>between</b> the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola.

The point was lost on the grim Duke of Alba, however. His letters reveal his frustration that Catherine’s spectacles kept interrupting the serious business of discussing how to make war on the Protestants. In the end, the Spanish decided the whole meeting been a waste of time, since Catherine had refused to change her policy towards the Huguenots in the slightest. The Huguenots, however, believed that their banishment from the <b>talks</b> <b>between</b> the two negotiating teams meant that Catherine had struck a secret deal with the Spanish to persecute them.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, the Scottish Government {{refused to}} pay for {{concessionary}} travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. <b>Talks</b> <b>between</b> the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but {{that they should be}} paid for by the Council instead of the Government. It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them. This compromise upset many people in the Lothians, who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.|$|E
