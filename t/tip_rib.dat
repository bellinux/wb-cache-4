40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe stress {{level in the}} milled skin {{at the root of}} a tapered, multicell swept wing is predicted by means of a matrix-force method. The solution is achieved by minimizing the internal strain energy, and the results compared with experimental tests. A single loading, consisting of a nose-up couple, is applied to each <b>tip</b> <b>rib.</b> The loading is transferred from the <b>tip</b> <b>rib</b> to an idealized structure by means of simple torsion theory. The idealized structure represents the inboard one-half of each semi-span. Results indicate that an accurate solution of the stress distribution in the actual wing can be achieved provided that the root boundary conditions are preserved. An extension of the analysis is suggested in order to more closely define the maximum accuracy inherent in the particular matrix-force method of solution.

The box structure extends from the fuselage production joint to the <b>tip</b> <b>rib</b> and includes {{the front and rear}} spars. Various design options were evaluated to arrive at a configuration which would offer the highest potential for satisfying program objectives. The preferred configuration selected consists of a hat-stiffened cover with molded integrally stiffened spars, aluminum trussed composite ribs, and composite miniwich web ribs with integrally molded caps. Material screening tests were performed to select an advanced composite material system for the Advanced Composite Vertical Fin (ACFV) that would meet the program requirements from the standpoint of quality, reproducibility, and cost. Preliminary weight and cost analysis were made, targets established, and tracking plans developed. These include FAA certification, ancillary test program, quality control, and structural integrity control plans...|$|E

The empennage component selected for this program is the vertical fin box of the L- 1011 aircraft. The box structure extends from the fuselage production joint to the <b>tip</b> <b>rib</b> and includes front and rear spars. During Phase 4 of the program, production quality tooling was designed and manufactured to produce three sets of covers, ribs, spars, miscellaneous parts, and subassemblies to assemble three complete ACVF units. Recurring and nonrecurring cost data were compiled and documented in the updated producibility/design to cost plan. Nondestruct inspections, quality control tests, and quality acceptance tests were performed in accordance with the quality assurance plan and the structural integrity control plan.

50|$|<b>Rib</b> <b>tip</b> {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} pain along the costal margin and is caused by hypermobility of the eighth, ninth and tenth ribs. These ribs do not articulate with the sternum but instead are bound to each other by a thin band of fibrous tissue. If this fibrous attachment becomes divided, the rib(s) may ride up and irritate the intercostal nerve(s) causing pain. Clinically the patient may be aware of a snapping or clicking sensation as the ribs move relative to one another. The clinician can reproduce the symptoms by hooking his or her fingers under the costal margin and pulling upwards. Relief can be provided by anesthetizing the relevant intercostal nerve with local anesthetic. If symptoms persist, <b>rib</b> <b>tip</b> resection may be necessary.|$|R

40|$|Recently, new {{processes}} to produce enhanced boiling surfaces have been developed. Those are extrusion, {{a combination of}} extrusion and chipping, mechanical rolling, hydraulic expansion, and sintering of metal powder, all of which involve complex operations and high production costs. Grooved rolling is introduced as a simple process to form enhanced boiling surfaces. First, the deformation caused by grooved rolling was analysed by applying a visioplasticity method with plasticine model rolling. Characteristic deformations using the grooved rolling technique occur {{in the form of}} a continuous indentation by the teeth of the grooved roll to the surface of a plane sheet or strip, deformation is mainly confined to the region between the teeth of the upper grooved roll and lower flat roll, plastic flow of the work occurs mainly in a longitudinally and the <b>tips</b> of <b>rib</b> projections formed by grooved rolling are rounded. Second, grooved rolling of thin aluminum and copper strips was examined and it was found that 1 mm pitch grooves can be formed on the strip surfaces successfully. Finally, three-stand tandem mill, by which longitudinal grooving, additional 45 degree cross grooving, and flattening and trimming of the rounded <b>tips</b> of the <b>rib</b> projections could be performed, was introduced as a test system, and some examples of products were obtained by the system. ...|$|R

50|$|Galileo high-gain antenna {{failed to}} fully deploy after its first flyby of Earth. The antenna had 18 ribs, like an {{umbrella}} {{and when the}} driver motor started and {{put pressure on the}} ribs, they were supposed to pop out of the cup their tips were held in. Only 15 popped out, leaving the antenna looking like a lop-sided, half-open umbrella. Investigators concluded that during the 4.5 years that Galileo spent in storage after the 1986 Challenger disaster, the lubricants between the <b>tips</b> of the <b>ribs</b> and the cup were eroded and worn away from vibration during three cross-country journeys by truck between California and Florida for the spacecraft. The failed ribs were those closest to the flat-bed trailers carrying Galileo on these trips, which were used instead of air transport to cut costs.

2500|$|Flight {{described}} the L.71 as a flying boat on wheels because, in the 1920s, such aircraft were almost the only modern pusher biplanes. Visually, {{the most unusual}} feature was the extreme stagger, introduced to optimise the view {{for each of the}} occupants of its tandem cockpits. [...] Both wings had spruce spars, continuous from tip to <b>tip,</b> and spruce <b>ribs.</b> The larger upper wing had no dihedral but carried the ailerons; the lower wing had 1.5° of dihedral. Outward leaning, aluminium tube N-form interplane struts braced the wings but there was none of the usual flying wire bracing in the single bay; the wings were aerodynamically quite thick, allowing them to be internally braced cantilevers. The upper wing centre section was supported by a shorter pair of outward leaning N struts from the upper fuselage. Though the lower plane was set at mid-fuselage the interplane gap was large, to provide clearance for the two blade propeller.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1979, Morry Hummel, {{who worked in the}} Curtis Wright {{experimental}} department during World War II, purchased the plans for Gary Watson’s Windwagon and the development of the [...] "Hummel Bird" [...] began. Because of the weather in Hummel's state of Ohio, a canopy was needed. The horizontal stabilizer attach construction was redesigned. The seat back was raised 5 inches so a shoulder harness could be added, and the instrument panel was raised 2 inches, increasing fuel capacity and leg room. The wing was completely re-engineered. The dihedral break on the Windwagon was in the middle; Morry made the center wing section straight and put the dihedral break {{at the point where the}} outer wing panels bolt to the center section. The Hummel Bird spar is built up of 1/8 6061-t6 aluminum angle spar caps, with a [...]040, 2024-t3 spar web. The spar cap angles are doubled in the center section, and tapered in the outer panels. The number of ribs was increased, the thickness of the skin was reduced, and the skins get even thinner toward the <b>tips.</b> The <b>ribs</b> are now a two piece design with one in front of the spar(nose rib) and one between the spars(main rib). The skins are riveted to the spars leaving no bump where the one piece ribs previously pushed the skin up where it crossed the spar. Both the Teenie Two and the Windwagon had tricycle landing gear, however, Morry preferred conventional landing gear so taildragger gear became a popular option. There were other changes as well, compromising a significant improvement over the wind wagon. He finished his project in July 1980. In July 1982, the plane was featured in an article written by Jack Cox, of Sport Aviation. Jack dubbed Morry’s new creation the “Hummel Bird” and the name stuck.|$|R
