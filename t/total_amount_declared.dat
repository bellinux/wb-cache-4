40|$|Under {{conditions}} of market equilibrium, {{the distribution of}} capital income follows a Pareto power law, with an exponent that characterizes the given equilibrium. Here, a simple taxation scheme is proposed such that the post-tax capital income distribution remains an equilibrium distribution, albeit with a different exponent. This taxation scheme is shown to be progressive, and its parameters can be simply derived from (i) the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of tax that will be levied, (ii) the threshold selected above which capital income will be taxed and (iii) the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of capital income. The latter can be obtained either by using Piketty's estimates of the capital/labor income ratio or by fitting the initial Pareto exponent. Both ways moreover provide {{a check on the}} <b>amount</b> of <b>declared</b> income from capital. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

30|$|CHO-DHFR {{cells were}} grown in fed-batch {{cultures}} {{over a period}} of 12  days. First, we fixed the ratio of asparagine to glutamine at 1 : 1 and increased the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of them to find a suitable concentration (Table  1). Thus, the effect of ratio would not impact by the limitation of them either. Figure  2 a shows the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> profiles of antibody production and concentrations of lactate and ammonia. The antibody titer increased from 0.51  g/L with no asparagine and glutamine to 0.95  g/L with 90  mM asparagine and 90  mM glutamine. When the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> increased from 180  mM to 240  mM, the mAb titer was not increased significantly. But the concentration of lactate and ammonia was increased following the addition of <b>total</b> <b>amount.</b> Thus, we chose the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> at 180  mM. Then, we fixed the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> (180  mM) and changed the ratio.|$|R

An evaluation index system of the degree of harmony of <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> control of water use was established, and a method for calculation of the degree of harmony of <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> control of water use was developed based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy comprehensive analysis (FCA) methods.

40|$|To {{understand}} the relationship between lodging resistance and chemical component contents in culms and leaf sheaths of rice, the physical strength and maximum bearing capacity of culm, and the contents and amounts of potassium (K), silicon (Si) and soluble sugars in culms and leaf sheaths were investigated using four japonica rice varieties with different lodging resistance characteristics during grain filling. There were significant differences in the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of K, Si and soluble sugars in culms and leaf sheaths among the tested rice varieties. The difference in the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of Si was greater than that of K or soluble sugars. The physical strength and maximum bearing capacity of culm continuously decreased from heading to ripening, with a rapid decrease at the dough stage. However, the contents and <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of K and Si in culms and the Si content in leaf sheaths gradually increased and an accumulation of K and Si in culms was exhibited, whereas the content and <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of K and the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of Si in leaf sheaths gradually decreased and an exportation of K and Si in leaf sheaths was presented. The physical strength was positively and significantly correlated with the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of K and Si in culms during grain filling except that at the heading stage, the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of soluble sugars in culms at the heading and milky stages, the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of Si and soluble sugars in leaf sheaths at the heading stage, the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of K in leaf sheaths at the heading and milky stages, and the maximum bearing capacity during grain filling. It is suggested that the lodging resistance of japonica rice would be improved by increasing the amount of soluble sugars in plants at the early filling stage, and enhancing the amount of Si in plants during grain filling through topdressing Si fertilizer at the early filling stage...|$|R
