5|$|The P2Vs {{would be}} first augmented, and then replaced, {{by the more}} capable North American AJ Savage as they became available. These could take off and land on a carrier, {{carrying}} a Fat Man. On 21 August 1950, Hayward was at <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> the first carrier landing and takeoff of an AJ-1 Savage heavy attack bomber, on the Coral Sea with the Commander of Naval Air Forces Atlantic Fleet (COMAIRLANT), Vice Admiral Felix Stump, in the back seat. However, by mid-December VC-5 still only had six AJ-1s.|$|E
5|$|The RLM had {{acquired}} {{an interest in}} rocket boosters fitted {{for the sake of}} simplicity below the wings of a heavily loaded bomber to cut down the length of runway needed for takeoff. Once in the air the booster canisters would be jettisoned by parachute for reuse. The firm of Hellmuth Walter, at Kiel, handled this development. The first standing trials and tests flights of the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe liquid-fueled boosters were held in 1937 at Neuhardenberg with test pilot Erich Warsitz at <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> Heinkel He 111E bearing civil registration D-AMUE.|$|E
40|$|Issues {{important}} in rotorcraft flight control are discussed. A perceptual description is suggested {{of what is}} believed to be the major issues in flight <b>control.</b> When <b>the</b> task is considered <b>of</b> a pilot <b>controlling</b> a helicopter in flight, the task is decomposed in several subtasks. These subtasks include: (1) <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> altitude, (2) <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> speed, (3) <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> heading, (4) <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> orientation, (5) <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> flight over obstacles, and (6) <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> flight to specified positions in the world. The first four subtasks can be considered to be primary control tasks as they are not dependent on any other subtasks. However, the latter two subtasks can be considered hierarchical tasks as they are dependent on other subtasks. For example, <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> flight <b>control</b> over obstacles can be decomposed as a task requiring <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> speed, altitude, and heading. Thus, incorrect <b>control</b> <b>of</b> altitude should result in poor <b>control</b> <b>of</b> flight over an obstacle...|$|R

5|$|Twenty {{years after}} the Falklands {{conflict}} Bravo November saw service in Iraq, being the first British helicopter to land Royal Marines ashore. After departing from , Bravo November landed the first Royal Marines on to the Al-Faw peninsula to seize oil-pumping facilities before Iraqi troops could destroy them. The second DFC for actions at <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> Bravo November was awarded to Squadron Leader Steve Carr {{for his role in}} an operation in Iraq. Bravo November was tasked with delivering the Marines to the landing sites marked by US special forces before returning for more troops, guns and freight. The aircraft was being flown at an altitude of less than 100ft with restricted visibility due to dust clouds thrown up by American armoured forces.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a {{vehicular}} combat racing {{video game}} {{based on the}} sport of demolition derby. The game contains three vehicles. Collisions in the game affect <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> each car, limiting their steering and maximum speed. Frontal collisions risk damage to the car's radiator, which causes the car to overheat and stop running. Four game modes are available: Destruction Derby, Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing and Time Trial. In Destruction Derby, the player earns points by destroying other cars in a large, trackless arena called The Bowl; in Stock Car Racing, the player must finish in first place, and no points are awarded for destroying cars. Wreckin' Racing is a hybrid of the two, in which the player earns points both by winning the race and by destroying other cars. Time Trial is a solo time attack mode. The PlayStation version features system link play for two players, while the MS-DOS version has an online multiplayer mode.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> {{supervisory}} <b>control</b> problem <b>of</b> discrete event {{systems with}} temporal logic spec-ifications is studied.

5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of a PlayStation 2 version of Elite Force was announced in late 2000. Whereas the original version of Elite Force had been published by Activision and developed by Raven Software, the PlayStation 2 version was published by Majesco Entertainment and developed by their in-house studio, Pipe Dream Interactive. Elite Force {{was to be the}} second PlayStation 2 project undertaken by Majesco. The PlayStation 2 version of the game includes most of the same content as the computer version of the game, albeit that the game's graphics were simplified slightly for the console. Due to the lack of online support for the PlayStation 2, the port only allows for four players to compete in a multiplayer game. Pipe Dream paid particular attention to adjusting <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> the game to suit the PlayStation 2's gamepad, introducing an auto-aim feature to assist the player. The first screenshots of the game were released in March 2001, and the game was released on December 11, 2001.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In 2001, Urbani and Palmer {{published}} {{a review of}} the epidemiological situation of helminthiases in the countries of the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization indicating <b>the</b> <b>control</b> needs in <b>the</b> region. Six years after this inspiring article, large-scale preventive chemotherapy for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> helminthiasis has scaled up dramatically in the region. This paper analyzes the most recent {{published a}}nd unpublished country information on large-scale preventive chemotherapy and summarizes the progress made since 2000. Almost 39 million treatments were provided in 2006 in the region for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> helminthiasis: nearly 14 million for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> lymphatic filariasis, more than 22 million for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and over 2 million for <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> schistosomiasis.

25|$|According to Mason, <b>the</b> <b>controls</b> <b>of</b> the Vampire were {{considered}} to be relatively light and sensitive, employing an effective elevator arrangement that enabled generous acceleration from relatively little control inputs along with highly balanced ailerons that could achieve high rates of roll. In comparison to the elevator and ailerons, the rudder required more vigorous actuation in order to achieve meaningful effect. Pilots converting from piston-engined types would find themselves having to adapt to the slower acceleration of turbojet engines and the corresponding need to moderate rapid throttle movements to avoid instigating a compressor stall.|$|E
