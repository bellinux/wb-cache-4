40|$|Physiological {{leukocyte}} homing and extravasation of leukocytes during inflammatory processes {{is directed}} {{by a number of}} proteins including adhesion molecules, proteases, cytokines and chemokines. Tight regulation of leukocyte migration is essential to ensure appropriate migration. A number of mechanisms exist that regulate leukocyte migration including up- or down-regulation of chemokine or chemokine receptor gene expression. However, chemokine availability in vivo also depends on the interaction of chemokines with specific glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate on the surface of endothelial layers. Modification of the interaction of chemokines with these glycosaminoglycans alters the presentation of chemokines to chemokine receptors on circulating leukocytes. On <b>top,</b> <b>binding</b> of chemokines to atypical chemokine receptors that do not signal through G proteins affects chemokine availability on the endothelial layers. In addition to mechanisms that modulate chemokine availability, this review summarizes mechanisms that fine-tune chemokine function. These include synergy or antagonism between chemokines and alternative splicing of chemokine genes. Moreover, chemokines may be posttranslationally modified leading to molecules with enhanced or reduced potency to bind to G protein-coupled receptors or GAGs or generating chemokines with altered receptor specificity. Cross-talk between these different mechanisms generates a complex regulatory network that allows the organism to modulate leukocyte migration in a highly specific manner. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Understanding protein-DNA interactions, {{specifically}} {{transcription factor}} (TF) and transcription factor binding site (TFBS) bindings, {{is crucial in}} deciphering gene regulation. The recent associated TF-TFBS pattern discovery combines one-sided motif discovery on both the TF and the TFBS sides. Using sequences only, it identifies the short protein-DNA binding cores available only in high-resolution 3 D structures. The discovered patterns lead to promising subtype and disease analysis applications. While the related studies use either association rule mining or existing TFBS annotations, none has proposed any formal unified (both-sided) model to prioritize the top verifiable associated patterns. We propose the unified scores and develop an effective pipeline for associated TF-TFBS pattern discovery. Our stringent instance-level evaluations show that the patterns with the top unified scores match with the binding cores in 3 D structures considerably better than the previous works, where up to 90 percent of the top 20 scored patterns are verified. We also introduce extended verification from literature surveys, where the high unified scores correspond to even higher verification percentage. The top scored patterns are confirmed to match the known WRKY binding cores with no available 3 D structures and agree well with the <b>top</b> <b>binding</b> affinities of in vivo experiments.

40|$|A {{universal}} {{platform for}} efficiently mapping antibody epitopes {{would be of}} great use for many applications, ranging from antibody therapeutic development to vaccine design. Here we tested the feasibility of using a random peptide microarray to map antibody epitopes. Although peptide microarrays are physically constrained to ∼ 104 peptides per array, compared with 108 permitted in library panning approaches such as phage display, they enable a much more high though put and direct measure of binding. Long (20 mer) random sequence peptides were chosen for this study to look at an unbiased sampling of sequence space. This sampling of sequence space is sparse, as an exact epitope sequence is unlikely to appear. Commercial monoclonal antibodies with known linear epitopes or polyclonal antibodies raised against engineered 20 -mer peptides were used to evaluate this array as an epitope mapping platform. Remarkably, peptides with the most sequence similarity to known epitopes were only slightly {{more likely to be}} recognized by the antibody than other random peptides. We explored the ability of two methods singly and in combination to predict the actual epitope from the random sequence peptides bound. Though the epitopes were not directly evident, subtle motifs were found among the <b>top</b> <b>binding</b> peptides for each antibody. These motifs did have some predictive ability in searching for the known epitopes among a set of decoy sequences. The second approach using a windowing alignment strategy, was able to score known epitopes of monoclonal antibodies well within the test dataset, but did not perform as well on polyclonals. Random peptide microarrays of even limited diversity may serve as a useful tool to prioritize candidates for epitope mapping or antigen identification...|$|E

40|$|DNA topoisomerases are {{believed}} to promote transcription by removing excessive DNA supercoils produced during elongation. However, {{it is unclear how}} topoisomerases in eukaryotes are recruited and function in the transcription pathway in the context of nucleosomes. To address this problem we present high-resolution genome-wide maps of one of the major eukaryotic topoisomerases, Topoisomerase II (Top 2) and nucleosomes in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data indicate that at promoters Top 2 binds primarily to DNA that is nucleosome-free. However, although nucleosome loss enables Top 2 occupancy, the opposite is not the case and the loss of Top 2 has little effect on nucleosome density. We also find that Top 2 is involved in transcription. Not only is Top 2 enriched at highly transcribed genes, but Top 2 is required redundantly with Top 1 for optimal recruitment of RNA polymerase II at their promoters. These findings and the examination of candidate-activated genes suggest that nucleosome loss induced by nucleosome remodeling factors during gene activation enables <b>Top</b> 2 <b>binding,</b> which in turn acts redundantly with Top 1 to enhance recruitment of RNA polymerase II...|$|R
40|$|Topoisomerase 1, {{an enzyme}} that {{relieves}} superhelical tension, is implicated in transcription-associated mutagenesis and genome instability-associated with neurodegenerative diseases {{as well as}} activation-induced cytidine deaminase. From proteomic analysis of TOP 1 -associated proteins, we identify SMARCA 4, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller; FACT, a histone chaperone; and H 3 K 4 me 3, a transcriptionally active chromatin marker.

In contrast, FACT knockdown inhibits association of TOP 1 with H 3 K 4 me 3, and severely reduces DNA cleavage and Igh/c-Myc translocations, without significant effect on TOP 1 recruitment to chromatin.

40|$|Topoisomerases are {{essential}} for DNA replication in dividing cells, but their genomic targets and function in postmitotic cells remain poorly understood. Here we show that a switch in the expression from Topoisomerases II? (Top 2 ?) to II? (Top 2 ?) occurs during neuronal differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Genome-scale location analysis in stem cell-derived postmitotic neurons reveals <b>Top</b> 2 ? <b>binding</b> to chromosomal sites that are methylated at lysine 4 of histone H 3, a feature of regulatory regions. Indeed Top 2 ?-bound sites are preferentially promoters and become targets during the transition from neuronal progenitors to neurons, {{at a time when}} cells exit the cell cycle. Absence of Top 2 ? protein or its activity leads to changes in transcription and chromatin accessibility at many target genes. Top 2 ? deficiency does not impair stem cell properties and early steps of neuronal differentiation but causes premature death of postmitotic neurons. This neuronal degeneration is caused by up-regulation of Ngfr p 75, a gene bound and repressed by Top 2 ?. These findings suggest a chromatin-based targeting of Top 2 ? to regulatory regions in the genome to govern the transcriptional program associated with neuronal differentiation and longevity...|$|R

We examined the mechanism of topoisomerase I (Top 1) to understand the role of the unique chromatin structure in Bmal 1 gene regu-lation. Camptothecin, a Top 1 inhibitor, and Top 1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced Baml 1 tran-scription and lengthened its circadian period. Top 1 is located at an intermediate region between two ROREs that are critical cis-elements of circadian transcription and the profile of <b>Top</b> 1 <b>binding</b> indicated anti-phase circadian oscillation of Bmal 1 transcription. Promoter assays showed that the Top 1 -binding site is required for transcriptional sup-pression and that it functions cooperatively with the distal RORE, supporting that Bmal 1 transcription is upregulated by Top 1 inhibition. A DNA fragment between the ROREs, where the Top 1 -binding site is located, behaved like a right-handed superhelical twist, and modulation of Top 1 activity by camptothecin and Top 1 siRNA altered the footprint profile, indicating modulation of the chromatin structure.

40|$|BLM and WRN {{are members}} of the RecQ family of DNA helicases, and in humans their loss is {{associated}} with syndromes characterized by genome instability and cancer predisposition. As the only RecQ DNA helicase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sgs 1 is known to safeguard genome integrity through its role in DNA recombination. Interestingly, WRN, BLM and Sgs 1 are all known to be modified by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO), although the significance of this posttranslational modification remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that Sgs 1 is specifically sumoylated under the stress of DNA double strand breaks. The major SUMO attachment site in Sgs 1 is lysine 621, which lies between the <b>Top</b> 3 <b>binding</b> domain and the DNA helicase domain. Surprisingly, sumoylation of K 621 was found to be uniquely required for Sgs 1 ’s role in telomere–telomere recombination. In contrast, sumoylation was dispensable for Sgs 1 ’s roles in DNA damage tolerance, supppression of direct repeat and rDNA recombination, and promotion of top 3 Δ slow growth. Our results demonstrate that although modification by SUMO is a conserved feature of RecQ family DNA helicases, the major sites of modification are located on different domains of the protein in different organisms. We suggest that sumoylation of different domains of RecQ DNA helicases from different organisms contributes to conserved roles in regulating telomeric recombination...|$|R

40|$|The Sgs 1 protein of {{the budding}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is a member}} of the RecQ DNA helicase family that {{includes}} the human Bloom, Werner, and Rothmund–Thompson syndrome proteins. The N-terminal region outside the central DNA helicase core of Sgs 1, particularly the part containing the first 100 amino acid resiudes of the 1, 447 -residue protein, is known to be functionally important and has been implicated in Sgs 1 –DNA topoisomerase III (Top 3) interaction. We show in this work that the functionality of a truncated Sgs 1 lacking its N-terminal 106 residues can be restored by replacing the truncated region with Top 3. Fusion of Top 3 to a mutant Sgs 1 with a Val- 29 to Glu substitution, which interferes with Sgs 1 –Top 3 interaction, similarly restores the functionality of the mutant Sgs 1 (V 29 E) protein. The Top 3 -Sgs 1 (Δ 1 – 106) and Top 3 -Sgs 1 (V 29 E) fusion proteins behave like wild-type Sgs 1 in complementing several aspects of the sgs 1 phenotype, including the hypersensitivity of sgs 1 cells to methyl methanesulfonate and hydroxyurea. Complementation by the fusion proteins required both the topoisomerase activity of Top 3 and the helicase activity of the Sgs 1 polypeptide. These results suggest that the sole function of the N-terminal 106 amino acid residues of Sgs 1 is for <b>Top</b> 3 <b>binding,</b> and that the coordinated actions of Sgs 1 and Top 3 are important in cellular processes such as the processing of DNA after exposure of cells to DNA-damaging agents...|$|R

40|$|Apelin is the {{endogenous}} ligand of {{the orphan}} 7 -transmembrane domain GPCR APJ, now named the apelin receptor (ApelinR). Apelin plays {{a prominent role}} in body fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. To better understand the structural organization of the ApelinR, we built 3 homology 3 -dimensional (3 D) models of the human ApelinR using the validated cholecystokinin receptor- 1 3 D model or the X-ray structures of the β 2 -adrenergic and CXCR 4 receptors as templates. Docking of the pyroglutamyl form of apelin 13 (pE 13 F) into these models revealed the conservation {{at the bottom of the}} binding site of a hydrophobic cavity in which the C-terminal Phe of pE 13 F was embedded. In contrast, at the <b>top</b> of the <b>binding</b> site, depending on the model, different interactions were visualized between acidic residues of the ApelinR and the basic residues of pE 13 F. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that Asp 92, Glu 172, and Asp 282 of rat ApelinR are key residues in apelin binding by interacting with Lys 8, Arg 2, and Arg 4 of pE 13 F, respectively. These residues are only seen in the CXCR 4 -based ApelinR 3 D model, further validating this model. These findings bring new insights into the structural organization of the ApelinR and the mode of apelin binding. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Preferred binding sites with their corresponding binding energy and deformation {{energy of the}} surface, {{as well as an}} estimated diffusion barrier of each species have been determined. Atomic species and molecular fragments tend to bind to threefold sites, whereas molecular species tend to bind to <b>top</b> sites. The <b>binding</b> strength, with respect to the corresponding gas phase species and in increasing order for all species studied, is: CO 2 < N- 2 < NH 3 < CO < CH 3 < HCN < NO < H < NH 2 < OH < CH 2 < CNH 2 < CN < HNO < NH < NOH < S < N < O < CH < C. The vibrational frequencies of all species in their most energetically favorable adsorbed configuration have been calculated. Finally, the thermochemistry of adsorption and decomposition of NO, NO + H, NH 3, N- 2, CO 2, CO and CH 4 on Re(0001) has been analyzed...|$|R
