5|$|In 1593 {{there was}} a fresh crisis with Spain and <b>the</b> <b>brass</b> guns needed for the English navy were in short supply. Brass {{artillery}} pieces were therefore rounded up from the forts along the south coast, including Camber. The number of guns at the castle remained around the same, but the larger, brass culverins and demi-cannon were removed, being replaced with smaller iron demi-culverins, sakers and a minion. In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 of repair work was needed on the fortifications.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{tradition}} of <b>brass</b> bands in New Orleans, Louisiana {{dates to the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. Traditionally, New Orleans brass bands could feature various instrumentations, often including trumpets, trombones, clarinets, saxophones, sousaphones, and percussion. The music played by these groups was often a fusion between European-styled military band music and African folk music brought to the Americas by West African slaves and the idiom {{played a significant role}} in the development of traditional jazz. Early <b>brass</b> bands include <b>the</b> Eureka <b>Brass</b> Band, <b>the</b> Onward <b>Brass</b> Band, <b>the</b> Excelsior <b>Brass</b> Band, <b>the</b> Tuxedo <b>Brass</b> Band, <b>the</b> Young Tuxedo <b>Brass</b> Band, <b>the</b> Camelia <b>Brass</b> Band, and <b>the</b> Olympia <b>Brass</b> Band.|$|R

5|$|Bach, the Thomaskantor in Leipzig from May 1723, {{composed}} this cantata {{to complete}} his second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas, begun in 1724. He used the lyrics of the hymn unchanged, which reflect the psalm and Jesus as the Good Shepherd. Bach structured the work in five movements. The outer choral movements are a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, both on the hymn tune. Bach set the inner stanzas as aria – recitative – aria, with music unrelated to the hymn tune. He scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. Bach scholars agree that <b>the</b> <b>brass</b> instruments, normally reserved for Feast days, could come from an earlier chorale fantasia of the same melody with {{the text of the}} German Gloria.|$|E

5|$|In late 1941, Wiesenthal and {{his wife}} were {{transferred}} to Janowska concentration camp and forced to work at the Eastern Railway Repair Works. He painted swastikas and other inscriptions on captured Soviet railway engines, and Cyla was put to work polishing <b>the</b> <b>brass</b> and nickel. In exchange for providing details about the railways, Wiesenthal obtained false identity papers for his wife from a member of the Armia Krajowa, a Polish underground organisation. She travelled to Warsaw, where she was put to work in a German radio factory. She spent time in two different labour camps as well. Conditions were harsh and her health was permanently damaged, but she survived the war. The couple was reunited in 1945, and their daughter Paulinka was born the following year.|$|E

5|$|In {{the city}} centre of Bath it passes under various bridges {{including}} the Midland Bridge which was originally {{built by the}} Midland Railway Company to allow the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway access to and from its Green Park Terminus Station. In November 2011 the navigation between Bath and Bristol was closed because of safety concerns about Victoria Bridge. Weston Lock {{on the outskirts of}} Bath is in what now forms the Newbridge. Weston Cut is a man made channel, opened in 1727, for boats to approach and pass through Weston Lock, which created an island between the cut and the river weir, which became known as Dutch Island after the owner of <b>the</b> <b>brass</b> mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain, and the country's coastal defences {{received}} little attention. The Gorges family continued as captains at Hurst, with Sir Edward Gorges taking up the post in 1610, but the castle was neglected. In 1628, the castle was unable to prevent Flemish ships from passing along the Solent, as only {{four or five of}} the castle's twenty-seven guns were functional, and the fort had no ammunition or powder for them. The government replaced all <b>the</b> <b>brass</b> ordnance in the castle, which were preferred, particularly on ships, as they could fire faster and more safely, with iron guns in 1635.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{needed to}} find {{financial}} backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, who was a singing teacher {{as well as a}} conductor, agreed. <b>The</b> <b>brass</b> and woodwind players of the Queen's Hall Orchestra were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments; Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.|$|E

5|$|The Bristol and Bath Railway Path {{crosses the}} {{navigation}} {{several times before}} reaching the suburb of Newbridge {{on the outskirts of}} Bath. Here the A4 crosses close to the Newton St Loe SSSI, which is designated an SSSI because it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous Pleistocene gravels containing the remains of mammoths (Mammuthus) and horses (Equus) along the river, and has aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation in South West England. The final lock before entering Bath is Weston Lock, opened in 1727.

5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special cell that compensated for the different temperature conductivities of <b>the</b> <b>brass</b> and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E
5|$|The {{slave trade}} and the {{consequent}} demand for cheap brass ware for export to Africa caused a boom in the copper and brass manufacturing industries of the Avon valley, which in turn encouraged {{the progress of the}} Industrial Revolution in the area. Prominent manufacturers such as Abraham Darby and William Champion developed extensive works between Conham and Keynsham which used ores from the Mendips and coal from the North Somerset coalfield. Water power from tributaries of the Avon drove the hammers in <b>the</b> <b>brass</b> batteries, until the development of steam power in the later 18th century. Glass, soap, sugar, paper and chemical industries also developed along the Avon valley.|$|E

5|$|To {{replace the}} departing {{principals}} the LSO recruited rising young players including Hugh Maguire, Neville Marriner and Simon Streatfeild in the string sections, Gervase de Peyer and William Waterhouse in the woodwinds, and Barry Tuckwell and Denis Wick in <b>the</b> <b>brass.</b> With the new intake the orchestra rapidly advanced in standards and status. The {{average age of}} the LSO players dropped to about 30. In 1956 the orchestra visited South Africa to play at the Johannesburg Festival. The players were impressed by the dynamic director of the festival, Ernest Fleischmann, and engaged him as general secretary of the orchestra when the post fell vacant in 1959. He was the LSO's first professional manager; all his predecessors as secretary/managing director had been orchestral players combining the duties with their orchestral playing.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{analysis}} the music scholar Jane Glover has divided Monteverdi's list of instruments into three main groups: strings, brass and continuo, with a few further items not easily classifiable. The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family (viole da brazzo), two double basses (contrabassi de viola), and two small violins (violini piccoli alla francese). The viole da brazzo are in two five-part ensembles, each comprising two violins, two violas and a cello. <b>The</b> <b>brass</b> group contains four or five trombones (sackbuts), three trumpets and two cornetts. The continuo forces include two harpsichords (duoi gravicembani), a double harp (arpa doppia), two or three chitarroni, two pipe organs (organi di legno), three bass viola da gamba, and a regal or small reed organ. Outside of these groupings are two recorders (flautini alla vigesima secunda), and possibly one or more citterns—unlisted by Monteverdi, but included in instructions relating {{to the end of}} act 4.|$|E
5|$|In May 1861 the United States War Department officially {{approved}} {{that every}} regiment of infantry and artillery {{could have a}} brass band with 24 members, while a cavalry regiment could have one of sixteen members. The Confederate army would also have brass bands. This {{was followed by a}} Union army regulation of July 1861 requiring every infantry, artillery, or cavalry company to have two musicians and for there to be a twenty-four man band for every regiment. The July 1861 requirement was ignored as the war dragged on, as riflemen were more needed than musicians. In July 1862 <b>the</b> <b>brass</b> bands of the Union were disassembled by the adjutant general, although the soldiers that comprised them were sometimes reenlisted and assigned to musician roles. A survey in October 1861 found that 75% of Union regiments had a band. By December 1861 the Union army had 28,000 musicians in 618 bands; a ratio of one soldier out of 41 who served the army was a musician, and the Confederate army was believed to have a similar ratio.|$|E

5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is {{recumbent}} and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head rests on a helm bearing an ass's head and around his neck is a gold collar of esses. The rest of the monument is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the recumbent effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. The screen in the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. The communion rail is also dated 1685. <b>The</b> <b>brass</b> chandelier dates from the 18thcentury. Stained glass in the east window and in windows of the south aisle is by Kempe and is dated between 1885 and 1888.

5|$|Some of the cathedral's {{fittings}} {{and monuments}} {{are hundreds of}} years old. <b>The</b> <b>brass</b> lectern in the Lady Chapel dates from 1661 and has a moulded stand and foliate crest. In the north transept chapel is a 17th-century oak screen with columns, formerly used in cow stalls, with artisan Ionic capitals and cornice, set forward over the chest tomb of John Godelee. There is a bound oak chest from the 14th century, which was used to store the chapter seal and key documents. The bishop's throne dates from 1340, and has a panelled, canted front and stone doorway, and a deep nodding cusped ogee canopy above it, with three-stepped statue niches and pinnacles. The throne was restored by Anthony Salvin around 1850. Opposite the throne is a 19th-century octagonal pulpit on a coved base with panelled sides, and steps up from the north aisle. The round font in the south transept is from the former Saxon cathedral and has an arcade of round-headed arches, on a round plinth. The font cover was made in 1635 and is decorated with the heads of putti. The Chapel of St Martin is a memorial to every Somerset man who fell in World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plans were}} for twenty four cannons, captured from the French army at the Battle of Waterloo, {{to be installed}} around the base. In 1818 one brass and 15 iron cannons were transported from the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich to Exeter Quay, but they were never transported to the monument. After years of storage at Exeter ten were sunk into the ground as bollards, and <b>the</b> <b>brass</b> gun sold in 1837 for £64 to cover the storage costs incurred by the local corporation. In 1890, when four guns were requested for the monument {{as part of a}} restoration project, they were found to be naval cannons cast in Scotland dating from 1789, and never used at the Battle of Waterloo. Four cannons were eventually installed in 1910, surrounding the monument, but these were removed during the Second World War (1939–1945) for scrap metal to help the war effort. The need for scrap metal fell and they were eventually buried at Watchet. The one cannon remaining at Exeter was brought to the monument in 1977 and finally installed in 1984.|$|E
