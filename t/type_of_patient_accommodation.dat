40|$|Functional {{dyspepsia}} is {{a heterogeneous}} disorder in which distinct pathophysiological abnormalities {{are present in}} subgroups <b>of</b> <b>patients.</b> <b>Accommodation</b> <b>of</b> the proximal stomach to a meal is impaired in 40 % <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> with functional dyspepsia. This is associated with symptoms of early satiety and weight loss. The presence of early satiety as a relevant or severe symptom is a good predictor of impaired accommodation. Gastric barostat or proximal gastric ultrasound may confirm the presence of impaired accommodation after a meal. Sophisticated analysis of scintigraphic gastric emptying images or a simple caloric drinking test are under investigation in the diagnosis of impaired accommodation. It seems logical to have patients eat more frequent, smaller sized meals. Cisapride is the only well-evaluated form of pharmacological treatment for this condition, and has been withdrawn from the US market (see Important Note under Treatment, below).

40|$|We examine {{provider}} {{responses to}} the Medicare inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) prospective payment system (PPS), which simultaneously reduced marginal reimbursement and increased average reimbursement. IRFs could respond to the PPS by changing the total number <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> admitted, admitting different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients,</b> or changing the intensity of care for admitted patients. We use Medicare claims data to separately estimate each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> provider response to the PPS. We also examine changes in patient outcomes and spillover effects on other post acute care providers. We find that costs of care initially fell following the PPS implementation, which we attribute to changes in treatment decisions rather than the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> admitted to IRFs. However, the probability of admission to IRFs increased after the PPS due to the expanded admission policies of providers. We find modest spillover effects on skilled nursing home costs and no substantive impact on patient health outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|Background. Commonly {{self-reported}} {{questions in}} population health surveys, such as “do {{you have a}} family physician?”, represent one of the best-known sources of information about patients’ attachment to family physicians. Is it possible to find a proxy for this information in administrative data? Objective. To identify the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> attachment to a family physician using administrative data. Methods. Using physician fee-for-service database and patients enrolment registries (Quebec, Canada, 2008 – 2010), we developed a step-by-step algorithm including three dimensions of the physician-patient relationship: patient enrolment with a physician, complete annual medical examinations (CME), and concentration of visits to a physician. Results. 68. 1 % of users were attached to a family physician; for 34. 4 % of them, attachment was defined by enrolment with a physician, for 31. 5 %, by CME without enrolment, and, for 34. 1 %, by concentration of visits to a physician without enrolment or CME. Eight <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> attachment were described. Conclusion. When compared to findings with survey data, our measure comes out as a solid conceptual framework to identify patient attachment to a family physician in administrative databases. This measure could be of great value for physician/patient-based cohort development and impact assessment <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> attachment on health services utilization...|$|R
