5|$|Filling {{the void}} left by Barrett's {{departure}} in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter, lyricist and co-lead vocalist (along with Gilmour, and at times, Wright), and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. He wrote {{the lyrics to}} the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his own departure, starting with <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> of the Moon (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album since <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> of the Moon has been a concept album. With lyrics written entirely by Waters, <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> of the Moon {{was one of the}} most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005. According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, Dark Side of the Moon is the world's second best-selling album, and the United States' 21st best-selling album of all time.|$|E
5|$|Though {{outwardly}} {{appearing to}} be a well-intentioned public servant and supporter of democracy prior to becoming Emperor, he is actually Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith – a cult of practitioners of <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> of the Force previously {{thought to have been}} extinct in the Star Wars galaxy for a millennium. As Sidious, he instigates the Clone Wars, nearly destroys the Jedi, and transforms the Republic into the Empire. He also manipulates Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into turning to <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> and serving at his side as Darth Vader. Palpatine's reign is brought to an end when Vader kills him to save his son, Luke Skywalker.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{convince}} Padmé about Anakin's turn to <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side,</b> Obi-Wan stows aboard her ship. Padmé travels to Mustafar and implores Vader to leave <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side.</b> He refuses, and upon witnessing Obi-Wan, chokes Padmé into unconsciousness {{in a fit}} of rage. Obi-Wan duels and defeats Vader, severing most of his limbs and leaving him at the bank of a lava river where he is horribly burned. On Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a stalemate. Yoda flees with Bail Organa while Palpatine, sensing that his apprentice is in danger, travels to Mustafar.|$|E

5|$|He became {{personally}} {{involved in all}} branches {{of the government and}} successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials. <b>The</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> of his censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech, and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate. He punished libel with exile or death and, due to his suspicious nature, increasingly accepted information from informers to bring false charges of treason if necessary.|$|E
5|$|In 1983's Return of the Jedi, the Emperor {{appears in}} person {{to oversee the}} last stages of the second Death Star's construction. He assures Darth Vader that they will {{together}} turn Luke, now revealed to be Vader's son, to <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side.</b> Unknown to Vader, the Emperor plans to replace his apprentice with Luke. When Vader brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tempts Luke to join <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> by appealing to the young Jedi's fear for his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. The Emperor tells Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Moved by his son's cries for help, Vader throws the Emperor into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing him.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, a bootleg {{containing}} rare {{singles and}} B-sides entitled <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> of the Moo appeared, {{with a similar}} cover.

The album cover to The KLF's concept album Chill Out was also inspired by Atom Heart Mother.|$|E

5|$|Lucas {{stated that}} he {{conceived}} the Star Wars saga's story {{in the form of}} a plot outline in 1973. However, he later clarified that, at the time of the saga's conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points. He began working on Episode III even before the previous film, , was released, proposing to concept artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets. Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin's fall to <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> and radically re-organized the plot. For instance, instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin, ending the film's first act with his killing of Count Dooku, an action that signals his descent to <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of the {{assistant}} engineers {{working on the}} album was a 19-year-old Alan Parsons.

5|$|Pink Floyd {{were founded}} by {{students}} Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene {{during the late}} 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and conceptual leader, devising the concepts behind their albums <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> of the Moon and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} chooses <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>side,</b> Starkiller kills Darth Vader. The Emperor then offers to let Starkiller take Vader's place as his {{apprentice}} if Starkiller proves himself by killing Kota. Starkiller instead attacks the Emperor, who effortlessly crushes Starkiller with the Rogue Shadow, severely injuring him and killing Kota, Juno, and the Senators. The story ends with Starkiller's broken body being grafted with armor {{so he can}} serve as the Emperor's assassin, though Palpatine assures Starkiller that he, like Vader, will be cast aside when he finds a new apprentice. The Infinities expansion content builds on this ending.|$|E
