50|$|This {{is also a}} 2-player game. One player will pump {{air into}} a {{vertical}} tube using what resembles a bicycle tire pump, while another player stands on an approximately 1 meter ledge. When the object inside the tube reaches the top, a series of track lights will come towards the player standing on the ledge. It is then his job to jump off the ledge {{in such a way}} that he will land on the ground below precisely when the track lights reach his platform. The faster the first player can pump air to get the object to the top of the vertical tube the slower the lights will travel, allowing a better chance the second player will trap the track lights below; <b>The</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> <b>up</b> to a maximum of 30 seconds, with the light's speed increasing after 8, 13, 18, and 23 seconds. The team has 8 attempts, and 3 successful trials wins them a coin. If a team of more than two players is competing, then each player (other than the player operating the pump) has their own platform, and all players must trap their lights to be successful. In such an event, the team's goal may be reduced.|$|E
50|$|Time {{bombs are}} common plot devices used in action/thriller TV series, cartoons, films and video games, where the hero often escapes the blast area or defuses the bomb {{at the last}} second. Many fictional time bombs are improvised, and usually involve a beeping sound with a large {{prominent}} countdown timer (on rare occasions, <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> will <b>count</b> <b>up).</b>|$|R
50|$|The aim of {{the game}} is to defuse a bomb on the screen while <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down, each level is divided into tiers that get closer to the core of the bomb and once {{successfully}} defused the player moves on to the next level.|$|R
5000|$|Time - This {{may be a}} <b>timer</b> <b>counting</b> down <b>the</b> {{time limit}} or the time left until a {{specific}} event (including when to begin racing in the Mario Kart series). It {{may also be a}} <b>timer</b> <b>counting</b> <b>up</b> to records such as lap times in racing games, or the length of time a player can last in games based on survival. Many HUDS also use time displays to show the in-game time, such as the current time of day or year within the game. Some games may also display the real time.|$|R
50|$|The game's scoring {{takes the}} form of a {{countdown}} timer. Starting at 8000 points, <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down to zero, at which point Earth is in range of the enemy weapon. When the player destroys the fifth silo, the alien vessel is destroyed and <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> stops, thus representing the player's score for that game. Points are added to <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> for each destroyed alien fighter, giving the player additional time to complete the mission.|$|R
50|$|Also during {{certain level}} portions, the player will {{encounter}} captured scientists {{that must be}} found and rescued before <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down, otherwise they will be teleported away, requiring the player to try again another time. There are six scientists per level (excluding boss battles and the Evonian Mothership), and 40 scientists must be rescued in order to access the final mothership levels.|$|R
5000|$|... uIP {{is widely}} used code with {{well-known}} weaknesses. The design minimizes and separates 32-bit arithmetic {{so that it can}} be adjusted or optimized for 8 and 16-bit CPUs. Also, 16-bit software timers (common on small microcontrollers) can overflow and cause defective operation. This can be fixed with a timer system that does not overflow (e.g. <b>the</b> <b>timers</b> <b>count</b> down or use modular arithmetic).|$|R
5000|$|In the Smash Run {{challenge}} in Super Smash for <b>the</b> 3DS, <b>the</b> <b>timer,</b> which <b>counts</b> down from five minutes, turns from blue to red when only 59 seconds remain.|$|R
50|$|Like in its predecessor, Donkey Kong Jr. {{features}} a kill screen at level 22. Due {{to the level}} counter only having one digit, the counter shows numbers 1 to 9 in levels 1 to 9, seven blanks in levels 10 to 16, and the letters A to F in the levels 17-22. The kill screen occurs {{the same way as}} in Donkey Kong, where an integer overflow occurs after too big a result is given after a multiplication problem in <b>the</b> computing. <b>The</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> as if there are 700 points, then kills Donkey Kong Jr. until all lives are taken.|$|R
50|$|Before <b>the</b> flight <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> {{is set for}} 21 seconds. When {{the pilot}} turns the handle for <b>the</b> takeoff, <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> begins <b>counting</b> and will give second-by-second signals to a buzzer in the pilot's helmet. In 15 seconds the signal becomes continuous, telling the pilot {{that it is time}} to land.|$|R
50|$|DK Jr. loses a {{life when}} he touches any enemy or projectile, falls too great a distance, or falls off {{the bottom of the}} screen. Additionally, he loses a life if <b>the</b> bonus <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down to zero. The game ends when the player loses all of his or her lives.|$|R
40|$|At a high {{evaporation}} rate {{the probability of}} simultaneous incoming of plural ions with the same mass-to-charge ratio becomes appreciable. Thus a timer which can discriminate {{the height of a}} signal voltage generated by simultaneously incoming ions was introduced to find their correct number. <b>The</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counted</b> a larger number of high voltage signals for the major isotopes of W and Ni, 184 W and 58 Ni, than that expected from the natural abundance of these isotopes, indicating the high probability of simultaneous incomings. The number of the detected ions was corrected by weighing the number of the high voltage signals. The corrected abundance of W and Ni isotopes were found to be nearly equivalent to the natural abundances...|$|R
25|$|Some {{models have}} a 2x backlit {{exposure}} switch and a 10 sec <b>timer</b> switch. When <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> is engaged, a flashing LED indicates <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> counter is <b>counting</b> down, {{for the last}} two sec, the flash interval shortened.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, as of {{revision}} 2.1, all initiators {{capable of}} bursting {{more than two}} data phases must implement a programmable latency <b>timer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>timer</b> starts <b>counting</b> clock cycles when a transaction starts (initiator asserts FRAME#). If <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> has expired and the arbiter has removed GNT#, then the initiator must terminate the transaction at the next legal opportunity. This is usually the next data phase, but Memory Write and Invalidate transactions must continue {{to the end of}} the cache line.|$|R
5000|$|Jake's {{mission is}} to defuse {{explosives}} set on levels one {{and two of the}} base. A scientist named Fitz demands [...] "two million dollars in unmarked bills, a private jet, and a televised interview" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> starts <b>counting</b> down at 20 minutes. A platoon of six Marines, led by the sinister Marine commander Black Dawn, whose orders are to [...] "clean things up after you complete your mission." ...|$|R
5|$|Bonuses can {{be earned}} by {{achieving}} specific goals. If stunts or actions are repeated within a time limit, a score multiplier is earned and repeated actions boost the player's score further. Gameplay {{takes place in}} a single tropical jungle area, {{at the beginning of a}} game the jeep appears in a random location within the jungle. Stunt ramps are set up throughout the game area, along with the hills and valleys these facilitate long-distance jumps and other stunts. Each game takes four minutes, after <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down to zero, the total score and any bonuses earned are shown. The player's ranking compared to other games played that day and the all-time highscores are also shown. Specific achievements can be gained by players, which are saved to their online profile, though the game can be played as a 'guest', which doesn't require a game profile to be created.|$|R
50|$|If the {{character}} is damaged, they will drop all their rings, however, if {{the character}} has no rings and takes damage, they will lose a life. A character will also lose a life if they spend too long underwater without replenishing air supply (air underwater lasts for 18 seconds), fall into a gap, or if the time exceeds 9 minutes and 59 seconds. In the first act of the sixth zone, the player will have 5 minutes {{to get to the}} next section. If player fails to get to the next section before <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down to 0, they will lose a life. Losing a life will require a character to start from the last checkpoint passed, or {{from the beginning of the}} act if they have not passed any checkpoints. If a character loses a live when the number of lives remaining is zero, the game will end.|$|R
5000|$|When {{they arrive}} at the {{location}} of the next TV set, Rickshaw orders one to kill the other. Charge tells Shadow that she needs to shoot him {{in a way that would}} make it seem as if he died, then he would find and kill Rickshaw while he was distracted monitoring her. She does, unwillingly, and heads out towards the [...] "Last Round". Meanwhile, Charge triangulates his position, then storms his hideout. Rickshaw, shocked to see him alive, is shot by Charge with a shotgun, but manages to activate a failsafe device right before he dies. Charge tells Shadow to head out of town, but she frees the civilians of the Last Round and then finds his map, where he had marked Rickshaw's location. She finds him and helps him to his feet, and they leave the hideout as <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down, with little more than a minute left.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the top of}} {{the screen}} is a <b>timer,</b> which will <b>count</b> <b>up</b> from zero to a time {{determined}} before each round during the briefing. As <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> approaches its end, a warning tone will beep. If the player does not destroy the remaining enemies before <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> finishes, <b>the</b> enemies will leave the level, and the word [...] "CAUTION" [...] will appear on the screen. This means the MIRV has been launched. The MIRV will appear from {{the top of the}} screen. As the MIRV descends, it will break up into three clusters, each of which will then break up into three separate bombs. The player must shoot all of the bombs before they reach the ground.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is unique}} in {{that it has no}} outlanes. Also, the game starts as 3-ball multiball with auto-plunger instead of a plunger; once the player started the game all three balls are {{released}} and objective is to knock down the set of drop targets in order to score points and build up time. Rather than counting balls, a player's score is determined based on the amount of time left on <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> which <b>counts</b> down when there's only 1 ball left.|$|R
50|$|The {{gameplay}} of Hogs of War is a turn-based tactics {{game where}} players take turns controlling {{individual members of}} their squad of hogs to engage in combat with the opposition, similar to Worms. Each turn, a player takes control of a single squad member in a third-person perspective to move around the map, including jumping over terrain and swimming over bodies of water, yet can only engage in combat when stationary. Each turn has a set time limit and ends if <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down to zero, the player skips their turn, a weapon or ability is used or if they have accidentally injured themselves such as walking into a mine field or falling from a high surface. Other hazards include bodies of water that, while they can be swam in, is damaging to nearly all types of soldiers and drains health as they swim. If a teammate is knocked into water by an opponent, they will automatically swim to the nearby shore line. While difficult, {{it is also possible}} to knock hogs off the map resulting in instant death. If all health is gone and the player is on land, they will fall over with a last comical remark before exploding.|$|R
5000|$|The group try {{to leave}} on Widmore's sub, and Kate is shot through the right collarbone. Once on board, while Jack is tending to Kate's wound, they {{discover}} that the Man in Black has placed a C4 explosive on board. Sawyer inadvertently causes <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> to <b>count</b> down faster and Sayid, Jin and Sun are killed in the resulting explosion. Jack asks Hurley {{to take care of}} Kate and make sure that he takes her to safety off the sinking vessel. On the shore, Kate races over to Jack and is relieved to find him safe. Kate, Jack and Hurley mourn the loss of their friends while Sawyer remains unconscious.|$|R
5000|$|This game {{features}} eight hockey {{teams from}} the Soviet Union, Canada, Sweden, the Czech Republic, the United States, Finland, France, and its home country of Japan; one (or two) player(s) can face four CPU-controlled teams in succession for the Tournament mode, and up {{to three or four}} players can face off against each other (two on each side) in the Versus mode. At the start of the game, the players can choose how many players their team has (three or five) - and in both modes, they will have to insert another coin {{at the end of each}} period to continue. This was also the first Namco game to feature Greek text; on the continuing screen, one of the players on the losing team says [...] "ODCH" [...] (ΟΔΧ) as <b>the</b> ten-second <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down for another coin.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>timer</b> section allows <b>the</b> user {{to set a}} <b>timer</b> to <b>count</b> down to a {{specific}} time. When <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> reaches zero, an alarm will be sounded.|$|R
5000|$|Two Minutes at Your House: In {{addition}} to being chosen to participate in stunts and contests, [...] "Live List-ers", as they are referred to, may be visited by the shows camera crew for a live crossover to their house lasting about two minutes. In reality, these segments are often well beyond the suggested two minutes, as <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> doesnt commence <b>counting</b> down until the person has been verified to be at home, and Rove tells the clock to start. If a particular story isnt finished, pet not shown, or talent not displayed, the segment will often continue even if <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> has expired. Some broadcasts have hinted at prior planning of the segment.|$|R
50|$|An FBI bomb {{disposal}} unit arrives {{at one of}} the disclosed locations and resets <b>the</b> <b>timer,</b> preventing <b>the</b> bomb from going off. As the FBI are celebrating however, behind a nearby crate, the originally unconfirmed fourth bomb's <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down to zero.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} format, both the {{champion}} and the Crossword winner played separate sets of words. The Crossword winner played first and chose {{one of two}} envelopes, leaving the other for the champion. A row of blanks would be shown, and Woolery would read a clue. Once the contestant indicated that he/she was ready, a <b>timer</b> began to <b>count</b> <b>up</b> and two letters were displayed, which he/she called {{one at a time}} to place in the word. Additional letters then appeared one at a time, but as in Crossword, the last letter would not be given. No stoppers were in play during the Sprint round.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} to equip future microprocessors with electronic cumulative <b>timers,</b> for essentially <b>the</b> same reasons for which land vehicles are equipped with odometers (total-distance-traveled meters) and aircraft are equipped with Hobbs meters (total-engine-operating time meters). Heretofore, {{there has been no}} way to determine the amount of use to which a microprocessor (or a product containing a microprocessor) has been subjected. <b>The</b> proposed <b>timers</b> would <b>count</b> all microprocessor clock cycles and could only be read by means of microprocessor instructions but, like odometers and Hobbs meters, could never be reset to zero without physically damaging the chip...|$|R
5000|$|The band's website {{featured}} a countdown <b>timer,</b> <b>counting</b> down to 15:00 PST of March 28, 2008.

40|$|A method aud system utilize a processor's digital timer and two {{interrupts}} to form {{a frequency}} multiplier. The first internipt's processing time window is definable by a first uumber of counts C(sub 1), of <b>the</b> digital <b>timer</b> while <b>the</b> second interrupt's processing time window is definable by a second number of counts C(sub 2) of <b>the</b> digital <b>timer.</b> A <b>count</b> value CV utilized by the systedmethod {{is based on a}} desired frequency multiplier N(sub 1), <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> clock rate, and the tiole required for one cycle of an input signal.

5000|$|The VIA {{provides}} two 16-bit timer/counters. Each {{can be used}} in one-shot (monostable) [...] "interval timer" [...] mode; timer 1 {{can also}} be used in [...] "free-running" [...] (divider/square wave) mode, in which <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> is automatically reloaded with the initial count when it reaches zero, and timer 2 can also be used in [...] "pulse counting" [...] mode, in which <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> will <b>count</b> <b>the</b> high-to-low state transitions of pin PB6 (the 7th bit of parallel I/O port B). In the one-shot mode, each timer continues free-running so that the time since zero was reached can be determined, but no further interrupt is issued until <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> is restarted. Each timer can generate an interrupt when it reaches zero, and timer 1 can also output pulses (in <b>the</b> interval <b>timer</b> mode) or square waves (in the free-running mode) on pin PB7 (the 8th bit of port B). Timer 2 can be used to provide the clock frequency for the shift register. A useful feature of the free-running mode is that the 16-bit counter latch can be loaded with a new count without reloading the counter, so that it will load the new count only after the current count reaches zero, seamlessly changing the output frequency. This feature of timer 1, combined with its ability to output to pin PB7, can be used to generate complex waveforms, for example pulse width modulation signals, frequency sweeps, or bi-phase or FM-encoded serial bit streams.|$|R
500|$|On October 14, 2009, a {{black metal}} [...] "R" [...] {{along with a}} message saying [...] "The Wait is Over" [...] was placed on Rihanna's {{official}} website. Subsequently, Rihanna posted on her official Twitter profile [...] "#The Wait Is Ova. Nov. 23 09".

5000|$|... "Delay Box" [...] is {{a common}} slang term used in drag racing to {{describe}} an on-board timer which is a Transmission Brake Delay Timer. A transbrake forces the race car to remain stationary at the starting line, in gear, regardless of how much engine power is applied. When the visual signal is given to start the race, the driver triggers the delay box to begin timing (precisely counting down). If the driver does not interrupt this timing device, the car is launched down the race track at <b>the</b> instant <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> expires (<b>counts</b> to zero). Delay box use was very controversial in the 1980s and 1990s, as it removed {{a portion of the}} advantages more experienced racers had. There was a period where technologists added and concealed homemade circuitry inside a delay box that violated some racing associations rules. Racing associations have imposed strict limits on delay boxes today, with manufacturers having to submit to an approval process, which has drastically reduced the number of makers of these devices.|$|R

5000|$|In [...] "out of bounds" [...] areas, many maps have hollow {{objects that}} the player can move through freely. These objects usually {{are in the}} {{distance}} and are for decoration. The floor or terrain can also be hollow. The floor can appear the same as a normal floor, but moving over it will cause the player to fall as if it does not exist. Depending on the game, after falling a certain distance the player will freeze, die, respawn on the map again or just keep falling. Two good examples are the Nintendo 64 games The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. In the former, there is a section of [...] "wall" [...] {{at the entrance to the}} water temple that will allow players to fall through the ground. Eventually players respawn rather than the game crashing. In the latter, there is a 3-day cycle (after which the moon will fall) that can be surpassed by going to the observatory and looking out the telescope on the last minutes of the final day. If you look out the telescope while <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> is <b>counting</b> down and exit the telescope when <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> hits 0, (if you're lucky) <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> will be gone and you can continue the game without it. The glitch is removed when you play the Song of Time. Most notable Out Of Bounds glitch was found in Final Fantasy XV, players going Out of bounds found massive chunks of un-used playable space fully loaded and rendered with collision and details, sfx, textures.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second half}} of the game follows the story of a {{suspended}} and disgraced police officer, Detective Constable Frank Carter (Joe Rice) in service with the Flying Squad as he attempts to wipe out Jolson and his gang. Both stories take place parallel to each other causing Hammond and Carter to come into contact on several occasions. Carter's partner, DI Joe Fielding (Vic Robinson) is shot {{at the beginning of the}} game, leaving Carter alone and without armed assistance while on duty. Carter also reports to several disturbances that have been caused by the player as the character Mark Hammond, such as the Collins Crew establishment which Mark burned to the ground and Carter was escorting Jake Jolson before he was broken out by Hammond. Due to his [...] "Rambo ways", Carter's superior officer, DCI Clive McCormack, suspends him pending investigation. While suspended, Carter grows skeptical of McCormack's integrity and covertly follows his boss to a depot operated by Jolson's Bethnal Green Mob. Using stealth tactics, Carter discovers McCormack's corrupt relationship with Charlie Jolson. Upon hearing that McCormack has ordered the assassination of his partner, Joe, Carter rushes to the hospital and adverts the attempted assassination. However he cannot clear his name as McCormack was just killed by Hammond. Joe gives him a new lead to follow up about the Jolsons (tax records). Carter then makes his way to Jolson's warehouse where he discovers Hammond and Yasmin locked in a cell. Firstly, he overhears Charlie talking to Harry and Jake about blowing up the other gangs on the ship. In particularly, Charlie explains how the bomb works that if you press <b>the</b> detonator, <b>the</b> <b>timer</b> <b>counts</b> down and if you release it, the bomb instantly explodes. Therefore, Frank is aware of Charlie's true intentions. After eavesdropping on Hammond discussing his dilemma to Yasmin, Carter decides to help Hammond by breaking him out of the cell and the two tenuously agree that Jolson is their respective target. Hammond and Yasmin escape the shipping warehouse and manage to infiltrate Jolson's highly secured manor to locate Alex. However, Alex is seen being driven away by some of Jolson's henchman, and Hammond and Yasmin take active pursuit.|$|R
