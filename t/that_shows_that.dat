5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> glutamine is transferred across the root interface, following {{the assimilation of}} ammonium by the fungus. However, the pathways responsible for this conversion are largely unknown, though there are several plausible hypotheses.

However {{there is nothing in}} the released military documents <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> he actually reported for duty on those days, or exactly where, or what duties he performed.

TCKs are particularly adept at building relationships with other cultures while not possessing a cultural identity of their own.

25|$|In 1650, Sweden {{established}} trading stations {{along the}} West African coast, with bases {{in an area}} called the Swedish Gold Coast which was later {{a part of the}} West African Gold Coast, and which is today part of Ghana. Sweden and Denmark were competing for positions as regional powers during this period, and the Danes followed the Swedes to Africa, setting up stations a couple of years later. In 1663, the Swedish Gold Coast was taken over by the Danish colonial power and became part of the Danish Gold Coast. There is no historical documentation <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> slaves were ever traded in the trading stations during their 13-year Swedish possession, rather it is assumed to be the case.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{factorization}} and discrete logarithms, quantum algorithms {{offering a}} more than polynomial speedup over the best known classical algorithm have been found for several problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid state physics, the approximation of Jones polynomials, and solving Pell's equation. No mathematical proof has been found <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, although this is considered unlikely. For some problems, quantum computers offer a polynomial speedup. The most well-known {{example of this is}} quantum database search, which can be solved by Grover's algorithm using quadratically fewer queries to the database than are required by classical algorithms. In this case the advantage is provable. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.|$|E
25|$|The cell-mediated {{response}} to the virus and to vectors is poorly characterised, and has been largely ignored in the literature as recently as 2005. Clinical trials using an AAV2-based vector to treat haemophilia B {{seem to indicate that}} targeted destruction of transduced cells may be occurring. Combined with data <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> CD8+ T-cells can recognise elements of the AAV capsid in vitro, it appears {{that there may be a}} cytotoxic T lymphocyte {{response to}} AAV vectors. Cytotoxic responses would imply the involvement of CD4+ T helper cells in the response to AAV and in vitro data from human studies suggests that the virus may indeed induce such responses, including both Th1 and Th2 memory responses. A number of candidate T cell stimulating epitopes have been identified within the AAV capsid protein VP1, which may be attractive targets for modification of the capsid if the virus is to be used as a vector for gene therapy.|$|E

25|$|The machine {{learning}} community most often uses the ROC AUC statistic for model comparison. However, this practice {{has recently been}} questioned based upon new {{machine learning}} research <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> the AUC is quite noisy as a classification measure and has some other significant problems in model comparison. A reliable and valid AUC estimate {{can be interpreted as}} the probability that the classifier will assign a higher score to a randomly chosen positive example than to a randomly chosen negative example. However, the critical research suggests frequent failures in obtaining reliable and valid AUC estimates. Thus, the practical value of the AUC measure has been called into question, raising the possibility that the AUC may actually introduce more uncertainty into machine learning classification accuracy comparisons than resolution. Nonetheless, the coherence of AUC as a measure of aggregated classification performance has been vindicated, in terms of a uniform rate distribution, and AUC has been linked to a number of other performance metrics such as the Brier score.|$|E
25|$|Responding to its sentimental public, Argentine film {{at times}} returns to {{subjects}} of the heart. David Lipszyc's grainy portrait of depression-era Argentina, El astillero ("The Shipyard", 2000) was a hit with critics, Paula Hernandez's touching ode to immigrants, Inheritance (2001), {{has become something of}} a sleeper, Adolfo Aristarain's Common Places (2002) follows an elderly professor into retirement, Cleopatra (2003), Eduardo Mignona's tale of an unlikely friendship, received numerous awards, as did Carlos Sorín's touching El perro ("The Dog", 2004). Emotional negativity, a staple for filmmakers anywhere, was explored in Mario Sabato's India Pravile (2003), Francisco D'Intino's La esperanza (2005) and Ariel Rotter's El otro ("The Other", 2007) each deals with mid-life crises in very different ways. The pronounced sentimentality of the average Argentine was also the subject of Robert Duvall's 2002 Assassination Tango, a deceptively simple crime drama <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> still waters do, indeed, run deep.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1882 R. Mowat {{published}} an inscription in which Fortuna is called daughter of Jupiter, raising new questions and opening new perspectives in {{the theology of}} Latin gods. Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this aporia would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the Not-Bound or Enemy of Bondage, <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> {{there is no question}} of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign who represents the Creative Energy, being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs. Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with Savitr) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with her head on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions. The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.|$|E

500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero.

I'm a great believer that when you have the right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E
500|$|Within the series, set {{during the}} Prohibition-era of the United States, Isaac and Miria [...] "are {{a pair of}} idiotic lovers and thieves" [...] who are portrayed as [...] "always {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic". They are often mistaken for performers because {{of the variety of}} disguises they employ during their heists, such as dressing up as mummies or as the Tramp. The duo commit a variety of eccentric robberies, including attempting to steal time by stealing watches, trying to stop anyone from entering a museum by stealing the entrance and stealing the Genoard family fortune to prevent the family from fighting over it. Miria exhibits a complete trust in Isaac and supports anything he says no matter how ridiculous it is and often goes as far to mimic his body language and his speech, although she often does not really know what she is saying. Although the pair are very idiotic, Isaac is not completely stupid and there are occasions <b>that</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> he displays his inner intelligence. He is able to recognize a pair of plainclothes officers because he claims that he is familiar with their speech style. Isaac and Miria may have been born into wealthy families because they state that their parents' homes and the Genoard mansion have similar exteriors.|$|E
