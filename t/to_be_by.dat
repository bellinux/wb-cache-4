5|$|The {{technical}} investigations Butler {{conducted during}} her tenure resulted in worldwide collaborations and three publications. The {{culmination of the}} research came in 1998 with an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The exhibition was small, {{with a handful of}} paintings and a few manuscript leaves. Only two are definitively attributed to the master, the Annunciation, which came from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and Saint Barbara, loaned from Antwerp. Two Saint Christophers, one in Philadelphia and the other from the Louvre, are considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> workshop members. From Cleveland came a John the Baptist in the Landscape, thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> van Eyck followers. The Philadelphia and Turin Saint Francis paintings were both on display, reunited for probably {{the first time since the}} 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Wheat beer is brewed {{with a large}} {{proportion}} of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley. Wheat beers are usually top-fermented (in Germany they have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> law). The flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum has proven <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought {{that there are more}} plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E

5|$|As Nazi Germany was {{collapsing}} {{towards the}} end of the war, Braun swore loyalty to Hitler and went to Berlin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> his side in the heavily reinforced Führerbunker beneath the Reich Chancellery. As Red Army troops fought their way into the neighbourhood on 29 April 1945, she married Hitler during a brief civil ceremony; she was 33 and he was 56. Less than 40 hours later, they committed suicide together in a sitting room of the bunker, she by biting into a capsule of cyanide, and he by a gunshot to the head. The German public was unaware of Braun's relationship with Hitler until after their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle {{than his father}} and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government more or less formally into the divine monarchy he believed it <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>By</b> moving the centre of power to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured his own family members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E

5|$|Grant planned another assault for May 22, {{but this}} time with greater care; they would first reconnoiter {{thoroughly}} and soften up the defenses with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders to ascend the fortification walls.

5|$|In 1719 the Duke and Duchess {{were able}} {{to move into the}} east wing of the {{unfinished}} palace, but Marlborough had only three years to enjoy it. While living at Windsor Lodge he suffered another stroke in June 1722, not long after his 72nd birthday. Finally, at 4 a.m on 16 June (O.S.), in the presence of his wife and two surviving daughters Henrietta Godolphin and Mary Montagu, the 1st Duke of Marlborough died. He was initially buried in the vault at the east end of HenryVII's chapel in Westminster Abbey, but following instructions left by Sarah, who died in 1744, Marlborough was moved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> her side lying in the vault beneath the chapel at Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|In {{part because}} he was {{overlooked}} until the mid-19th century, Velázquez found no followers and was not widely imitated. In particular, his visual and structural innovations in this portrayal of Venus were not developed by other artists until recently, largely owing to the censorship of the work. The painting remained {{in a series of}} private rooms in private collections until it was exhibited in 1857 at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, along with 25 other paintings at least claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> Velázquez; it was here that it became known as the Rokeby Venus. It {{does not appear to have}} been copied by other artists, engraved or otherwise reproduced, until this period. In 1890 it was exhibited in the Royal Academy in London, and in 1905 at Messrs. Agnews, the dealers who had bought it from Morritt. From 1906 it was highly visible in the National Gallery and became well-known globally through reproductions. The general influence of the painting was therefore long delayed, although individual artists would have been able to see it on occasion throughout its history.|$|E

5|$|On 10October1945, {{the brigade}} {{arrived at the}} port of Haifa, and after {{disembarking}} moved to Gaza. After a short period of acclimatisation, the 6th Airlanding Brigade was deployed in the Samaria region, with the brigade headquarters at Lydda airfield. At the same time, the 6th Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, based at Tulkarm, came under the brigade's command. The first incident in the brigade area was on 31 October, when parties of armed Jews planted explosives on rail lines, which killed four and wounded eight when they exploded. Following attacks on coastguard stations, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> members of the Palmach, over the night of 24/25November, the brigade carried out two operations to search settlements for those responsible. On 29March1946 the brigade was relocated to Jerusalem in preparation for leaving the division. On 3April the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had been assigned to the division, arrived in Palestine. Their arrival made the glider formation surplus to requirements, so on 15April the brigade was renumbered 31st Independent Infantry Brigade, and was no longer part of the British airborne forces.|$|E

5|$|Other {{variants}} {{were designed}} by Viquesney to depict different doughboy poses, but very few got past the drawing stage and none were ever realized at full scale.

It was copyrighted in 1930 and dedicated in 1938. No full-sized Viquesney doughboys in any pose other than the original have been confirmed to exist. New information and photographs confirm this piece is actually titled Resting Doughboy and was copyrighted in 1936.|$|E

5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and times <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> {{far the most}} prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over {{many areas of the}} US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by most of the children playing together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of time-out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that time-out had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} attribution to Droeshout {{the younger}} {{can also be}} supported on stylistic grounds. A drawing known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> Droeshout the elder appears to show superior artistic skill than {{the work of his}} nephew, and the clumsy features of the depiction of Shakespeare's body resemble other prints by Droeshout the Younger. The attribution to the younger artist is provisionally accepted by the National Portrait Gallery.|$|E

5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Carl Ludwig Hablitz in 1783 as Colymbus caspicus, from {{a bird in}} Bandar-e Anzali. This was originally {{thought to be a}} synonym for the horned grebe, until Erwin Stresemann discovered that the description applied more to the black-necked grebe in 1948. Before this, the earliest description was thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> Christian Ludwig Brehm in 1831, who gave this bird its current scientific name of Podiceps nigricollis from a German bird. To resolve this, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature suppressed the name C. caspicus. The genus name Dytes is sometimes used for this species, a placement which was formalized by Robert Ridgway in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Troilus' {{death was}} also {{described}} in the Cypria, one of {{the parts of the}} Epic Cycle that is no longer extant.

Although the Cypria does not survive, most of an ancient summary of the contents, thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> Eutychius Proclus, remains. Fragment 1 mentions that Achilles killed Troilus, but provides no more detail. However, Sommerstein takes the verb used to describe the killing (phoneuei) as meaning that Achilles murders Troilus.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker began collaborating {{under the}} name TRV$DJAM. They {{performed}} at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2008. On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a Learjet 60 when it crashed upon takeoff in Columbia, South Carolina. The crash killed both crew members {{and the other two}} passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered third-degree burns to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore flew <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>by</b> Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence {{on the part of the}} pilots, and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane. He asked for damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.|$|E
