25|$|The eighth {{match was}} between <b>The</b> <b>Giant</b> and <b>The</b> Taskmaster, and Arn Anderson and Chris Benoit. <b>The</b> <b>Giant</b> and <b>The</b> Taskmaster {{attacked}} Anderson and Benoit during their {{entrance into the}} arena.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Giants</b> {{received}} {{the second half}} kickoff and mounted a record-setting drive.

The signature play of the drive came on a third down play, when Giants receiver Mark Ingram appeared about to be tackled well short of a first down. However, Ingram evaded several tacklers, and dragged one defender just enough to get <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> the first down, and kept the drive alive. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> strategy to handle the Bills offense had become clear: keep them off the field.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Giants</b> {{received}} the second-half kickoff and mounted a record-setting drive.

On the first play of the 4th quarter, the Bills' Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard touchdown that put Buffalo back in front, 19–17. On the ensuing possession, <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> drove down to the Buffalo 4-yard line, and Bahr made a 21-yard field goal, which gave <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> a 20–19 lead. Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive, driving down to <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> 29-yard line to set up {{what would be a}} potential game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. In what would become the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> won their second Super Bowl, 20–19.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Giants</b> {{went on to}} {{play the}} Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI in front of 101,063 fans at the Rose Bowl.

A turning point of the game came on the first possession of the second half. <b>The</b> <b>Giants</b> received the second half kickoff, and led a short drive that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and one, <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge then ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. <b>The</b> <b>Giants</b> scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Giants,</b> Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams (NFC West), and New Orleans Saints (NFC West) {{finished}} the 1988 season with identical 10–6 records.

5|$|After {{losing the}} 2004 season opener, <b>the</b> <b>Giants,</b> behind Warner, {{went on to}} win five of their next six games to stand at 5–2. <b>The</b> <b>Giants</b> then lost two close games, to the Bears and Cardinals, to drop to 5–4. It was at this point that Coughlin {{announced}} that Eli Manning would become the starter {{for the rest of the}} season. Manning struggled in his first four starts, and <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> did not score more than 14 points in any game. However, they played better in narrow losses to the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals. <b>The</b> <b>Giants</b> won their final game of the year against rival Dallas, to finish the season 6–10. Top performers on the season included Tiki Barber, who established a personal career high in rushing yardage with 1,518yards, and also contributed 52 catches and 15 touchdowns.

5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in 1988, <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> started the 1989 season 8–1 and did not allow more than 24 points in any game.

The division clinching season finale was highlighted by kick returner Dave Meggett's first career punt return for a touchdown. Though many people predicted an NFC Championship showdown between <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> and the 49ers, <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> lost their divisional playoff game to the Rams 19–13 in overtime. The highlight of the game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass over cornerback Mark Collins. After he caught the pass, Anderson raced down the sideline, through the end zone, and into the tunnel that led to the locker rooms, silencing the crowd.|$|E

5|$|After the 1982 season, Perkins became {{head coach}} of the University of Alabama and <b>the</b> <b>Giants</b> hired Parcells to replace him.

Taylor immediately regretted the decision. <b>The</b> <b>Giants,</b> who were eager to keep Taylor, took part in negotiating his way out of it.
