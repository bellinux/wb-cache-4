This paper contrasts their sticky information model with the standard sticky price model.

Second, I introduce a modeling approach <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> nest the sticky price and the sticky information models within a single empirical framework. Third, I propose a single-step estimation method that provides consistent estimates of adjustment speeds and reliable confidence bands that enable <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reject flexible prices. Finally, I use the approach to carry out an empirical specification analysis of multiple structural models.

The problem for me was to develop a way of drawing <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> simplify without it looking like realism formalized. It was part caricature, part expressionism.

The majority of the Frontier Ruckus catalog had dealt with a longstanding romantic situation that was much more complex—a bittersweet dissolution marked by shapeshifting guilt and confused but always tender love. This new situation was the opposite. Unambiguous, a bit disgraceful, and not altogether free of some pettiness on both sides.

5000|$|His strongest {{influences}} include Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin and Michel Foucault. Agamben edited Benjamin's {{collected works}} in Italian translation until 1996, and called Benjamin's thought [...] "the antidote <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> survive Heidegger". In 1981, Agamben discovered several important lost manuscripts by Benjamin {{in the archives}} of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Benjamin had left these manuscripts to Georges Bataille when he fled Paris shortly before his death. The most relevant of these to Agamben's own later work were Benjamin's manuscripts for his theses On the Concept of History. Agamben has engaged since the nineties in a debate with the political writings of the German jurist Carl Schmitt, most extensively in the study State of Exception (2003). His recent writings also elaborate on the concepts of Michel Foucault, whom he calls [...] "a scholar from whom I have learned a great deal in recent years".|$|E

[...] Richard Rodgers, who died when Guettel was 15, overheard an early composition, said he liked it {{and asked him to}} play it louder. Guettel has qualified the compliment, noting that [...] "He was literally on his deathbed {{on the other side of}} the living-room wall." [...] In his high school and collegiate years and into his early twenties, Guettel worked as a rock and jazz musician, singing and playing bass, before realizing [...] "that writing for character and telling stories through music was something that I really loved to do, and <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> express love." ...|$|E

In spring 1974, Dylan was in New York for several weeks while he attended art classes with the painter Norman Raeben. Dylan subsequently gave Raeben credit in interviews for transforming his understanding of time, and during the summer of 1974 Dylan began to write a series of songs in a red notebook which utilised his new knowledge: [...] Raeben taught me how to see ... in a way <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do consciously what I unconsciously felt ... when I started doing it, the first album I made was Blood on the Tracks.

5000|$|When {{asked where}} {{the idea for}} I’ll Give You the Sun, Nelson {{responds}} that, “These characters - Jude and Noah - pretty much crash-landed in my brain, almost fully formed. They brought with them this tragedy and their “first love” stories.” She mentions the complications that came with writing this novel, “The challenge became how to tell their really complicated story, {{because there is a}} lot going on between and among all these characters.” Nelson talks about the different approach and writing process she took with this novel. She says, “The Sky Is Everywhere I wrote like a normal person, but for this book I wrote the entire thing in a pitch-black room with earplugs in. The only available light was the light coming from the computer screen.” Apparently, this process worked, as Nelson continues by commenting, “There was something about being in that dark room like a lunatic, not letting my world in at all, <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stay in their story.” ...|$|E
