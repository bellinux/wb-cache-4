5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center.
