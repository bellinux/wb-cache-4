5|$|Dickinson remembers {{relationships}} with fellow celebrities including Sylvester Stallone, Liam Neeson, Warren Beatty, Mick Jagger, and Jack Nicholson. She enjoys her celebrity status and her time with friends John Belushi, Truman Capote, and Andy Warhol. Belushi and Dickinson enable each other's predilections for abusing drugs. She regularly spends time at Studio 54 during this period. Dickinson recounts a {{darker side of}} celebrity, and writes that she trusted in Bill Cosby when he informed her he could help her career in show business, only to experience verbal anger from him when {{she said she was}} <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to engage in sexual activity with him.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, 1987, Parsons was hitchhiking along Interstate 15 near Barstow, California. He {{was picked}} up by 30-year-old Richard Lynn Ernest, a {{concrete}} laborer from Loma Linda, California {{on his way to a}} construction job in Denver, Colorado. Ernest did not know that Parsons was a fugitive. At about 3 a.m. on August 31, Ernest was <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to drive and stopped at the Lunt Park rest area near Cedar City, Utah to get some sleep. Parsons stabbed Ernest to death and drove off in his blue Dodge Omni.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 3 is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. At the start, {{players can}} select Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join in {{at any time}} and control Tails separately. Sonic 3 adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by {{spinning}} his twin tails like a propeller; when he gets <b>too</b> <b>tired,</b> he falls. Unlike Sonic, Tails can also swim underwater.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Considering its inexperience, Savige's 17thInfantry Brigade {{was given}} a {{complicated}} role in the Battle of Bardia. While the 2/6thInfantry Battalion made a demonstration on the right, the 2/5thInfantry Battalion, reinforced by part of the 2/7thInfantry Battalion, attempted to follow up the 16thInfantry Brigade's attack, with {{the remainder of the}} 2/7th in reserve. The brigade had to move in four directions at once. The plan soon went wrong, as the 2/5th in particular suffered a series of mishaps. By nightfall, Colonel Frank Berryman, the divisional chief of staff, had reached the conclusion that the 17thInfantry Brigade had become <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> and disorganised for further effort. This was only partly due to enemy action; the rest was attributable to Berryman's own plan, which had dispersed the brigade and provided it with inadequate armoured and, in the final stages, artillery support. Savige also bore some of the blame, for failing to ensure that his subordinates understood and carried out the plan.|$|E
5|$|General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove's Mill, a British encampment on the Enoree River. They rode {{all night}} with two hundred men, {{reaching}} their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby's men and horses were <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> for a retreat and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a breastwork from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued {{them back to the}} main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel, however, {{was still}} {{disappointed}} with the failure to destroy the Turkish army. The Turks had fought hard, forcing {{the commitment of the}} Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for a sweeping pursuit came. When it did, the men and horses were <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> and could not summon the required energy. In February 1918, the EEF began a series of operations across the Jordan. Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France, to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions, and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for a time. In the meantime, during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain, the weather and a tenacious enemy; the campaign was not a success. The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered, with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides. Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan. Subsequently, the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the 5th Light Horse Brigade, formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and a composite French cavalry regiment of Spahis and Chasseurs d'Afrique.|$|E
5|$|Battle {{losses of}} horses were {{approximately}} 25percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease and exhaustion {{accounted for the}} remainder and the Germans specifically targeted horses with gunfire. The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the initial stock numbers, mainly due to infection from the tsetse fly. On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the Crimean War, 120 percent in the Boer War and 10 percent in peacetime. During some periods of the war, 1,000horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Some horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, drowned in ankle-deep mud, <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to lift their heads high enough to breathe. Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 Battle of Verdun between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun. By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the Clydesdale horses, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over {{the course of the}} war, Britain lost over 484,000horses, one horse for every two men. A small number of these, 210, were killed by poison gas.|$|E
25|$|A Factories Inquiry Commission of 1833 {{found that}} {{children}} working in the mills were often <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to eat and, when woken in the morning, unable to dress themselves.

25|$|During the Yugoslav socialist period, Jews {{were allowed}} to leave to Israel. However, if they decided to go, all their {{properties}} and any kind of their possession was automatically owned by the Communist party with no possibility of return.

Gauchier also captured the artillery and the army baggage. The Protestant army had been all but destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The {{book also}} {{describes}} other farm work duties and events, {{such as the}} birth of a calf, and the availability of milk, butter and cheese, gardening, field work, hunting, gathering, and more.

One day he noticed a bee tree and returned from hunting early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the honey. When Pa returned in the winter evenings, Laura and Mary always begged him to play his fiddle, as he was <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> from farm work to play during the summertime.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to hauling the artillery piece, the limber also hauled the caisson, a two-wheeled cart that carried two extra ammunition chests, a spare wheel and extra limber pole slung beneath. There was one caisson for each artillery piece in a battery. The cannoneers could ride the ammunition chests on the limbers and the caisson when speed was required, {{but to do}} so {{for any length of time}} was <b>too</b> <b>tiring</b> for the horses, so cannoneers generally walked. The exception to this rule would be in horse-artillery batteries, where the cannoneers rode saddle horses.|$|R

25|$|The European Union {{promotes}} various initiatives regarding {{work-life balance}} and encourages its {{member states to}} implement family-friendly policies. In Europe, the Working Time Directive has implemented a maximum 48-hour working week. Many countries have opted for fewer hours. France introduced a 35-hour workweek. Contradictory to the Scandinavian countries, {{there is no evidence}} of state policies that absolutely encourage men to take on a larger share of domestic work in France, Portugal, or Britain. In a 2007, the European Quality of Life Survey found that countries in south-eastern Europe had the most common problems with work–life balance. In Croatia and Greece, a little over 70% of working citizens say that they are <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to do household jobs at least several times a month because of work.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{launched}} straight away. After their 11-hour journey across Exmoor, {{they now}} had to row for an hour into the storm to reach the Forrest Hall which was anchored close to Hurlstone Point. The lifeboat stood by – the crew rowing continuously to hold a safe position – until daylight when two tugs arrived and {{managed to get a}} new rope across. Some of the lifeboatmen went on board to help raise the anchors as the crew were <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to do it themselves. The tugs took it across the channel to Barry, accompanied by the Louisa and the Lynmouth lifeboat volunteers in case there were further problems. They finally arrived in port at about 05:00 on 14 January. The lifeboat crew were towed back to Lynmouth by a steam ship.|$|E
25|$|Corse {{drove off}} the Confederate {{skirmish}} line and seized some half-built defensive {{works at the}} north end of Tunnel Hill. Continuing over the crest of the hill, Corse charged Cleburne's main position but was repulsed. After several attempts, Sherman gave up on attacking from Corse's position and the fighting shifted to the west side of the ridge. Loomis had advanced to the railroad in front of the ridge where he skirmished with Walker's division. Buschbeck, followed by Matthies and then Raum were sent up the west slope of Tunnel Hill between Loomis and Corse. Cleburne's salient began to feel the pressure and it came close to breaking. Hardee fed in reinforcements from Stevenson's division, and Cleburne ordered a general counterattack. Charging down the hill at 4 p.m., the Confederates routed Sherman's men, who were <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> and low on ammunition to resist, and captured numerous Federal prisoners.|$|E

25|$|At the Rethel {{meeting on}} 17 August Lanrezac also thought that Sir John French, whose BEF only {{consisted}} of four infantry divisions {{rather than the}} planned six, intended to use the British cavalry on foot (it is thought likely that he had misunderstood Sir John’s intention to keep his cavalry in reserve). Whereas Sir John wanted Sordet's French cavalry to cover the assembly of the BEF, Lanrezac wanted them to gather tactical intelligence and was told by Joffre’s {{deputy chief of staff}} Berthelot on 17 August that this took priority. Nonetheless Joffre ordered Sordet to move up to Namur and Louvain to try to prevent the Belgians falling back on Antwerp. GQG were unfairly angered at Sordet’s “dilatoriness”, even though his horses were <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> to do more than walk. Lanrezac demanded to Joffre on morning of 18th that he have use of Sordet’s corps.|$|E
25|$|That {{summer and}} fall, the Ingalls again plant a garden and fields, and store {{food for the}} winter.

One day he noticed a bee tree and returned early to get the wash tub and milk pail to collect the honey. When he returned in winter evenings, Laura and Mary always begged him to play his fiddle; he was <b>too</b> <b>tired</b> from farm work to play during summer.

5000|$|Later, Carol's {{production}} supervisor, C.O.

[...] Marc Scott Zicree, author of The Twilight Zone Companion (1982), has cited Carol {{as an example of}} Serling's more [...] "didactic" [...] writing. Serling biographer Gordon F. Sander noted that unlike much of Serling's screenwriting dealing with social change, Carol was depressing and did not end on an optimistic note, possibly because Serling in 1964 was influenced by the then-recent assassination of John F. Kennedy and the Johnson administration's escalation of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.|$|R
