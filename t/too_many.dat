5|$|A CIA {{agent and}} head of Division X, a {{government}} agency working with the X-Men. Vaughn had considered his friend Dexter Fletcher for the part, but the studio felt the cast had <b>too</b> <b>many</b> British actors, and Fletcher himself declined, to direct Wild Bill.|$|E
5|$|After this experience, Commissioner Gary Bettman {{stated that}} the League would like more time to prepare {{the site for the}} next outdoor game. He also wanted to ensure that not <b>too</b> <b>many</b> outdoor games are held so the event can remain special.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{definition}} {{can be useful}} for concrete problems, it is far too complicated to produce elegant general proofs; there are <b>too</b> <b>many</b> cases to consider.|$|E

60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. I thought so. I was, <b>too,</b> for <b>many</b> years. The negress {{redeemed}} me.|$|R
60|$|Recollect what I said at first, that {{we should}} find Balaam <b>too</b> like <b>many</b> people now-a-days; perhaps too like ourselves.|$|R
5|$|Fey's {{charity work}} {{includes}} support of Autism Speaks, {{an organization that}} sponsors autism research. In April 2008, she participated in Night of <b>Too</b> <b>Many</b> Stars, a comedy benefit show for autism education.|$|E
5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing <b>too</b> <b>many</b> or too few lands. Early in the game especially, <b>too</b> <b>many</b> or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count is automatically adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of the committee's work was subject of great debate. While some members thought the language had <b>too</b> <b>many</b> compromises and {{was the result of}} design by committee, others felt it was better than the three languages examined. Some felt the language was too complex; others, too simple.|$|E
50|$|Marić's father, Zoran, {{was also}} a footballer and a striker. He <b>too</b> spent <b>many</b> years working in Spain, mainly with Celta de Vigo.|$|R
50|$|Marić's son, Goran, {{is also a}} footballer and a striker. He <b>too</b> spent <b>many</b> {{years working}} in Spain, mainly with Celta de Vigo B.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} accusations like the famed journalist's {{political}} aspirations and his 'shakhsiyat-parasti' or projecting himself <b>too</b> much. <b>Many</b> other journos harbour similar ambitions.|$|R
5|$|A {{northern}} {{route of}} retreat had <b>too</b> <b>many</b> obstacles, so Hunter's force retreated westward toward Charleston—with the Confederate army in pursuit. On June 19, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was the rear guard. The regiment {{often had to}} fight dismounted. Averell's entire division fought for two hours near Liberty. His cavalry division fought until its ammunition was exhausted, and then was relieved by Crook's infantry. Averell lost 122 men.|$|E
5|$|A two-minute minor {{penalty is}} often called for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, roughing, <b>too</b> <b>many</b> players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires, or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major penalty).|$|E
5|$|Bart's House of Weirdness is an action-adventure-strategy {{platform}} {{game that}} uses single-screen movement. The plot sees Bart grounded {{to his room}} by his parents Homer and Marge after having pulled one <b>too</b> <b>many</b> pranks. With nothing to do, he quickly gets bored and escapes from the home. He travels around town, and eventually heads to an amusement park where he has to save Krusty the Clown from his archenemy Sideshow Bob.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{had tried}} to {{maintain}} a middle-of-the-road approach, but ultimately alienated many of the state's liberals who viewed him as <b>too</b> conservative and <b>many</b> conservatives who viewed him as <b>too</b> liberal. <b>Many</b> were upset that in trying to balance the budget, Davis cut spending for schools while increasing spending for prisons. Some critics attributed the proposal to the California Correctional Peace Officers Associations donations to Davis' re-election campaign.|$|R
5000|$|Another book on The Farm {{written by}} Douglas Stevenson is also available: [...] "Out To Change The World." [...] This book <b>too</b> {{includes}} <b>many</b> never-before-published images from The Farm's early years.|$|R
5000|$|This law simply {{gives the}} police even {{more power to}} make {{mistakes}} with their use of force — and they make <b>too</b> damn <b>many</b> of them already. Dave Goulet, Barry's Bay This Week ...|$|R
5|$|Consecutive points {{finishes}} in Hungary and Italy saw Webber climb to ninth in the drivers' standings with a 5-point margin over Button. He {{was unable to}} hold on to this position however, after one <b>too</b> <b>many</b> laps on dry tyres saw him spin out from the lead of the , and a disappointing 11th-place result in Japan. These meant that he had finished on equal points with Button but lost out on a countback.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the overall}} {{positive}} reception, some reviewers {{thought that the}} game had <b>too</b> <b>many</b> redundancies in the cases and left too little control to the player, leading to the game being boring at times. Although 1UP gave it a perfect score, they also warned that the extended cut-scenes in the game could make some players feel they {{lost control of the}} action.|$|E
5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The Bessemer process for steel {{manufacture}} produced <b>too</b> <b>many</b> imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin process to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E
5000|$|... "The real numbers, {{for certain}} purposes, are <b>too</b> thin. <b>Many</b> {{beautiful}} phenomena become fully visible {{only when the}} complex numbers are brought to the fore." [...] (Bishop 1967, Chapter 5, Complex Analysis, page 113) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon it's {{almost as}} big as an English county," [...] {{answered}} Harry, [...] "and the land's as good, <b>too,</b> for <b>many</b> things." [...] Harry would not have the Old Dominion, nor his share in it, underrated.|$|R
2500|$|One {{difference}} between the two languages is that Ido has an extra utrum third person singular pronoun, i.e. that means [...] "he or she". For various reasons, this is seen as desirable in Esperanto <b>too</b> by <b>many</b> Esperantists.|$|R
5|$|Fields' {{political}} enemies {{charged him with}} corruption and chastised him for issuing <b>too</b> <b>many</b> pardons. He also drew criticism for appointing his eldest son as state examiner, political supporter James Brown as tax commissioner, and other relatives and political supporters to low-ranking positions in the state government. Although the party strongly supported Alben Barkley's senatorial bid in 1926, Fields and his allies refused to support 1927 gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham, and the governorship went to Republican Flem D. Sampson.|$|E
5|$|In November 1953 Babb {{was arrested}} on a drunk-driving charge after running a red traffic light and refusing a sobriety test. His $250 bail was continued, {{and he was not}} convicted, {{although}} this mishap to the recent creator of the anti-alcohol film One <b>Too</b> <b>Many</b> was widely covered in the press.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviews of}} the Amstrad release, Amtix noted the colour {{additions}} over the monochromatic original and wrote that Knight Lore was among the Amstrad's best adventures. Their one complaint was the graphical slowdown when <b>too</b> <b>many</b> elements were moving onscreen. Amstrad Action shared this complaint but nevertheless named Knight Lore among the Amstrad's best three games—an improvement on the Spectrum release and on par {{with the quality of}} Commodore 64 titles.|$|E
50|$|Dayspring is a {{community}} in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located in the Lunenburg Municipal District in Lunenburg County. It {{is home to the}} traditional wooden shipyard, Snyders Shipbuilding, builders of Theodore <b>Too,</b> among <b>many</b> other vessels.|$|R
50|$|Its history {{dates from}} the 12th century, with the vicarage being consecrated before 1229. It was {{attached}} to Cirencester Abbey and then Avebury. The endowment of the church was considered <b>too</b> small <b>many</b> times during the Middle Ages.|$|R
30|$|After the WW 1, {{which brought}} the {{disintegration}} of the dualist Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the country was facing completely new challenges in the field of the transport <b>too,</b> since <b>many</b> important lines and cities lied outside the new state borders.|$|R
5|$|Murphy {{has been}} outspoken about several other of his rivals, criticising them for having <b>too</b> <b>many</b> toilet breaks and {{complaining}} about table conditions among other things. Murphy also makes collective criticisms {{of his fellow}} professionals for not attending events and has branded other players' concerns over prize money as a joke. Murphy's harshest criticism has been reserved for Ronnie O'Sullivan. Murphy highlights what he perceives to be O'Sullivan's lack of professionalism.|$|E
5|$|ReTool {{bought and}} sold used tools. Winmark opened the first ReTool on November 10, 1999, in Chicago. Roughly 65% of ReTool's goods were {{purchased}} from people, while the remainder was purchased from factories that produced <b>too</b> <b>many</b> tools or from closing businesses. CEO John Morgan said in an October 2000 interview that many people did not sell tools they did not use so {{it was hard to}} accumulate used tools at ReTool. Winmark sold ReTool around 2002.|$|E
5|$|Stable is {{the current}} release and targets stable and well-tested {{software}} needs. Stable is made by freezing Testing {{for a few months}} where bugs are fixed and packages with <b>too</b> <b>many</b> bugs are removed; then the resulting system is released as stable. It is updated only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated. This branch has an optional backports service that provides more recent versions of some software. Stables CDs and DVDs {{can be found in the}} Debian website.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, full {{surveillance}} programmes {{would be too}} costly and <b>too</b> unrealistic for <b>many</b> developing countries.|$|R
50|$|As a {{quick fix}} the system {{switched}} to printing checks (not normally used in German financial transactions), but since {{the field for the}} street name chosen was <b>too</b> small, <b>many</b> of the checks could not be delivered to the intended recipients.|$|R
25|$|In Boston <b>too</b> {{there were}} <b>many</b> {{collection}}s, a collection from the Messrs Hovey of Cambridgeport was also mentioned.|$|R
