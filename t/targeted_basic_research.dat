While the accomplishments of the past decades have answered important questions about the physics of the Sun, the interplanetary medium, and the space environments of Earth and other solar system bodies, they have also highlighted other questions, some of which are long-standing and fundamental. This report organizes these questions in terms of five challenges that are expected to be the focus of scientific investigations in solar and space physics during the coming decade and beyond: Challenge 1 : Understanding the structure and dynamics of the Sun's interior, the generation of solar magnetic fields, the origin of the solar cycle, the causes of solar activity, and the structure and dynamics of the corona. Challenge 2 : Understanding heliospheric structure, the distribution of magnetic fields and matter throughout the solar system, and the interaction of the solar atmosphere with the local interstellar medium. Challenge 3 : Understanding the space environments of Earth and other solar system bodies and their dynamical response to external and internal influences. Challenge 4 : Understanding the basic physical principles manifest in processes observed in solar and space plasmas. Challenge 5 : Developing a near-real-time predictive capability for understanding and quantifying the impact on human activities of dynamical processes at the Sun, in the interplanetary medium, and in Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere. This report summarizes the state of knowledge about the total heliospheric system, poses key scientific questions for further research, and presents an integrated research strategy, with prioritized initiatives, for the next decade. The recommended strategy embraces both basic research programs and <b>targeted</b> <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> activities that will enhance knowledge and prediction of space weather effects on Earth. The report emphasizes the importance of understanding the Sun, the heliosphere, and planetary magnetospheres and ionospheres as astrophysical objects and as laboratories for the investigation of fundamental plasma physics phenomena...|$|E

Commonly available as a nutraceutical, berberine is a potential candidate. Methods and results: Because its low oral bioavailability can be overcome by P-glycoprotein inhibitors like herbal polyphenols, we have tested the nutraceutical combination of Berberis aristata extract and Silybum marianum extract (Berberol&reg;) in type 2 diabetes in terms of its additive effect when combined with a conventional oral regimen for patients with suboptimal glycemic control. After 90 days of treatment, the nutraceutical association had a positive effect on glycemic and lipid parameters, significantly reducing glycosylated hemoglobin, basal insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. A relevant effect was also observed in terms of liver function by measuring aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. The product had a good safety profile, with distinctive gastrointestinal side effects likely due to its acarbose-like action. Conclusion: Although further studies should be carried out to confirm our data, Berberol could be considered a good candidate as an adjunctive treatment option in diabetes, especially in patients with suboptimal glycemic control.

It is characterized by moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain and allodynia, but its pathogenesis appears confined to the nociceptive structures of the central nervous system. FMS is often triggered by negative environmental influences, especially if they occur in childhood.

40|$|Abstract Background Phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) lipids, {{produced}} and modified by PtdIns kinases and phosphatases, {{are critical to}} the regulation of diverse cellular functions. The myotubularin PtdIns-phosphate phosphatases have been well characterized in yeast and especially animals, where multiple isoforms, both catalytically active and inactive, occur. Myotubularin mutations bring about disruption of cellular membrane trafficking, and in humans, disease. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} myotubularins are widely distributed amongst eukaryotes, but key evolutionary questions concerning the origin of different myotubularin isoforms remain unanswered, and {{little is known about the}} function of these proteins in most organisms. Results We have identified 80 myotubularin homologues amidst the completely sequenced genomes of 30 organisms spanning four eukaryotic supergroups. We have mapped domain architecture, and inferred evolutionary histories. We have documented an expansion in the Amoebozoa of a family of inactive myotubularins with a novel domain architecture, which we dub "IMLRK" (inactive myotubularin/LRR/ROCO/kinase). There is an especially large myotubularin gene family in the pathogen Entamoeba histolytica, the majority of them IMLRK proteins. We have analyzed published patterns of gene expression in this organism which indicate that myotubularins may be important to critical life cycle stage transitions and host infection. Conclusions This study presents an overall framework of eukaryotic myotubularin gene evolution. Inactive myotubularin homologues with distinct domain architectures appear to have arisen on three separate occasions in different eukaryotic lineages. The large and distinctive set of myotubularin genes found in an important pathogen species suggest that in this organism myotubularins might present important new <b>targets</b> for <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> and perhaps novel therapeutic strategies. </p...|$|R

In view of this, a new predictor was proposed by incorporating the evolutionary information into the general form of pseudo amino acid composition via the top-n-gram approach. It was observed by comparing the new predictor with the existing methods via both jackknife test and independent data-set test that the new predictor outperformed its counterparts.

40|$|Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors can transduce cells {{by several}} mechanisms, {{including}} (i) gene addition by chromosomal integration or episomal transgene expression or (ii) gene targeting by modification of homologous chromosomal sequences. The latter {{process can be}} used to correct a variety of mutations in chromosomal genes with high fidelity and specificity. In this study, we used retroviral vectors to introduce mutant alkaline phosphatase reporter genes into normal human cells and subsequently corrected these mutations with AAV gene targeting vectors. We find that increasing the length of homology between the AAV vector and the target locus improves gene correction rates, as does positioning the mutation to be corrected {{in the center of the}} AAV vector genome. AAV-mediated gene targeting increases with time and multiplicity of infection, similar to AAV-mediated gene addition. However, in contrast to gene addition, genotoxic stress did not affect gene targeting rates, suggesting that different cellular factors are involved. In the course of these studies, we found that (i) vector genomes less than half of wild-type size could be packaged as monomers or dimers and (ii) packaged dimers consist of inverted repeats with covalently closed hairpins at either end.

40|$|Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy 2009 This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Globalization of Science and InnovationBrazil has {{been at the forefront of}} developing countries in implementing policies to promote the development of nanotechnologies, with the first programs implemented in 2001. Previous research has demonstrated that this country is also the leader in research and patenting activity in this field in Latin America, yet industry involvement in nanotechnology is relatively low considering its research output in terms of scientific publications and patents granted in recent years (Kay & Shapira, 2009). Yet, at the same time, nanotechnology policy in Brazil has promoted the development of research networks and suggested economic targets related to industrial development. For instance, the National Program of Nanotechnology includes goals like reaching one percent of the global markets for materials, products, and processes based on nanotechnology and exports of about $ 10 billion within 10 years (Goncalves da Silva, 2003). Although the existing evidence at the aggregate level suggests that Brazilian firms are not participating actively in nanotechnology development, when looking in detail the data show that several firms are involved to more or less extent in nanotechnology research and commercialization (Table 1). For example, some preliminary analyses show that at least 36 firms have published or co-authored nanotechnology articles in the last 15 years, more than 20 of them have applied for nanotechnology patents, and several others are mentioned in official data sources as institutions forming part of research networks supported by government programs (MCT, 2003, 2006). These more detailed data suggest some incipient industry activity in developing nanotechnologies, yet it is not clear what role these firms have in the overall process of nanotechnology development pursued by Brazil. At least two hypothetical paths of development of nanotechnology are suggested for Brazilian firms. Considering the important presence of state-owned firms in Brazil and the existing nanotechnology policy, it is expected for these firms to engage more in <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> in areas more aligned with social or broader economic goals, collaborating more with local research institutions than other types of firms. Meanwhile, Brazilian private firms and subsidiaries of foreign firms are expected to target research areas aligned with their overall commercial strategies, patenting their technologies after undertaking research in-house or in collaboration with local or foreign research institutions. For testing these hypothetical roles of firms, other variables like firm location and industry sector will be considered. Research question What is the role of Brazilian firms in the development of nanotechnology? What type of research and commercialization activities are they undertaking? Do they collaborate with other research institutions? Method Based primarily on Georgia Tech global databases of nanotechnology scientific publications and patents,[1] this work will identify the firms undertaking nanotechnology research and commercialization in Brazil. Their scientific publications and patents will be identified and matched to the industry sectors that those firms represent and to collaborations that they maintain with other national or foreign research institutions. In addition to this bibliometric analysis, this work will produce case studies of the leading Brazilian firms based on secondary data, describing in more detail their research and commercialization activities by analyzing thoroughly publication and patent records. Preliminary Results The levels of scientific publication and patenting by Brazilian firms are still very low compared to the overall nanotechnology research level in the country. The top- 5 firms undertaking nanotechnology research and applying for nano-patents in Brazil were identified and shown in Table 1. The top four research firms are large state-owned firms in the sectors of agriculture, energy, and communications. Meanwhile, the top- 5 patent applicants are private companies in the sectors of chemistry, medicine, electronics and optics, and engineering. In principle, these data suggest that the two hypothetical paths of nanotechnology development suggested before are plausible for Brazilian firms. That is, public firms may be more likely to <b>target</b> <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> in priority areas for the country, while private firms may be more likely to target the development and patenting of nanotechnologies related to their overall commercial strategies.

5000|$|Despite its {{advances}} in technological {{research and development}} and its major commitment to applied research, however, Japan significantly trailed other developed nations in <b>basic</b> scientific <b>research.</b> In 1989 about 13 percent of Japanese research and development funds were devoted to <b>basic</b> <b>research.</b> The proportion of <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> expenses borne by government is also much lower in Japan than in the United States, as is Japan's ratio of <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> expenses to GNP. In the late 1980s, the Japanese government attempted to rectify national deficiencies in <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> by waging a broad [...] "originality" [...] campaign in schools, by generously funding research, and by encouraging private cooperation in various fields.|$|R

Although <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> is often associated with low appropriability it provides the fundamental basis for subsequent applied research and development. Especially in the high-tech sector <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> capabilities are an essential component for a firm's success. We use firm-level panel data stemming from Belgian R&D surveys and apply a production function approach which shows that <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> exhibits a premium on a firm's output when compared to applied research and development. When we split the sample into high-tech and low-tech companies, we find a large premium of <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> for firms in high-tech industries, but no premium in low-tech sectors. nrpages: 30 status: publishe...|$|R

We show that the impact of <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> on the general economy rationalizes a taxation pecking order to finance <b>basic</b> <b>research.</b> More specifically, in a society with desirably dense entrepreneurial activity, a large share of funds for <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> should be financed by labor taxation, while a minor share should be left to profit taxation. Such tax schemes will induce a significant proportion of agents to become entrepreneurs, thereby rationalizing substantial investments in <b>basic</b> <b>research</b> that fosters their innovation prospects. These entrepreneurial economies, however, may make a majority of workers worse off, giving rise to a conflict between efficiency and equality. We discuss ways of mitigating this conflict and thus strengthening the political support for growth policies...|$|R
