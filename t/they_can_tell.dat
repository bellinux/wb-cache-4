5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E

They also note that for each period of time there was a vast improvement in their relics. During this time several families lived together because the caves or shelters under bluffs were larger. These shelters were always near to a clear spring of bubbling water.|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> us about their experiences.|$|E
500|$|With {{the rise}} of media {{watchdog}} groups, such as the conservative Media Research Center (MRC), Jennings came under increasing scrutiny for what some observers deemed a liberal bias. The anchor drew fire from conservatives, such as the MRC and Cal Thomas, for his November 14, 1994, remarks on ABC Radio, in which he analyzed {{the results of the}} 1994 U.S. midterm elections. [...] "Some thoughts on those angry voters. Ask parents of any two-year-old and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you about those temper tantrums: the stomping feet, the rolling eyes, the screaming," [...] said Jennings. [...] "Imagine a nation full of uncontrolled two-year-old rage. The voters had a temper tantrum last week....Parenting and governing don't have to be dirty words: the nation can't be run by an angry two-year-old." [...] A July 1995 documentary, Peter Jennings Reporting: Hiroshima: Why the Bomb Was Dropped, which aired a week before the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, also drew scorn from conservatives and some television critics, who called the program a revisionist look at the decision to drop the bomb. Some viewers of the documentary mailed bus fares to Jennings, telling him to return to Canada.|$|E

500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E

2500|$|Cornell was a {{close friend}} of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle. While living together, Cornell and Wood {{recorded}} the song [...] "Island of Summer", which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording from the two of them singing together. The song was released in 2011 in the album [...] "Melodies & Dreams", a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life. Wood's sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood's death: [...] "I've always had a really difficult time with loss. I didn't deal well with Andy's death. After he died, numerous times I'd be driving and I would look out the window and I thought I saw him. It would take me five minutes to update to the moment and realize, 'no, he's actually dead.' This tour, in a sense, is the dealing. It's facing the reality." [...] When asked if it is legitimate to read a songwriter's demise into his lyrics after the fact during a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone reflecting on Kurt Cobain's suicide, Cornell said; [...] "When Andy died, I couldn't listen to his songs for about two years after that, and it was for that reason— his lyrics often seem as though <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> that story. But then again, my lyrics often could tell the same one. In terms of seeing everything as {{a matter of life and}} death— if that's what you're feeling at the time, then that's what you're going to write. It's sort of a morbid exchange when somebody who is a writer like that dies, and then everyone starts picking through all their lyrics. In Kurt's case, whatever he was thinking and whatever he was writing, there wasn't an arrow pointing at what his demise was. It's a stream of thought, it's a possibility— it's definitely something that somebody was feeling when they were writing. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen. But it doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't, either." ...|$|E
