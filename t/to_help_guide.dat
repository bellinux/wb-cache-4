5|$|Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) is {{the second}} solo album by English {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno, it was originally released by Island Records in November 1974. Unlike his previous album Here Come the Warm Jets, Eno used a core band of five instrumentalists (keyboards, guitars, bass, drums and percussion) and used fewer guest musicians. Also participating was guitarist and co-writer Phil Manzanera, who had played with Eno in Roxy Music. <b>To</b> <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> {{the production of the}} album, Eno and Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards called Oblique Strategies to use through the creative process of the album.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{clinical}} {{staging systems}} {{are used to}} classify HIV and HIV-related disease for surveillance purposes: the WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease, and the CDC classification system for HIV infection. The CDC's classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries. Since the WHO's staging system does not require laboratory tests, {{it is suited to}} the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes.|$|E
5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, decided they could not wait any longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E
50|$|Etest, (previously {{known as}} Epsilometer test) {{manufactured}} by bioMérieux, is a manual in vitro diagnostic device used by laboratories {{to determine the}} MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) {{and whether or not}} a specific strain of bacterium or fungus is susceptible to the action of a specific antimicrobial.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the needs for climate risk management and information {{services for the}} health sector to serve research, educational and operational needs of ministries of health and their partners, those agencies that support broader public health service provision as well as respond to epidemics and emergencies. While climate information is considered highly relevant <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>guide</b> improvements in public health provision, to date this information is largely underutilized. We explore some of the gaps in satisfying these needs, and we make recommendations <b>to</b> <b>help</b> fill the identified gaps...|$|R
40|$|Treating elderly cancer {{patients}} {{is a challenge}} for oncologists, especially considering the several therapeutic modalities in glioblastoma. Extensive tumor resection offers {{the best chance of}} local control. Adequate radiotherapy should always be given to elderly patients if they have undergone gross total resection and have maintained a good performance status. Rather than being ruled out, chemotherapy should be considered, and temozolomide is the chosen drug. A comprehensive geriatric assessment is a valuable tool <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>guiding</b> treatment decisions in elderly patients with glioblastoma...|$|R
5|$|Gilchrist's icy {{reception}} at the Gabba did not faze him; he took five catches, stumped Azhar Mahmood off Shane Warne's bowling and scored a rapid 81, mostly in partnership with ODI partner Waugh, in a match that Australia won comfortably by ten wickets. In his second Test match he made an unbeaten 149 <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> Australia to victory {{in a game that}} looked well beyond their reach. Australia were struggling at 5/126 in pursuit of 369 for victory as he joined his Western Australian teammate, Justin Langer, but the pair put on a record-breaking partnership of 238 to seal an Australian win. Gilchrist continued his strong run throughout his debut Test season, and ended the summer with 485 runs at 69.28 in six matches, three each against Pakistan and India, adding two fifties against the latter.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February, Wyoming steamed out of New York to {{join the}} annual fleet {{maneuvers}} off Cuba, before returning to New York on 14 April. On 12 May, she left port <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> a group of Navy Curtiss NC flying boats as they made the first aerial transatlantic crossing. The battleship was back in port by 31 May. She then took on a crew of midshipmen for a training cruise off the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia Capes. After finishing the cruise, Wyoming entered dry dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 1 July for a modernization for service in the Pacific. Her secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch guns. After emerging from the shipyard, she became the flagship of BatDiv 6 of the newly designated Pacific Fleet. On 19 July, Wyoming {{and the rest of}} the Pacific Fleet departed the east coast, bound for the Pacific. The ships transited the Panama Canal later that month, and reached San Diego, California on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Roberts {{needed more}} help if his racing career {{was going to}} progress, Aksland {{introduced}} Roberts to airline pilot and amateur motorcycle racer Jim Doyle, who would become Roberts' personal manager. In 1971, Doyle and Roberts approached Triumph's American distributor {{to ask about the}} possibility of a sponsored ride, but were told that Roberts was too small for one of their bikes. They then turned to the American Yamaha importer's team, who agreed to make Roberts a factory sponsored rider at the age of 19. Yamaha asked the head of their American racing program, former 250cc world champion Kel Carruthers <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> Roberts' racing career. It marked the beginning of a long and productive relationship between the two men. Carruthers ended his riding career after the 1973 season to concentrate full-time on managing Roberts' and Yamaha's efforts in the A.M.A. Grand National Championship, a series which encompassed events in four distinctive dirt track disciplines plus road racing.|$|E

Real-time arrival signs debuted at Swift stations in 2013, featuring a countdown to the arrival of the next bus that is estimated using GPS units on coaches. In June 2015, the Washington State Department of Transportation removed part of the refuge island at the intersection of State Route 99 and Airport Road to create a through lane exclusively for Swift buses.|$|E
5|$|Crazy Taxi and its sequels are score attack {{games that}} all employ the same {{fundamental}} rules and mechanics. The player controls {{one of several}} taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's HUD that points {{in the general direction}} of the passenger's destination <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> the player through the map.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, Bridges joined Conference North side Kettering Town on {{a one-year}} deal. Bridges made his debut for Kettering in late August 2007, {{starting}} in the club's 3–2 away win against Worcester City. He scored his first goal for the club in the following game, scoring in the 60th minute to double Kettering's lead in a victory against Tamworth, and followed this up with another goal in the club's 4–1 win against Leigh RMI. Bridges made it four goals in as many games by scoring against both Boston United and Workington respectively. However, he suffered an injury in Kettering's 2–0 home loss to Hyde United in October 2007, ruling him out for two months. He returned to first-team action in December, coming on as a second-half substitute in the club's 3–2 loss against Cambridge City, and scored twice the following week in Kettering's 3–0 home win against Leigh RMI. He started 2008 by scoring Kettering's fifth in a 6–1 victory against Solihull Moors, as well as scoring in the next game – heading in Kettering's second in a 3–1 win against Harrogate Town. Bridges scored his ninth goal of the campaign shortly after, doubling the club's lead in a 2–0 away win at Hucknall Town. Bridges featured regularly during the club's {{second half of the}} season, getting on the scoresheet in a 3–0 away victory at Hyde United, before scoring Kettering's third in another 3–0 win, this time against AFC Telford United – his last appearance for the club. He was instrumental for the Northamptonshire club throughout Kettering's 2007–08 league campaign, scoring a total of 11 goals in 27 appearances <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>guide</b> Kettering to promotion to the Conference National.|$|E

30|$|Polyclonal {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins (IVIG), {{which have}} pleiotropic effects on inflammatory and immune mechanisms, {{have been proposed}} as adjuvant therapy to modulate both pro- and anti-inflammatory processes [6].

However, results from recent trials and systematic meta-analyses indicate that intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins (IVIgGM) may be effective in septic patients [8 – 10].
